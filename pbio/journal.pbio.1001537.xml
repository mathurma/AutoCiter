         <p>Experiments in peripheral and central synapses reveal the regulatory mechanisms that enable trans-synaptic control of synapse development and maintenance by the L1-type CAM Neuroglian.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
         <p>The precise control of synaptic connectivity is essential for the development and function of neuronal circuits. While there have been significant advances in our understanding how cell adhesion molecules mediate axon guidance and synapse formation, the mechanisms controlling synapse maintenance or plasticity in vivo remain largely uncharacterized. In an unbiased RNAi screen we identified the <italic>Drosophila</italic> L1-type CAM Neuroglian (Nrg) as a central coordinator of synapse growth, function, and stability. We demonstrate that the extracellular Ig-domains and the intracellular Ankyrin-interaction motif are essential for synapse development and stability. Nrg binds to Ankyrin2 in vivo and mutations reducing the binding affinities to Ankyrin2 cause an increase in Nrg mobility in motoneurons. We then demonstrate that the Nrg–Ank2 interaction controls the balance of synapse growth and stability at the neuromuscular junction. In contrast, at a central synapse, transsynaptic interactions of pre- and postsynaptic Nrg require a dynamic, temporal and spatial, regulation of the intracellular Ankyrin-binding motif to coordinate pre- and postsynaptic development. Our study at two complementary model synapses identifies the regulation of the interaction between the L1-type CAM and Ankyrin as an important novel module enabling local control of synaptic connectivity and function while maintaining general neuronal circuit architecture.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>The function of neuronal circuits relies on precise connectivity, and processes like learning and memory involve refining this connectivity through the selective formation and elimination of synapses. Cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) that directly mediate cell–cell interactions at synaptic contacts are thought to mediate this structural synaptic plasticity. In this study, we used an unbiased genetic screen to identify the <italic>Drosophila</italic> L1-type CAM Neuroglian as a central regulator of synapse formation and maintenance. We show that the intracellular Ankyrin interaction motif, which links Neuroglian to the cytoskeleton, is an essential regulatory site for Neuroglian mobility, adhesion, and synaptic function. In motoneurons, the strength of Ankyrin binding directly controls the balance between synapse formation and maintenance. At a central synapse, however, a dynamic regulation of the Neuroglian–Ankyrin interaction is required to coordinate transsynaptic development. Our study identifies the interaction of the L1-type CAM with Ankyrin as a novel regulatory module enabling local and precise control of synaptic connectivity without altering general neuronal circuit architecture. This interaction is relevant for normal nervous system development and disease as mutations in L1-type CAMs cause mental retardation and psychiatric diseases in humans.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Transsynaptic interactions mediated by cell adhesion molecules (CAMs) control the formation, function, and stability of synaptic connections within neuronal circuits. While a large number of synaptogenic CAMs controlling the initial steps of synapse formation have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Siddiqui1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Williams1">[2]</xref>, we have only limited knowledge regarding the identity or regulation of CAMs selectively controlling synapse maintenance or plasticity. Information processing within neuronal circuits is adjusted by the selective addition or elimination of individual synapses both during development and in response to activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Caroni1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Holtmaat1">[4]</xref>. These changes in connectivity can occur in very close proximity to stable synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Xu1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Yang1">[6]</xref> indicating the existence of mechanisms capable of local alterations of transsynaptic adhesion. Potential mechanisms to alter binding affinities of CAMs include direct alterations of extracellular domains through binding of ligands like metal ions (e.g., Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or indirect mechanisms through the selective association of CAMs with the intracellular cytoskeleton via adaptor proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Shapiro1">[7]</xref>. Modulation of intracellular interactions via posttranslational modifications can alter mobility, clustering, and adhesive force of CAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Nishimura1">[8]</xref>. For example, it has been demonstrated for the Cadherin–Catenin complex that changes in biophysical properties can induce changes in synapse morphology, strength, or stability and modulate transsynaptic signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Benson1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Brigidi1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>To identify cell adhesion molecules potentially controlling synapse maintenance and plasticity we performed an unbiased in vivo RNA interference (RNAi) screen at the larval neuromuscular junction (NMJ) of 287 transmembrane proteins that are predicted to function as synaptic CAMs based on their domain structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Shapiro2">[11]</xref>. These included Ig-domain containing proteins, Leucine-rich repeat proteins, Cadherins, Integrins, Semaphorins, and others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s009">Table S1</xref>). In this high-resolution screen we identified the <italic>Drosophila</italic> L1-type CAM Neuroglian (Nrg) as a key regulator for synapse stability. Nrg encodes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of the L1-type protein family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bieber1">[12]</xref> that is composed of four closely related members in vertebrates: L1, CHL1 (close homolog of L1), NrCAM (neuronal CAM), and Neurofascin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Maness1">[14]</xref>. L1-type IgCAMs usually consist of 6 Ig-domains, 3–5 fibronectin type III domains, a single transmembrane domain, and an intracellular tail. The extracellular domain of L1 family proteins can mediate cell–cell adhesion via homophilic interactions and can also engage in a variety of heterophilic interactions with other Ig-domain proteins (e.g., NCAM, TAG-1, Contactin, and others), extracellular matrix proteins, or integrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Sakurai1">[15]</xref>. The intracellular tail contains distinct protein–protein interaction domains potentially controlling the localization and function of L1 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch2">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Dubreuil1">[18]</xref>. Most prominent is a central Ankyrin interacting motif that is highly conserved among all vertebrate L1 family proteins and <italic>Drosophila</italic> Neuroglian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch3">[19]</xref>. Phosphorylation of the tyrosine within this FIGQY motif abolishes binding to Ankyrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Garver1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Zhang1">[23]</xref>. The Ankyrin-binding domain is essential for mediating neuronal function in vivo in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, however it is dispensable for L1-mediated homophilic adhesion in transfected cells in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pocock1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Wong1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Importantly, we previously identified <italic>Drosophila ankyrin2</italic> (<italic>ank2</italic>) as an essential gene for synapse stability at the larval neuromuscular junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Koch1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage1">[27]</xref>. Ank2 together with the presynaptic spectrin cytoskeleton and the actin capping protein Hts/Adducin controls NMJ formation and maintenance and provides a scaffold to link the actin and microtubule cytoskeleton to synaptic cell adhesion molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage3">[29]</xref>. Based on this potential biochemical interaction Nrg might encode the CAM upstream of this Ank2/Spectrin scaffold to control synapse development.</p>
      <p>Human mutations in L1CAM cause a broad spectrum of neurological disorders (L1 or CRASH syndrome) including MASA syndrome (mental retardation, aphasia, shuffling gait, adducted thumbs), agenesis of the corpus callosum, and spastic paraplegia. In addition, hypomorphic mutations in L1CAM and NrCAM have been linked to psychiatric diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Maness1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Sakurai1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Kenwrick1">[30]</xref>. In correspondence with the human disease, animal models implicated L1-type proteins in nervous system development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Maness1">[14]</xref>. At the cellular level L1-type proteins are involved in the control of neurite outgrowth, axon pathfinding, and fasciculation and synapse development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Maness1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Guan1">[31]</xref>. The subcellular localization of L1-type proteins contributes to the establishment and maintenance of specialized neuronal membrane compartments including the axon initial segment (AIS) and nodes of Ranvier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Ango1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Zonta1">[35]</xref>. While these studies highlight essential functions of L1-type proteins, potential redundant or antagonistic functions between different L1-type proteins may mask the full extent of their importance for nervous system development. Indeed, evidence for redundant functions between L1-type proteins was provided by a double mutant analysis of L1CAM and NrCAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Sakurai2">[36]</xref>. Together with the requirement of L1-type proteins for early nervous system development, this confounds our current understanding of the contribution of L1-type CAM to synapse development and plasticity. In addition, mechanistic insights into the in vivo control of L1-type CAM function at synapses are lacking to date.</p>
      <p>Nrg encodes the sole homolog of L1-type CAMs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> with equal homology to all four vertebrate proteins. This provides a unique opportunity to unravel the contributions and mechanisms of regulation of L1-type CAMs in synapse development and maintenance. Here, we generate a series of Pacman-based mutations that allowed us to identify the specific contributions of extra- and intracellular domains of Nrg for synapse stability. We then provide evidence that binding of Nrg to Ank2 is critical for the control of mobility of Nrg in vivo. We demonstrate that modulation of the Nrg–Ank2 interaction allows precise control over the balance between synapse formation and stability. Finally, we demonstrate that dynamic regulation of the Ankyrin-binding domain of Nrg is essential for the coordination of pre- and postsynaptic development via transsynaptic signaling mechanisms at central synapses.</p>

         <title>RNAi Screen Identifies the <italic>Drosophila</italic> L1-Type CAM Neuroglian as Essential for Synapse Stability</title>
         <p>To identify cell adhesion molecules necessary for the maintenance of synaptic connections we performed a transgenic RNAi-based screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Dietzl1">[37]</xref> of 287 transmembrane proteins encoding potential cell adhesion molecules based on their domain structure and previously described functions in axon guidance or synapse development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s009">Table S1</xref>). We knocked down candidate genes simultaneously in presynaptic neurons and postsynaptic muscles and analyzed third instar NMJs for defects in synapse stability using selective pre- and postsynaptic markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1A–F</xref>). In wild-type animals the presynaptic active zone marker Bruchpilot (Brp) is found in close opposition to postsynaptic glutamate receptor cluster at all individual synapses within the presynaptic nerve terminal demarcated by the membrane marker Hrp. In contrast, NMJs displaying postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters without opposing presynaptic active zone markers and a fragmentation of the presynaptic membrane indicate synapse retractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage2">[28]</xref>. We identified <italic>Drosophila</italic> Nrg as the major hit in our screen resulting in synaptic retractions at more than 50% of all NMJs on muscle 4. We first tested whether specific knockdown of Nrg either in the motoneuron or the muscle also impairs synapse stability. Presynaptic knockdown of Nrg was sufficient to cause synaptic retractions equivalent to the simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1B,G</xref>). In contrast, muscle-specific <italic>nrg</italic> RNAi did not lead to a significant increase in synaptic retractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1C,G</xref>). We obtained similar results when we expressed an independent <italic>nrg</italic> RNAi line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1E–G</xref>) and were able to enhance the phenotype by combining different motoneuron Gal4 drivers or by co-expressing UAS-<italic>dcr2</italic> to enhance RNAi efficacy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, we observed similar rates and severities of synapse retractions when using independent pre- and postsynaptic markers and when analyzing different subsets of muscles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s001">Figure S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s010">Table S2</xref>).</p>

(A) A stable wild-type NMJ indicated by perfect apposition of pre- and postsynaptic markers. (B) Knockdown of presynaptic Nrg resulted in severe synaptic retraction indicated by the loss of presynaptic Brp despite the presence of postsynaptic glutamate receptors and by a fragmentation of the presynaptic membrane. Synaptic retractions caused a characteristic fusion of postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters. (C) Knockdown of postsynaptic Nrg did not impair synapse stability. (D–F) NMJs on muscle 4 stained for the presynaptic motoneuron membrane (Hrp, white), presynaptic vesicles (Syn, green), and postsynaptic Dlg (red). Identical phenotypes were observed when using an independent Nrg RNAi line and independent pre- and postsynaptic markers. Only presynaptic knockdown of Nrg resulted in synaptic retractions indicated by a selective loss of synaptic vesicles and a fragmentation of the presynaptic membrane. (G) Quantification of synaptic retractions. Neuronal but not muscle-specific knockdown of Nrg using different Gal4 driver combinations or independent RNAi constructs resulted in a significant increase in synaptic retractions on muscle 4.

In the absence of Nrg, Ank2-L was lost prior to Brp at distal parts of an NMJ that was still stable as indicated by the continuous membrane staining. (J) Similarly, Ank2-L was lost prior to the presynaptic vesicle marker DvGlut (red) at a semistable NMJ.

Western blots of larval brain extracts and analysis at the larval NMJ demonstrated that all combinations of presynaptic <italic>nrg</italic> RNAi efficiently knocked down Nrg180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Similarly, muscle-specific knockdown of Nrg caused a loss of Nrg<sup>3c1</sup> staining in the muscle that can be attributed to a loss of Nrg167 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s002">Figure S2F</xref>). The loss of postsynaptic Nrg resulted in a significant change in presynaptic Nrg levels and distribution at the NMJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s002">Figure S2C</xref>, F; reduction to 62.9±3.7% of wild-type protein within the presynaptic terminal, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), indicating a requirement of postsynaptic Nrg for presynaptic Nrg localization. However, this reduction in presynaptic Nrg180 levels was not sufficient to impair synapse stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1C,F,G</xref>), implicating the potential existence of alternative postsynaptic Nrg interaction partners essential for NMJ maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Islam1">[39]</xref>.

To validate the specificity of our RNAi-mediated knockdown we aimed to rescue the synaptic phenotypes by co-expressing wild-type Nrg180.

         <p>To gain insights into the molecular processes inducing synaptic retractions in animals lacking presynaptic Nrg, we analyzed the distribution of two presynaptic components, Ank2 and Futsch, at early stages of synaptic retractions in comparison to active zone and vesicle markers. The presynaptic adaptor protein Ank2 is an essential molecule for synapse stability and Ankyrins can directly bind to Nrg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Koch1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bennett1">[40]</xref>.

At wild-type NMJs, Ank2 and Futsch were present in all terminal boutons together with Brp and DvGlut.

         <title>Distinct Contributions of the Extra- and Intracellular Domain of Nrg for Synapse Stability</title>
         <p>Two domains of Nrg that may be essential for synapse maintenance are the extracellular Ig domains mediating association with postsynaptic CAMs and the intracellular Ankyrin binding domain that provides a link to the presynaptic cytoskeleton. To directly test for a potential role of these domains we generated genomic rescue constructs that allow expression of wild-type and mutated <italic>nrg</italic> at endogenous levels using a site-directed Pacman-based approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Venken1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bischof1">[43]</xref>.

This construct fully rescued the embryonic lethal <italic>nrg</italic> null mutations <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> and <italic>nrg<sup>17</sup></italic>. We then used <italic>galK</italic>-mediated recombineering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Warming1">[44]</xref> to generate a deletion of the extracellular Ig domains 3 and 4 (P[<italic>nrg<sup>ΔIg3–4</sup></italic>]), thereby completely disrupting hetero- and homophilic binding capacities of Nrg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Haspel1">[45]</xref>. In addition, we generated specific deletions of the Ankyrin-binding domains of Nrg167 and Nrg180 that are encoded by unique exons (P[<italic>nrg167<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] and P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>]; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). All constructs were inserted into the genomic insertion site attP40 to ensure identical expression levels. While P[<italic>nrg167<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] and P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] rescued the embryonic lethality of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> mutants similar to the wild-type construct, P[<italic>nrg<sup>ΔIg3–4</sup></italic>] failed to rescue lethality. In order to analyze the larval NMJ of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg<sup>ΔIg3–4</sup></italic>] mutant animals, we combined the Pacman rescue approach with the MARCM technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Lee1">[46]</xref>. This allows the generation of mCD8–GFP-marked motoneurons expressing only the mutated form of Nrg. First we analyzed motoneurons completely lacking <italic>nrg</italic> using the <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> null mutation and observed two striking phenotypes. We found synapse retractions indicated by NMJs displaying remnants of the presynaptic MARCM membrane marker opposite postsynaptic glutamate receptors but lacking the presynaptic marker Brp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). While synapse retractions were only observed at low frequency, about 50% of all MARCM motoneuron axons ended in “bulb-like” structures within nerve bundles and were not connected to a postsynaptic muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). The wild-type <italic>nrg</italic> Pacman construct fully rescued the axonal and NMJ phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2B,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s003">Figure S3A</xref>,D), however, P[<italic>nrg<sup>ΔIg3–4</sup></italic>] failed to rescue these defects and the presence of P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] resulted only in a partial rescue. In both genotypes we observed synaptic retractions as well as axons ending in bulbs distant from a potential target muscle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s003">Figure S3C</xref>,G; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s009">Table S1</xref>). In contrast, no defects were observed in the presence of P[<italic>nrg167<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] indicating that only the Ankyrin binding motif of Nrg180 is essential within motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s003">Figure S3B</xref>,F; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s010">Table S2</xref>).</p>
         <p>Prior studies showed a delay of axonal outgrowth in <italic>nrg</italic> mutant embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hall1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Martin1">[49]</xref>. Our axonal phenotypes would be equally consistent with a stalling of axons or with a retraction of axons after initial innervation of target muscles. Importantly, we observed mutant MARCM motoneurons where we could link synapse eliminations to axons ending in bulb-like structures. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2E</xref> shows an example of a complete elimination of an NMJ indicated by the loss of presynaptic vesicles, while fragments of the mCD8–GFP-marked motoneuron membrane were still present opposite postsynaptic Dlg. We traced fragmented membrane remnants over a distance of more than 150 µm to the retraction bulb-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2E</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s003">Figure S3C</xref> for another example). Additionally, we observed large axonal swellings in the same axon further proximal toward the cell body of the motoneuron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Rates of retraction bulbs and axonal swellings were identical in MARCM clones of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> and <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔIg3–4</sup></italic>] animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Finally, analysis of the innervation pattern of motoneuron axons forming stable NMJs at this larval stage demonstrated that loss of Nrg did not result in obvious axon guidance defects. We observed similar rates of innervations for all four major classes of motoneurons in all genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s002">Figure S2H</xref>). In summary, while we cannot exclude a role for Nrg in axonal outgrowth, we provide clear evidence that Nrg is required for the maintenance of the NMJ and that this function requires both the extracellular domain and the intracellular Ankyrin-binding domain of Nrg180 but not of Nrg167.</p>

         <title>Mutations in the Nrg FIGQY Motif Differentially Affect Ankyrin2-Binding</title>
         <p>Based on these results we aimed to unravel the molecular mechanisms controlling the synaptic function of Nrg through the interaction with the Ankyrin-associated cytoskeleton. Prior studies in vertebrates demonstrated that phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine residue within the FIGQY motif of L1-type proteins has the potential to abolish the interaction with Ankyrins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Garver1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Zhang1">[23]</xref>. Similarly, Yeast-2-Hybrid assays showed that Nrg can bind to <italic>Drosophila</italic> Ankyrin1 and Ankyrin2 and that replacing the tyrosine with a phenylalanine (Y-F) reduces binding capacities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bouley1">[50]</xref>.</p>
         <p>Therefore, we first tested whether the neuronal isoform Nrg180 can directly bind to the large isoform of Ank2 (Ank2-L) that is present within the presynaptic nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1I,J</xref>). Using the Nrg180-specific antibody Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup> we were able to co-immunoprecipitate Ank2-L from larval brain extracts demonstrating that Nrg180 and Ank2-L interact in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Next we used IP-assays to further characterize the interaction between Nrg180 and Ank2. We generated tagged Nrg180 and Ank2 UAS constructs (Ank2-S, short isoform of Ank2 containing all potential Nrg interacting domains) and co-expressed the constructs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells. We were able to efficiently pull-down Nrg180 using Ank2-S and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and unpublished data). To alter the binding properties and to potentially mimic a gradual increase in phosphorylation levels of Nrg180 in vivo, we generated a series of mutations replacing the tyrosine with a phenylalanine (Y-F), aspartate (Y-D), or alanine (Y-A) or by deleting the entire FIGQY motif (ΔFIGQY). Compared to wild-type we observed a 30% decrease in binding capacities for the Y-F, a 70% decrease for the Y-D, and a 90% reduction for the Y-A mutation. The deletion of the FIGQY motif essentially abolished the Nrg–Ank2 interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Thus, we have identified a series of mutations that allows us to characterize the function and regulation of Nrg in vivo. These mutations potentially allow the differentiation between processes depending on Nrg bound to Ankyrins and processes depending on a differential regulation of the FIGQY motif.</p>

Therefore, we generated GFP-tagged UAS-constructs of all <italic>nrg180</italic>-<italic>FIGQY</italic> mutations and used site-specific integration to generate transgenic flies that will express equal protein levels after Gal4 activation. Analysis of larval brain extracts after expression of the constructs in motoneurons (<italic>ok371</italic>–Gal4) in a wild-type background demonstrated equal protein levels comparable to endogenous nontagged Nrg180 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3E</xref> upper and middle panels, analysis with an anti-GFP antibody and with a newly generated anti-Nrg180<sup>cyto</sup> antibody that recognizes the cytoplasmic tail of Nrg180 C-terminal to the FIGQY motif). The Nrg180-specific antibody Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup> specifically recognizes the Nrg180 FIGQY motif as the antibody detects wild-type GFP-tagged Nrg180 but not any mutant proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, lower panel). We used fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) to test whether the FIGQY mutations affect the mobility of Nrg180-GFP within motoneurons in vivo. For wild-type Nrg180 we observed a mobile fraction of about 40% of total protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3D,F,G</xref>). The deletion of the Ank2 binding domain increased the mobile fraction of Nrg180 by a factor of two to about 80%. For the tyrosine-specific point mutations, we observed a significant increase in the mobile fraction compared to wild type but to a lesser extent than for Nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3D,F,G</xref>).

In addition, we generated a deletion of the Nrg180 specific C-terminus including the FIGQY motif, a complete deletion of the FIGQY motif of Nrg167 as well as a specific deletion of the last three amino acids of Nrg180 as this potential PDZ-protein interacting domain has been implicated in axon outgrowth of mushroom body neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s010">Table S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Goossens1">[53]</xref>. All constructs were inserted into the attP40 genomic landing site and crossed into the background of the <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> null mutation to create flies that express only mutant Neuroglian protein under endogenous control, thereby mimicking the effect of knock-in mutations. All modifications of the intracellular cytoplasmic domains of Nrg167 and Nrg180 rescued the embryonic lethality associated with <italic>nrg</italic> null mutations (<italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> and <italic>nrg<sup>17</sup></italic>), allowing an analysis at the third instar larval stage. To confirm the specificity of our mutations and the expression levels and localization of the mutant proteins, we analyzed the animals with specific antibodies recognizing either both isoforms of Nrg (Nrg<sup>3c1</sup>) or only Nrg180 (Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch4">[38]</xref>. As observed for the UAS-constructs, Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup> recognizes only wild-type Nrg180 but none of our FIGQY mutations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s004">Figure S4A</xref>,B; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; unpublished data), thereby demonstrating that our Pacman-rescued flies indeed only express the mutant version of the protein and no wild-type Nrg180 protein. We verified this using the Nrg180<sup>cyto</sup> antibody as well as a second new antibody, Nrg<sup>FIGQY</sup>, that recognizes the wild-type FIGQY motif of both Nrg167 and Nrg180 but not any mutant versions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s004">Figure S4A</xref>,B). We were able to unambiguously identify all mutated proteins to demonstrate that all constructs are expressed at wild-type levels within larval brains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s004">Figure S4B</xref>,D). In addition, all constructs enabled Nrg180 localization to the presynaptic nerve terminal and Nrg167 expression within glial cells and muscles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s004">Figure S4A</xref>,C). Our data demonstrate that the FIGQY domain is not essential for presynaptic localization of Nrg180.</p>
         <p>Next, we systematically determined the requirement of the different domains for synapse development in third instar larvae. Our analysis of synapse stability revealed a significant increase in the frequency and severity of synaptic retractions in mutants with severely disrupted Nrg180–Ank2 interactions (<italic>nrg180<sup>Y-D</sup></italic>, <italic>nrg180<sup>Y-A</sup></italic>, <italic>nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>) but not in animals expressing Nrg180 with only slightly impaired Ank2 binding capacities (<italic>nrg180<sup>Y-F</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g004">Figure 4A–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s010">Table S2</xref>). The FIGQY motif of Nrg167 and the PDZ protein-binding domain of Nrg180 are not essential for normal NMJ development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g004">Figure 4D,E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s005">Figure S5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s009">Table S1</xref>). These phenotypes are consistent with our results for the <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] and <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg167<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] MARCM clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g002">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s010">Table S2</xref>). The observation that impairing the Nrg–Ank2 interaction only in motoneurons weakened synapse stability provided an alternative way to test for a potential contribution of postsynaptic (muscle) Nrg for synapse maintenance. Therefore, we selectively knocked down Nrg in muscles of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg_wt</italic>] or <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] animals. Indeed, we observed a significant increase in the frequency and severity of synaptic retraction when knocking down postsynaptic Nrg in the sensitized animals lacking the Ank2 interaction domain but not in animals expressing the wild-type Pacman construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–D).</p>

         <p>We next asked whether the Nrg180 FIGQY motif is required for the synaptic localization of Ank2-L to mediate NMJ stability. Interestingly, we did not observe obvious alterations of presynaptic Ank2-L localization or protein levels in P[<italic>nrg</italic>_<italic>wt</italic>, <italic>180Y-F</italic>, or <italic>180ΔFIGQY</italic>] mutant animals at stable synapses when compared to control animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s007">Figure S7A</xref>; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05 for comparison of protein levels; unpublished data). Thus, Nrg and Ank2 do not depend on each other for initial synaptic localization but display a high sensitivity toward normal levels of their interaction partner as they are among the first proteins to be lost at <italic>ank2</italic> or <italic>nrg</italic> mutant semi-stable NMJs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1I,J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s007">Figure S7B</xref>–D).</p>
         <p>In addition to the synapse stability defects, we observed a second striking defect in these animals. With an increasing reduction in Ank2 binding capacities of Nrg180 we observed an increase in growth of the NMJ as reflected by an increase in the span of the presynaptic nerve terminal and an increase in the number of synaptic boutons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g005">Figure 5A–E</xref>). At the same time we observed a corresponding decrease in synaptic bouton area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Interestingly, only subtle alterations were observed for the Nrg180 Y-F mutation that still binds Ank2 efficiently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g005">Figure 5B,E,F</xref>). The identical phenotypes of the FIGQY deletion and of the C-terminal deletion indicate that control of NMJ growth critically depends on the Nrg180-FIGQY motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g005">Figure 5E,F</xref>). Similar to the analysis of synapse stability we did not observe any phenotypes in <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg167<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>] or <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔPDZ</sup></italic>] mutant animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g005">Figure 5E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s005">Figure S5D</xref>). Finally, we tested whether we could mimic these growth defects by ectopically expressing mutant Nrg180 (UAS-<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup>-GFP</italic>) in wild-type animals. High levels of expression of Nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup>-GFP but not of Nrg180-GFP resulted in an almost 2-fold increase in bouton number and in the span of the presynaptic nerve terminal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s008">Figure S8A</xref>–D). Together, our data demonstrate that the loss of Ank2 binding capacities of Nrg180 correlates with both a loss of NMJ growth control and an impairment of synapse stability, suggesting that these two parameters are tightly coupled.</p>

         <title>The Nrg180 FIGQY Motif Is Essential for Giant Fiber Synapse Development</title>
         <p>To address synaptic functions of the Nrg180–Ank2 interaction in the central nervous system (CNS), we extended our analysis to the adult Giant Fiber (GF) circuitry. We used the GF to TTMn (Tergo-trochanteral motoneuron) connection as a model neuro-neuronal synapse as it provides precise genetic control of pre- and postsynaptic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Allen1">[54]</xref>. Previous analysis of <italic>nrg</italic> mutations affecting either homophilic cell adhesion properties (<italic>nrg<sup>849</sup></italic>) or protein levels (<italic>nrg<sup>305</sup></italic>) identified both axon guidance and synaptic defects at the GF terminal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Boerner1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Godenschwege1">[56]</xref>. Our Pacman-based mutants enabled us to directly determine potential requirements of the intracellular regulation of the Nrg–Ankyrin interaction for GF circuit formation and function.</p>
         <p>We analyzed the function of the GF to TTM (Tergo-Trochanteral Muscle) pathway in all viable <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg</italic>-mutant] animals by intracellular recordings from the TTM using either brain or thoracic stimulation to differentiate between potential GF-TTMn synapse or TTMn NMJ defects. Importantly, presence of the wild-type <italic>nrg</italic> construct in <italic>nrg</italic> null mutants (<italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg</italic>_wt]) established normal function of the GF-TTMn circuit. We observed no significant differences in average response latencies or following frequencies after a train of stimulations at 100 Hz when compared to wild-type control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In contrast, all mutations affecting the Nrg180 FIGQY motif caused equally severe impairments of GF circuit function. The average response latency, a measure for synaptic strength, was significantly increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and mutant animals were not able to follow trains of high-frequency stimulations; in some animals we observed a complete absence of responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g006">Figure 6B,D</xref>). In contrast, when we bypassed the GF and stimulated the motoneurons directly using thoracic stimulation, both response latency and ability to follow high-frequency stimulation were normal in all tested animals (unpublished data). This indicates that the observed defects were specific to the GF-TTMn synaptic connection. Similarly, we observed a disruption of synapse function when expressing UAS-Nrg180<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup>-GFP simultaneously pre- and postsynaptically at the GF synapse in wild-type animals (average latency increased to 1.01±0.057 ms; following frequency reduced to 52.34±7.17%), further demonstrating the importance of the Nrg180 FIGQY motif for normal GF synapse development. In contrast, neither the Nrg167 FIGQY nor the C-terminal Nrg180 PDZ protein-binding domains were essential for GF circuit function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g006">Figure 6C,D</xref>).</p>

         <p>In order to identify potential morphological phenotypes and to distinguish between axon guidance and synaptic defects, we co-injected large (Rhodamin-dextran) and small (Biotin) fluorescent dyes into the GF. In wild-type animals the large dye is confined to the GF and reveals the morphology of the synaptic terminal. In wild-type animals the GF-TTMn synapse grows to a large presynaptic terminal with mixed electrical and chemical synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Allen1">[54]</xref>. Biotin can pass through gap-junctions and thereby dye-couple pre- and postsynaptic neurons in animals with a synaptic connection. While we observed no obvious morphological alterations of GF terminals in <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg</italic>_wt], <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg167<sup>ΔFIGQY</sup></italic>], or <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>; P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔPDZ</sup></italic>] mutant flies, all mutations affecting the Nrg180 FIGQY motif resulted in severely disrupted GF terminals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>). The GFs were present within the synaptic target area, however large areas of the synaptic terminals were either thinner or swollen and often contained large vacuole-like structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, insets). Similar to the electrophysiological phenotypes, we observed no obvious qualitative or quantitative differences between different Nrg180 FIGQY mutations. Next, we directly tested for the presence of a synaptic connection between the GF and the postsynaptic TTMn using the dye-coupling assay. We found a residual synaptic connection in more than 90% of animals carrying mutations in the Nrg180 FIGQY motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g007">Figure 7A,C</xref>). However, dye-coupling was often weaker or required longer injection times in mutant animals when compared to animals rescued with the wild-type construct. These results indicate that at most GF terminals of Nrg180<sup>FIGQY</sup> mutants, synaptic connections with at least a small number of gap junctions were established. When we correlated the ability to dye-couple with the electrophysiological properties of these synapses, we observed that approximately 40% of Nrg180<sup>FIGQY</sup> mutant animals that were positive in the dye-coupling assay did not show any functional response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that the synaptic strength was below the threshold to trigger an action potential in the postsynaptic TTMn. In contrast, neither the deletion of the FIGQY motif of Nrg167 nor of the PDZ protein-binding domain of Nrg180 affected GF morphology or function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Thus, we conclude that a wild-type Ankyrin binding motif of Nrg180 but not of Nrg167 is essential for normal GF-TTMn synapse maturation and function, but it is not required for GF axon guidance or synapse targeting.</p>

         <title>Transsynaptic Coordination of Pre- and Postsynaptic Development by Nrg180</title>
         <p>The similar phenotypes of <italic>nrg180</italic> mutations affecting Ank2 binding either weakly (Y-F) or strongly (ΔFIGQY) indicate that normal GF synapse development requires a dynamic regulation of this interaction by phosphorylation, a feature disrupted by all mutations. Our Pacman-based mutants enabled us to determine temporal and spatial requirements of a wild-type, modifiable, Nrg180-FIGQY motif as we can express wild-type Nrg180 in the background of our mutants using the Gal4/UAS system. We used previously characterized Gal4-driver lines that allow expression of Nrg180 either simultaneously in pre- and postsynaptic neurons of the GF-TTMn synapse, only in one of the two partner neurons, or only during late stages of synaptic development in the GF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Godenschwege2">[57]</xref>. Simultaneous expression of wild-type Nrg180 in pre- and postsynaptic neurons throughout GF circuit development was able to rescue all electrophysiological and morphological defects associated with the Nrg180-FIGQY mutations (using Y-F, Y-A, and Nrg180ΔFIGQY as representative examples) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g008">Figure 8B–D</xref> and unpublished data). Thus, this assay is suitable to determine specific pre- or postsynaptic requirements of the Nrg–Ank2 interaction. To our surprise, we were able to rescue the anatomical and physiological phenotypes to a similar extent by expressing wild-type <italic>nrg180</italic> either in the pre- or the postsynaptic neuron in the background of the Pacman-based mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Precise control of synaptic connectivity is essential for the formation, function, and maintenance of neuronal circuits. Here we identified the L1-type CAM Neuroglian as a key regulator of synapse stability in vivo. By combining biochemical, biophysical, and genetic assays at two complementary model synapses, we demonstrate that regulation of the Nrg180–Ankyrin2 interaction plays a critical role in controlling synapse growth, maturation, and maintenance. Several important findings arise from our work: (1) Control of synapse stability requires Nrg-mediated cell adhesion, which can be controlled by direct coupling to the presynaptic Ankyrin-associated cytoskeleton. (2) Synapse elimination and axonal retraction display striking phenotypic similarities to developmentally controlled synapse elimination at the vertebrate NMJ, suggesting common cellular mechanisms between developmental and disease processes. (3) Local regulation of the Nrg180–Ankyrin2 interaction provides a mechanism to gradually control the delicate balance between synapse growth and stability. (4) Transsynaptic Nrg signaling mediates the coordination of pre- and postsynaptic development in the CNS and requires a dynamic regulation of the Ankyrin-motif both temporally and spatially. (5) The FIGQY motif enables synapse-specific regulation of L1-type proteins to differentially control connectivity and function in distinct neuronal circuits.</p>

         <title>The L1-Type CAM Neuroglian Controls Synapse Stability</title>
         <p>A large number of cell adhesion molecules have been implicated as important mediators of synapse development, but the regulatory mechanisms controlling structural synapse plasticity and maintenance remain largely unknown. In an unbiased RNAi screen, we identified the <italic>Drosophila</italic> L1-type CAM Neuroglian as essential for synapse stability at the neuromuscular junction. We demonstrate that knockdown of presynaptic Nrg induces synapse disassembly that shares all cellular hallmarks of synapse retractions observed in <italic>ank2</italic>, <italic>spec</italic>, or <italic>hts</italic> mutant animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Koch1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage3">[29]</xref>. By analyzing individual motoneurons lacking any Nrg expression, we verified this presynaptic requirement of Nrg for synapse maintenance. In addition, this allowed us to unravel the cellular events occurring in response to loss of cell adhesion at the presynaptic nerve terminal. In <italic>nrg</italic> mutant motoneurons, we observed both synaptic retractions and motoneuron axons ending in “retraction bulb”–like structures. Excitingly, we directly observed eliminated NMJs that were still connected via traces of clonally marked presynaptic membrane remnants to retraction bulb–like structures. This demonstrates that loss of synapse stability can induce a cellular program resulting in the retraction of the motoneuron axon accompanied by shedding of presynaptic membrane. This phenotype shares striking similarities with developmental synapse elimination at the vertebrate NMJ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bishop1">[58]</xref> and points to similar cellular programs underlying synapse loss in development and disease. It will be of particular interest to analyze the contribution of glial cells in this process as they are part of a pro-degenerative signaling system at the NMJ and actively clear membrane remnants of degenerating or pruning axons in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bishop1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-MacDonald1">[61]</xref>. It is important to note that some of the axonal phenotypes would also be consistent with a stalling of the axonal growth cone before reaching the appropriate target. Indeed, prior studies in both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates demonstrated a function of Nrg and L1CAM during neurite outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Maness1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hall1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Martin1">[49]</xref>, indicating that both defects in axon growth and loss of synapse stability may have contributed to the observed phenotypes.</p>
         <p>Although Nrg is critical for NMJ maintenance, our observation that 50% of larval NMJs were still stable in <italic>nrg</italic> null mutants indicates that redundant mechanisms control synapse stability at the level of synaptic cell adhesion molecules. A candidate to provide such redundancy would be the <italic>Drosophila</italic> NCAM homolog FasII, which has been previously implicated in NMJ maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Schuster1">[62]</xref> and can substitute for Nrg during axonal outgrowth of ocellar neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Kristiansen1">[48]</xref>. However, we demonstrate that FasII cannot compensate for the loss of presynaptic Nrg at the larval NMJ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001537-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001537.s001">Figure S1D</xref>).

         <title>The Nrg–Ank2 Interaction Functions as a Molecular Switch to Balance Synapse Growth and Stability</title>
         <p>The dynamic nature of many neuronal circuits requires controlled changes in synapse assembly and disassembly without a disruption of neuronal circuit function. While interactions of synaptic cell adhesion molecules are essential to maintain synaptic connectivity, mechanistic insights regarding the regulation of these interactions to alter transsynaptic adhesion are limited to date. The process is probably best understood for Cadherins where adhesive properties are modulated either via binding of extracellular calcium or by altering their association with intracellular Catenins via posttranslational phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Shapiro1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Nishimura1">[8]</xref>. These changes alter localization, clustering, and transsynaptic signaling of Cadherins leading to modulations of synaptic connectivity and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Benson1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Brigidi1">[10]</xref>. Here we identify the interaction between the L1-type CAM Nrg and the adaptor protein Ank2 as a similar control module. First, we demonstrate that Nrg180 directly interacts with Ank2 in vivo. Second, a series of specific mutations in the Ankyrin binding motif allowed us to differentially modulate the Ankyrin-binding capacity of Nrg180. We demonstrate that decreasing Ank2-binding capacities correlate with an up to 2-fold increase in lateral mobility of Nrg180 in motoneurons. This is consistent with studies in vertebrates demonstrating that phosphorylation of the conserved tyrosine of the FIGQY motif reduces or abolishes binding to Ankyrins and increases mobility of L1-type CAMs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Garver1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Zhang1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Gil1">[52]</xref>. Finally, Pacman-based <italic>nrg</italic> mutants with altered Ankyrin-binding capacity caused two striking phenotypes. There was a significant increase in synapse retractions in mutants with severely impaired Ank2 binding but not in mutants with partial binding (Nrg180<sup>Y-F</sup>). In addition, we observed increased NMJ growth that correlated in a similar manner with the decrease in Ank2 binding capacities. The reduction in Ank2 binding potentially decreases the static population and adhesive force mediated by Nrg and thereby impairs synapse stability. At the same time this reduction in transsynaptic adhesion might allow for increased NMJ growth. We previously identified similar switch-like alterations of synapse growth and stability in animals lacking the spectrin-binding and actin-capping protein Hts/Adducin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Pielage2">[28]</xref>. Importantly, studies of <italic>adducin2</italic> mutant mice demonstrated that Adducin2 provides a similar function in vertebrates and is essential to mediate changes in synaptic connectivity relevant for learning and memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bednarek1">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Ruediger1">[64]</xref>.</p>
         <p>Interestingly, we did not observe significant alterations in presynaptic Nrg180 or Ank2 levels in these animals similar to previous observations for the axonal localization of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Bouley1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch5">[65]</xref>. However, we found a clear dependence on the respective partner protein at semi-stable <italic>nrg</italic> and <italic>ank2</italic> mutant synapses, indicating that the Nrg–Ank2 interaction is required to maintain their synaptic localization. A similar late loss of AnkyrinG has been observed in <italic>neurofascin</italic> mutant Purkinje cells, demonstrating a function of the L1-CAM paralog for maintenance but not for initial localization of AnkG to the AIS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Buttermore1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Zonta1">[35]</xref> and likewise AnkG is required for the maintenance of Neurofascin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Ango1">[32]</xref>. Together these data indicate that modulation of the Nrg–Ank2 interaction balances synapse growth and stability. Changing the interaction via posttranslational phosphorylation could thus locally decrease synapse stability, thereby allowing the formation of new synapses without impairing general neuronal circuit architecture.</p>

         <title>Transsynaptic Nrg Function Requires Dynamic Regulation of the Ankyrin Binding Motif</title>
         <p>Despite our detailed knowledge regarding the expression of synaptic cell adhesion molecules, mechanistic insights into the transsynaptic control of synapse maturation or function are only recently emerging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Siddiqui1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Williams1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Benson1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Brigidi1">[10]</xref>. Here we provide evidence that transsynaptic coordination of synapse development can be controlled via a dynamic regulation of the L1-type CAM Nrg.</p>
         <p>In contrast to the larval NMJ, the lack of significant differences in phenotypic strength between the mutations in Nrg180-FIGQY motif demonstrates that normal GF synapse development requires a dynamic regulation of the Nrg–Ank2 interaction via phosphorylation. To address the importance of this regulation for transsynaptic development, we selectively reintroduced wild-type Nrg180 either pre- or postsynaptically in the background of the different FIGQY motif mutations. Surprisingly, pre- or postsynaptic expression of wild-type Nrg in the presence of mutant Nrg on both sides of the synapse was sufficient to restore synaptic function in all mutants, but late presynaptic expression could only rescue the Nrg180<sup>Y-F</sup> mutation. This highlights two important novel aspects of Nrg function at central synapses. First, while Nrg180 is required on both sides of the synapse, regulation of the FIGQY motif is sufficient on either side of the synapse, demonstrating that Nrg can control synapse development in a transsynaptic manner. Second, constitutive binding to Ank2 is sufficient for early stages of synapse development, but GF synapse maturation requires dynamic regulation of the Nrg–Ank2 interaction. A potential function of the phosphorylation of Nrg could be an increase of lateral mobility of Nrg to allow precise spatial alignment with postsynaptic CAMs. Alternatively, phosphorylation may enable an interaction with proteins that bind only phosphorylated Nrg. One candidate would be the microtubule binding protein Doublecortin that binds only phosphorylated Neurofascin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Kizhatil1">[66]</xref>, but physiological relevance for this interaction in nervous system development is lacking to date.</p>
         <p>While we observe distinct functions and modes of regulation of Nrg at peripheral versus central synapses in both cases, the Nrg180–Ank2 interaction did not influence axon outgrowth or guidance. In addition, we did not observe any requirements for the Nrg167 FIGQY motif or for the PDZ-binding motif of Nrg180, which has recently been implicated in controlling axonal outgrowth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> mushroom bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Goossens1">[53]</xref>.</p>
         <p>A surprising observation from studies of vertebrate L1 family proteins was that mutations within the intracellular domain that are linked to human L1/CRASH syndrome and neuropathological diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Kenwrick1">[30]</xref> resulted in significantly weaker phenotypes in mice compared to the complete L1 knockout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Maness1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Guan1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Buhusi1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Nakamura1">[68]</xref>. While extracellular interactions are essential for early nervous system development including neurite outgrowth and axon targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Hortsch2">[16]</xref>, here we provide evidence that reversible phosphorylation of the intracellular Ankyrin binding motif might provide a regulatory module to fine tune synaptic connectivity without impairing overall circuit stability. The expansion of the L1-type CAM family to four independent proteins in vertebrates may provide the means to cope with the diversity and complexity of synaptic connectivity in the vertebrate CNS. Indeed, while mutations in the L1CAM Ankyrin motif did not affect the general organization of the nervous system, they resulted in specific impairments of particular neuronal circuits and at subsets of synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Guan1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Buhusi1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Nakamura1">[68]</xref>. The functions of the different L1-type proteins may be distinct, partly opposing or redundant as evident by an analysis of cerebellar granule cell development in L1CAM and NrCAM double mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001537-Sakurai2">[36]</xref>. Our data suggest that the coordinated phosphorylation of a subpopulation of synaptic L1 family proteins may allow differential modulation of biophysical properties of L1 complexes to precisely control distinct aspects of synapse development. Elucidating the synaptic L1-family protein code at specific synapses and identifying their phosphorylation status during synapse development and in response to activity might uncover new mechanisms controlling synaptic plasticity in development and during learning and memory.</p>

Motoneuron axons were photo-bleached using a Zeiss LSM700 by scanning the targeted region for 30 iterations at 100% laser-power using the 488 nm line. Ten images were acquired before the bleach and 40 after the bleach with a time interval of 5 s at low laser power.</p>
         <p>Images of the FRAP series were corrected for animal movement using the FIJI registration plugin (StackReg option). Images were corrected by substracting background fluorescence from regions outside the axons and corrected for bleaching using a control area within the same axon.</p>
         <p>The recovery curves were fit to a double exponential curve as follows:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001537.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001537.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

<caption><p>Presynaptic Nrg is essential for synapse stability. (A–C) NMJs on muscle 6/7 stained for the presynaptic motoneuron membrane (Hrp, white), the presynaptic active zone marker Brp (green), and postsynaptic glutamate receptors (DGluRIII, red). (A) A stable wild-type NMJ indicated by perfect apposition of pre- and postsynaptic markers. (B) Knockdown of presynaptic Nrg resulted in severe synaptic retractions indicated by a fragmented presynaptic membrane and the loss of presynaptic Brp despite the presence of postsynaptic glutamate receptors. The example shows a complete elimination of an entire NMJ at muscle 6/7. Please note the characteristic increase in postsynaptic glutamate receptor clusters at sites of retractions (inset). (C) Loss of muscle Nrg did not impair synapse stability. Scale bar in (A) corresponds to (A–C), 10 µm, inset 5 µm. (D) Quantification of different <italic>nrg</italic> RNAi conditions. Neuronal- but not muscle-specific knockdown of Nrg using different Gal4 driver combinations or independent RNAi constructs resulted in a significant increase in synaptic retractions on muscle 6/7. The retraction frequency was significantly rescued (<italic>p</italic>≤0.001) by co-expression of UAS–<italic>nrg180</italic> but not by co-expression of either UAS–<italic>mCD8</italic>–<italic>GFP</italic> or UAS–<italic>fasII</italic>.

(E) Quantification of retraction severity on muscle 6/7. Only neuronal knockdown of Nrg resulted in a significant increase in the severity of synapse retractions. (F) Quantification of retraction severity on muscle 4. Only neuronal knockdown of Nrg resulted in a significant increase in the severity of synapse retractions.

<caption><p>Analysis of pre- and postsynaptic Nrg localization after RNAi-mediated knockdown. (A–D) Muscle 4 NMJs stained with an antibody specific to the cytoplasmic tail of Nrg180 (Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup>, white and green) and the presynaptic membrane (Hrp, red). (A) In wild-type animals Nrg180 was present in the motoneuron axon and within the presynaptic nerve terminal marked by the membrane marker. In contrast to the uniform distribution in the axon, Nrg was present in a punctate pattern at the terminal and co-localized with Hrp at the ends of small filopodia-like membrane extensions. (B) Neuronally expressed <italic>nrg</italic> RNAi resulted in an almost complete knockdown of Nrg180 in the presynaptic motoneuron. (C) Muscle-specific knockdown of Nrg altered the normal distribution of Nrg180 in the presynaptic nerve terminal. (D) Co-expression of Nrg180 with <italic>nrg</italic> RNAi resulted in a complete rescue of Nrg180 levels and distribution at the NMJ. (E–G) Muscle 4 NMJs stained with an antibody recognizing both Nrg isoforms (Nrg167/180<sup>3c1</sup>, white and green) and the presynaptic membrane marker Hrp (red). (E) In addition to neuronally expressed Nrg180, we observed Nrg167 throughout the postsynaptic muscle and in glial cells surrounding the motoneuron axon. (F) Muscle-specific knockdown efficiently eliminated Nrg167 expression in the muscle. Presynaptic Nrg can still be detected (asterisk). A tracheal branch expressing Nrg167 is indicated (t). (G) Neuronal-specific knockdown significantly reduced Nrg expression in the motoneuron and the presynaptic nerve terminal (arrows). Nrg167 can still be observed in glial cells surrounding the motoneurons and in the postsynaptic SSR. (H) Analysis of Nrg expression in motoneurons that are enwrapped by glial cells. In wild-type Nrg180 expression (Nrg180<sup>cyto</sup>) is confined to neurons marked by Hrp (blue). Surrounding glial cells express high levels of Nrg167. Knockdown of neuronal Nrg abolishes all Nrg staining in the nerve (asterisk) but does not affect glial expression. Scale bar in (A) corresponds to (A–G), 10 µm, insets 5 µm.</p>

The motoneuron clone was marked by the expression of mCD8–GFP (green). Synaptic vesicles (DvGlut, red) were found opposite postsynaptic Dlg (blue), indicating a stable NMJ (insets). Neighboring NMJs are visible that were not mutant, as evident by the absence of the clonal marker.

(C) A <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> MARCM clone expressing a mutated form of Nrg180 lacking the FIGQY motif. A “bulb-like” structure (arrow) was present in close proximity to an NMJ that contained postsynaptic profiles marked by Dlg but no presynaptic vesicles (asterisk). In contrast to the neighboring wild-type NMJ, postsynaptic Dlg staining was reduced and no longer formed a continuous structure (inset). While no membrane marker remnants were visible at the eliminated NMJ, we observed small GFP-puncta in between the NMJ and the retracted axon (arrowhead). (D) Axonal area of a <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> MARCM clone rescued by a wild-type <italic>nrg</italic> Pacman construct. Within the axon, only very low levels of the synaptic vesicle marker DvGlut were evident. (E) A “bulb-like” structure in a <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> MARCM clone.

<caption><p>Analysis of the expression of genomic Nrg Pacman rescue constructs. (A) Nrg180 expression of different Pacman introduced <italic>nrg</italic> mutations in the background of the <italic>nrg</italic> null mutation <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>. All <italic>nrg</italic> Pacman constructs were expressed at wild-type levels at the NMJ. The cytoplasmic domain-specific antibody Nrg180<sup>cyto</sup> (green) detected Nrg180 at the NMJ in all mutant animals. In contrast, the Nrg180–FIGQY-specific antibody Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup> (white) did not recognize Nrg180 carrying mutations in the FIGQY motif. (B) Western blot analysis of larval brain extracts of all Nrg Pacman constructs in the background of the <italic>nrg</italic> null mutation <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic>. Nrg<sup>3c1</sup> recognizes a common motif of both Nrg isoforms. Both isoforms are present in all Pacman rescued flies; Nrg<sup>FIGQY</sup> specifically recognizes the FIGQY motif of both Nrg isoforms; thus, the mutated forms were not detected in the Western blot. Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup> recognizes the FIGQY motif of Nrg180. No signal could be detected in animals expressing mutated versions of the FIGQY motif of Nrg180. (C) Muscle 4 NMJs stained for both Nrg isoforms (Nrg<sup>3c1</sup>, green, white). P[<italic>nrg<sup>wt</sup></italic>] rescued Nrg expression and distribution of both Nrg isoforms in motoneurons, glial cells, and muscles of <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> mutant animals. (D) Western blot analysis to assay the expression of Nrg lacking Ig3–4 domains. As P[<italic>nrg<sup>ΔIg3–4</sup></italic>] did not rescue the embryonic lethality associated with the <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> mutation, we tested if normal levels of mutated Nrg isoforms were expressed in a wild-type background. Using isoform-specific antibodies, we could visualize equal expression levels of truncated proteins of both isoforms. (E) Muscle 4 NMJs stained for the Nrg180<sup>cyto</sup> antibody that recognizes Nrg180 C-terminal to the FIGQY motif. In wild-type the antibody was present in a pattern similar to Nrg180<sup>BP104</sup>, showing a punctate pattern within the presynaptic nerve terminal (see also A). No specific signal could be detected in <italic>nrg<sup>14</sup></italic> mutant animals rescued by P[<italic>nrg180<sup>ΔC</sup></italic>], demonstrating the specificity of the antibody and the specificity of the introduced mutation.
