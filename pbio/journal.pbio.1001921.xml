<p>Mapping the conditions of spider silk proteins along the silk gland, and combining with molecular studies, reveals a pH controlled switch between lock and trigger forms, providing insights into spider silk formation.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Spider silk fibers are produced from soluble proteins (spidroins) under ambient conditions in a complex but poorly understood process. Spidroins are highly repetitive in sequence but capped by nonrepetitive N- and C-terminal domains (NT and CT) that are suggested to regulate fiber conversion in similar manners. By using ion selective microelectrodes we found that the pH gradient in the silk gland is much broader than previously known. Surprisingly, the terminal domains respond in opposite ways when pH is decreased from 7 to 5: Urea denaturation and temperature stability assays show that NT dimers get significantly stabilized and then lock the spidroins into multimers, whereas CT on the other hand is destabilized and unfolds into ThT-positive β-sheet amyloid fibrils, which can trigger fiber formation. There is a high carbon dioxide pressure (pCO<sub>2</sub>) in distal parts of the gland, and a CO<sub>2</sub> analogue interacts with buried regions in CT as determined by nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy. Activity staining of histological sections and inhibition experiments reveal that the pH gradient is created by carbonic anhydrase. Carbonic anhydrase activity emerges in the same region of the gland as the opposite effects on NT and CT stability occur. These synchronous events suggest a novel CO<sub>2</sub> and proton-dependent lock and trigger mechanism of spider silk formation.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The spinning process of spider silk is crucial for making webs or other complex constructions to catch spider's prey. The main components of the silk are spidroins, which are large and repetitive proteins that have conserved nonrepetitive terminal domains (NT and CT). Spiders manage both to store the highly aggregation-prone spidroins in solution at extreme concentrations in the silk glands and then to rapidly convert these spidroins into a solid fiber within fractions of a second as they spin fibres. This process has been extensively studied and is thought to involve a pH gradient, but how this pH gradient is generated and maintained was not resolved. Here, we measured the pH at locations along the ampullate gland and determined that the pH decreases to 5.7 in the middle of the spinning duct. We also observed that the carbon dioxide pressure is simultaneously increased and that its accumulation may affect the stability of CT. We find that active carbonic anhydrase (CA) is crucial to maintain the pH gradient along the gland. Detailed molecular studies of NT and CT under the disparate conditions present along the gland revealed a lock and trigger mechanism whereby in more neutral pH conditions, precocious spidroin aggregation is prevented, and when in more acidic pH conditions, NT dimers firmly interconnect the spidroins and the CT unfolds into β-sheet nuclei that can trigger rapid polymerization of the spidroins. We conclude that this mechanism enables temporal and spatial control of silk formation and may be harnessed in attempts to produce artificial silk replicas.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spider silk fibers contain regions of crystalline and noncrystalline β-sheets, which mediate mechanical stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Simmons1">[1]</xref>. In contrast, the soluble spidroins (dope) stored in the tail and sac of major and minor ampullate silk glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Bell1">[2]</xref> exhibit unordered and helical conformations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hijirida1">[3]</xref>. How spiders rapidly convert the dope into a solid fiber at a defined site of the S-shaped duct has been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Vollrath1">[8]</xref>, but major questions are unresolved: First, how is the pH gradient in the gland generated and maintained? Second, what is the pH at the phase transition in the duct? The pH in the major ampullate gland has been shown to decrease from 7.2 in the proximal parts of the sac to 6.3 in the beginning of the duct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Dicko1">[7]</xref>, but it has also been proposed that the gradient goes from 6.9 in the sac to 6.3 in the third limb of the duct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Knight1">[6]</xref>. Third, how are the terminal domains affected by the conditions in the duct at a molecular level, and in particular, do they, as proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Askarieh1">[5]</xref>, act in similar manners? Documented pH-dependent effects at a molecular level include that the N-terminal domain (NT) dimerizes at pH 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Gaines1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Kronqvist1">[11]</xref>, but pH-induced structural changes of the C-terminal domain (CT) have only been observed at pH 2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref>. Here we address these questions and unravel novel physiological mechanisms for regulated spider silk formation.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<p>By use of concentric ion selective microelectrodes (ISMs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Fedirko1">[12]</xref> we determined the pH in the major ampullate gland of <italic>Nephila clavipes</italic>, from the proximal part of the tail to the middle part of the second limb of the duct. Concentrations of CO<sub>3</sub><sup>2−</sup> were also determined at locations where pH was high enough to allow reliable measurements, and used to calculate HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> concentrations. We found that the pH decreases from 7.6±0.1 (<italic>n</italic> = 11) in the proximal tail to 5.7±0.0 (<italic>n</italic> = 6) in the second limb of the duct and that HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> concentration increases from 5 mM in the proximal tail to 21 mM in the distal part of the sac (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001921-t001">Table 1</xref>). With these values in the Henderson–Hasselbalch equation, the carbon dioxide pressure (pCO<sub>2</sub>) could be calculated and was found to increase along the gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We observed that the intraluminal pH at different locations did not change despite superfusion of the gland with an elevated pCO<sub>2</sub>. This indicates that the epithelium of the major ampullate gland does not allow permeation of CO<sub>2</sub>, a phenomenon previously described for parietal and chief cells in gastric glands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Waisbren1">[13]</xref>. The concentrations of K<sup>+</sup>, Na<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>−</sup> in the sac were determined to be 6, 192, and 164 mM, respectively, using concentric ISMs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001921-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The observation of simultaneously decreasing pH and increasing HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub> concentrations from the proximal to the distal parts of the gland (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g001">Figure 1</xref>) suggested that carbonic anhydrase (CA) could be involved through catalysing the conversion of H<sub>2</sub>O + CO<sub>2</sub> ↔H<sup>+</sup>+ HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>. By use of a histochemical method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Ridderstrale1">[14]</xref> we could indeed identify abundant CA activity in intracellular vesicles and at the apical cell membrane of the epithelium in the distal part of the major and minor ampullate sacs and ducts, as well as in aggregate gland ducts and tubuliform glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g002">Figure 2A–E</xref>). The site in the major ampullate epithelium where CA was found to emerge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) exactly coincides with the location where the glandular epithelium ceases to produce spidroins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Andersson1">[15]</xref>. To investigate whether CA is responsible for generating and maintaining the pH gradient, we immersed freshly dissected <italic>N. clavipes</italic> major ampullate glands in buffers containing methazolamide, a membrane-permeable CA inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Maren1">[16]</xref>. Exposure to methazolamide collapsed the pH gradient, and pH levelled out to approximately 7 in the tail and sac. The gradient could subsequently be restored by removing the methazolamide (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001921-t002">Table 2</xref>). Thus, the pH gradient in the major ampullate gland is dependent on active CA. Because CA activity was found in the epithelium of the distal major ampullate duct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), where also proton pumps are present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Vollrath2">[17]</xref>, the pH may well continue to drop along the entire duct—that is, below pH 5.7 now measured half-way through the duct. This needs to be experimentally verified, as the extremely small inner diameter in the second half of the duct (&lt;20 µm) did not allow measurements with the currently used ISMs.</p>

<p>To address the third unresolved question—that is, how the terminal domains are affected by the conditions in the duct at a molecular level—we first compared the in vitro structural stability of NT and CT in the broad pH gradient now observed. We studied isolated domains, and it may be that these domains behave differently in their natural context of full-length spidroins. However, we have observed that NT followed by five repeats behaves as the isolated domain in terms of pH-dependent dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Kronqvist1">[11]</xref>. Urea and temperature denaturation studies at different pH values were performed for recombinant NT and CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g004">4</xref>). The stability of NT towards urea remained largely unchanged between pH 7.5 and 6.5, but was significantly increased between 6.0 and 5.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We here analyzed a minor ampullate spidroin (MiSp) NT, which has not been studied before, but a similar pH effect was recently shown for a major ampullate spidroin (MaSp) NT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Kronqvist1">[11]</xref>. This indicates that the structural effects now observed are applicable to spidroins from major and minor ampullate glands, in concordance with the observation of CA in major and minor ampullate, aggregate, and tubuliform glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g002">Figure 2</xref>). A similar effect as seen for stability towards urea was seen for NT thermal stability; that is, it was increased at lower pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Dimerization of NT is completed at pH 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Kronqvist1">[11]</xref>, and the subsequent stabilization of NT dimers between pH 6 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g003">Figure 3</xref>) may result in the firm locking of spidroins into multimers in the distal part of the duct (cf., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g001">Figure 1</xref>). CT, in sharp contrast to NT, was gradually destabilized towards urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g004">Figure 4</xref>) when pH was lowered from 7.5 to 5.0. Heteronuclear single quantum coherence (HSQC) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectra of CT showed a folded structure at pH 6.8, whereas a gradual conversion to an unfolded state was observed at a pH below 5.5, and at pH 5.0, it is completely unfolded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Moreover, we observed that CT irreversibly converted from α-helical to β-sheet structure upon thermal denaturation at pH 5.5, but not at pH 6.5 or 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001921.s001">Table S1</xref>). The fact that NMR spectroscopy of CT shows an unfolded state at pH 5.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g005">Figure 5</xref>) whereas circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy and urea denaturation shows residual structure at pH 5.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g003">Figure 3</xref>) may be explained by the different CT concentrations (0.3 mM versus 5 µM) and recording times (hours versus minutes) used. It should also be pointed out that unfolded species should have increased NMR intensities (and may thus be overestimated relative to folded species) due to favorable relaxation and dynamic properties and that helical structure (which is observed by CD) may be present in the species that are observed as random coil/unfolded by NMR. Denaturation of NT, in contrast, resulted in mainly unordered structure and was reversible at all three pH values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001921.s001">Table S1</xref>). It may be worth noting that the structural conversion now observed for CT, but not for NT, resembles that seen for the spidroin dope <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Dicko2">[18]</xref>, which may be relevant for the trigger mechanism as discussed below.</p>

<p>Next, we used hydrogen-deuterium exchange mass spectrometry (HDX-MS) to study the backbone conformational dynamics of CT at pH 7.5 to 5.5. No major differences in HDX were seen between pH 7.5 and 6.5, but helices 2, 3, and 5 showed increased HDX at pH 5.5 compared to at pH 6.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g007">Figure 7</xref>), indicating increased structural flexibility at lower pH. Previous studies of CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Gao1">[19]</xref> have identified a strictly conserved salt bridge between an Arg residue in helix 2 and a Glu residue in helix 4. The NMR structure of <italic>Araneus ventricosus</italic> MiSp CT now studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001921.s002">Table S2</xref>) is very similar to those of MiSp CT from <italic>Nephila antipodiana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Gao1">[19]</xref> and MaSp CT from <italic>A. diadematus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref> with backbone root-mean-square deviations (RMSDs) of 2.4 Å and 3.4 Å, respectively (over 202 residues from both chains; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Largest differences are observed for the N-terminal helix, which is shorter, and the C-terminal helix, which is kinked near the C-terminus in the <italic>A. ventricosus</italic> MiSp CT structure. A salt bridge between Arg38 in H2 and Glu82 in H4 is indeed found in <italic>A. ventricosus</italic> MiSp CT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Computational pKa predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Olsson1">[20]</xref> of the available CT structures uniformly suggested that the Glu residue in H2 (that participates in the saltbridge) has a pKa ≥6, making it possible to protonate in the pH interval now observed in the gland, and mutations interfering with this salt bridge greatly destabilize CT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Gao1">[19]</xref>. Our results suggest that protonation of the conserved Glu in H2 is involved in pH-dependent unfolding of CT in spider silk glands, and further experimental studies are warranted to determine exactly what residues are protonated in CT at low pH. Although the NMR structures of several CTs from different spidroins have been solved and their biochemical properties have been studied, the now observed pH responsive behavior of this domain has not been investigated in detail before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Askarieh1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Gao1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hedhammar1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Wang1">[23]</xref>. The shared overall fold suggests a conserved function of CT, but the possibility that CT has diverse functions in different silks cannot be excluded and is an important topic for further studies.</p>

<p>The conditions now determined for the distal parts of the gland—that is, low pH combined with increasing HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> concentration and low CO<sub>2</sub> permeability of the gland—imply that pCO<sub>2</sub> is elevated along the sac and duct. For MaSp CT, it has been shown that shear forces induce conformational changes that result in increased exposure of nonpolar surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Hagn1">[4]</xref>, and CO<sub>2</sub> interacts mainly with nonpolar regions in proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Wright1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-vanLun1">[25]</xref>.

<p>Amyloid fibrils are β-sheet polymers formed from (partly) unfolded proteins in a nucleation-dependent reaction and are found in tissue deposits associated with disease but also in some functional protein aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Greenwald1">[26]</xref>. Amyloid fibrils share similarities with the β-sheets of spider silk and have been observed in the distal third of the spinning duct by electron microscopy (EM), and it was proposed that the spidroin repetitive parts are responsible for the amyloidogenic behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Kenney1">[27]</xref>. The poly-Ala segments of spidroins need to rapidly form β-sheet structure in silk formation, although Ala is highly prone to form α-helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Johansson1">[28]</xref>, raising the question, What nucleates this process? We investigated whether CT may convert to amyloid-like fibrils at low pH by measuring Thioflavin T (ThT) fluorescence of CT over time at different pH values. When ThT binds to β-sheet polymers in amyloid-like fibrils, it gives an increased fluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-LeVine1">[29]</xref>. At pH 5.5 and below, CT converted to a ThT-positive state, which was not observed at higher pH, or for NT at any pH tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g011">Figure 11A</xref>). Analysis of the ThT-positive aggregates by transmission EM showed typical amyloid-like fibrils, 5–10 nm thick, elongated and nonbranched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g011">Figure 11B</xref>). Only samples of CT incubated at pH 5.5 showed the presence of amyloid-like fibrils. Furthermore, the CT fibrils were positive for Congo red staining and showed green birefringence under polarized light (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g011">Figure 11C</xref>), another hallmark of an amyloid-like fiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Sipe1">[30]</xref>.</p>

<p>The spidroins' terminal domains are highly conserved, both between species and between different types of silks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Garb1">[31]</xref>, which suggest that they play important roles in spider silk formation rather than for the silks' mechanical properties. Further supporting the hypothesis of general polymerization mechanisms between different types of silks, CA is found in the distal parts of several different spider silk glands and occur at the same location as the observed structural changes of NT and CT will take place provided that their behavior <italic>in vitro</italic> is recapitulated <italic>in vivo</italic>. NT and CT are unique to spidroins and there are no known homologues. The lock (accomplished by NT) and trigger (accomplished by CT) mechanism proposed herein is therefore likely unique for spider silk formation, in contrast to the previously identified shear-induced polymerization mechanism that also apply to, for example, silk worm silk formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Moriya1">[32]</xref>. A detailed understanding of the natural spinning process will be vital for the development of a spinning process capable of generating truly biomimetic spider silk fibers and may provide novel insights into Nature's way of confining amyloid fibril formation to a specific location.</p>
<p>In summary, the spidroin N- and C-terminal domains show synchronous and opposite structural changes in response to the physiological conditions of the spinning duct. CT unfolds into β-sheet nuclei that can trigger rapid polymerization of the spidroins, whereas gradually locked NT dimers alleviate the need for rapid diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Kronqvist1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Schwarze1">[33]</xref>, firmly interconnect the spidroins, and allow for propagation of pulling forces along the peptide chains. These events are driven by CO<sub>2</sub> and proton gradients that ensure temporal and spatial confinement of the divergent structural changes of CT and NT. This novel lock and trigger mechanism elegantly explains how silk formation can occur at a very high speed, more than 1 m/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Ortlepp1">[34]</xref>, and at the same time be confined to the very distal part of the spinning duct.</p>

<title>ISM Measurements of Major Ampullate Glands</title>
<p>Adult female <italic>N. clavipes</italic> collected in Florida from September to November were kept in individual containers and fed water.

<p>Some glands were subjected to CO<sub>2</sub> permeability studies. Glands were dissected, mounted, and superfused with HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup> and CO<sub>2</sub>-buffered spider Ringer at room temperature as described above. A pH electrode was inserted into the gland, after which the surrounding Ringer solution was buffered by 26 mM bicarbonate and 100% CO<sub>2</sub>. pH measurements were continued up to 1 h to see if intraluminal pH changed in response to the elevated pCO<sub>2</sub> surrounding the gland. The Ringer solution was then changed again, being buffered by 26 mM bicarbonate and 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, yielding a pH of 7.4, after which the pH electrode was removed from the gland and put in the Ringer and pH was recorded. This was made to ensure that the electrode had not been drifting.</p>

<title>Histochemical Localization of CA Activity</title>
<p>Spiders (<italic>A. diadematus</italic>, <italic>N. clavipes</italic>, <italic>E. australis</italic>, and <italic>Tegenaria sp.</italic>) were anesthetized and sacrificed as described above. Dissection was carried out in 67 mM sodium phosphate buffer at pH 7.2 or in a modified Spider Ringer (see above). Some opisthosomas were fixed and embedded directly after removal of the exoskeleton, whereas others were dissected so that the major and minor ampullate glands could be isolated before fixation.</p>
<p>Tissues for histochemical localization of CA activity were immersion fixed in 2.5% (v/v) glutaraldehyde in 67 mM phosphate buffer, pH 7.2, for 24 h at 4°C and subsequently rinsed with phosphate buffer, pH 7.2. After fixation, tissues were dehydrated using increasing concentrations of ethanol, infiltrated and embedded in a water-soluble glycol methacrylate (Leica Historesin embedding kit).</p>
<p>Historesin embedded major and minor ampullate glands and opisthosomas were sectioned at 2 µm in a microtome (Leica RM 2165) and stained for CA activity using a histochemical method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Ridderstrale1">[14]</xref>. The method involves incubation of sections in a medium containing NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, CoSO<sub>4</sub>, H<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, and KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, whereby carbon dioxide leaves, pH increases, and a cobalt–phosphate–carbonate complex is formed at sites with CA activity. This complex is then converted into a black cobalt–sulphide precipitate. The sections were counterstained with Azure blue. For control of unspecific staining, the CA inhibitor acetazolamide was included in the incubation medium.</p>

Additionally, in order to identify intermolecular NOEs, a <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N-filtered <sup>13</sup>C(aliphatic)-resolved NOESY-HSQC spectrum (768×34×70, 60 ms) was recorded on a sample containing 50% <sup>13</sup>C/<sup>15</sup>N-labelled and 50% unlabelled proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Stuart1">[38]</xref> that was prepared by mixing equal amounts of labeled and unlabelled proteins in 8 M urea followed by dialysis against the NMR sample buffer. The same sample was afterwards used to probe interactions with CS<sub>2</sub>. Aliquots of 20% CS<sub>2</sub> in DMSO were added in a stepwise manner to the NMR sample of CT, yielding CS<sub>2</sub> concentrations of 50 mM, 100 mM, and 200 mM, and a 2D [<sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H]-HSQC spectrum was recorded each time. To account for perturbations due to DMSO, a reference experiment was performed by adding DMSO only in the same amounts. CS<sub>2</sub>-induced chemical shift perturbations were calculated by comparing the spectrum at 200 mM CS<sub>2</sub> with the spectrum at the end of the reference titration with DMSO, and using the formula (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001921.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Constantine1">[39]</xref>.

<title>Urea Denaturation</title>
<p><italic>A. ventricosus</italic> MiSp NT and CT stability between pH 5.0 and 7.5 with and without 154 mM NaCl was determined by urea denaturation. Like in previous denaturation studies of MiSp CT from <italic>N. antipodiana</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Gao1">[19]</xref>, we used a two-state model for analyzing our denaturation data. Although a two-state transition is supported by a CD isodichroic point at 203 nm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001921-Holtzer1">[46]</xref> for NT at low pH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), this is not the case for CT at any pH, or NT at pH 7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001921-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To emphasize that we assumed a two-state transition for both NT and CT, the urea concentrations derived from fitting the data to a two-state unfolding model are referred to as apparent half-denaturation ([den]<sup>50%</sup>). Notably, the main conclusion from these experiments—that NT and CT respond in completely opposite ways to lowered pH—is not dependent on whether a two-state transition applies or not.</p>
<p>For NT, urea-induced denaturation was performed by diluting the protein to 5 µM in 20 mM HEPES/20 mM MES with 0–7 M urea in 0.25 M steps. Tryptophan fluorescence emission spectra were measured on a spectrofluorometer (Tecan Safire 2) using Costar black polystyrene assay plates with 96 flat bottom wells. The samples were excited at 280 nm using a 5 nm bandwidth, and emission spectra were recorded in 1 nm steps between 300 and 400 nm using a 10 nm bandwidth. Spectra were recorded at constant pH values ranging from 5.0 to 7.5 with 0.2–0.5 unit steps. For CT, CD spectroscopy at 222 nm was used to determine [den]<sup>50%</sup> as a function of pH. The CT samples were diluted to 7.5 µM in 20 mM sodium phosphate buffer and ran with 0–7 M urea in 0.25 M steps. At each pH, the average 222 nm CD ellipticity from three temperature scans for different urea concentrations were obtained with the settings described below (see CD spectroscopy). The ellipticities for each measured pH values ranging from 5.0 to 7.5 with 0.2–0.5 unit steps were plotted against the urea concentration and fitted to a two-state unfolding model in order to determine the [den]<sup>50%</sup> by KaleidaGraph.</p>

<p>Samples were thawed and immediately injected into an HPLC system using a chilled 25 µl Hamilton syringe. CT protein was digested in a Porozyme pepsin cartridge (Applied Biosystems), and peptides were trapped and desalted in a Waters Symmetry C<sub>18</sub> trap column (Waters).

The entire flow system was submerged in an ice bath.</p>
<p>ESI spectra were acquired in positive-ion mode with a Waters Ultima API mass spectrometer (Waters) equipped with a Z-spray source. The source temperature was 80°C, the capillary voltage was 2.5 kV, and the cone and radiofrequency lens 1 potentials were 100 and 38 V, respectively. The mass spectrometer was operated in single-reflector mode to achieve a resolution of 10,000 (full width at half maximum). The mass scale was calibrated using [Glu1]fibrinopeptide B. Peptic peptides were identified based on a map of pepsin-digested undeuterated CT using automated liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS) analysis with a Waters NanoAcquity system (Waters).
