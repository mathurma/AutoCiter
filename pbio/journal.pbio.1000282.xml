<p>In plants, auxin distribution and tissue patterning are coordinated via a feedback loop involving the auxin-regulated cell polarity factor ICR1 and the secretory machinery.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Development in multicellular organisms depends on the ability of individual cells to coordinate their behavior by means of small signaling molecules to form correctly patterned tissues. In plants, a unique mechanism of directional transport of the signaling molecule auxin between cells connects cell polarity and tissue patterning and thus is required for many aspects of plant development. Direction of auxin flow is determined by polar subcellular localization of PIN auxin efflux transporters. Dynamic PIN polar localization results from the constitutive endocytic cycling to and from the plasma membrane, but it is not well understood how this mechanism connects to regulators of cell polarity. The Rho family small GTPases ROPs/RACs are master regulators of cell polarity, however their role in regulating polar protein trafficking and polar auxin transport has not been established. Here, by analysis of mutants and transgenic plants, we show that the ROP interactor and polarity regulator scaffold protein ICR1 is required for recruitment of PIN proteins to the polar domains at the plasma membrane. <italic>icr1</italic> mutant embryos and plants display an a array of severe developmental aberrations that are caused by compromised differential auxin distribution. ICR1 functions at the plasma membrane where it is required for exocytosis but does not recycle together with PINs. ICR1 expression is quickly induced by auxin but is suppressed at the positions of stable auxin maxima in the hypophysis and later in the embryonic and mature root meristems. Our results imply that ICR1 is part of an auxin regulated positive feedback loop realized by a unique integration of auxin-dependent transcriptional regulation into ROP-mediated modulation of cell polarity. Thus, ICR1 forms an auxin-modulated link between cell polarity, exocytosis, and auxin transport-dependent tissue patterning.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The coordination of different cells during pattern formation is a fundamental process in the development of multicellular organisms. In plants, a unique mechanism of directional transport of the signaling molecule auxin between cells demonstrates the importance of cell polarity for tissue patterning. The direction of auxin flow is determined by polar subcellular localization of auxin transport proteins called PINs, which facilitate auxin efflux. At the same time, an auxin-mediated positive feedback mechanism reinforces the polar distribution of PINs. However, the molecular mechanisms that underlie polar PIN localization are not well understood. In eukaryotic cells, the Rho family of small GTPases function as central regulators of cell polarity. We show that a Rho-interacting protein from plants, called ICR1, is required for recruitment via the secretory system of PIN proteins to polar domains in the cell membrane. As a result, ICR1 is required for directional auxin transport and distribution and thereby for proper pattern formation. In addition, both the expression and subcellular localization of ICR1 are regulated by auxin, suggesting that ICR1 could function in a positive feedback loop that reinforces auxin distribution. Thus, ICR1 forms an auxin-modulated link between cell polarity, protein secretion, and auxin-dependent tissue patterning.</p>

<p>ROP (Rho of Plants), also known as RAC GTPases, have been implicated as master regulators of cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yalovsky1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yang1">[2]</xref>. In their GTP-bound, active state, ROPs interact with downstream effector proteins to regulate organization of actin and microtubules (MT), vesicle trafficking, production of phosphoinositides, and gradients of reactive oxygen species (ROS) and Ca<sup>2+</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yalovsky1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Molendijk1">[6]</xref>. ROPs function at the plasma membrane to which they attach by virtue of posttranslational lipid modifications prenylation and <italic>S</italic>-acylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yalovsky1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sorek1">[9]</xref>. The ability of ROPs to interact with membranes allows these proteins to regulate actin polymerization and vesicle trafficking at discrete sites of the plasma membrane and of internal membranes, which is essential for their role in the control of cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Ridley1">[10]</xref>. ROPs are polarly localized and expression of activated dominant ROP mutants that cannot hydrolyze GTP compromises cell polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yalovsky1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Molendijk1">[6]</xref> and inhibits endocytic vesicle recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Bloch1">[3]</xref>. Due to their essential role in generation of cell polarity, it was plausible that ROPs also regulate distribution of polar cargos including PIN auxin efflux transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Petrasek1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously identified a ROP interacting coiled coil domain scaffold protein Interactor of Constitutive active ROP 1 (ICR1) and demonstrated that it affects cell polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>. Recently, ICR1/RIP1 has been implicated as a regulator of polar pollen tube growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Li2">[13]</xref>. The primary root meristem of <italic>icr1</italic> mutant and <italic>RNAi</italic> silenced plants collapses soon after germination, resembling mutants affected in basal localization of PIN proteins and multiple <italic>pin</italic> loss-of-function mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn1">[14]</xref>. These results suggested that ICR1 might form a link between Rho-regulated cell polarity and polar auxin transport.</p>
<p>Auxin is the major signal for tissue polarity and patterning in plants. Polar auxin transport and resulting asymmetric auxin distribution within tissues (auxin maxima and gradients) are essential for proper development of the embryo, the root, and the shoot, differentiation and regeneration of vascular tissues, and for tropic responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sabatini1">[18]</xref>. Directionality of auxin transport depends on polar subcellular distribution of PINFORMED (PIN) family of efflux transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Petrasek1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Galweiler1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Wisniewska1">[20]</xref>. Dynamic PIN polarity is a result of constitutive endocytic recycling. Recycling to the membrane requires the function of the brefeldin A (BFA)-sensitive ADP ribosylation factor GDP/GTP Exchange Factors (ARF GEFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Geldner1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Geldner2">[22]</xref>. The endocytic step is clathrin dependent and requires function of endosomal Rab5/Ara7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Dhonukshe1">[23]</xref>. However, little is known on how PIN recycling is directed to result in their polar distribution.</p>
<p>In this work we show that ICR1 is an essential component of the auxin transport machinery functioning in exocytosis and as a part of an auxin modulated feedback loop. Thus, ICR1 links between Rho-regulated cell polarity and auxin associated pattern formation.</p>

<title>Auxin Distribution in <italic>icr1</italic> Roots</title>
<p>To address the potential function of ICR1 in auxin transport, we examined auxin distribution in wild type (WT) <italic>Col-0</italic> and <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants using the auxin sensitive reporters <italic>DR5::GUS</italic> and <italic>DR5rev::GFP</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Friml1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sabatini1">[18]</xref>. The formation of the <italic>DR5</italic>-visualized auxin maximum in the quiescent center (QC) and proximal columella cells is required for root meristem maintenance and correct tissue patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sabatini1">[18]</xref>. In young 2 days after germination (DAG) <italic>icr1</italic> roots the auxin maximum was displaced towards the distal tier of root cap and was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). Concomitant with the reduction of the auxin maximum at the root tip, it started to accumulate in the vascular bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In older (14 DAG) roots auxin accumulated in the vascular bundle but did not reach the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These results suggested that the collapse of the root meristem in <italic>icr1</italic> plants resulted from compromised auxin transport and in-turn gradual disappearance of the auxin maximum at the root tip.</p>

<title>Columella Specification in <italic>icr1</italic></title>
<p>The specification of the columella at the root tip is closely associated with the formation of a stable auxin maximum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sabatini1">[18]</xref>. Columella cells contain starch granules that can be easily identified by staining of roots with Lugol staining (IKI). No starch granules were detected in the collapsed primary roots of <italic>icr1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>, indicating that columella identity was lost. Because the stable auxin maximum was displaced in <italic>icr1</italic> embryos and roots, it was plausible that columella cells may be specified in young roots but would later disappear, concomitant with the proximal shift of the auxin maximum. To examine the specification of the columella cells, the existence of starch granules was examined in WT and <italic>icr1</italic> roots at 2, 4, and 6 DAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In 2 DAG seedlings, starch granules were detected in two cell tiers, in both WT and <italic>icr1</italic> root tips. At 4 DAG, starch granules were detected in 3 cell tiers of WT plants but remained confined to 2 cell tiers in the <italic>icr1</italic> roots. Furthermore, the columella initials could not be detected in <italic>icr1</italic>. At 6 DAG, WT roots had 4 columella cell tiers, while starch granules were barely detected or absent in the <italic>icr1</italic> roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These results indicate that columella identity is initially specified in <italic>icr1</italic> root tip cells and then gradually disappears, concomitant with the diminishing local auxin maximum.</p>

<title>Development of <italic>icr1</italic> Embryos</title>
<p>In plants, the polar shoot to root axis and the primary shoot and root meristems develop during embryogenesis. These developmental processes are associated with stereotypical series of cell divisions and gene expression and depend on auxin distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Friml1">[17]</xref>. Development of WT and <italic>icr1</italic> mutant embryos was analyzed to further establish the role of ICR1 in auxin distribution and embryo development. About 10% (27/273) of the <italic>icr1</italic> embryos showed defects in stereotypic cell divisions of the basal embryo pole at the globular stage as well as abnormal divisions in the suspensor, including the uppermost cell, which forms hypophysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The majority (90%, 246/273) of the mutant embryos developed normally through the globular stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s018">Table S1</xref>). From the triangular stage and onward, abnormal divisions of the suspensor, QC and columella cells were detected. Moreover, abnormal division planes were observed in the protoderm at the position of future cotyledons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s002">Figure S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s018">Table S1</xref>). The variable penetrance of the <italic>icr1</italic> mutation also resulted in reduced developmental synchronization of embryos within single siliques. Whereas in WT siliques the embryos were found in two to three developmental stages, in <italic>icr1</italic> siliques the embryos were spread between four and five stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s003">Figure S3</xref>), indicating that developmental delay in <italic>icr1</italic> occurs at different stages. The data suggested that the loss of <italic>ICR1</italic> function results in a gradient of phenotypic defects primarily at the places of auxin maxima and in processes requiring differential auxin distribution.</p>

The abnormal auxin distribution coincided with the non-stereotypic divisions of the future root meristem, further suggesting that the developmental abnormalities in <italic>icr1</italic> result from compromised auxin distribution.</p>

<title>Patterning of <italic>icr1</italic> Embryos and Roots</title>
<p>Root and embryo patterning and QC maintenance depend on highly specific expression pattern and subcellular localization of transcriptional regulators, including WOX5 (WUSCHEL related homeobox 5) and SCR (SCARECRAW), that define the stem cell niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Haecker1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sabatini2">[26]</xref>. In roots, formation of a stable auxin maximum is required for correct expression pattern of <italic>WOX5</italic>, <italic>SCR</italic>, and an additional marker SHORTROOT (SHR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sabatini1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Xu1">[27]</xref>. To verify that ICR1 is indeed involved in regulation of auxin distribution rather than this gene network, the expression of <italic>WOX5</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic> in embryos was examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s005">Figures S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s006">S6</xref>). Both <italic>WOX5</italic> and <italic>SCR</italic> were expressed in the <italic>icr1</italic> mutant embryos, but their expression pattern was altered, reflecting changes in cell identity and disruption of the embryo polar axis. The embryo development and auxin response further suggested that the alterations in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants are related to defects in auxin distribution.</p>
<p>To further establish that the altered patterning in <italic>icr1</italic> mutants resulted from compromised auxin transport rather than the genetic framework that regulates root development, we compared the expression of <italic>WOX5</italic>, <italic>SCR</italic>, and SHR in WT and <italic>icr1</italic> roots.

<p>To further examine the function of ICR1 in root patterning, we examined the expression pattern of PIN1 in <italic>icr1</italic> roots. In the root, PIN1 is expressed mainly in the vascular cylinder. In <italic>icr1</italic> mutant roots, however, <italic>pPIN1</italic>-driven PIN1-GFP expression was detected also in the epidermis and root hairs where it formed intracellular aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The mis-expression of PIN1 was a further indication that the altered auxin distribution in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants resulted from compromised auxin transport and is not an indirect effect of perturbations in auxin-independent patterning mechanisms.</p>

<title>Lateral Root Development in <italic>icr1</italic></title>
<p>The initiation and growth of lateral roots are separable events that depend on local auxin accumulation and polar transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Benkova1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Dubrovsky1">[28]</xref>. Given the function of ICR1 in primary root development, it was plausible that it would affect development of lateral roots. The primary root of <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants collapses before formation of lateral roots. However, the mutant plants develop adventitious roots that grow for some time and then collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>. The formation of these adventitious roots is preceded by formation of local auxin maxima (unpublished data). Lateral roots were initiated on these adventitious roots, but their growth was arrested after emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Often, multiple initiations of lateral roots were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, inset), indicating that the onset as well as growth of lateral roots was perturbed in <italic>icr1</italic>. In the <italic>icr1</italic> arrested lateral roots, <italic>WOX5</italic> was mis-expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g004">Figure 4E</xref>, compare left and right panels), indicating that the new root meristem was not properly setup. Taken together, these results indicate that in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants the basic genetic framework that regulates root development is present and that the root meristem collapse, the altered organ development, and changes in cell identities can be attributed primarily to the compromised auxin distribution.</p>
<p>The function of roots as an auxin sink has long been postulated to play a major role in vascular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sachs1">[29]</xref>. The “canalization hypothesis,” which became a hallmark for explaining auxin-dependent patterning, postulates that differentiation and regeneration of vascular tissues depend on an auxin-regulated positive feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Berleth1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sachs2">[30]</xref>. That is, auxin induces a process that enhances its own transport from cells while inhibiting its transport in neighboring cells. This process eventually leads to the formation of auxin transporting cell files that differentiate into vascular tissues. Given the involvement of ICR1 in auxin transport, we suspected that the vascular tissues in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants would be abnormal. Transverse sections through rosette leaves were prepared to compare the vascular tissues in WT and <italic>icr</italic> mutant plants. Analysis of these sections showed that the leaf veins in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants are much reduced compared to WT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s007">Figure S7</xref>). The reduced vascular tissues in <italic>icr1</italic> mutants further suggested the involvement of ICR1 protein in auxin transport and that it could be part of an auxin modulated feedback loop.</p>
<p>In summary, the detailed phenotype analyses using markers for the auxin response and major regulators of patterning in multiple auxin-regulated processes revealed pronounced defects in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants that presumably result from the defects in auxin distribution.</p>

<title>Localization of PIN1 and PIN2 in <italic>icr1</italic></title>
<p>To examine a possible mechanism by which ICR1 mediates auxin distribution, we examined the localization and expression of PIN1 and PIN2 auxin transporters in WT and <italic>icr1</italic> roots and embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g005">Figure 5</xref> and Figures <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s008">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s009">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s011">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s012">S12</xref>). Immunolocalization analysis showed a defect in polar localization of PIN proteins, in more pronounced cases resulting in basal-to-apical shift of PIN1 in the stele and of PIN2 in the cortex of <italic>icr1</italic> roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, see arrowheads, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Consistently, in approximately 90% of the cells, reduced association of PIN1-GFP with the plasma membrane and basal to apical shift of PIN2-GFP of the cells in the cortex were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s009">Figures S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s010">S10A</xref>). In the epidermis, PIN2 is primarily localized at the apical side of the cells and is resistant to BFA at this location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Geldner1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn2">[31]</xref>. PIN2 remained associated with the apical side of the <italic>icr1</italic> root epidermis cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g005">Figures 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s010">S10A</xref>), suggesting that ICR1 primarily interacts with a BFA sensitive PIN delivery pathway. In globular <italic>icr1</italic> embryos showing early developmental defects, GFP-PIN1 was not expressed at the basal pole, accumulated in large aggregates inside the cells, and was largely absent from the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, arrow, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s011">Figure S11</xref>). In embryos with late developmental aberrations, obvious changes in PIN1-GFP localization started to appear at the early heart stage and were associated with intracellular PIN1-GFP aggregations and overall loss of polar membrane localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s011">Figure S11</xref>). The differences between the immunolocalizations and the PIN1-GFP possibly reflect differences between embryo and root cells or higher stability GFP-PIN1. Alternatively, the changes in auxin distribution affect <italic>pPIN1</italic>-driven PIN1-GFP expression such that it accumulates at higher levels in certain cells. Importantly, localization of the plasma membrane marker LTi-GFP was not affected in <italic>icr1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), suggesting that ICR1 does not regulate targeting of membrane proteins in general. The model in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s012">Figure S12</xref> summarizes the effects of ICR1 on embryo patterning, PIN1 localization, and auxin distribution. The reduced polarity and membrane association of PIN1 in <italic>icr1</italic> embryos likely leads to defective polar auxin transport and thus to defects in formation of auxin maxima in embryonic root and cotyledons. The reduction in auxin levels is associated with inhibition of PIN1 expression in the provascular tissue. This leads, in turn, to failure of the auxin maximum formation causing a collapse of the root meristem.</p>

<title>ICR1 Expression Pattern</title>

<p>Several experiments were carried out to examine whether ICR1 expression is influenced by auxin. Expression analysis by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (q-PCR) showed that ICR1 expression is quickly induced following 30 min of incubation in auxin (NAA) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). The expression of <italic>pICR</italic>≫<italic>GFP-ICR1</italic> and <italic>pICR1</italic>≫<italic>GUS</italic> reporters following growth of seedling on medium containing the polar auxin transport inhibitor NPA (1-N-naphthylphthalamic acid) and followed by addition of auxin (NAA) to the growth medium were studied. Confirming the prediction, ICR1 expression was lower when seedlings were grown on NPA and was induced as early as 4–6 h following treatment with NAA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s014">Figure S14</xref>). As shown above, lateral root development is compromised in <italic>icr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). The initiation of lateral roots is induced by auxin and occurs at places of transient local auxin maxima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Benkova1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Dubrovsky1">[28]</xref>. Consistently, GFP-ICR1 expression was observed at positions of lateral root initiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), further indicating that ICR1 expression is induced by auxin.</p>
<p>The absence of ICR1 in the QC and stem cells, where the stable auxin maximum is formed, was in apparent discrepancy to the induction of its expression by auxin and suggested that it might be suppressed by a different mechanism. To examine whether a stable auxin maximum could suppress <italic>ICR1</italic> expression directly, auxin was applied locally to <italic>pICR1</italic>≫<italic>GFP-ICR1</italic> roots, using small, 1 mm<sup>2</sup>, agar particles that contained 10 µM NAA. Strong local GFP-ICR1 expression was observed in the auxin treated roots, while no increase was observed in control roots that were treated with agar particles without auxin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). These results reconfirmed that <italic>ICR1</italic> expression is induced by auxin and further suggested that stable auxin maxima, likely, do not suppress ICR1 expression directly. The site of the stable auxin maximum at the root tip was shown to express a specific group of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sabatini1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Xu1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sena1">[34]</xref>. Thus, possibly, the suppression of ICR1 expression is associated with specific cellular processes taking place at and around the site of the stable auxin maxima.</p>
<p>To obtain further insight into regulation of ICR1 expression, we examined whether the suppression of its expression may be associated with the ICR1 gene or protein. To this end, a GFP-rop6<sup>CA</sup> reporter (Poraty and Yalovsky, unpublished data) was expressed under regulation of the <italic>ICR1</italic> promoter. To reduce the possibility of differences in expression due to position effects, expression was carried out using the LhG4/pOp transcription/transactivation system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Eshed1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Moore1">[36]</xref>, using the same <italic>pICR1</italic> promoter activator lines to express GFP-rop6<sup>CA</sup>, GUS, or GFP-ICR1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s013">Figure S13</xref>). In contrast to GFP-ICR1, the GFP-rop6<sup>CA</sup> was observed in the QC and stem cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating that indeed the suppression of ICR1 expression in the root meristem could be regulated by a mechanism associated with the ICR1 gene or protein. To summarize these data, while auxin induced transcription of <italic>ICR1</italic> is part of a positive feedback loop that facilitates auxin transport, the suppression of ICR1 expression in the root meristem is associated with a cell-specific mechanism/s, presumably leading to inhibition of directional auxin transport, and contributes to the formation of a stable auxin maximum.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2i">
<title>Subcellular Localization of ICR1</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether the subcellular localization of GFP-ICR1 reflects ICR1 function in polar localization of PIN proteins. GFP-ICR1 complemented root growth in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Furthermore, in pollen tubes, overexpression of either GFP-ICR1 or non-fused recombinant ICR1 had the same phenotypic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Li2">[13]</xref>. It thus appears that localization of the GFP-ICR1 fusion protein reflected that of the native ICR1 protein. Importantly, GFP-ICR1 localization was not sensitive to BFA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), consistent with earlier studies showing that recruitment of ICR1 to the plasma membrane is not ARFGEF- but ROP-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Li2">[13]</xref>. GFP-ICR1 was localized both at the plasma membrane and intracellularly. Plasma membrane localization was confirmed by plasmolysis, which induces detachment of membrane from the cell wall (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s016">Figure S16</xref>). In lateral root founder cells and embryos, GFP-ICR1 had polarized localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6C and 6D</xref>, arrowheads). In the primary root, the localization of GFP-ICR1 became progressively polarized away from the auxin maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, arrowheads). The non-polarized ICR localization around the auxin maximum could contribute to the reduction of auxin transport leading to the formation of stable auxin maximum.</p>

<title>ICR1 and Constitutive Endocytic Recycling</title>
<p>The reduced polarity and association with the plasma membrane of PIN1 and PIN2 in the <italic>icr1</italic> plants suggested that ICR1 is required for recruitment of the PIN proteins to the plasma membrane rather than their Rab5-regulated endocytic recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Dhonukshe2">[37]</xref>. Indeed, internalization of endocytosis tracer FM4-64 into BFA bodies occurred normally in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant roots and embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Furthermore, similar to WT roots, PIN1-GFP and PIN2-GFP were internalized into the BFA bodies in <italic>icr1</italic> roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g007">Figures 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s010">S10B</xref>). These data confirmed that endocytosis of FM4-64-labeled plasma membrane derived vesicles in general and of PIN1 and PIN2 in particular were not affected in <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants.</p>
<p>The effects of BFA on endocytic recycling are reversible. When BFA is washed from the medium, the BFA bodies disappear and PIN proteins regain their localization in the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Geldner1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Geldner2">[22]</xref>.

Following incubation of <italic>GFP-PIN2</italic> and <italic>GFP-PIN2 icr1</italic> plants in BFA, the GFP-PIN2-containing BFA bodies appeared in 80% to 90% of the cells and no significant differences were found between WT and <italic>icr1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g008">Figure 8A, 8C, and 8E</xref>). However, following a 2-h incubation in medium without BFA, 20%–27% of the cells in the <italic>icr1</italic> roots still contained BFA bodies compared to only 2%–5% of the cells in WT plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g008">Figure 8B, 8D, and 8E</xref>).

<title>Function of ICR1 in Exocytosis</title>
<p>Previously, we showed that ICR1 interacts with AtSEC3A exocyst complex subunit and that ROPs can recruit ICR1-SEC3 complexes to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>. This suggested that ICR1 could be involved in regulation of polarized exocytosis. To test this hypothesis, comparison of the distribution of a protein secretion marker, secGFP, in WT and <italic>icr1</italic> mutant plants was carried out. SecGFP is a secreted form of GFP that is fused to the chitinase signal peptide at its N-terminus and to HDEL, ER-retention signal, at its C-terminus and has been used in analysis of protein trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Teh1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Zheng1">[39]</xref>. Secretion of secGFP to the apoplast results in weak signal due to the relatively acidic pH of this compartment. Perturbation of secretion results in fluorescence of intracellular accumulating protein. Thus, the effect of a given mutant or treatment on secretion can be evaluated by monitoring the differences in fluorescence. Transgenic plants expressing secGFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Teh1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Zheng1">[39]</xref> were crossed into the <italic>icr1</italic> background.

Fluorescence of secreted GFP can be recovered when seedlings are grown at a pH value higher than 8.1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Zheng1">[39]</xref>. To validate that the differences in GFP fluorescence between WT and <italic>icr1</italic> roots were associated with protein secretion rather than an unrelated mechanism, seedlings were transferred from low (pH 5.5) to high (pH 8.5) pH medium. Quantitative analysis showed significant (<italic>p</italic>≤0.01; Student's <italic>t</italic> test) increase in GFP fluorescence of WT roots, while no increase was observed in <italic>icr1</italic> roots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s017">Figure S17</xref>). These data confirmed that the secGFP secretion was compromised in <italic>icr1</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our results show that ICR1 regulates directionality of polar auxin transport and is thus required for the formation of a stable auxin maximum and tip localized auxin gradient during embryogenesis, organogenesis, and meristem activity. Earlier work on auxin related patterning enforced the notion that patterns do not reflect a rigid program but rather the inherent developmental potential of each cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sachs2">[30]</xref>. Results presented in this work imply that ICR1 is part of an auxin regulated positive feedback loop, integrating auxin-dependent transcriptional regulation with Rho family GTPases-mediated modulation of cell polarity. Thus, ICR1 forms an auxin-modulated link between cell polarity and auxin transport-dependent tissue patterning.</p>
<p>Dynamic PIN polarity is achieved by (1) integration of a previously described constitutive endocytic recycling that involves clathrin-dependent endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Dhonukshe1">[23]</xref> and BFA-sensitive ARF GEFs-mediated recycling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Geldner1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Geldner2">[22]</xref> and (2) a ROP-ICR1-regulated, BFA-insensitive exocytosis (this work). ROP-ICR1 complexes were detected in the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Li2">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, following plasmolysis a substantial fraction of <italic>pICR1</italic> driven GFP-ICR1 remained associated with the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s016">Figure S16</xref>). Thus, it is likely that ICR1 functions in conjunction with ROPs to recruit PIN proteins to specific sites in the membrane. Future analysis of PINs dynamics, using techniques such as Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Dhonukshe2">[37]</xref>, would be required to elucidate the interactions between ICR1-associated exocytosis and the BFA-sensitive PIN endocytic recycling.</p>
<p>The exocytosis defects in <italic>icr1</italic> are consistent with a previous finding that ICR1 can interact with both ROPs and AtSEC3A exocyst subunit at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>. Plants have an evolutionarily conserved exocyst complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Hala1">[40]</xref> that based on mutational analysis was implicated in regulation of polarized secretion, cell morphogenesis, and patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Hala1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Synek1">[43]</xref>. The reduced association of PINs with the membrane, their accumulation inside the cells in the <italic>icr1</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s008">Figures S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s009">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000282.s011">S11</xref>), and the slower recruitment of PIN2 to the plasma membrane following BFA washout (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g008">Figure 8</xref>) indicate that ICR1 and possibly exocyst-dependent exocytosis acting at or close to the plasma membrane is required for proper PIN localization. Thus, in the absence of ICR1, due to endocytic recycling, the PIN proteins are degraded or accumulate in the cells. Basal to apical shift of PIN1 and PIN2 have been associated with function of PINOID (PID) protein kinase as well as a BFA-insensitive pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn2">[31]</xref>. The basal to apical shift of PIN1 and PIN2 that were observed in <italic>icr1</italic> suggests that ICR1 has either reduced or no effect on this BFA insensitive pathway.</p>
<p>ROPs are recruited to the plasma membrane by virtue of the posttranslational lipid modifications prenylation or <italic>S</italic>-acylation that take place on conserved C-terminal cysteine residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yalovsky1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy2">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sorek1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Ivanchenko1">[44]</xref>. In addition, at least some ROPs also undergo activation-dependent transient <italic>S</italic>-acylation and consequent partitioning into detergent resistant membranes that could be lipid rafts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sorek1">[9]</xref>. Association with the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane also requires a polybasic domain proximal to the lipid modified cysteines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy2">[8]</xref>. It has been shown that the polybasic domain in Rho proteins associates with phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PtdIns-P2) and phosphatidylinositol 3,4,5-trisphosphate (PtdIns-P3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Heo1">[45]</xref>. Consistently, in pollen tubes tip, ROP/RAC proteins were shown to physically associate with a phosphatidylinositol monophosphate kinase (PtdIns P-K) activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Kost1">[46]</xref>, and PtdIns-P2, the product of PtdIns P-K, had similar distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Kost1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Preuss1">[47]</xref>. When expressed in pollen tubes, ICR1/RIP1 and ROP1 stabilized the membrane localization of each other at the growing tip, suggesting that ICR1 may interact with other components in the membrane in addition to ROPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Li2">[13]</xref>. It appears therefore that determination of ROP-ICR1 subcellular localization involves multiple mechanisms, including different protein lipid modifications, partitioning into discrete membrane microdomains, and association with phosphatidylphosphoinositides and possibly with yet unidentified components.</p>
<p>At the root tip, localization of GFP-ICR1 became progressively associated with the plasma membrane and polarized in cells that were more distantly located away from the stable auxin maximum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). This suggests that membrane localization and polarization of ICR1 are locally regulated, possibly by a local auxin gradient associated mechanism.</p>
<p>Auxin modulates its polar efflux from cells by inhibiting PIN endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Paciorek1">[48]</xref> and possibly by regulating the expression of ICR1 (this work). Thus, ICR1 may be part of an auxin modulated positive feedback loop that facilitates auxin efflux. ICR1 expression in the root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6</xref>) coincides with pattern of auxin flux and with non-polar localization of PIN4 in the sites of the auxin maxima in the hypophesis, QC, and columella initials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-KleineVehn1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Friml2">[33]</xref>. In most regions of the primary root, the expression of ICR1 is limited to the stele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The expression pattern changes in two regions: (1) lateral root founder cells and initials and (2) around the root tip where expression is detected in epidermis, cortex, endodermis, and the root cap. The stable auxin maximum and local gradient at the root tip are associated with expression of specific genes. The expression level of some of these genes has been shown to correlate with auxin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Xu1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Sena1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Galinha1">[49]</xref>. It is likely that the repression of ICR1 expression in the QC and the meristematic stem cells is associated with one or some of these auxin maximum-specific genes. The quick induction of <italic>ICR1</italic> expression by auxin and the strong expression of <italic>pICR1</italic>-driven GFP-ICR1 by local application of auxin further suggest that suppression of ICR1 expression at the site of auxin maxima is indirectly regulated by auxin. Interestingly, mutants in the <italic>HALTEDROOT</italic> (<italic>HLR</italic>) gene, which encodes an RPT2a 26S proteasome subunit, share a similar phenotype with <italic>icr1</italic>. Like <italic>icr1</italic>, the root meristem of <italic>hlr</italic> collapses, the QC is lost, and expression pattern of several markers including <italic>SCR</italic> and <italic>SHR</italic> is altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Ueda1">[50]</xref>. In contrast to <italic>icr1</italic>, however, additional tiers of columella cells, compared to WT, were observed in 6-d-old <italic>hlr</italic> seedling, while in <italic>icr1</italic> plants, of similar age, the specification of the columella is significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g002">Figure 2</xref>). No differences in the <italic>icr1</italic> expression pattern were observed when <italic>pICR1</italic>≫<italic>GFP-ICR1</italic> plants were treated with a proteasome inhibitor (unpublished data). Thus, it is currently unclear whether the proteasome is involved in regulation of ICR1 expression.</p>
<p>Based on computational modeling, it has been proposed that the PIN-mediated auxin fluxes in the root are sufficient for maintaining a stable auxin maximum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Grieneisen1">[51]</xref>. Results of this work (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000282-g006">Figure 6</xref>) implicate the repression of ICR1 expression and possibly also regulation of its subcellular localization in the formation of the stable auxin maximum. The stable auxin maximum may facilitate a positive feedback loop that maintains the repression of ICR1 expression and its distribution in the immediate proximal and subtending cells.</p>
<p>Constitutive active ROP-induced cell deformation has been associated with reorganization of actin and MT cytoskeleton, as well as compromised vesicle uptake at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yalovsky1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Yang1">[2]</xref>. Ectopic expression of ICR1 induced deformation of leaf epidermis pavement cells and root hairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref> as well as pollen tubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Li2">[13]</xref>, resembling the effect of activated ROP mutants. Thus, ICR1 may act as a scaffold that facilitates compartmentalization of ROPs and other proteins such as the exocyst complex at specific membrane domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>. This also suggests that ICR1 could be involved in regulation of various processes.</p>
<p>ROPs orchestrate cell polarization by regulating cytoskeleton organization through proteins that include RIC1 (ROP Interacting CRIB containing 1), RIC3 and RIC4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Fu1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Gu1">[53]</xref>, ADF/Cofilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Chen1">[54]</xref>, and the WAVE and Arp2/3 complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Basu1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Uhrig1">[56]</xref>. As shown in this work and based on previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000282-Lavy3">[12]</xref>, the ROP-ICR1-associated cell polarization machinery is required for plasma membrane recruitment and polar localization of PIN proteins, consequently directing auxin transport.</p>
