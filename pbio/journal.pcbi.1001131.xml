                <p>This paper proposes a new method to identify communities in generally weighted
                    complex networks and apply it to phylogenetic analysis. In this case, weights
                    correspond to the similarity indexes among protein sequences, which can be used
                    for network construction so that the network structure can be analyzed to
                    recover phylogenetically useful information from its properties. The analyses
                    discussed here are mainly based on the modular character of protein similarity
                    networks, explored through the Newman-Girvan algorithm, with the help of the
                    neighborhood matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The most relevant
                    networks are found when the network topology changes abruptly revealing distinct
                    modules related to the sets of organisms to which the proteins belong. Sound
                    biological information can be retrieved by the computational routines used in
                    the network approach, without using biological assumptions other than those
                    incorporated by BLAST. Usually, all the main bacterial phyla and, in some cases,
                    also some bacterial classes corresponded totally (100%) or to a great
                    extent (&gt;70%) to the modules. We checked for internal consistency in
                    the obtained results, and we scored close to 84% of matches for community
                    pertinence when comparisons between the results were performed. To illustrate
                    how to use the network-based method, we employed data for enzymes involved in
                    the chitin metabolic pathway that are present in more than 100 organisms from an
                    original data set containing 1,695 organisms, downloaded from GenBank on May 19,
                    2007. A preliminary comparison between the outcomes of the network-based method
                    and the results of methods based on Bayesian, distance, likelihood, and
                    parsimony criteria suggests that the former is as reliable as these commonly
                    used methods. We conclude that the network-based method can be used as a
                    powerful tool for retrieving modularity information from weighted networks,
                    which is useful for phylogenetic analysis.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Complex weighted networks have been applied to uncover organizing principles of
                    complex biological, technological, and social systems. We propose herein a new
                    method to identify communities in such structures and apply it to phylogenetic
                    analysis. Recent studies using this theory in genomics and proteomics
                    contributed to the understanding of the structure and dynamics of cellular
                    complex interaction webs. Three main distinct molecular networks have been
                    investigated based on transcriptional and metabolic activity, and on protein
                    interaction. Here we consider the evolutionary relationship between proteins
                    throughout phylogeny, employing the complex network approach to perform a
                    comparative study of the enzymes related to the chitin metabolic pathway. We
                    show how the similarity index of protein sequences can be used for network
                    construction, and how the underlying structure is analyzed by the computational
                    routines of our method to recover useful and sound information for phylogenetic
                    studies. By focusing on the modular character of protein similarity networks, we
                    were successful in matching the identified networks modules to main bacterial
                    phyla, and even some bacterial classes. The network-based method reported here
                    can be used as a new powerful tool for identifying communities in complex
                    networks, retrieving useful information for phylogenetic studies.</p>

            <p>In networks, module or community structure plays a central role when it comes to
                understand network topology and dynamics. To advance solutions to many problems
                related to biological networks, we need to identify, thus, the community structure
                in datasets. Consequently, the introduction of new efficient and robust methods that
                are able to perform such a task in a variety of situations is of utmost
                importance.</p>
            <p>We are interested, here, in giving a contribution to the complex issue of
                phylogenetic inference by appealing to the complex network approach, which has been
                successfully applied to uncover organizing principles that govern the constitution
                and evolution of various complex biological, technological, and social systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Silva1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Amaral1">[4]</xref>. Recent studies
                using complex network approaches in the fields of both genomics and proteomics have
                contributed to a better knowledge of the structure and dynamics of the complex webs
                of interactions of a living cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Milo1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-CastroeSilva1">[12]</xref>. Several kinds of
                biologically relevant networks have been studied in the last years, mainly protein
                interaction, transcriptional, and metabolic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Silva1">[1]</xref>. In this study, we work with
                another set of relationships, namely, the evolutionary relationships between
                proteins throughout phylogeny, and introduce a new method to identify communities in
                generally weighted complex networks.</p>
            <p>The reliability and overall applicability of a new proposed method is the subject of
                a long term research program, which necessarily starts with a clear formulation of
                the key steps of the method, alongside with the analysis of a non trivial problem
                that has been analyzed before, such as, for instance, phylogenetic inference.</p>
            <p>There are four families of methods of phylogenetic analysis that are commonly used,
                namely: maximum parsimony, distance, maximum likelihood, and Bayesian <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Felsenstein1">[13]</xref>. Promising
                prospects of developing new trustful methods to infer phylogenetic relationships are
                offered by the possibility of using primary information about protein sequences
                contained in open access databases and the derived protein similarity measures. We
                introduce here a methodology to identify community structure in such primary data
                sets, based on the concept of distance between complex networks, and apply it to the
                specific problem of retrieving useful information that can be used to infer
                phylogenetic relationships. In this process, we avoid as much as possible the use of
                any qualitative pre-existing biological information. We show here that a method
                based on complex network theory can recover information about the evolutionary
                relationships between organisms, as expressed in the similarities and differences
                between their protein or DNA sequences.</p>
            <p>Depending on the way the nodes are connected within a network, it may be possible to
                identify one or more subsets of nodes such that the average number of connections
                among nodes within any of these subsets is distinctly larger than the average number
                of connections with nodes outside this subset. The identification of such subsets
                (usually called communities, modules, components, clusters, etc.), a key issue that
                has not been completely solved within complex network theory, is of utmost
                importance for biological applications. Indeed, modular properties are found to be
                very common features in any branch or level of biological network
                investigations.</p>
            <p>Over the past years, the amount of research in identifying communities in networks is
                really astonishing. There are several review articles discussing this subject, based
                on mathematical and computational approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Fortunato1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Schaeffer1">[16]</xref>. Furthermore, comparative
                analyses of the available methods are also found in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Danon1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Kovcs1">[18]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Computationally efficient approaches based on similarity matrices and cluster
                analyses for the exploration of protein databases with little or no prior knowledge
                are important tools for phylogenetic analysis. A number of approaches are currently
                being used to infer evolutionary relationships between proteins. For instance, the
                Markov Cluster (MCL) Algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-VanDongen1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-VanDongen2">[20]</xref> is an unsupervised cluster algorithm that has been
                applied to the analysis of graphs in several different domains, mostly in
                bioinformatics. The MCL Algorithm was used, for instance, for the detection of
                protein families <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Enright1">[21]</xref>, a major research goal in structural and functional
                genomics. MCL was also extended to the identification of orthologous groups by
                OrthoMCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Li1">[22]</xref>. It was
                also used to develop phylogenomic analyses of specific taxa, such as the Ascomycota
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Robbertse1">[23]</xref>. A
                hybrid approach to sequence-based clustering of proteins was developed, combining
                Markov with single-linkage clustering, with the intention of obtaining both
                specificity (as allowed by MCL) and the preservation of topological information as a
                function of threshold information about protein families (as in single-linkage
                clustering) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Harlow1">[24]</xref>.
                Another recently developed method for automatic and unsupervised detection of
                protein families and genome annotation is the Global Super Paramagnetic Clustering
                (SPC) Algorithm, which showed higher accuracy, specificity and sensitivity of
                clustering than MCL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Tetko1">[25]</xref>. Finally, Kóvacs et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Kovcs1">[18]</xref> introduced ModuLand, an
                integrative network module determination method family, which can determine
                overlapping network modules as hills of an influence function-based, centrality-type
                community landscape. The new method to identify communities in generally weighted
                complex networks proposed here is quite powerful and innovative in the use of a
                distance <italic>δ</italic> (to be defined in the next section) to determine an
                optimal value of the threshold on similarity.</p>
            <p>Two main tasks are crucial to derive an objective, mathematically based community
                identification: First, to define a measure suitable to distinguish non-modular from
                modular character, and, second, to identify the communities, when this is the case.
                The distance <italic>δ</italic> used herein is able to help the identification
                of the modular character in a very clear way. Therefore, our major contribution,
                based on complex network theory, is to use this measure together with the protein
                similarity matrix (in fact, the weight matrix of any weighted network) to identify
                the minimal set of links that are included in the network in order to preserve the
                relevant biological information necessary to unveil the modular character within the
                data set at stake.</p>
            <p>Once such optimally chosen network is found, any proposed community detection method
                may be used to retrieve the existing communities. We use here the Newman Girvan
                algorithm (NGA) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Newman1">[26]</xref>, which, although time consuming, also allows to identify
                the sequence of branching events, leading to useful and well defined
                dendrograms.</p>
            <p>Since several organic biomolecules are required for basic metabolic purposes, they
                can be found in large number of organisms, making it possible to use techniques
                derived from complex network theory to explore information that is useful for
                phylogenetic inferences. Enzymes that are involved in the synthesis of ubiquitous
                and metabolically important molecules seem particularly promising for such complex
                network approach. They are likely to be found in many distinct organisms and, if
                they are involved in ancient metabolic pathways, they can be found in the three life
                domains, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya. Even though distinct organisms use their
                own enzyme variants to produce a given molecule, these variants will tend to look
                more similar in their amino acid sequences the closer the species are in
                phylogenetic terms. Thus, species can be gathered in phylogenetically meaningful
                groups by analyzing the degree of similarity of enzymes involved in some basic
                metabolic pathway. We show here how the similarity of the amino acid sequences of
                enzymes derived from completely sequenced genomes of extant organisms can be used
                for network construction and, subsequently, the network structure can be analyzed so
                as to recover phylogenetically useful information from its properties and
                statistics.</p>
            <p>The methods described here can be used for any set of proteins involved in basic
                metabolic pathways. We will work in this paper with data from enzymes involved in
                chitin synthesis. Chitin, the β-1,4-linked linear homopolymer of
                N-acetylglucosamine, is a structural endogenous carbohydrate, which is a major
                component of fungal cell walls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Bowmann1">[27]</xref>, cephalopod beaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Hanlon1">[28]</xref>, integuments of larvae and
                young nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Ax1">[29]</xref>,
                and arthropod exoskeletons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Merzendorfer1">[30]</xref>. Chitin is the second most abundant polysaccharide in
                nature after cellulose. It occurs only in eukaryotic organisms of the Metazoa-Fungal
                clade. This suggests that chitin may have evolved before the crown eukaryotic
                radiation.</p>
            <p>Chitin is synthesized by a sequence of six successive reactions: (i) conversion of
                Glu-6P into Fru-6-P by phosphoglucoisomerases (E.C. 5.3.1.9); (ii) conversion of
                Fru-6-P into GlcN-6-P by glucosaminephosphate isomerases (E.C. 2.6.1.16); (iii)
                acetylation of GlcN-6-P generating GlcNAc-6-P by phosphoglucosamine acetylases (E.C.
                2.3.1.4), (iv) interconversion of GlcNAc-6-P into GlcNAc-1-P by acetylglucosamine
                phosphomutases (E.C. 5.4.2.3) or, alternatively, by acetylglucosamine phosphate
                deacetylases (E.C. 3.5.1.25); (v) uridilation of GlcNAc-1-P by UDP-acetylglucosamine
                pyrophosphorylases (E.C. 2.7.7.23); and (vi) conversion of UDP-GlcNAc into chitin by
                chitin synthases (E.C. 2.1.4.16) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Mio1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Lagorce1">[32]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Chitin degradation is achieved by chitinases (E.C. 3.2.1.14), either by
                exochitinases, which convert chitin into N-acetylglucosamine residues, or by
                endochitinases, which convert chitin into chitobiose, which, in turn, may be
                converted into N-acetylglucosamine residues by hexoaminidases (E.C. 3.2.1.52).
                N-acetylglucosamine residues may be activated by acetylglucosamine kinases (E.C.
                2.7.1.59) to form N-acetylglucosamine-6-P, restoring the precursor of the short
                feedback cycle of chitin metabolism. Chitin may also be deacetylated by chitin
                deacetylases (E.C. 3.5.1.41), converted into chitosan, which is degraded by
                chitosanases (E.C. 3.2.1.132) into glucosaminide, which, when converted into
                glucosamine, may be activated by hexokinase type IV glucokinases (E.C. 2.7.7.1),
                which restore the precursor of N-acetylglucosamine-6-P, Glucosamine-6-P, configuring
                a longer feedback cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Pirovani1">[33]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Even though chitin itself is found only in the Metazoa-Fungal clade, we can find
                proteins which are homologous to enzymes involved in chitin synthesis in other
                clades, including bacterial and archaeobacterial ones. Therefore, the chitin
                metabolic pathway can be used to recover phylogenetically relevant information in
                the three life domains.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we use the complex network approach as a theoretical and
                methodological tool to perform a comparative study of the enzymes related to the
                chitin metabolic pathway in extant organisms of the three life domains, Archaea,
                Bacteria, and Eukarya. We will show how the information derived from the network
                structure and statistics can be used to uncover phylogenetically useful modules,
                retrieving sound biological information by computational routines, without using
                biological assumptions other than those incorporated by BLAST.</p>

                <p>Our primary database consists of protein sequences of completely sequenced
                    genomes of extant organisms that can be freely accessed at the GenBank - NCBI
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Benson1">[34]</xref>

                    essential information to the identification of any given organism, as well as to
                    comparative studies on evolutionary paths followed by different organisms. Our
                    data set, downloaded from GenBank at May 19th, 2007, contains information from
                    1695 organisms. We used completely sequenced genomes to assure that all putative
                    proteins and their isoforms, if any, could be adequately retrieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-GesNeto1">[35]</xref>.</p>
                <p>We developed automatic procedures to filter the protein related data in the
                    complete downloaded database. In the first step of the process, we extracted
                    from the primary database the relevant information for the current work, namely,
                    the molecular source of protein sequences, their structural and functional
                    information, and the taxonomic classification of the organisms in which the
                    proteins are found. Next, we scrutinized the secondary database obtained in this
                    manner, in order to identify which proteins (i.e., the organism-specific protein
                    variants that play the same biological function) are present in a large number
                    of organisms. One way to optimize this search, in the sense of finding many
                    organisms with the same protein, is to pre-select a basic biomolecule, such as
                    chitin, and look for the enzymes involved in its metabolism. Indeed, our search
                    revealed that some of the proteins with the largest number of entries in the
                    database are enzymes that take part in the metabolic synthesis or degradation of
                    chitin. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001131-t001">Table 1</xref>, we

                    number of bacterial records in the database reflects the fact that there are

                <title>Network construction</title>
                <p>Before defining the networks used in this study, let us recall that the most used
                    characterization of network properties is based on a series of measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Albert1">[38]</xref>, including:
                    the number of nodes, <italic>N</italic>; the shortest path
                        <italic>d(i,j)</italic> between nodes <italic>i</italic> and
                        <italic>j</italic>; the average minimal distance
                    〈<italic>d</italic>〉 taken over all pairs of nodes; the network
                    diameter <italic>D</italic>, defined by the largest value of
                        <italic>d(i,j)</italic>; the node clustering coefficient
                            <italic>c<sub>i</sub></italic>, which measures how strongly connected
                    the neighbors of node <italic>i</italic> are; the network clustering coefficient
                        <italic>C</italic>, corresponding to the average value over the
                            <italic>c<sub>i</sub></italic>; the node degree,
                        <italic>k<sub>i</sub></italic>, defined by the number of links of a node
                        <italic>i</italic> and its average value over all nodes
                        〈<italic>k</italic>〉; the functional relationships
                        <italic>p(k)</italic>, the probability distribution of nodes with
                        <italic>k</italic> links, and <italic>C(k)</italic>, the distribution of
                    node clustering coefficients with respect to the node degree
                    <italic>k</italic>.</p>
                <p>In general, the key step in the construction of a system interaction network is
                    to define a meaningful criterion to place an edge between two nodes, which
                    should be able to identify the presence and strength of the interaction between
                    them. In the current study, the concept of interaction corresponds to protein
                    similarity, which is related, in turn, to the evolutionary relationships between
                    the organisms possessing the proteins at stake <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-GesNeto1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, the similarity
                    matrix <italic>S</italic> constitutes the starting point to obtain the protein
                    similarity networks (PSN).</p>
                <p>In a PSN, the nodes correspond to the protein sequences, and the presence of
                    edges between two nodes depends on how similar the related proteins are. Each
                    network can be defined by its adjacency matrix (AM) <italic>M</italic>, for
                    which any matrix element <italic>m<sub>i,j</sub></italic> is set to 1, if the
                    nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are connected, or to 0, if not.
                    Note that it is straightforward to switch from the AM network description to the
                    list description, in which the network is characterized by a list of L pairs of
                    nodes connected by a link. To be more precise, let us define a network family
                    depending on a threshold value <italic>σ</italic>, where the elements of its
                    adjacency matrix <italic>M(σ)</italic> satisfy:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>This strategy makes it possible to replace one single weighted network defined in
                    terms of <italic>S</italic> by a family of unweighted networks, which can be
                    analyzed by a large number of recently developed methods and measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Albert1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Costa1">[41]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Depending on the value of <italic>σ</italic>, the interaction network may be
                    completely distinct: for small values of <italic>σ</italic> it is highly
                    connected, while for large values of <italic>σ</italic> it is poorly
                    connected. As we will show in the next section, we have performed a detailed
                    investigation of the dependence of the network properties on the value of
                        <italic>σ</italic>. We are able to establish a well defined criterion
                    for optimal choices of <italic>σ</italic>, in the sense that the networks
                    generated within a relatively narrow range of values of <italic>σ</italic>
                    display a modular pattern that can be interpreted in phylogenetic terms, as
                    addressed in the section of results and discussion of the present paper.</p>
                <p>To fine tune the value of <italic>σ</italic> that makes it possible to unveil
                    the modular character, we use the concept of higher order neighborhoods of a
                    node <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Andrade1">[42]</xref>.
                    Two nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are neighbors of order
                        <italic>ℓ</italic> when the shortest path between them consists of
                        <italic>ℓ</italic> edges. In this manner, it is possible to define a
                        <italic>ℓ</italic>-th order neighborhood of a given network represented
                    by <italic>M</italic> if we connect all pairs of nodes that are
                        <italic>ℓ</italic> steps apart. Such networks can be defined in terms of
                        <italic>M(ℓ)</italic>, the corresponding AM of order
                        <italic>ℓ</italic>. The elements of this matrix are defined
                            as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>The knowledge of the set <italic>{M(ℓ)}</italic>, where
                        <italic>ℓ∈[1,D]</italic>, allows us to define the
                    following neighborhood matrix<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula></p>

                    path between the nodes <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. If the network
                    is assembled by two or more disjoint clusters, the distance
                        <italic>d(i,j)</italic> between two nodes, say <italic>i</italic> and
                        <italic>j</italic>, belonging to two distinct clusters is ill-defined. In
                    order to sidestep this indeterminacy and continues operating with
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><italic><sub>i,j</sub></italic> = 0
                    whenever this occurs. The importance of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for a deeper
                    analysis of the neighborhood structure of a network has been indicated in a
                    series of previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Andrade2">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Andrade4">[45]</xref>. The utility of
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ranges from providing an insightful visualization of the
                    neighborhood structure by means of color plots to defining a distance between
                    pairs of networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Andrade4">[45]</xref>. This last measure can be used to identify how
                    similar two networks are. For this purpose we define the distance
                        <italic>δ(α,β)</italic> between any two networks with the same
                    number of nodes (<italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic>)
                            by:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>D(α)</italic>
                    represents the diameter of the network <italic>α</italic>.</p>
                <p>In a general comparison process, the obtained value of
                        <italic>δ(α,β)</italic> depends on the adopted node enumeration
                    for both networks, although the network topology does not depend on it.
                    Therefore, for the purpose of providing a useful measure, the definition (4) can
                    be made more precise by restricting the value of
                        <italic>δ(α,β)</italic> to the minimal value assumed when all
                    possible node enumerations are taken into account (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Andrade4">[45]</xref>). In the current study,
                        <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic> are two distinct protein
                    networks, generated by one same dataset, but where the edges are inserted
                    according to Eq. (1) when we consider
                            <italic>α = σ<sub>1</sub> = σ</italic>
                    and
                        <italic>β = σ<sub>2</sub> = σ+Δσ</italic>.
                    In this definition, we suppose that <italic>σ<sub>1</sub></italic> and
                            <italic>σ<sub>2</sub></italic> are two nearby values of
                        <italic>σ</italic>. Since the nodes represent the same proteins, it is
                    not necessary to consider different enumerations, but just to use the same
                    enumeration to generate both networks. If we plot
                        <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>σ,σ+</italic>Δ<italic>σ</italic>)
                    as function of <italic>σ</italic>, it turns out that the graph is
                    characterized by the presence of sharp peaks. Such series of consecutive values
                    of
                        <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>σ,σ+</italic>Δ<italic>σ</italic>)
                    marks the points where the obtained networks are about to suffer important
                    topological changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Andrade2">[43]</xref>, i.e., to be split into separate communities.</p>
                <p>The value of <italic>σ</italic> plays a key role in the network definition,
                    which is similar to the probability <italic>p</italic> to establish an edge in a
                    random Erdös-Rényi network. By varying the value of
                        <italic>p</italic>, the network changes to an assembly of disconnected edges
                    at <italic>p = 0</italic> to a complete graph when
                        <italic>p = </italic>1. The most interesting situation,
                    however, occurs in the neighborhood of one critical value
                        <italic>p<sub>cr</sub></italic>≈1<italic>/N</italic>, which is related to
                    the emergence of a giant cluster that contains the overwhelming majority of
                    nodes.</p>

                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Newman1">[26]</xref>. As a
                    result, it is possible to obtain a network dendrogram where the number of
                    branches increases with the number <italic>r</italic> of eliminated links. In
                    this way, the dendrogram has one single branch when
                        <italic>r = 0</italic> – in the case of a
                    connected network – and <italic>N</italic> single-node communities when
                        <italic>r = L</italic>. Each value of
                        <italic>r</italic> informs the set of nodes that are still connected in a
                    given cluster. Since this is a time consuming program, faster tracks have been
                    proposed to analyze very large networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Albert1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Costa1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Newman3">[46]</xref>. In the current case,
                    however, we are able to work with this method, given that our networks are not
                    too large.</p>
                <p>In our analyses, we used the NGA to identify existing communities for any value
                    of <italic>σ</italic>. As the detected communities may be quite distinct
                    from one value of <italic>σ</italic> to another, the NGA results corroborate
                    our claim that the identification of the optimal value of <italic>σ</italic>
                    using the distance <italic>δ</italic> is the crucial step of the whole
                    procedure.</p>
                <p>To reveal the modular structure of the network, NGA requires a node
                    re-enumeration, a step that is also included in our procedure. Therefore, it is
                    possible to use the re-enumerated form of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to visualize the
                    modularity of the protein similarity networks with color plots. The modularity
                    structure becomes quite clear when we draw color plots for the elements of
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> using the same node labeling obtained at the final step
                    of the dendrogram evaluation.</p>
                <p>We want to comment further that the concept of distance
                        <italic>δ(α,β)</italic> can also be used to follow the process
                    of link elimination within NGA. In this particular case, <italic>α</italic>
                    and <italic>β</italic> identify two networks characterized by having
                        <italic>m</italic> and <italic>m+1</italic> eliminated links within NGA
                    (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Newman1">[26]</xref>). A
                    graph of <italic>δ(m,m+1)</italic> as a function of <italic>m</italic>
                    indicates, by high peaks, those events of link eliminations that correspond to
                    branching points in the dendrogram. As it was shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Andrade4">[45]</xref>, the distance
                        <italic>δ(m,m+1)</italic> is able to indicate the branching points
                    in a much clearer way when compared to, e.g., the modularity function
                        <italic>Q</italic> introduced by Newman and Girvan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Newman1">[26]</xref>.</p>
                <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001131-t001">Table 1</xref>, we
                    constructed networks for five enzymes of the chitin metabolic pathway, which
                    provided, in turn, different classifications for the organisms included in the
                    database. In order to quantitatively assess the possible differences between the
                    classification provided by the networks based on different enzymes, say
                        <italic>φ</italic> and <italic>ψ</italic>, we evaluated a
                    congruence index
                        <italic>G</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>,<italic>ψ</italic>)
                    according to the following prescription: i) we count the number
                        <italic>R(φ,ψ)</italic> of common organisms that are present
                    simultaneously in both networks; ii) we look for the correspondence between the
                    different communities from <italic>φ</italic> and <italic>ψ</italic>
                    that maximizes the number of matching organisms
                        <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>,<italic>ψ</italic>), i.e.,
                    organisms that are placed in the same communities in the two networks. In doing
                    this, we must observe that, if the number of communities in
                        <italic>φ</italic> and <italic>ψ</italic> are different, it is
                    necessary to make a correspondence of two or more communities of network
                        <italic>φ</italic> to the same community in
                        network<italic>ψ</italic>. The value
                        <italic>G</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>,<italic>ψ</italic>) is
                    defined as the ratio

            <p>Here, we present and discuss results concerning the modular structure of protein
                similarity networks provided by our method that are useful for phylogenetic
                inferences. To be concise, we provide a detailed discussion of the results obtained
                for two proteins in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001131-t001">Table 1:</xref>
                UDP-acetylglucosamine pyrophosphorylase (to which we will refer below as UDP) and
                acetylglucosamine phosphate deacetylase (Acetyl). Then, we will provide a
                comparative analysis of the results for the networks of all the five proteins
                investigated in this study, in order to provide evidence for the classification

                <title>Community detection</title>
                <p>Let us now illustrate how the behavior of
                        <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>σ,σ+</italic>Δ<italic>σ</italic>)
                    provides a precise way of characterizing the dependence of the networks on
                        <italic>σ</italic> (step (E) in the summary of the methodology presented
                    in the previous section). This behavior is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g001">Figure 1a</xref> for the Acetyl network. The results
                    were obtained by making the values of <italic>σ</italic> differ in
                        <italic>Δσ</italic> = 1%. The graph
                    shows three well defined maxima of
                        <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>σ,σ+</italic>Δ<italic>σ</italic>)
                    for <italic>σ</italic> in the interval [30%,50%],
                    the largest of which occur at
                            <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> = 42%.
                    These results should be interpreted as follows: if
                        <italic>σ = 0</italic>, the network consists of a
                    completely connected single cluster. By increasing the value of
                        <italic>σ</italic>, we restrict the number of bonds in the network, so
                    that 〈<italic>d</italic>〉 increases together with the values of the
                    matrix elements <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since the
                    distance
                        <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>σ,σ+</italic>Δ<italic>σ</italic>)
                    makes a comparison of the influence of changing <italic>σ</italic> on
                        <italic>d(i,j)</italic>, a sharp increase in its value indicates that the
                    bond removal is leading to large changes in the values of some of
                        <italic>d(i,j)</italic>. This suggests also that important network
                    topological changes are about to occur. The most drastic events, expressed by
                    the first sharp peaks, are usually related to the disassembling of one large set
                    of nodes (module) from the original, completely connected cluster. This network,
                    which we will call the critical network, is selected to be analyzed. Later on,
                    smaller peaks indicate the splitting of larger modules into smaller ones. This
                    occurs when the last bonds linking these modules to the network are removed. The
                    very high peak at
                        <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> = 42%
                    indicates that a large topological change occurred at this particular value.</p>

                    is corroborated by other network measures. Let us consider how
                            <italic>N<sub>c</sub></italic>, the size of the largest connected
                    component in the network, depends on <italic>σ</italic>. This is illustrated
                    in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g002">Figures 2a and 2b</xref> for the
                    Acetyl and UDP networks, respectively (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-GesNeto1">[35]</xref>). In both figures we
                    notice a rapid decrease of <italic>N<sub>c</sub></italic> in a relatively narrow
                    interval of values of <italic>σ</italic>. This effect is related to the
                    detachment of large groups of nodes from the main cluster as the restriction on
                    establishing links between nodes is increased. As anticipated in the previous
                    section, the curves follow the same qualitative features as those for the

                <p>Hereafter, we will consider the dendrograms, the neighborhood matrices, and the
                    usual representation of the network associated with the proteins listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001131-t001">Table 1</xref> for the values of
                        <italic>σ</italic> such that the distance shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g001">Figures 1a and 1b</xref> assumes a maximum value.
                    Concerning UDP, the figures are not shown, since they were already presented in
                    a previous paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-GesNeto1">[35]</xref>, in which the criterion for setting up the range of
                        <italic>σ</italic> that reveals the modular structure of network was
                    based on the region of transition associated with <italic>C</italic> and
                        〈<italic>d</italic>〉. It is important to call the attention to the
                    fact that the criterion based on the distance
                        <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>σ,σ+</italic>Δ<italic>σ</italic>)
                    reveals in a much more precise way, in comparison to <italic>C</italic> and
                        〈<italic>d</italic>〉, the value of <italic>σ</italic> in which
                    the modular structure is observed.</p>
                <p>The influence of <italic>σ</italic> on the network structure can be better
                    appreciated by comparing two dendrograms in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g003">Figure 3</xref> for the Acetyl networks at
                        <italic>σ</italic> = 30% and
                            <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> = 42%.
                    In the first situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g003">Figure
                        3a</xref>), the very large number of edges does not allow one to perceive
                    the system modular structure. Accordingly, the NGA based on
                            <italic>b<sub>ij</sub></italic> is characterized by a progressive
                    detachment of small groups of nodes from the original giant cluster. In turn,
                    the dendrogram for
                        <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g003">Figure 3b</xref>) reveals a lot of
                    structure. It starts, at <italic>r</italic> = 0, with some
                    already isolated clusters, corresponding to the modules that were detached at
                            <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic>,
                        <italic>σ</italic> = 45%, and
                        <italic>σ</italic> = 48%. Then, we note the
                    separation of a large cluster at a low value of <italic>r</italic>, which is
                    caused by the elimination of the few bonds with very large betweenness degree
                    connecting nodes of the different modules. Such cluster detachment is exactly
                    the same one produced by increasing the value of <italic>σ</italic> to
                    42%, causing the absolute
                        <italic>δ</italic>(<italic>σ,σ+</italic>Δ<italic>σ</italic>)
                    maximum in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g002">Figure 2a</xref>. The
                    subsequent elimination of bonds leads to further branching in the dendrogram,
                    some of which can be related to local maxima in the
                            <italic>σ&gt;σ<sub>max</sub></italic> region of the

                <p>Dendrograms evaluated at intermediate <italic>σ</italic> values, e.g.,

                    clearly identify network modules corresponding to those clusters detached from
                    the giant cluster by selecting <italic>σ</italic> close to this peak value
                    at <italic>σ<sub>max</sub></italic>. However, the picture that emerges for
                    those clusters that detach at larger values is still rather blurred.</p>
                <p>As anticipated in the previous section, let us put together supplementary results
                    in the dendrogram construction to display the network modular structure with the
                    help of the neighborhood matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To avoid line
                    crossings in the dendrogram, the order at which the isolated nodes are drawn for
                    the largest value of <italic>r</italic> does not necessarily follow the original
                    numbering. This ordering defines a new node labeling which leaves untouched the
                    network topology. If we now use a color code to represent
                            <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1001131.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with relabeled nodes, the modularity structure becomes
                    quite clear, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g004">Figure
                        4</xref>. Running from blue (immediate neighbors) to red (farthest apart
                    nodes), the colors clearly indicate how the nodes are grouped into modules, as
                    well as the existence of sub-clusters within the modules and the average
                    distance between nodes in distinct modules. Note that we use gray to indicate
                    the value <italic>d(i,j)</italic> = 0, so that the
                    communities that have been detached from the main cluster at lower values of
                        <italic>σ</italic> appear isolated from one another in the color
                    diagram. We identify 11 modules (C1–C11), the biological significance of
                    which will be discussed below. We note also a number of isolated nodes or small
                    sub-graphs that do not constitute a module on its own. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows the color plot for the
                    neighborhood structure for the Acetyl network at
                            <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic>. It is
                    relatively easy to infer the structure of the dendrograms from the position of
                    the modules. It is important to stress that both graphs not only show the
                    modular structure of the network, but also clearly depict how the retrieved
                    communities are related to each other.</p>

                <p>This discussion shows that the proposed method allows us to find the most
                    relevant networks, namely those at critical values of
                        <italic>σ<sub>cr</sub></italic>. These values, where the network
                    topology changes abruptly, correspond to optimal choices between inter-community
                    edge elimination (noise effect) and intra-modules bond preservation (valuable
                    information). They allow us to identify distinct communities, which can be
                    related, then, to the sets of organisms to which the proteins belong (see also
                        <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s003">Figures

We observe that
                            <italic>σ<sub>max</sub></italic> corresponds to the particular
                            <italic>σ<sub>cr</sub></italic>, where

                    reaches the largest value.</p>
                <p>We show in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001131-t002">Table 2</xref> the
                    values of <italic>σ<sub>max</sub></italic>, the number of nodes, and the
                    number of communities obtained for each of the five enzyme networks. In the case
                    of UDP, we observe the highest <italic>σ<sub>max</sub></italic> value,
                    indicating that, in the case of this protein, the disassembling of the original,
                    completely connected cluster happen at higher values of similarity. This is a
                    protein with a central role in the chitin synthesis, and, consequently, it is
                    not surprising that it shows the greatest degree of sequence conservation
                    throughout evolution, among the proteins studied in this work. This suggests
                    additional features of the method discussed here, in that there is a
                    relationship between the <italic>σ<sub>max</sub></italic> value, the degree
                    of sequence conservation of proteins (a structural feature), and their

                <title>Biological interpretation</title>
                <p>It is relevant to notice that, up to this point, all discussed results have been
                    obtained without any previous knowledge of phylogenetic classification. We only
                    constructed computer routines to proceed with the data analysis, network
                    construction, and network analysis, leading to community identification.</p>
                <p>If we now interconnect the results discussed above with taxonomic and
                    phylogenetic data, sound biological information can be promptly retrieved by
                    these computational routines, without using biological assumptions other than
                    those incorporated by BLAST in the production of its outputs.</p>
                <p>The Acetyl modules that can be identified at
                            <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001131-g004">Figure 4</xref>) correspond, in a
                    clear and rather precise manner, to bacterial phyla and/or classes (and even
                    orders, in some communities). As already discussed, we restricted our analysis
                    to those phyla due to the fact that most of the protein sequences in the
                    database were derived from this biological domain. All cyanobacterial
                    representatives formed only one and exclusive group retrieved in the module
                    C8(a). Furthermore, there are six communities [C3(a), C4(a), C5(a), C6(a),
                    C7(a), C10(a), C11(a)] that are formed exclusively by representatives of
                    one single bacterial phyla or class and, in some cases, order: community C3(a)
                    is exclusively formed by species of the same bacterial order (Mollicutes);
                    community C4(a) are all composed of representatives of Actinobacteria, high
                    G+C Gram-positive monoderm bacteria, of the same class (Actinomycetales);
                    community C5(a) exclusively includes alpha-proteobacteria of the class
                    Rhodobacterales; and community C11(a) contains only species of Firmicutes, low
                    G+C Gram-positive monoderm bacteria, belonging to the very closely related
                    orders Bacillales and Lactobacillales. Although not entirely composed of
                    representatives of the same phyla, 18 out of 20 nodes (90%) of community
                    C2(a) are from the same bacterial phyla (Proteobacteria) and 16 (80%) are
                    from the most phylogenetically related classes of beta- and gamma-proteobacteria
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Gupta1">[47]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Four modules are retrieved in the Glucosaminephosphate isomerase (gluco) network
                    at
                    <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> = 40%,
                    and, as in the case of UDP and Acetyl, most of them correspond to single
                    bacterial phyla and/or classes (and even orders): community C2(g) is exclusively
                    composed by bacterial representatives of phyla Firmicutes of only two classes:
                    Bacillales and Lactobacillales; community C4(g) is entirely formed by sequences
                    of the order Alteromonadales of the class gamma-proteobacteria; and 21 out of 23
                    sequences (91.3%) of community C3(g) are representatives of the phyla
                    Proteobacteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s005">Figures S5a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s006">S6a</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s007">S7a</xref>).</p>
                <p>A total of 9 modules occur in the Hexosaminidase (hexo) network at
                            <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> = 37%
                    and three of them, which contain the greatest number of nodes, are almost
                    exclusively formed by only one bacterial phyla or class: Community C1(h) is
                    composed of 97 nodes, of which 95 (98%) are representatives of phyla
                    Proteobacteria; community C2 is almost exclusively formed by species of the
                    class alpha-proteobacteria; and community C4(h) contains only members of the
                    most phylogenetically related classes of beta- and gamma-proteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Gupta1">[47]</xref>. The other
                    communities are all composed by few nodes corresponding to species of distinct
                    phyla (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s005">Figures
                        S5b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s006">S6b</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s007">S7b</xref>).</p>
                <p>Five modules occur in the Phosphoglucoisomerase (phospho) network at
                            <italic>σ = σ<sub>max</sub></italic> = 37%
                    and, similarly to the other enzymes of the chitin metabolic pathway, there is a
                    rather strict correspondence between these modules and bacterial phyla.
                    Community C1(p) is mainly composed by cyanobacterial representatives
                    (71%), community C2(p) is almost exclusively formed by species of
                    Firmicutes (96.4%), and the very large community C5(p), with 328 nodes,
                    is mainly represented by sequences of Proteobacteria (76%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s005">Figures
                    S5c</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s006">S6c</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001131.s007">S7c</xref>).</p>
                <p>Finally, UDP can be decomposed into 6 clearly identified modules
                    C1(u)–C6(u), as has been shown previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-GesNeto1">[35]</xref>. C1(u) is composed by 16
                    nodes, 14 (87.5%) of which are protein sequences from representatives of
                    the phylum Cyanobacteria. One of the nodes corresponds to a sequence from a
                    species of Deinococcus-Thermus, a Gram-negative diderm bacterial group of
                    extremophiles that is closely related to Cyanobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Gupta2">[48]</xref>. C2(u) contains 135 nodes
                    and, among them, 132 (97.8%) are sequences from species of both beta- and
                    gamma-proteobacteria, which are considered to be more closely related to each
                    other than to any other proteobacterial class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Gupta1">[47]</xref>. C3(u) is entirely
                    constituted by 80 sequences from Firmicutes species, of three phylogenetically
                    related orders: Bacillales, Lactobacillales, and Clostridiales. C4(u) contains
                    33 vertices, of which 31 (93.4%) are sequences from the presumed
                    monophyletic group of alpha-proteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Gupta1">[47]</xref>. C5(u) is entirely formed by
                    sequences from Actinobacteria, all from the same order: Actinomycetales.
                    Finally, C6(u) comprises only nine nodes from the putative monophyletic group of
                    epsilon-proteobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001131-Gupta1">[47]</xref>, all from the same order: Campylobacterales.</p>
                <p>Usually, all the main bacterial phyla (Actinobacteria, Cyanobacteria, Firmicutes,
                    Proteobacteria) and, in some cases, also some bacterial classes (alpha-, beta-
                    and gamma-Proteobacteria), corresponded totally (100%), or with a
                    substantial number of representatives (&gt;70%), to the modules formed as
                    a result of the complex network analysis of the proteins of the chitin metabolic
                    pathway. Even when there were few completely sequenced genomes exhibiting one of
                    the studied proteins, all the representatives of the same phyla were generally
                    grouped together in the same community.</p>
                <p>In each of the protein networks, the nodes with the highest degree numbers, or
                    hubs, occurred inside the same community. Although these hubs were not the same
                    in the five different protein networks, many of them were from the same
                    bacterial species for distinct proteins, e.g. <italic>Yersinia pestis</italic>
                    for gluco, hexo, and UDP; <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> for acetyl, hexo,
                    and UDP. In contrast to all other proteins, the hubs in the gluco network were
                    mainly archeal representatives.</p>

            <sec id="s3c">
                <title>Internal consistency and comparison with phylogenetic methods</title>
                <p>The results for a phylogenetic analysis provided by several distinct methods do
                    not necessarily agree with each other, as one can verify by a direct comparison
                    of the outputs produced by each of them. Although we will not make here a
                    detailed comparison between our method and other procedures used to recover
                    phylogenetically useful information, but limit ourselves to take into account
                    the classification obtained for the original dataset, we are in a position to
                    discuss the internal consistency of our method.</p>
                <p>The modules defined by the five different enzymes do not necessarily agree with
                    each other for two distinct reasons: first, because not all organisms possess
                    all the enzymes involved in the chitin pathway. This is already clear by the
                    different number of nodes in each of the five networks. Second, because during
                    the course of evolution some enzymes may have suffered more changes than the
                    corresponding enzyme in other organisms, so that the similarity index
                            <italic>S<sub>ij</sub></italic> between organisms <italic>i</italic> and
                        <italic>j</italic> may take distinct values for two different enzymes. Such
                    quantitative changes may alter the way the organisms are arranged into
                    communities in the corresponding networks. In particular, it may happen that
                    different networks produce distinct number of communities because different
                    enzymes may have changed to a different extent in the organisms, so that one
                    organism may belong to different communities in the networks obtained for
                    different enzymes. Since the same protein may have been independently inserted
                    more than once into the database during the process of uploading the recordings
                    available in Genbank, we have found that the number of distinct organisms in
                    each of the 5 networks is always smaller than the number of nodes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001131-t002">Table 2</xref>). We avoided, then,
                    to advance biological hypotheses before the elimination of the isoforms.</p>
                <p>The congruence of the classification provided by the distinct networks obtained
                    for the five enzymes of the chitin metabolic pathway was evaluated by means of
                    the congruence index
                        <italic>G</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>,<italic>ψ</italic>), defined
                    in the previous section as the ratio
                        <italic>Q</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>,<italic>ψ</italic>)/<italic>R</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>,<italic>ψ</italic>).
                    For instance, if we take into account the classifications provided by acetyl and
                    UDP we notice that they consist, respectively, of 176 and 327 nodes, which
                    actually correspond to 88 and 245 organisms, distributed into 12 and 7
                    communities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001131-t002">Table 2</xref>). The
                    number of common organisms and correct matches are
                        <italic>R</italic>(<italic>φ</italic>,<italic>ψ</italic>) = <italic>44</italic>
                    and

                    so that

                    association (number, organism) is available in the Supplementary Information.
                    Each of the five networks is represented by a horizontal sequence of spikes,

                    is no color correspondence between distinct network classifications. Congruence
                    can be measured by the same color criterion: if the spikes corresponding to

                <title>Conclusions</title>
                <p>This work reports a method based on complex network theory that can recover
                    information about the evolutionary relationships between organisms, as expressed
                    in the similarities and differences between their protein sequences, which is
                    useful for phylogenetic inference. The system interaction network constructed is
                    based on protein similarity as the meaningful criterion to place an edge between
                    two nodes. Each node in the network is a specific protein sequence and the
                    placement of edges depends on a threshold value <italic>σ</italic>, related
                    to the protein similarity required to such a placement.</p>
                <p>We performed a comparative study of the enzymes related to the chitin metabolic
                    pathway in completely sequenced genomes of extant organisms of the three life
                    domains, Archaea, Bacteria, and Eukarya, in order to show how the information
                    derived from the network structure and statistics can uncover phylogenetic
                    patterns. The results concerning phylogenetic classification discussed in this
                    paper are mainly based on the modular character of protein similarity networks.
                    Once the critical value of <italic>σ</italic>
                        (<italic>σ<sub>cr</sub></italic>) using the distance measure
                        <italic>δ(α,β)</italic> is found, we can choose the optimal
                    network for community detection, namely, that in which the network topology
                    changes abruptly, corresponding to optimal choices between inter-community edge
                    elimination (noise effect) and intra-modules bond preservation (valuable
                    information). Although the NGA can be used to identify communities for any value
                    of <italic>σ</italic>, it is in this optimal network that the best results
                    can be achieved with regard to the identification of distinct communities, which
                    can be related, in turn, to the sets of organisms to which the proteins
                    belong.</p>
                <p>With this method, sound biological information can be promptly retrieved by
                    computational routines, without using biological assumptions other than those
                    incorporated by BLAST. Usually, all the main bacterial phyla and, in some cases,
                    also some bacterial classes corresponded to a great extent
                    (70%–100%) to the modules obtained by means of the complex
                    network analysis of the proteins of the chitin metabolic pathway. Therefore, the
                    method reported here can be used as a powerful tool to reveal relationship
                    patterns among both organisms we have knowledge about and organisms about which
                    we do not have much information available.</p>
                <p>We provided results showing the internal consistency of the results obtained
                    through our method for the data corresponding to five different enzymes. Despite
                    the different rates of changes suffered by these enzymes during evolution, we
                    found 84% of matches for community pertinence when comparisons between
                    the results were performed. Moreover, a preliminary comparison between the
                    results obtained with the complex network approach reported here and the
                    outcomes of methods based on Bayesian, distance, likelihood, and parsimony
                    criteria suggests that the methodology reported in this paper is as reliable as
                    these commonly used methods.</p>
                <p>There are, however, some possible advantages of the complex network method when
                    compared to these other methods. One of them concerns the fact that we can
                    determine the value of <italic>σ</italic> in which the complex network
                    retrieve most of the phylogenetic information available in the data set. Second,
                    even though all these methods use substitution matrices – including ours
                    –, the complex network method is not dependent upon patterns inferred from
                    the detailed study of any organisms.</p>
                <p>The next steps in our research program will be the application of the method
                    presented here to new sets of protein sequences, a more thorough comparison of
                    the results obtained through our complex network approach with the outcome of
                    other methods employed to retrieve information from molecular data that is
                    useful for phylogenetic inference, and the application of our method to address
                    relevant research questions within different fields of biology.</p>

                    <p>Graphs of δ(p,p+Δp) as function of p for N-nodes ER networks
                        (G(N,p)), where p indicates the probability of introducing an edge between
                        any pair of nodes. For the sake of a better comparison, p is restricted to
                        the interval [0,5pc = 5/N] for any value of
                        N. The solid line indicates the average behavior (10 samples when
                        N = 256 (a), and 3 samples when
                        N = 4096 (b)), while dashed lines illustrate the
                        typical behavior of a single sample. The values of p where peaks are present
                        are much smaller than the corresponding values of σ in PSN. When
                        N = 256, the typical order of magnitude of the protein
                        networks, distinct modules of comparatively large size are individually
                        formed. The several peaks indicate the values of p at which different
                        modules merges, producing a similar landscape to that observed in the PSN
                        networks. The maximum of the averaged curve occurs at values of p&gt;pc.
                        When N increases (b), the fluctuations in the values of
                        δ(p,p+Δp) decrease and the maximum is displaced to the left,
                        becoming closer and closer to pc. The peak is much sharper, and the slope of
                        the curve in its neighborhood is much larger. This indicates that the number
                        of components of relatively large size is reduced, and that all smaller
                        clusters start to merge with the largest component in very narrow interval
                        of values of p.</p>
