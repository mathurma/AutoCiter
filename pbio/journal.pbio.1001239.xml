        <article-title>USP8 Promotes Smoothened Signaling by Preventing Its Ubiquitination and Changing Its Subcellular Localization</article-title>
      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>Hedgehog transduces signal by promoting cell surface expression of the seven-transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but the underlying mechanism remains unknown. Here we demonstrate that Smo is downregulated by ubiquitin-mediated endocytosis and degradation, and that Hh increases Smo cell surface expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. We find that Smo is ubiquitinated at multiple Lysine residues including those in its autoinhibitory domain (SAID), leading to endocytosis and degradation of Smo by both lysosome- and proteasome-dependent mechanisms. Hh inhibits Smo ubiquitination via PKA/CK1-mediated phosphorylation of SAID, leading to Smo cell surface accumulation. Inactivation of the ubiquitin activating enzyme Uba1 or perturbation of multiple components of the endocytic machinery leads to Smo accumulation and Hh pathway activation. In addition, we find that the non-visual β-arrestin Kurtz (Krz) interacts with Smo and acts in parallel with ubiquitination to downregulate Smo. Finally, we show that Smo ubiquitination is counteracted by the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY/USP8. Gain and loss of UBPY lead to reciprocal changes in Smo cell surface expression. Taken together, our results suggest that ubiquitination plays a key role in the downregulation of Smo to keep Hh pathway activity off in the absence of the ligand, and that Hh-induced phosphorylation promotes Smo cell surface accumulation by inhibiting its ubiquitination, which contributes to Hh pathway activation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The Hedgehog (Hh) family of secreted proteins governs cell growth and patterning in diverse species ranging from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to human. Hh signals across the cell surface membrane by regulating the subcellular location and conformation of a membrane protein called Smoothened (Smo). In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Smo accumulates on the cell surface in response to Hh, whereas in the absence of Hh it is internalized and degraded. The molecular mechanisms that control this intracellular trafficking and degradation of Smo were unknown, but here we show that Smo is modified by attachment of several molecules of a small protein called ubiquitin, which tags it for internalization and degradation within the cell. Hh inhibits this ubiquitination of Smo by inducing another modification, phosphorylation, of its intracellular tail by two types of protein kinase enzymes. This loss of ubiquitination and gain of phosphorylation causes the accumulation of Smo at the cell surface. What's more, we find that another protein called Kurtz interacts with Smo and acts in parallel with the ubiquitination process to promote internalization of Smo, and that the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY/USP8 counteracts ubiquitination of Smo to promote its cell surface accumulation. Our study demonstrates that reversible ubiquitination plays a key role in regulating Smo trafficking to and from the cell surface and thus it provides novel insights into the mechanism of Hh signaling from the outside to the inside of the cell.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hedgehog (Hh) signaling governs cell growth and patterning in species ranging from insects to human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Jiang1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Ingham1">[2]</xref>. Because of its pivotal role in embryonic development and adult tissue homeostasis, misregulation of Hh signaling activity has been linked to many human disorders including birth defects and cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Jiang1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Villavicencio1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Taipale1">[4]</xref>. Hh exerts its biological influence through a largely conserved signaling cascade that culminates at the activation of latent transcription factors Cubitus interruptus (Ci)/Gli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Jiang1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The core Hh reception system consists of a 12-transmembrane protein Patched (Ptc) that acts as the Hh receptor and a seven-transmembrane protein Smo that acts as the Hh signal transducer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Chen1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Stone1">[6]</xref>. Hh and Ptc reciprocally regulate the subcellular localization and active state of Smo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Denef1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Rohatgi1">[10]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Hh stimulation or loss of Ptc leads to cell surface accumulation of Smo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Denef1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhu1">[11]</xref>. Increased cell surface expression and activation of Smo are regulated by Hh-induced and PKA/CK1-mediated phosphorylation of Smo carboxyl intracellular tail (C-tail) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Apionishev1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhang1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several observations suggest that Smo cell surface expression is controlled by endocytic trafficking. A transmission electron microscopic study of <italic>Drosophila</italic> imaginal discs indicated that Smo is localized primarily in the lysosome of anterior compartment cells but is enriched on the plasma membrane of posterior compartment cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Nakano1">[15]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> salivary gland cells, blocking endocytosis promotes Smo cell surface accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhu1">[11]</xref>. Using antibody uptake assay in S2 cells, we have shown that Smo reaches the cell surface but quickly internalizes in the absence of Hh and that Hh stimulation diminishes internalized Smo with a concomitant increase in cell surface Smo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Jia1">[13]</xref>. Taken together, these observations suggest that Hh signaling may regulate Smo cell surface expression by blocking its endocytosis and/or promoting its recycling back to the cell surface after internalization.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms by which Smo endocytic trafficking and cell surface expression are regulated have remained unknown. Smo intracellular regions lack recognizable endosomal-lysosomal sorting signals such as the NPXY and dileucine-based motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Bonifacino1">[16]</xref>. However, many membrane receptors are internalized after covalently modified by ubiquitination, as has been demonstrated for receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs) and G protein coupled receptors (GPCRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-dAzzo1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Wojcikiewicz1">[18]</xref>. The close relationship between Smo and GPCRs prompted us to investigate whether Smo cell surface expression is regulated by the ubiquitin pathway. Here we provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that Smo trafficking and degradation are regulated through multi-site ubiquitination of Smo C-tail and that Hh promotes Smo cell surface expression by inhibiting its ubiquitination. We also provide evidence that the non-visual β-arrestin Kurtz (Krz) acts in parallel with Smo ubiquitination to control Smo cell surface expression, and that the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY promotes Smo cell surface expression by counteracting Smo ubiquitination.</p>

        <title>Inactivation of the Ubiquitin-Activating Enzyme Uba1 Leads to Smo Accumulation</title>
        <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing discs, Smo cell surface level is low in anterior (A) compartment cells away from the A/P boundary but is elevated in response to Hh in A-compartment cells near the A/P boundary or in posterior (P) compartment cells (Figure 1A) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Denef1">[7]</xref>. To determine whether Smo is downregulated by the ubiquitin pathway, we generated mutant clones for <italic>Uba1</italic>, which encodes the only ubiquitin-activating enzyme (E1) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Lee1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Pfleger1">[20]</xref>. We employed a temperature-sensitive allele of <italic>Uba1, Uba1<sup>H33</sup></italic>, which behaves like a null allele at the restrictive temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Lee1">[19]</xref>. <italic>Uba1<sup>H33</sup></italic> clones were induced at second instar larval stage (48–72 h AEL) by FRT/FLP mediated mitotic recombination. Larva carrying <italic>Uba1<sup>H33</sup></italic> clones were grown at permissive temperature (18°C) for 3 d and then shifted to non-permissive temperature (30°C) for 24 h before dissection for immunostaining. We found that anteriorly situated <italic>Uba1<sup>H33</sup></italic> clones accumulated high levels of Smo compared with neighboring wild type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g001">Figure 1A–B</xref>'), suggesting that Smo is downregulated via the ubiquitin pathway in the absence of Hh. Immunostaining with anti-Smo antibody before membrane permeabilization suggested that Smo was accumulated on the cell surface in anteriorly situated <italic>Uba1<sup>H33</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001239.s001">Figure S1A–A'</xref>).

In general, Smo elevation coincided well with <italic>Uba1</italic> mutant clones. Intriguingly, <italic>Uba1<sup>H33</sup></italic> mutant cells situated in the posterior compartment also exhibited slightly higher levels of Smo than neighboring wild type cells (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that a fraction of Smo still undergoes ubiquitin-mediated degradation in the presence of Hh.</p>

        <title>Uba1 Regulates Smo Ubiquitination and Cell Surface Expression</title>
        <p>To examine whether Smo is directly ubiquitinated and whether Uba1 is responsible for this activity, we carried out a cell-based ubiquitination assay (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhang2">[21]</xref>. We employed RNAi and/or pharmacological inhibitor to inactivate Uba1. S2 cells stably expressing a Myc-tagged Smo (Myc-Smo) were treated with Uba1 or control double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) in the absence or presence of PYR-41, a cell permeable E1 inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Yang1">[22]</xref>. The efficiency of Uba1 RNAi was confirmed by Western blot analysis of an exogenously expressed tagged Uba1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Myc-Smo was ubiquitinated efficiently in the absence of Uba1 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g001">Figure 1D</xref>); however, ubiquitination of Smo was attenuated by Uba1 RNAi and more significantly inhibited by PYR-41 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The incomplete blockage of Smo ubiquitination by Uba1 RNAi is likely due to partial inactivation of Uba1 by the RNAi approach. Indeed, a combined treatment with Uba1 RNAi and PYR-41 resulted in a more complete inhibition of Smo ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next applied a cell-based immunostaining assay to determine whether Uba1 regulates Smo cell surface expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Jia1">[13]</xref>. Myc-Smo expressing cells were treated with control or Uba1 dsRNA in the absence or presence of PYR-41. Cell surface and total Smo were visualized by immunostaining with an anti-SmoN antibody prior to and after cell membrane permeabilization, respectively. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, inhibition of Uba1 either by RNAi or PYR-41 increased the levels of Smo cell surface expression and combined treatment resulted in more dramatic cell surface accumulation of Smo.</p>

        <title>Perturbation of Endocytic Machinery Leads to Smo Accumulation and Hh Pathway Activation</title>
        <p>Ubiquitinated membrane proteins are internalized through the endocytic pathway and targeted to lysosome for degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-dAzzo1">[17]</xref>. We therefore examined the effect of inactivation of endocytic components on Smo accumulation in wing imaginal discs. We found that Smo was accumulated in intracellular puncta in mutant clones lacking the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of HGF-regulated tyrosine kinase substrate (Hrs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g002">Figure 2A–A</xref>'), a protein involved in sorting ubiquitinated membrane proteins into multivesicular bodies (MVBs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Lloyd1">[23]</xref>. Of note, not all <italic>hrs</italic> mutant cells exhibited Smo puncta. This could be due to perdurance of Hrs activity and/or disc folding so that Smo puncta are present at different focal planes. RNAi of other endocytic components, including Tsg101 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Moberg1">[24]</xref>, Avalanche (Avl), a <italic>Drosophila</italic> syntaxin located in early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Lu1">[25]</xref>, and Rab5, resulted in Smo accumulation in anterior compartment cells distant from the A/P boundary (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g002">Figure 2B–E</xref>), as well as Hh pathway activation as indicated by Ci accumulation and ectopic expression of a Hh target gene <italic>decapentaplegic</italic> (<italic>dpp</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g002">Figure 2B–E</xref>).

        <title>Smo Is Degraded by Both Lysosome and Proteasome</title>
        <p>Consistent with Smo being downregulated through the endocytic pathway, treating Myc-Smo expressing S2 cells with a lysosome inhibitor, NH<sub>4</sub>Cl, stabilized Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Interestingly, treating cells with a proteasome inhibitor, MG132, stabilized Smo more dramatically than treating cells with NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Furthermore, combined treatment of cells with MG132 and NH<sub>4</sub>Cl had an additive effect on Smo stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), suggesting that Smo is downregulated by both lysosome- and proteasome-dependent mechanisms. However, unlike the case of Hh stimulation or Uba1 inaction where Smo was accumulated on the cell surface, proteasome inhibition stabilized Smo in intracellular vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Double labeling with endosomal markers YFP-Rab5 (for early endosomes) or YFP-Rab7 (for late endosomes) revealed that Smo was stabilized in Rab7 positive late endosomes after MG132 treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that a fraction of internalized Smo was degraded by proteasome in the endocytic pathway before reaching to lysosome.</p>

        <title>The SAID Domain Promotes Smo Ubiquitination and Endocytosis</title>
        <p>Our previous study revealed that the Smo autoinhibitory domain (SAID) inhibits Smo activity in part by preventing Smo cell surface expression because a Smo variant lacking the SAID domain (Smo<sup>Δ661–818</sup> or Smo<sup>ΔSAID</sup>) accumulated on the cell surface in the absence of Hh stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhao1">[8]</xref>. To determine whether the SAID domain regulates Smo ubiquitination, we examined the ubiquitin status of a Myc-tagged Smo<sup>ΔSAID</sup> (Myc-Smo<sup>ΔSAID</sup>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, deleting the SAID domain diminished Smo ubiquitination, and the residual ubiquitination of Myc-Smo<sup>ΔSAID</sup> was further reduced by Hh treatment.</p>
        <p>To determine whether the SAID domain suffices to promote ubiquitination and internalization of a heterologous membrane protein, we fused it to the C-terminus of the Wingless (Wg) receptor Frizzle 2 (Fz2) to construct <underline>F</underline>z2-<underline>S</underline>AID chimeric protein (FS). When expressed in S2 cells, CFP-tagged Fz2 (CFP-Fz2) was largely accumulated on the cell surface with a small fraction internalized and colocalized with the endosomal marker Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g005">Figure 5A–A</xref>”). In contrast, CFP-FS was barely detectable on the cell surface but largely accumulated in Rab5-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g005">Figure 5B–B</xref>”), suggesting that SAID can promote endocytosis of Fz2. Introducing the phosphorylation-mimetic mutation to the SAID domain of FS (CFP-FS-SD) reduced its endocytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g005">Figure 5C–C</xref>”), whereas the chimeric protein carrying a phosphorylation deficient form of SAID (CFP-FS-SA) was internalized as efficiently as CFP-FS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g005">Figure 5D–D</xref>”). In addition, we found that adding the phosphorylation-deficient form but not the phospho-mimetic form of SAID to Fz2 promotes the ubiquitination of the corresponding chimeric protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Taken together, these observations suggest that the SAID domain suffices to promote ubiquitination and internalization of a membrane protein in a manner inhibited by phosphorylation. Combined with our earlier work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhao1">[8]</xref>, it seems that the SAID domain autonomously regulates ubiquitination independent of the C-terminal negatively charged region.</p>

        <title>Smo Is Ubiquitinated at Multiple Lysine Residues</title>
        <p>If Smo ubiquitination is responsible for its internalization and degradation, one would expect that ubiquitination-deficient Smo variants should be stabilized and accumulated on the cell surface. We therefore attempted to identify Lys residues responsible for Smo ubiquitination. In general, ubiquitin acceptor sites lack a strict consensus and target proteins can be ubiquitinated at multiple Lys residues. Smo C-tail and intracellular loops contain a total of 49 Lys residues, many of which may serve as ubiquitin acceptor sites, making it difficult to generate Smo variants devoid of ubiquitination. As deleting the SAID domain diminished Smo ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g004">Figure 4G</xref>), we speculated that this region might contain Lys residues critical for Smo ubiquitination. There are a total of 13 Lys residues between aa 661 and aa 818. We therefore constructed Smo<sup>K6R</sup> with K665, K695, K700, K702, K710, and K733 mutated to Arg; Smo<sup>K7R</sup> with K752, K753, K762, K772, K773, K782, and K801 mutated to Arg; and Smo<sup>K13R</sup> with all the 13 Lys residues mutated to Arg. Using the cell-based ubiquitination assay described above, we found that both Myc-Smo<sup>K6R</sup> and Myc-Smo<sup>K7R</sup> exhibited reduced ubiquitination compared with Myc-Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The combined mutations (K13R) resulted in a more dramatic reduction in Smo ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), suggesting that Smo is ubiquitinated at multiple Lys residues between aa 661 and aa 818. In addition, the residual ubiquitination of Myc-Smo<sup>K13R</sup> suggests that Smo is also ubiquitinated at one or more Lys residues outside the SAID domain.</p>

        <p>Using a coimmunoprecipitation assay, we found that Smo interacted with Krz through its C-tail as both Myc-Smo and Myc-Smo<sup>CT</sup> (a Smo variant only containing its C-tail) but not Myc-Smo<sup>ΔCT</sup> (a Smo variant with its C-tail deleted) pulled down a C-terminally YFP-tagged Krz (Krz-YFP) when expressed in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). Furthermore, Krz-YFP could internalize Smo<sup>SD</sup> but not Smo<sup>ΔCT</sup> in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7F</xref>), suggesting that Krz internalizes Smo by binding to its C-tail. The association between Smo and Krz was attenuated by Hh stimulation because Myc-Smo pulled down less Krz-YFP in the presence of Hh conditioned medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). In addition, Myc-Smo<sup>SD</sup> pulled down less Krz-YFP than Myc-Smo<sup>SA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), suggesting that Smo/Krz interaction is inhibited by Hh and PKA/CK1-mediated phosphorylation.</p>
        <p>The observations that overexpression of Krz promoted Smo internalization but its loss of function did not lead to Smo cell surface accumulation suggest that a redundant mechanism(s) may act in parallel with Krz to internalize Smo. For example, in the absence of Krz, ubiquitination of Smo might be sufficient to promote its internalization and degradation. On the other hand, Krz could internalize Smo when Smo ubiquitination is compromised. This may explain, at least in part, why Smo<sup>K13R</sup> is still internalized and degraded by lysosome. To test this model, we examined the effect of Krz inactivation on the cell surface expression of Myc-Smo and Myc-Smo<sup>K13R</sup> in S2 cells. Consistent with the finding that loss-of-Krz has no effect on the cell surface expression of endogenous Smo in wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), Krz RNAi did not significantly affect the cell surface expression of Myc-Smo in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). In contrast, Krz RNAi increased the cell surface expression of Myc-Smo<sup>K13R</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7G</xref>), suggesting that Smo<sup>K13R</sup> is, at least in part, internalized by Krz. Similarly, Krz RNAi enhanced the cell surface accumulation of Myc-Smo induced by Uba1 RNAi or PYR41 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001239.s003">Figure S3</xref>), suggesting that Krz acts in parallel with ubiquitination to internalize Smo.

The effect of UBPY RNAi on Smo ubiquitination was confirmed by an independent dsRNA for UBPY (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). We also found that inactivation of UBPY by RNAi increased Smo ubiquitination in the presence of Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), suggesting that UBPY counteracts Smo ubiquitination in both Hh signaling “off” and “on” states. Consistent with UBPY being able to counteract Smo ubiquitination independent of Hh signaling states, overexpression of UBPY reduced Smo ubiquitination in S2 cells both in the absence and presence of Hh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).</p>

        <p>We then carried out coimmunoprecipitation assays to determine whether UBPY physically interacts with Smo. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, Myc-Smo and Myc-Smo<sup>CT</sup> but not Myc-Smo<sup>ΔCT</sup> pulled down a flag-tagged UBPY (Fg-UBPY) when expressed in S2 cells, suggesting that UBPY interacts with Smo through its C-tail. The association between UBPY and Myc-Smo was not significantly affected by Hh stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). Furthermore, UBPY appears to interact equally well with Myc-Smo, Myc-Smo<sup>SA</sup>, and Myc-Smo<sup>SD</sup>, suggesting that the bulk of Smo/UBPY association is not regulated by Hh signaling.</p>
        <p>We next examined the effect of loss- or gain-of-UBPY on Smo cell surface expression. In wing discs carrying <italic>UBPY</italic> mutant clones, Smo cell surface accumulation was attenuated in P-compartment situated UBPY mutant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8E–E</xref>”). On the contrary, expression of <italic>UAS-UBPY</italic> using the wing specific Gal4 driver <italic>MS1096</italic> resulted in Smo accumulation in anterior compartment cells away from the A/P boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8G,J</xref>). Similarly, overexpression of UBPY in S2 cells markedly increased the cell surface expression of Myc-Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8K</xref>). Overexpression of UBPY in wing discs stabilized full-length Ci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8G</xref>',J') and induced ectopic expression of <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic> in anterior dorsal compartment cells where <italic>MS1096</italic> was expressed at high levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8G</xref>”). Smo RNAi suppressed the ectopic <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic> expression induced by UBPY overexpression as well as the endogenous <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic> expression near the A/P boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8H–H</xref>”). However, overexpression of UBPY induced little if any ectopic expression of <italic>ptc-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g008">Figure 8J</xref>”), which is normally induced by higher levels of Hh signaling than <italic>dpp-lacZ</italic>. Taken together, these results suggest that UBPY can reverse Smo ubiquitination to promote its cell surface accumulation and induce low but not high levels of Hh pathway activation. This is in line with our previous finding that overexpression of wild type Smo only induced low levels of Hh pathway activation and full activation of Smo requires additional steps, including a phosphorylation-mediated conformational switch in Smo C-tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Denef1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Rohatgi1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Jia1">[13]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Smo Is Regulated by Both Mono- and Polyubiquitination</title>
        <p>It is generally thought that monoubiquitination or multiubiquitination (monoubiquitination at multiple sites) is responsible for receptor internalization and degradation by lysosome, whereas Lys 48-linked polyubiquitination targets proteins for proteasome-mediated degradation. The observation that Smo is degraded by both lysosome and proteasome dependent mechanisms implied that Smo might undergo both types of modification. To determine if Smo could be monoubiquitinated, Myc-Smo or its KR variants was coexpressed with a HA-tagged mutant form of Ub with all Lys residues mutated to Arg (HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup>) in S2 cells. In this case, addition of HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> prevents the formation of polyubiquitination chains, generating modified proteins with one or more sites monoubiquitinated. We found that Myc-Smo was effectively modified by HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> was also incorporated into Myc-Smo<sup>K6R</sup>, Myc-Smo<sup>K7R</sup>, and Myc-Smo<sup>K13R</sup>, albeit with reduced efficiency compared with Myc-Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g009">Figure 9A</xref>), suggesting that Smo can be monoubiquitinated at multiple sites.</p>

        <p>In the absence of proteasome inhibitor, HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> and wild type HA-Ub were incorporated into Myc-Smo at similar levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that the ubiquitinated Smo species modified by HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> or HA-Ub detected under these conditions were mostly mono- or multi-ubiquitinated. Furthermore, Hh stimulation inhibited Smo ubiquitination under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). However, after MG132 treatment, more HA-Ub conjugated Smo was detected than HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> modified Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that a fraction of Myc-Smo underwent polyubiquitination that was normally degraded by proteasome. The proteasome inhibitor also increased the level of HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> conjugated Smo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g009">Figure 9B</xref>), suggesting that a fraction of HA-Ub<sup>K0</sup> conjugated Smo might undergo polyubiquitination via endogenous Ub.</p>
        <p>To confirm that Smo could be modified by Lys 48-linked polyubiquitination, we probed Smo immunopurified from S2 cells stably expressing Myc-Smo with a Lys 48-linkage specific polyubiquitin antibody (K48, Cell Signaling).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Regulation of Smo cell surface expression is a key step in Hh signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Denef1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhu1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Jia1">[13]</xref>, but the underlying mechanism has remained unknown. In this study, we provide the first evidence that Smo is ubiquitinated in a manner regulated by Hh signaling and PKA/CK1-mediated Smo phosphorylation. We provide both genetic and biochemical evidence that Smo ubiquitination regulates its endocytic trafficking and cell surface expression. In addition, we provide evidence that the non-visual β-arrestin Krz acts in parallel with Smo ubiquitination to promote its internalization and that Smo ubiquitination is antagonized by the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY.</p>
      <p>Several lines of evidence suggest that the ubiquitin pathway regulates Smo endocytic trafficking and degradation: (1) Smo was accumulated in mutant clones lacking the ubiquitin-activating enzyme Uba1 in wing imaginal discs, and inactivation of Uba1 in S2 cells inhibited Smo ubiquitination and promoted its cell surface accumulation; (2) Smo was accumulated when the activity of several endocytic components or lysosome was inhibited; (3) Hh and PKA/CK1-mediated Smo phosphorylation inhibited Smo ubiquitination and increased Smo cell surface expression; (4) the Smo autoinhibitory domain (SAID) promoted receptor ubiquitination and internalization; (5) Smo was ubiquitinated at multiple sites both inside and outside the SAID domain and mutating the ubiquitin acceptor sites in SAID increased Smo half-life and cell surface expression; and (6) Smo cell surface expression was promoted by the deubiquitinating enzyme UBPY that binds Smo and counteracts Smo ubiquitination.</p>
      <p>Early studies with yeast membrane receptors provided evidence that monoubiquitination of GPCRs mediates their agonist-induced internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Hicke1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Roth1">[34]</xref>. Later studies with mammalian GPCRs and other receptors suggested that both mono- and polyubiquitination could be involved in receptor endocytosis and degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Wojcikiewicz1">[18]</xref>. However, it has been shown that “polyubiquitination” of some receptors is due to monoubiquitination at multiple sites (multiubiquitination) instead of forming a polyubiquitination chain at a single site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Haglund1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Mosesson1">[36]</xref>. Here we provide evidence that Smo is both mono- and polyubiquitinated. It is possible that mono- or multiubiquitination may lead to Smo internalization and that internalized Smo could be further ubiquitinated in the endocytic pathway, leading to the formation of Lys 48-linked polyubiquitin chain that targets Smo for proteasome-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, multiple ubiquitination events provide a robust mechanism for Smo downregulation to prevent aberrant Smo activity in the absence of Hh.</p>

          <p>In the absence of Hh, Ptc inhibits Smo phosphorylation. Unphosphorylated or under-phosphorylated Smo is effectively ubiquitinated at multiple sites. In addition, Krz binds Smo and acts in parallel with Smo ubiquitination to promote Smo endocytosis. Smo is further ubiquitinated in the endocytic pathway and degraded by both proteasome and lysosome. In the presence of Hh, binding of Hh to Ptc inhibits its activity and promotes its degradation, allowing Smo phosphorylation by PKA and CK1. Phosphorylation inhibits Smo ubiquitination and its association with Krz, thereby inhibiting its internalization. UBPY catalyzes Smo deubiquitination in both signal “off” and “on” states and may facilitate Smo recycling back to the cell surface. See text for details.</p>

      <p>Regulation of Smo trafficking and cell surface expression provides a new paradigm for how the ubiquitin pathway controls the activity of a membrane receptor. Unlike all the other cases whereby receptor ubiquitination is triggered by ligand or agonist stimulation and serves as a mechanism to control the duration of cell signaling, Smo ubiquitination occurs in the absence of ligand stimulation and serves as a mechanism to keep the basal pathway activity in check. Smo ubiquitination is inhibited upon ligand stimulation; as a consequence, Smo is accumulated on the cell surface where it becomes activated. Thus, the regulation of Smo ubiquitination by the upstream signal is in the opposite direction compared with other receptors.</p>
      <p>How does Hh block Smo ubiquitination? Smo intracellular regions such as SAID could recruit one or more E3 ubiquitin ligases to catalyze Smo ubiquitination and E3 recruitment could be inhibited by Hh stimulation and PKA/CK1-mediated Smo phosphorylation. An alternative but not mutually exclusive mechanism is that Hh and Smo phosphorylation could promote Smo deubiquitination by regulating the binding and/or activity of one or more DUBs. In a systematic RNAi-based screen, we identified UBPY as a Smo DUB. UBPY binds Smo C-tail and antagonizes Smo ubiquitination. UBPY may modulate Smo cell surface expression by attenuating Smo endocytosis and/or promoting Smo recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g010">Figure 10</xref>). However, we found that UBPY decreases Smo ubiquitination regardless of the Hh signaling states and that the association between UBPY and Smo is not significantly affected by either Hh stimulation or Smo phosphorylation, suggesting that Smo deubiquitination by UBPY is unlikely to be a major mechanism by which Hh inhibits Smo ubiquitination, although we cannot rule out the possibility that Hh regulates UBPY binding to Smo in a subtle way that escaped the detection by our coimmunoprecipitation assay. The mechanism underlying the regulation of Smo ubiquitination might be analogous to those regulating the phosphorylation of many proteins in which kinases instead of phosphatases are usually regulated by upstream signals. Thus, identifying the E3 ligase(s) involved in Smo ubiquitination may shed important light on the mechanism by which Smo ubiquitination is regulated.</p>
      <p>We have also obtained evidence that the non-visual β-arrestin Krz can promote Smo internalization by binding to its C-tail and this activity is inhibited by Hh. However, while Krz overexpression effectively internalized Smo, loss-of-Krz-function did not lead to a significant change in Smo cell surface expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7C,G</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Molnar1">[31]</xref>. Our results suggest that Smo ubiquitination can act independently of Krz to internalize Smo, leading to its degradation by both proteasome and lysosome so that the requirement of Krz in internalizing Smo can only be revealed when Smo ubiquitination is compromised (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7G–I</xref>). It is possible that Smo ubiquitination plays a major role while Krz only plays a minor role in the regulation of Smo trafficking and cell surface expression.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms that regulate Smo trafficking and cell surface expression exhibit interesting similarities to as well as important differences from those regulating GPCRs. For example, it has been shown that agonist-induced downregulation of β2-Adrenergic Receptor (β2AR) is mediated by both β-arrestin and receptor ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy1">[27]</xref>. In addition, β2AR internalization and degradation is regulated by both proteasome- and lysosome-dependent mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy2">[37]</xref>. However, β2AR ubiquitination is induced by agonist and serves as a mechanism for desensitization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy2">[37]</xref>, whereas Smo ubiquitination is inhibited by Hh and serves as a mechanism for keeping pathway activity off in the absence of the ligand. β-arrestin binding to β2AR is induced by agonists and requires GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of the activated receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy1">[27]</xref>, whereas Krz binding to Smo is attenuated by Hh and Smo phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Although GPRK2/GRK2 also regulates Smo in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, its function appears to be uncoupled from that of Krz because loss of GPRK2 exhibits a phenotype distinct from that exhibited by loss of Krz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Molnar1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Molnar2">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Chen3">[40]</xref>. Furthermore, Krz can internalize Smo in the absence of GPRK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Molnar1">[31]</xref>. β-arrestin is required for β2AR ubiquitination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy2">[37]</xref>, whereas Krz inactivation does not significantly affect Smo ubiquitination (unpublished observations). Finally, while the proteasome inhibitor MG132 blocks agonist-induced β2AR internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Shenoy1">[27]</xref>, it does not prevent Smo internalization but instead inhibits Smo degradation after internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001239-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>
      <p>It is also interesting to note that β-arrestin has been implicated in the regulation of Smo trafficking and Shh signaling in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Chen2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Wilbanks1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Kovacs1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, β-arrestin binds to mammalian Smo (mSmo) in a manner promoted by Shh and GRK2-mediated phosphorylation of mSmo C-tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Kovacs1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Chen4">[43]</xref>, which is analogous to agonist-induced β-arrestin binding to GPCRs. However, instead of internalizing mSmo for degradation, β-arrestin appears to promote mSmo ciliary accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Kovacs1">[42]</xref>, which correlates with its positive role in Shh signaling. Both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate Smo proteins can activate trimeric G-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-DeCamp1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Riobo1">[46]</xref>, suggesting that they are not only structurally but also functionally related to GPCRs. It is conceivable that Smo proteins may employ multiple mechanisms utilized by GPCRs to control their intracellular trafficking and activity. Thus, it will be interesting to determine whether vertebrate Smo is also regulated by the ubiquitin pathway.</p>

        <p>Ubiquitination assays were carried out based on the protocol described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001239-Zhang2">[21]</xref>. Briefly, Myc-Smo stably expressing S2 cells or S2 cells transfected with Smo variants with or without HA-Ub (wild type or mutants) were treated with MG132 or NH<sub>4</sub>Cl before harvesting. Cells were lysed in 100 µl of denaturing buffer (1% SDS/50 mM Tris, pH 7.5/0.5 mM EDTA/1 mM DTT). After incubation for 5 min at 100°C, the lysates were diluted 10-fold with lysis buffer and then subjected to immunoprecipitation and Western blot analysis.</p>
