        <p>The identification of regulators, circuits, and target genes employed by the fungus <italic>Candida albicans</italic> to thrive in disparate niches in a mammalian host reveals interconnection between commensal and pathogenic lifestyles.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Systemic, life-threatening infections in humans are often caused by bacterial or fungal species that normally inhabit a different locale in our body, particularly mucosal surfaces. A hallmark of these opportunistic pathogens, therefore, is their ability to thrive in disparate niches within the host. In this work, we investigate the transcriptional circuitry and gene repertoire that enable the human opportunistic fungal pathogen <italic>Candida albicans</italic> to proliferate in two different niches. By screening a library of transcription regulator deletion strains in mouse models of intestinal colonization and systemic infection, we identified eight transcription regulators that play roles in at least one of these models. Using genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation, we uncovered a network comprising ∼800 target genes and a tightly knit transcriptional regulatory circuit at its core. The network is enriched with genes upregulated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells growing in the host. Our findings indicate that many aspects of commensalism and pathogenicity are intertwined and that the ability of this microorganism to colonize multiple niches relies on a large, integrated circuit.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Our skin and mouth, as well as our genital and gastrointestinal tracts, are laden with microorganisms belonging to all three domains of life (bacteria, archaea, and eukaryotes). Much of the time these commensal microorganisms are not only harmless but provide advantages to us. However, when the host's defenses are compromised, some members of the normal flora, such as the fungus <italic>C. albicans</italic>, can cross the host's protective barriers and colonize virtually every internal organ causing life-threatening conditions. The environment found in the bloodstream and internal organs is presumably distinct from the mucosal surfaces where our flora typically resides. Whether opportunistic pathogens such as <italic>C. albicans</italic> rely on common or separate gene repertoires to thrive in each of these locales is largely unknown. To address this question we carried out genetic screens in mouse models that recapitulate niches where <italic>C. albicans</italic> thrives and used genome-wide experimental approaches to uncover the genes required to proliferate in each environment. In fact, the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonize disparate niches within a mammalian host relies on a large, integrated circuit. Our observations suggest that at least some key gene circuits are not dedicated to one niche or another. Rather, thriving in various locales of the host seems to involve the complex regulation of multiple processes, which may allow <italic>C. albicans</italic> to adjust to different environments.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Mammalian mucosal surfaces harbor trillions of microorganisms from all three domains of life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Iliev1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Ghannoum1">[4]</xref>. While most of these microorganisms are harmless (or beneficial) to their host, a few of them are able to cross the host's protective barriers and colonize internal organs that offer little apparent resemblance to the microbe-laden mucosal surfaces. Indeed, many of the life-threatening infections in humans are caused by the very same bacterial or fungal species that typically compose our own microbiota. A hallmark of these opportunistic pathogens therefore is their ability to proliferate in disparate niches within the host. It remains an open question, however, whether the repertoire of genes that enables such pathogens to thrive in the host varies from one niche to the other.</p>
      <p>In this paper we investigate the case of <italic>C. albicans</italic>, the most prominent fungal species living on mucosal surfaces—particularly in the gastrointestinal (GI) tract—of warm-blooded animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Odds1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Calderone1">[7]</xref>. While it is a member of the normal human microbiota, <italic>C. albicans</italic> can also cause mucosal disease in healthy hosts or produce systemic infections and colonize internal organs in people who have received surgical implants or whose immune systems have been compromised, such as AIDS patients or individuals receiving chemotherapy. Deep-seated infections often result in life-threatening conditions. In addition to the status of the host immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Koh1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Romani1">[9]</xref>, the outcome of the <italic>C. albicans</italic>–host interaction depends on various products and functions encoded in the genome of the fungus, as multiple gene deletions render <italic>C. albicans</italic> avirulent in both mucosal and invasive animal models (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Calderone2">[10]</xref>). For example, the production of extracellular hydrolases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Hube1">[11]</xref>, the ability to switch between yeast and filament forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Gow1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Brunke1">[14]</xref>, and the production of small molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Noble1">[15]</xref> are all necessary for <italic>C. albicans</italic> to proliferate as either commensal or pathogen. The recent generation of relatively large collections of gene deletion mutants makes it now possible to carry out systematic and unbiased searches for genes and cellular functions employed by <italic>C. albicans</italic> to thrive in the host.</p>
      <p>To begin to dissect the repertoire of genes that enable <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonize the mammalian GI tract and determine whether these genes also play a role during systemic infection, we screened a collection of 77 <italic>C. albicans</italic> transcription regulator (TR) mutants in mouse models that recapitulate these two niches. We focused on TRs because transcriptional circuits are central to the regulation of many biological processes. The subset of TRs we screened was chosen because their deletion in <italic>C. albicans</italic> produces neither significant growth defects nor anomalous colony morphologies under any of 55 different laboratory growth conditions that have been tested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Homann1">[16]</xref>. Thus, we expected to maximize the identification of regulators “dedicated” to biological processes directly connected to <italic>C. albicans</italic> proliferation in the host. This approach also minimized the retrieval of mutants with either large pleiotropic effects or with fitness defects not specific to life in the host.</p>
      <p>Here we report the identification of eight <italic>C. albicans</italic> TRs required for GI tract colonization, systemic infection or both. We elucidate the transcriptional circuitry controlled by these regulators using genome-wide experimental approaches, and find that the resulting network is enriched with genes that are upregulated when <italic>C. albicans</italic> grows in the host. Five of the identified TRs form a highly interconnected core network that regulates determinants of GI tract colonization as well as systemic infection indicating that both types of growth in the host require common circuitries. We find that cell surface remodeling and the acquisition of carbon and nitrogen are salient among the functions that <italic>C. albicans</italic> requires to proliferate in the host. Finally, we demonstrate that several of the gene products regulated by the identified TRs are in fact required for intestinal colonization or for systemic infection. Thus, the use of TRs as genetic entry points, combined with full-genome molecular biology methods, can identify regulators, circuits, and target genes needed explicitly for <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonize different niches of mammalian hosts.</p>

        <title>Genetic Screen to Identify <italic>C. albicans</italic> Transcription Regulators Required to Colonize the Murine Gastrointestinal Tract</title>
        <p>Sequence-specific DNA binding proteins that regulate transcription, or TRs, are major elements within the gene network of an organism. They are pivotal in orchestrating responses to external cues and in maintaining internal homeostasis in the face of fluctuations in the environment. TRs are thus likely to be critical components of the gene network that underlies the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to inhabit the host. Our laboratory recently constructed a collection of 165 <italic>C. albicans</italic> TR homozygous deletion mutant strains consisting of two independently generated, fully vetted isolates of each deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Homann1">[16]</xref>. About 45% of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> TR deletion strains display no significant growth or colony morphology phenotype under any of 55 different laboratory growth conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Homann1">[16]</xref>, raising the possibility that their function may be revealed only in the context of the host. Hence, we focused on this subset of TRs (<italic>n</italic> = 77) to carry out genetic screens in mouse models that recapitulate niches where <italic>C. albicans</italic> thrives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To minimize the number of animals required to screen the mutant strain library, we adopted the signature-tagged mutagenesis technique that our laboratory has successfully used to identify virulence factors in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Noble1">[15]</xref> and has been employed in other fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Liu1">[17]</xref> and bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Shea1">[18]</xref> as well. We used a mouse model of intestinal colonization in which immunocompetent antibiotic-treated Swiss Webster mice are orally inoculated with <italic>C. albicans</italic> by gavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Rosenbach1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-White1">[20]</xref>. While mice do not appear to be natural hosts for <italic>C. albicans</italic> but for the closely related yeast <italic>C. tropicalis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Iliev1">[1]</xref>, the murine GI colonization model has been adopted as the standard in the field to evaluate <italic>C. albicans</italic> commensalism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Chen1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Pierce2">[23]</xref>. We assayed pools of 15–20 signature-tagged mutant strains; the relative abundance of the strains recovered from feces (at 1, 9, and 21 d post-inoculation) or intestinal contents (at day 21 when mice were euthanized) compared to the inoculum was determined by real time PCR (using primers to the signature tags) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Noble1">[15]</xref>. We were able to confidently monitor 72 <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains over the course of the experiment in three mice each. The level of depletion or accumulation of each mutant relative to the inoculum is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. We found that ∼1,000-fold reduction with respect to the inoculum is the limit of accurate detection for most strains in this assay (that is, a log<sub>2</sub> value of about −10). While the actual values can vary from mouse to mouse, they do show a high degree of consistency across samples (e.g., intestinal contents versus fecal pellets at day 21) and across time points (e.g., mutants that became undetectable at day 9 remained so at day 21). The weight and body condition of all inoculated mice were closely monitored throughout the experiment; no differences were observed between inoculated and control animals.</p>

        <p>For each mutant that showed a severe defect (i.e., those that fell below the level of detection of the assay at day 9 or 21 post-inoculation) we tested an independently constructed deletion of the same gene. We also re-tested in this assay all the mutants that showed defects in our second screen, a systemic infection model (see below). We focused on mutants with large effects (&gt;1,000-fold reduction relative to the inoculum) and, to facilitate the statistical analysis, we converted the data to binary mode: presence or absence. The data displayed in this manner are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. Each mutant shown here was evaluated in at least six mice, with both independent isolates producing consistent results. Based on these criteria, six TR deletion mutants (<italic>tye7</italic>Δ/Δ [<italic>orf19.4941</italic>], <italic>rtg1</italic>Δ/Δ [<italic>orf19.4722</italic>], <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ/Δ [<italic>orf19.2315</italic>], <italic>lys144</italic>Δ/Δ [<italic>orf19.5380</italic>], <italic>hms1</italic>Δ/Δ [<italic>orf19.921</italic>], and <italic>orf19.3625</italic>Δ/Δ) showed significant, large impairments in GI tract colonization (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.02) while <italic>zcf21</italic>Δ/Δ (<italic>orf19.4166</italic>) has a weaker defect (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0503). To verify that the phenotype is due to the deleted gene, we reintroduced an ectopic copy of the wild-type allele back into each mutant and found that it was able to restore colonization at least partially in all mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g003">Figure 3</xref>). As noted previously, the mutants have no growth defect in standard laboratory conditions and none of the six regulators had been previously implicated in intestinal colonization.</p>

        <title>Partial Overlap between the Set of TRs Required to Colonize the GI Tract and TRs Playing Roles in Systemic Infection</title>
        <p>To determine whether a given <italic>C. albicans</italic> TR play a role in colonization of the GI tract as well as during systemic infection, we evaluated the fitness of the same set of 77 TR deletion mutant strains in a mouse model of disseminated candidiasis. We chose tail vein injection because this model has been adopted as the standard in the field to assess <italic>C. albicans</italic> virulence. Pools of 24 signature tagged mutant strains were assayed, and the relative abundance of the strains recovered from the kidneys of moribund BALB/c mice (2–4 d post-infection) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) was compared to that in the infecting inoculum using real time PCR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Noble1">[15]</xref>. For about two-thirds of the mutant strains, two independent isolates were evaluated. Only one isolate was tested for the other third. Every strain was assayed in at least four mice. The results obtained for all the mutants are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001510.s007">Table S1</xref>. To consider a mutant strain as having fitness defect, both isolates had to exhibit consistent results (none of the mutants for which only a single isolate was tested showed any defect). Based on this criterion, the screen revealed five TR deletion mutants (<italic>rtg1</italic>Δ/Δ, <italic>rtg3</italic>Δ/Δ, <italic>zcf21</italic>Δ/Δ, <italic>lys14</italic>Δ/Δ [<italic>orf19.5548</italic>], and <italic>hms1</italic>Δ/Δ) with reduced fitness (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). These five mutants were retested individually and showed reduced virulence in single (as opposed to pooled) tail vein infections when time to illness was monitored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g004">Figure 4B–4D</xref>). Careful scrutiny of the other three TR deletion mutants with defects in GI tract colonization (<italic>tye7</italic>Δ/Δ, <italic>lys144</italic>Δ/Δ, and <italic>orf19.3625</italic>Δ/Δ) confirmed that they did not show abnormalities in our systemic infection model (in agreement with this observation, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Askew1">[24]</xref> also found no defect for a <italic>tye7</italic> mutant in related models of disseminated candidiasis). In sum, our two in vivo genetic screens uncovered eight TRs playing roles in the proliferation of <italic>C. albicans</italic> within the host. Three of these regulators (<italic>RTG1</italic>, <italic>RTG3</italic>, and <italic>HMS1</italic>) exhibited significant impairment in both GI tract colonization and systemic infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). <italic>ZCF21</italic> displays a significant fitness anomaly in systemic infection but only a weak and variable defect in GI tract colonization. <italic>LYS14</italic> showed a defect in systemic infection but not GI tract colonization. <italic>ORF19.3625</italic>, <italic>LYS144</italic>, and <italic>TYE7</italic> showed the opposite behavior being required for intestinal colonization but not systemic infection.

        <title>Connecting the Regulators of Intestinal Colonization and Systemic Infection to Target Genes</title>
        <p>To gain insights into the biological processes directed by the seven identified TRs, we determined the genes that they regulate. <italic>TYE7</italic> is the only one of the regulators for which genome-wide data regarding its target genes in <italic>C. albicans</italic> are available (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Askew1">[24]</xref>). Thus, we carried out whole genome chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by array hybridization (ChIP-chip) for the remaining six TRs. As it might be predicted, the conditions typically used to grow <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the laboratory (liquid culture in YPD medium at 30°C) were not optimal to detect either binding of the TRs to their target promoters or changes in the expression of target genes (i.e., in expression arrays comparing wild-type versus TR deletion mutant strains). This was not unexpected because the mutants chosen for the screen have no significant phenotypes when tested under laboratory conditions; therefore, the identified regulators are likely to be active only under specific conditions within the host. To overcome this limitation we constructed fluorescent reporter strains (<italic>yfp</italic> or <italic>gfp</italic> fused to each regulator's native promoter and YFP- or GFP-fused TR proteins) and sought conditions that promoted either the expression or the nuclear localization (in the case of fusion proteins) of the fluorescent reporters. Among the conditions tested were ∼20 different cell culture media, 37°C (the temperature in the host) and the growth of cells on a semi-solid surface (which may mimic growth on the surfaces within the host). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g005">Figure 5A</xref> summarizes the optimal growth conditions that were chosen to immunoprecipitate each regulator in vitro.

        <p>Using stringent cutoffs to define statistically significant binding events (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we established that the following number of intergenic regions are bound by each regulator: 79 for Hms1, 51 for Lys14, 47 for Lys144, 237 for Zcf21, and 215 for Rtg1 and Rtg3 (Dataset S1). The ChIP-chip profiles of Rtg1 and Rtg3 were identical to each other implying that these two proteins bind to DNA together. Indeed, the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> Rtg1 and Rtg3 orthologous proteins are known to form a heterodimer to bind to DNA (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Liu2">[29]</xref>). Using only the ChIP-chip data, we were able to derive DNA motifs (i.e., <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequences) for each regulator (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These sequences were significantly enriched in the bound regions compared to the remainder of intergenic regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001510.s003">Figure S1</xref>). The motif that we derived for Rtg1/3 is similar to the reported binding sequence of their orthologs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GTCAC</named-content>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Liu2">[29]</xref>. Likewise, the motif that we find for Lys144 resembles the reported binding sequence for its closest homolog in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, Lys14 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">T<underline>CC</underline>RNY<underline>GG</underline>A</named-content>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Becker1">[30]</xref>.

Although the Lys14 motif that we generated differs from the sequence recognized by its homolog Lys14 in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, we confirmed by gel mobility shift assays that the purified <italic>C. albicans</italic> Lys14 protein binds in vitro to the sequence that we identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). (Phylogenetic reconstructions indicate that the closest homolog of <italic>S. cerevisiae LYS14</italic> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is <italic>LYS144</italic> and not <italic>LYS14</italic>, albeit the current nomenclature implies otherwise. In addition, as described below, <italic>C. albicans LYS144</italic> and <italic>LYS14</italic> have nothing to do with lysine biosynthesis regulation.) We were unable to identify an ortholog in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> for <italic>C. albicans</italic> Zcf21, so we could not perform an independent check of its motif. Taken together, the fact that we were able to derive motifs de novo from the ChIP data, and the similarity of these independently derived motifs to the sequences known to be bound by homologs in other species validate the dataset that we generated by genome-wide ChIP.</p>

        <title>Rtg1/3 Is a Major Regulator of Genes Preferentially Expressed during Intestinal Colonization</title>
        <p>This study was designed to identify TRs that specifically control aspects of <italic>C. albicans</italic> that are needed in the host. A prediction of this idea is that the target genes identified in this study will be preferentially expressed when <italic>C. albicans</italic> is in the host. To test this prediction, we compared the list of ChIP targets that we identified to an independently generated gene expression dataset where <italic>C. albicans</italic> growing in the mouse intestine was compared to <italic>C. albicans</italic> growing under laboratory conditions. In this study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Rosenbach1">[19]</xref>, Rosenbach et al. defined a collection of 408 genes that were upregulated during growth in the murine cecum relative to laboratory grown exponential and post-exponential phase cells (in reference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Rosenbach1">[19]</xref>'s table S3). We found that <italic>C. albicans</italic> genes upregulated during growth in the mouse intestine are significantly overrepresented in the set of putative ChIP targets (153 out of 408 genes, <italic>p</italic> = 2.7×10<sup>−38</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; Dataset S2) supporting a role for the identified regulators in controlling a gene expression program activated specifically in the host.</p>
        <p>The subset of 153 target genes upregulated when <italic>C. albicans</italic> is growing in the murine gut is not evenly distributed across the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Rather they are predominantly located in the set controlled by Rtg1/3 (108 of 153 genes) (Dataset S2) suggesting that these two proteins are major regulators of GI tract colonization determinants. <italic>RTG1</italic>/<italic>3</italic> controls mitochondrial retrograde signaling in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Liu2">[29]</xref>).

Based on our ChIP-chip results, Rtg1/3 appears to regulate similar functions in <italic>C. albicans</italic> and these functions seem to contribute to the ability of the fungus to proliferate in the GI tract. In support of this idea, the subset of Rtg1/3 targets upregulated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells growing in the intestine (108 genes) is enriched with genes involved in metabolic functions (e.g., carbohydrate catabolic process [<italic>p</italic> = 3.28×10<sup>−5</sup>]).</p>

        <title>Target Genes Implicated in Intestinal Colonization and Systemic Infection</title>
        <p>We next wanted to test experimentally whether the target genes identified in this study were actually required for <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonize the GI tract or for fitness during systemic infection. We reasoned that the most likely candidates to show strong effects would be those genes that are clearly bound by one or more of the TRs identified here and whose expression is upregulated when <italic>C. albicans</italic> is growing in the mouse compared to laboratory conditions. Of the 153 genes upregulated in the host (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we focused on those bound by Hms1 and Rtg1/3 because these TRs showed phenotypes in both mouse models. We selected 18 genes that met these criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001510.s008">Table S2</xref>) and successfully constructed signature-tagged homozygous deletion strains for 17 of these genes (we were unable to make a homozygous deletion of <italic>orf19.1363</italic>, raising the possibility that this gene may be essential) and tested 15 of them in the mouse models of GI tract colonization and systemic infection (<italic>orf19.1069</italic> and <italic>orf19.4961</italic> were excluded because their deletion results in severe growth defects in vitro). As described for the initial TR screen, we tested these mutants as a single pool in at least six mice.</p>
        <p>Three of the 15 homozygous deletion mutants (<italic>gal10</italic> [<italic>orf19.3672</italic>], <italic>dfi1</italic> [<italic>orf19.7084</italic>], and <italic>hap41</italic> [<italic>orf19.740</italic>]) showed significantly reduced levels of GI tract colonization whereas one (<italic>nce102</italic> [<italic>orf19.5960</italic>]) displayed reduced fungal burden in kidneys after tail vein infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

As predicted by the ChIP-chip–based network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), Rtg1/3 and Hms1 regulate the expression levels of these targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001510.s004">Figure S2</xref>). None of the identified genes had been previously implicated in intestinal colonization. While the <italic>C. albicans GAL10</italic> gene encodes an enzyme of the galactose utilization pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Singh1">[35]</xref>, the ability to use galactose as a carbon source <italic>per se</italic> is unlikely to contribute to the mutant's inability to colonize the GI tract because we did not observe similar defects in the <italic>GAL1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g007">Figure 7</xref>) (the <italic>GAL1</italic> gene encodes another enzyme of the galactose utilization pathway).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have investigated the transcriptional regulatory circuits and the repertoire of genes that the opportunistic pathogen <italic>C. albicans</italic> uses to thrive in two niches within its mammalian host. The identification of TRs that play roles predominantly during GI tract colonization (<italic>TYE7</italic>, <italic>ORF19.3625</italic>, and <italic>LYS144</italic>) or during systemic infection (<italic>ZCF21</italic> and <italic>LYS14</italic>) as well as of TRs required in both locales (<italic>RTG1</italic>/<italic>3</italic> and <italic>HMS1</italic>) suggest that these two disparate niches impose both exclusive and shared demands upon <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Our finding that some TRs show strong defects in only one of the two mouse models is similar to what has been reported for a <italic>tec1</italic> mutant strain and for a strain ectopically expressing <italic>EFH1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Rosenbach1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-White1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Schweizer1">[39]</xref>. However, the high degree of interconnectedness that we observe among the identified TRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g008">Figure 8</xref>) and in the entire gene network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) indicate that these are not circuits dedicated exclusively to one or the other niche. Rather, our results indicate that a large interconnected network functions in both niches and that the expression of target genes in one locale or the other is coordinated by this network.</p>

      <p>Our finding that a shared regulatory network controls aspects of both commensalism (i.e., GI tract colonization) and systemic infection (i.e., fungal burden in kidneys after bloodstream infection) may be rationalized in the context of the natural history of <italic>C. albicans</italic>: while its association with mammals may be ancient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Odds2">[6]</xref>, the selective pressure on the fungus has likely been as a commensal organism. In fact, <italic>Candida</italic> spp. were considered essentially non-pathogenic until the mid-1950s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Casadevall1">[40]</xref>. Thus, the functions that confer on <italic>C. albicans</italic> the ability to produce systemic infections are likely built upon the available regulatory circuitry that allows <italic>C. albicans</italic> to proliferate in its host as a commensal organism.</p>
      <p>We focused our genetic screens on a subset (∼35%) of the TRs present in the genome of <italic>C. albicans</italic>. Essential TRs as well as regulator mutants that display moderate to strong in vitro phenotypes were excluded from our screen because we wanted to identify genes explicitly needed for <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonize different niches of mammalian hosts. TRs not included in our screen, however, can also contribute to the proliferation of the fungus in the host. For example, <italic>CPH2</italic>, a regulator of hyphal development in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Lane1">[41]</xref>, has been shown to be required to colonize the murine GI tract <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Rosenbach1">[19]</xref>; a similar phenotype in the mouse is observed when <italic>EFH1</italic>, a regulator of pseudohyphal formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Doedt1">[42]</xref>, is overexpressed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-White1">[20]</xref>. The TRs identified in our study as defective in gut colonization may control these two regulators because Rtg1/3 and Hms1 bind upstream of the <italic>CPH2</italic> gene whereas Tye7 binds upstream of the <italic>EFH1</italic> gene (Dataset S2). The inclusion in our network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) of the two regulators previously known to affect gut colonization suggests that a significant proportion of the “gene clusters” that contribute to the growth of <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the host are linked with one another.</p>
      <p>The topology of the gene network that results from our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g008">8</xref>) reveals that it contains a highly interconnected core component (composed of the TRs <italic>RTG1</italic>/<italic>3</italic>, <italic>TYE7</italic>, <italic>ZCF21</italic>, and <italic>HMS1</italic>) and a remote, “satellite-like” component (circuits controlled by <italic>LYS14</italic> and <italic>LYS144</italic>). Within the core component, <italic>RTG1</italic>/<italic>3</italic> appear to be the only “master regulators” that are not transcriptionally regulated by themselves or the other TRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001510.s001">S3</xref>). This may reflect the fact that Rtg1 and Rtg3 are regulated post-translationally (by phosphorylation and translocation into the nucleus) and not at the transcriptional level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Liu2">[29]</xref>. The core component resembles other highly interwoven circuits known to direct well-established cell differentiation processes such as white-opaque switching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Zordan1">[43]</xref> and biofilm development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Nobile1">[44]</xref> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> or filamentation in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Borneman1">[45]</xref>. Our findings, therefore, support the notion that <italic>C. albicans</italic> employs an integrated regulatory circuit to control the expression of genes that allow it to thrive in the host.</p>
      <p>The gene network that we have identified as controlling proliferation in the host is enriched with genes upregulated when <italic>C. albicans</italic> grows in the mouse intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The finding that this subset of 153 target genes is predominantly located around Rtg1/3 in the network (108 of 153 genes) suggests that these two proteins are major regulators of GI tract colonization. Among these determinants, the ability to regulate metabolic functions such as sugar catabolism appears to be particularly important for the fungus to successfully colonize the GI tract: the subset of 108 Rtg1/3 targets upregulated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells growing in the intestine is enriched with genes that play crucial roles in this process. Consistent with the notion that regulating metabolic functions is pivotal for intestinal colonization, sugar catabolism is a function enriched also among the targets of <italic>HMS1</italic> (hexose catabolic process [<italic>p</italic> = 2.7×10<sup>−4</sup>]), a regulator necessary for gut colonization as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Based on our circuit mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001510.s004">S4</xref>), the function of <italic>RTG1</italic>/<italic>3</italic> in <italic>C. albicans</italic> is similar, at least in broad outline, to that of their orthologs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> where they control mitochondrial retrograde signaling (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Liu2">[29]</xref>). This pathway involves sensing and transmitting nutritional as well as mitochondrial signals to effect changes in nuclear gene expression, which lead to a reconfiguration of metabolism to accommodate cells to nutrient availability or mitochondrial defects.</p>

        <title>Prominent Functions Controlled by Regulators of Intestinal Colonization and Systemic Infection</title>
        <p>The collection of TR target genes in the network includes a large and diverse set of biological functions, but three broad functions/categories are most noticeable: (1) acquisition and metabolism of carbon; (2) acquisition and metabolism of nitrogen; and (3) transporters and cell surface proteins. The acquisition and metabolism of carbon and nitrogen are among the most prominent challenges faced by bacteria that live in the gut as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Fischbach1">[46]</xref>. Moreover, bacterial pathogens that undergo mutations as well as gene gains/losses resulting in alterations of their metabolic capabilities often display a selective advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Rohmer1">[47]</xref>. Cell surface remodeling is a key strategy used by microorganisms to circumvent host defenses; in fact, the ability to do so has been demonstrated to contribute to the virulence of a broad range of pathogens including bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Haraga1">[48]</xref>, fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Gow1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Gow2">[49]</xref>, and parasites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Cross1">[50]</xref>. In bacterial species that can turn from harmless commensals to life-threatening pathogens, surface proteins also appear to play major roles in the transition between commensalism and pathogenicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Wei1">[51]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Carbohydrates consumed by the gut microbiota are typically oligo- or polysaccharides derived from diet, host mucosal secretion, or other resident (or dietary) microbes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Fischbach1">[46]</xref>. In the bloodstream, on the other hand, glucose is the only sugar available whereas in internal organs the carbohydrates available are probably those from the proteoglycans that form the extracellular matrix, an ubiquitous constituent of animal tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Chagnot1">[52]</xref>. This major difference in the potential source of carbon between the two locales suggest that the strategy that <italic>C. albicans</italic> employs to obtain carbohydrates in the GI tract should differ, at least in part, from the strategy used while in the bloodstream or internal organs. Consistent with this notion, we find that <italic>TYE7</italic>, one of the major regulators of carbohydrate metabolism in <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Askew1">[24]</xref>, is needed to proliferate in the gut but not during systemic infection. <italic>RTG1</italic>/<italic>3</italic> and <italic>HMS1</italic>, both required not only for gut colonization but also for full fitness after bloodstream infection, bind upstream of a significant number of genes involved in hexose catabolism (Dataset S2). This function may be important during systemic infection because genes involved in the assimilation of alternative carbon sources have been found to be upregulated in <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells during infection of the mammalian kidney <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Walker1">[53]</xref> and carbon metabolism has been implicated in the infections of other fungal pathogens as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Cairns1">[54]</xref>. Metabolic flexibility, in general, has been postulated to be a requisite for <italic>C. albicans</italic> infection due to the dynamic nature of host niches which contain complex arrays of nutrients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Sandai1">[55]</xref>.</p>
        <p>How nitrogen is acquired by microorganisms living in the GI tract remains an open question. Several bacterial species that live in the gut, e.g., <italic>Bacterioides</italic>, seem to rely on NH<sub>3</sub> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Fischbach1">[46]</xref>). Other sources could be amino sugars and proteins that are present in secreted mucus and epithelial cells, or amino acids derived from diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Fischbach1">[46]</xref>. Consistent with the latter, Rtg1/3, one of the <italic>C. albicans</italic> TRs controlling intestinal colonization, has a number of putative amino acid permeases among their target genes. In addition, we find that Lys144 binds upstream of each of four putative allantoate transporters raising the possibility that allantoate, a product of purine catabolism in some bacteria, is one of the sources of nitrogen for <italic>C. albicans</italic> in the gut. Contrary to what their nomenclature implies, neither Lys144 nor Lys14 seems to regulate lysine biosynthesis genes in <italic>C. albicans</italic> (our ChIP data and phenotypic screen results in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Homann1">[16]</xref>).</p>
        <p>The majority of the pathogen-associated molecular patterns (PAMPs) that activate and modulate immune responses are cell wall components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Netea1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Romani2">[57]</xref>. Indeed, <italic>C. albicans</italic> mutants that are unable to add particular carbohydrate moieties to their surface proteins are attenuated for virulence in mouse models of systemic infection. <italic>ZCF21</italic> and <italic>LYS14</italic>, the two TRs that influence the outcome of systemic infections but not colonization of the GI tract, have among their targets a significant number of genes encoding proteins predicted to be localized to the cell surface or enzymes that modify the cell wall structure such as the mannosyltransferase <italic>OCH1</italic> and the glucosyltransferase <italic>ALG6</italic>. Hence, our findings reveal two regulators that <italic>C. albicans</italic> employ to remodel its surface and indicate that these modifications are needed during systemic infection.</p>
        <p>In summary, our findings indicate that the ability of <italic>C. albicans</italic> to colonize multiple niches within a mammalian host relies on a large, integrated circuit that responds to different environmental conditions to effect major changes in metabolic functions, nutrient (especially carbon and nitrogen) acquisition, cell wall remodeling, and cell wall integrity. We propose that this “master circuit” allows <italic>C. albicans</italic> to adjust to disparate environments in the host and accounts for the close links between commensalism and pathogenicity.</p>

        <p>The procedure used was essentially the one described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Rosenbach1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-White1">[20]</xref>. Female Swiss Webster mice (18–20 g) were treated with antibiotics (tetracycline [1 mg/ml]), streptomycin [2 mg/ml], and gentamycin [0.1 mg/ml]) added to their drinking water throughout the experiment beginning 4 d before inoculation. Prior to inoculation, <italic>C. albicans</italic> strains were grown for ∼18 h at 30°C in YPD liquid medium, washed twice with PBS, and counted in a hemocytometer. Mice were orally inoculated with 5×10<sup>7</sup> <italic>C. albicans</italic> cells (in a 0.1 or 0.2 ml volume) by gavage using a feeding needle. Colonization was monitored by collecting fecal pellets (produced within 10 min prior to collection) at various days post-inoculation and cecum contents at the end of the experiment when the mice were killed. In the initial screening the fecal pellets and intestinal contents were used to prepare genomic DNA directly from the samples. In follow-up experiments, the mouse homogenates were plated onto Sabouraud medium containing ampicillin (50 µg/ml) and gentamycin (15 µg/ml) (antibiotics were included to prevent the growth of contaminating bacteria). Genomic DNA was prepared from yeast scraped off the plates. The yields of DNA prepared directly from fecal pellets and intestinal contents were relatively low, hence one round of whole genome amplification (using Sigma's GenomePlex Complete Whole Genome Amplification kit) was used to generate adequate amounts of material before the qPCR analysis. Similar results were obtained with samples that were plated or that were processed directly.</p>
        <p>The 77 <italic>C. albicans</italic> deletion mutants screened are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001510.s007">Table S1</xref>. We assayed pools of 15–20 signature-tagged mutant strains. The relative abundance of the strains recovered from feces (at 1, 9, and 18 or 21 d post-inoculation) or intestinal contents (at day 18 or 21) compared with the inoculum was determined by real time PCR (using primers to the signature tags) as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001510-Noble1">[15]</xref>. Briefly, threshold cycle (<italic>C</italic><sub>T</sub>) values were converted to a linear scale using the simple equation, linear value = 2<sup>−<italic>C</italic>T</sup>. Experiments comparing 15 strains resulted in 15 values for the inoculum (<italic>I</italic>) and another 15 for the recovered pool (<italic>R</italic><sub>raw</sub>). <italic>R</italic><sub>raw</sub> values were multiplied by median(<italic>I</italic>)/median(<italic>R</italic><sub>raw</sub>) to generate normalized <italic>R</italic> values.

These ratios expressed as log<sub>2</sub> values are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001510-g002">Figure 2A</xref>.</p>
        <p>Empirically we found that the limit of accurate qPCR detection for most strains was about 1,000-fold reduction in levels compared to the inoculum.

          <p><bold>DNA motifs derived from the ChIP-chip analysis occur preferentially in regions bound by the regulators.</bold> The frequency with which each DNA motif occurs in the entire set of ChIP peaks (500-nt sequences centered in the midpoint of the peak) for a given regulator (blue line) versus in an equally sized set of random intergenic regions (red line) was evaluated in MochiView using its “enrichment plot” function. In all the plots shown, the blue line runs to the right of the red line indicating that at any motif score that one chooses as a cutoff, the set of ChIP peaks contains a higher proportion of matches to the motif than the set of random sequences. The Lys14 motif is composed of CGC repeats separated by 4 or 5 nt; since a fixed-length motif is required to perform the “enrichment” analysis, two plots are shown for this regulator.</p>
