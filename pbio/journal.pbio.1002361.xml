<article-title>Good Amyloid, Bad Amyloid - What's the Difference?</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Amyloids are ordered protein aggregates that are typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases and cognitive impairment. By contrast, the amyloid-like state of the neuronal RNA binding protein Orb2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> was recently implicated in memory consolidation, but it remains unclear what features of this functional amyloid-like protein give rise to such diametrically opposed behaviour. Here, using an array of biophysical, cell biological and behavioural assays we have characterized the structural features of Orb2 from the monomer to the amyloid state. Surprisingly, we find that Orb2 shares many structural traits with pathological amyloids, including the intermediate toxic oligomeric species, which can be sequestered in vivo in hetero-oligomers by pathological amyloids. However, unlike pathological amyloids, Orb2 rapidly forms amyloids and its toxic intermediates are extremely transient, indicating that kinetic parameters differentiate this functional amyloid from pathological amyloids. We also observed that a well-known anti-amyloidogenic peptide interferes with long-term memory in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. These results provide structural insights into how the amyloid-like state of the Orb2 protein can stabilize memory and be nontoxic. They also provide insight into how amyloid-based diseases may affect memory processes.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Amyloids are ordered protein aggregates typically associated with neurodegenerative diseases, such as Alzheimer disease and Parkinson disease, which usually result in cognitive impairment. However, the amyloid state of the neuronal RNA binding protein Orb2 shows a quite opposite behaviour: instead of impairment, it is associated with memory consolidation. Here, we have characterized the structural features of Orb2 from the monomer to the amyloid state in order to determine why it shows this unexplained puzzling behaviour. Surprisingly, we find that Orb2 shares many structural traits with pathological amyloids. However, Orb2 rapidly forms amyloids, and its toxic intermediates are transient. Furthermore, we find that an anti-amyloidogenic peptide that blocks the initial structural transitions in pathological amyloids also blocks Orb2 amyloid formation and memory consolidation. Our results provide structural insights into how Orb2 amyloids can mediate stable memory while being nontoxic and how amyloid-based diseases may affect memory processes. They also suggest a new pharmacological approach for blocking memory consolidation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Amyloids, whose cross-<italic>β</italic> fold has been postulated as the ancestral protein fold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref002">2</xref>], were initially associated with fatal neurodegenerative disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref004">4</xref>]. However, more than a century after the identification of these “pathological amyloids,” a growing list of so-called “functional amyloids” that fulfils a wide variety of physiological functions has recently emerged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref005">5</xref>]. The discovery of functional amyloids raises the question of what causes such a strikingly distinct behaviour to that observed in pathological amyloids. Indeed, it remains unclear what features are shared by functional and pathological amyloids and what determines whether a particular amyloid is functional rather than toxic.</p>
<p>One functional amyloid-like protein of particular interest is the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element binding protein (CPEB). The CPEB family of proteins regulates the translation of dormant mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref007">7</xref>], and some members of this family are involved in synaptic plasticity and long-lasting memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref009">9</xref>]. The CPEB isoforms share a common C-terminal catalytic region (RNA-binding domain), but they differ in the N-terminal region. Surprisingly, the N-terminus of some CPEB isoforms in <italic>Aplysia</italic>, <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and mouse have features characteristic of self-sustaining amyloidogenic (prion-like) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref013">13</xref>]. For example, the neuronal specific isoform of <italic>Aplysia</italic> CPEB (ApCPEB) has a glutamine-asparagine (Q/N)-rich N-terminal domain, which resembles a yeast prion-like domain (PLD) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref014">14</xref>], and it is predicted to have conformational flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref010">10</xref>]. Indeed, ApCPEB undergoes a conformational transition to a <italic>β</italic>-sheet-rich state similar to that undertaken by other prion-like proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref015">15</xref>]. In sensory neurons, the neurotransmitter serotonin controls the prion-like switch from the monomeric form to the self-sustaining oligomeric state, which is important for the serotonin-induced increase in synaptic strength [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref016">16</xref>]. Accordingly, it has been postulated that the switch to the oligomeric and self-perpetuating state contributes to the long-term maintenance of synapse-specific changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref016">16</xref>], providing a molecular mechanism for the persistence of memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> orthologue of CPEB, Orb2, has two isoforms that are structurally similar to the ApCPEB isoform: Orb2A and Orb2B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref018">18</xref>]. Both forms are expressed in the fly brain and they are required for long-term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref019">19</xref>]. Orb2A, a synaptic protein, is scarce, and its availability is controlled by phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref020">20</xref>]. This isoform has eight amino acid residues (YNKFVNFI) preceding the PLD, which are critical for both the efficiency as well as the nature of the amyloid-like oligomers being formed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>]. The longer Orb2B isoform, with a region of 162 residues preceding the PLD, appears to act as a canonical CPEB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref021">21</xref>], regulating translation via its RNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref021">21</xref>]. The PLD of Orb2A has a low Q/N content compared to ApCPEB (23.5% versus 48.1%), it acts in long-term memory independently of its RNA-binding domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref021">21</xref>], and its mutations prevent memory consolidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The nervous system is particularly susceptible to amyloid-driven diseases, some of which lead to severe cognitive deficits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref022">22</xref>]. Currently, it remains unclear why some amyloids in general are detrimental for neurons, while a seemingly similar amyloid state of some neuronal CPEB proteins is critical for memory stabilization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>]. As with other biological conundrums, a structural/functional analysis of CPEB/Orb2 proteins may shed light on the features that distinguish functional from pathological amyloids, and it may also help us to understand the molecular basis of memory consolidation. Here, we have employed an array of in vitro (bulk and single-molecule biophysics as well as cell culture) and in vivo (<italic>Drosophila</italic> and yeast) techniques to characterize Orb2 amyloid both structurally and functionally. In addition to dissecting out the characteristics of the Q/N-rich PLD-containing region of Orb2, we have found that a known anti-amyloidogenic peptide inhibits some forms of memory consolidation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Furthermore, comparing with pathological amyloids, we found that although in solution Orb2 can form toxic oligomers, these toxic species rapidly progress to innocuous species. These transient Orb2 species are structurally similar to toxic Huntingtin aggregates and, when abundant, these two proteins form a heteromeric complex. These findings indicate that there are intrinsic structural constraints that prevent functional amyloids to dwell in the toxic conformation. These observations also provide clues as to how pathological amyloids may interfere with the function of those beneficial amyloids.</p>

<p>Both the endogenous and the recombinant Orb2 protein form sodium dodecyl sulphate (SDS) and urea-resistant oligomers that are characteristic of amyloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>]. However, it remains unclear to what extent the Orb2 amyloid behaves as a typical pathological amyloid. Both recombinant Orb2A and Orb2B bind to thioflavin T (ThT) and Congo red (CR) dyes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s002">S1A Fig</xref>), and this binding is inhibited by amyloid destabilizing reagents such as rottlerin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref023">23</xref>] or the polyphenol (-)-epigallocatechin gallate (EGCG: <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s002">S1B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref025">25</xref>]. The soluble form of both full-length isoforms has a helix-rich secondary structure monitored by Circular Dichroism (CD) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). However, over time both isoforms become rich in amyloid-specific <italic>β</italic>-sheets, as evidenced by Fourier transform infrared (FTIR) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), which coincides with aggregation of the protein, as monitored by turbidimetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Furthermore, transmission electron microscopy (TEM) showed Orb2A to form spherical oligomers and typical unbranched amyloid fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Interestingly, Orb2A adopted an amyloid structure more efficiently (without the typical lag phase) than other amyloids like the A<italic>β</italic>42 peptide or the yeast prion Sup35NM, with a t½ of ~15 min and at a protein concentration 8–10-fold lower (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Based on these observations, we conclude that, in isolation, Orb2A not only forms seemingly canonical amyloid structures but it also does so in an extremely efficient manner.</p>

<title>Prion-like Properties of Orb2A</title>
<p>In order to determine whether Orb2A amyloid possesses the self-sustaining properties of prion-like proteins, we took advantage of the well-characterized yeast prion Sup35, a translation termination factor that can exist in two states: as an active monomeric state (nonprion) and as a less active amyloid state (prion) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref026">26</xref>]. The conversion between those two states can be readily assessed by non-sense suppression of the mutant <italic>ade1-14</italic> allele. In the nonprion state of Sup35, yeast colonies appear red in rich media, and they cannot grow in media containing a limiting amount of Adenine (-ade media), while in the prion-state, read-through translation turns the colonies white and cells can grow in -ade media. We substituted the NM prion domain of the Sup35 protein with the N-terminal domain of Orb2A, Orb2B or a paralogue of Orb2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, Orb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1H</xref>, left), and these chimeric constructs were expressed under the control of Sup35 promoter, representing the sole source of the Sup35 protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref027">27</xref>]. While all these chimeric proteins substituted the essential function of the Sup35 protein, only Sup35 carrying the N-terminal domain of Orb2A produced two readily distinguishable phenotypes: red Ade<sup>-</sup> [<italic>prion</italic>-] and white Ade<sup>+</sup> [<italic>PRION</italic>+] colonies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1H</xref>, right). The Orb2A N-terminal domain produced the prion-like state with an unusually high frequency and perpetuated stably through hundreds of generations. Random selection of 100 colonies revealed that almost 50% of them spontaneously gave rise to white-pink Ade<sup>+</sup> colonies for Orb2A, compared to ~1% for Orb2B and none for Orb1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1H</xref>, right). Furthermore, the nonprion and prion-like states correlated with the monomeric and SDS-urea resistant amyloidogenic oligomeric states of Orb2, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s002">S1D Fig</xref>). These results indicate Orb2A is very efficient in adopting a self-sustaining amyloid-like state.</p>

<title>Boundaries and Conformational States of the Orb2A PLD</title>
<p>A group of the prion-like proteins characterized to date contain a PLD that is disordered and frequently composed of a Q/N rich sequence with a low content of charged residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref030">30</xref>]. In Orb2A, the entire PLD is composed of an N-terminal Q/N-rich domain (88 residues with 35.2%Q+N, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), which is followed by a 74-residue region containing few charged residues (6.8% compared to 21.6% in the rest of the Orb2A protein).</p>
<p>PLDs often adopt distinct conformational states, such as coiled-coil rich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref031">31</xref>] or stacked <italic>β</italic>-sheet rich structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref036">36</xref>]. The conformational switch can be gauged through their susceptibility to proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref037">37</xref>]. To determine the region of Orb2A PLD that adopts distinct conformational states, we inserted the tobacco etch virus (TEV) protease recognition motif (ENLYFQG) at the N-terminus of EGFP-tagged Orb2 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), and we measured the accessibility of the TEV protease to these sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref038">38</xref>]. Insertion of the TEV protease sites at the positions indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2A</xref> did not alter the ability of Orb2 to oligomerize (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s003">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>) or bind to mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s003">S2C Fig</xref>). We found that the TEV protease site located outside the N-terminal of Orb2A or Orb2B (Orb2A162TEV, Orb2A216TEV and Orb2B370TEV) was cleaved efficiently and equivalently in both the oligomeric and the monomeric forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). However, when the TEV site was located within the first 162 residues of Orb2A (Orb2A88TEV), or within the first 242 residues of Orb2B (Orb2B242TEV), most of the oligomers and a fraction of the monomers were not cleaved by TEV after 24h incubation with TEV protease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This differential cleavage of monomers implies that: i) the 88 N-terminal residues are not inherently inaccessible; and ii) there is a conformational variability even among monomeric forms.</p>

<p>To further explore the conformational variability in the monomer population and to rule out the possibility that resistant monomers were not simply oligomers that have dissociated, we obtained protein fractions containing primarily monomeric Orb2 by differential centrifugation. When the TEV protease site is within the first 162 residues of Orb2A, only a fraction of the monomeric protein is accessible to TEV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). These results suggest that the N-terminal Q/N rich region that ends at residue 162 is most likely the boundary of the PLD and that this domain can adopt at least two distinct conformational states: a protease-accessible monomeric state and a protease inaccessible state in both monomeric and oligomeric forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s004">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Dissection of the Orb2A PLD</title>
<p>PLDs are often organized such that two distinct regions mediate the initiation of aggregation and recruitment to the aggregate for self-perpetuation. To determine whether the Orb2A PLD has this organization, we studied the recruitment of red-labelled proteins into EGFP-labelled preformed aggregates using a cell fusion-based assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref039">39</xref>]. Three distinct Orb2AΔPLD-Cherry fluorescent protein constructs that lacked specific regions of the PLD were generated: Orb2AΔ1-88-Cherry, Orb2AΔ88-162-Cherry, or Orb2AΔ1-162-Cherry. We fused S2 cells carrying Orb2A-EGFP to Orb2AΔPLD-Cherry expressing cells by inducing the expression of the <italic>Caenorabditis elegans</italic> epithelial fusion failure 1 (EFF-1) protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref039">39</xref>], which causes cell fusion via a homotypic interaction and the mixing of cytoplasmic but not nuclear components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). While Orb2AΔ1-88-Cherry expression appeared mostly diffuse by itself, in the fused cells this protein variant formed large puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Orb2AΔ88-162-Cherry formed few puncta by itself but co-aggregated efficiently with full-length Orb2A-EGFP to form large fluorescence puncta. By contrast, Orb2AΔ1-162-Cherry, which lacks the entire PLD, failed to form any such aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Since only Orb2A-EGFP efficiently induced the formation of Orb2AΔ88-Cherry puncta but not EGFP, Orb2B-EGFP, or Orb1-EGFP, these results indicate that the intramolecular interaction is highly specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). Surprisingly, the Orb2A protein from <italic>D</italic>. <italic>willistoni</italic>, which is ~81% identical to the <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> protein, forms puncta when it is expressed in S2 cells. However, Orb2A from <italic>D</italic>. <italic>willistoni</italic> failed to induce the aggregation of Orb2AΔ88-Cherry into puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), indicating that this is a species-specific process. These data suggest that the organization of Orb2A’s PLD resembles that of other prion-like proteins, whereby the first 88 residues are important for initiating aggregation, and residues 88–162 are important for the recruitment into preformed aggregates.</p>

<title>A Single Point Mutation in Orb2A Affects Its Amyloidogenic and Prion-like Properties</title>
<p>One surprising feature of PLDs is that although the domains can substitute each other, the amino acid sequence of the various PLDs are distinct. Therefore, it remains unclear to what extent individual amino acids at various positions contribute to the prion-like properties. Intriguingly, previously we found that a F to Y substitution at the 5th position of the Orb2A PLD—representing the addition of a single hydroxyl group—dramatically reduced Orb2 oligomerization and impaired memory consolidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>]. This prompted us to determine the role of the 5th residue in amyloid formation and what aspects of amyloid formation (e.g., recruitment) and/or prion-like behaviour (i.e., self-sustaining properties) are affected by this mutation.</p>
<p>To address these issues, the F5 residue was substituted for 18 different residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), and Orb2A puncta stability was quantified using fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP). Remarkably, substitution of F5 with any residue except the highly hydrophobic ones (V, I, L, or W, only exception being E) strongly destabilized Orb2A oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). ThT binding to Orb2A variants correlated with FRAP results, and the Orb2AF5Y mutant showed the weakest enhancement in ThT fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). To determine whether this 5th residue might also play an important role in oligomer packing, in addition to affecting the rate of Orb2A oligomerization, we performed fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) assay. FRET efficiency depends on the distance between the fluorophores, which in turn depends on the orientation and packing of the protein subunits in the homo-oligomer. Surprisingly, only the F5L, F5W, F5S, F5Q and F5P (One-way ANOVA, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05) substitutions produced an average FRET efficiency similar to the efficiency observed in the wild-type protein. Moreover, the F5Y substitution produced aggregates with very variable FRET efficiency, whereas all other substitutions decreased the average FRET efficiency (*<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), suggesting that the nature of the 5th residue is important in oligomer packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Thus, the 5th residue of Orb2A seems to mediate a key intramolecular interaction important for the oligomerization process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref040">40</xref>].</p>

<p>We then asked whether this perturbation in oligomer packing and stability affected the prion-like behaviour of Orb2A (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Remarkably, this single residue substitution dramatically interfered with the capacity of the Orb2A’s PLD to adopt a stable prion-like state, as concluded from a chimeric yeast prion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3E</xref>), coinciding with the reduction in the SDS-urea resistant amyloidogenic oligomeric states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). The Orb2AF5Y-EGFP mutant also impaired the formation of Orb2AΔ1-88-Cherry puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3G</xref>), and this PLD variant exhibited impaired capability to aggregate, as measured by turbidimetry and far-UV CD spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s005">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>).

<title>Orb2 Shares Common Features with the Pathological Amyloidogenic Pathway</title>
<p>The possible existence of intrinsic differences (related to protein structure or/and dynamics) between functional and pathological amyloidogenic pathways prompted us to carry out a comprehensive analysis on the various stages of amyloid formation.</p>
<p>The monomeric species of amyloidogenic proteins represent the starting point and a key determinant of the amyloidogenic cascade. The conformational changes that occur in the monomeric protein are difficult to study with bulk structural techniques because of the coexistence of many conformational states in a dynamic equilibrium. However, single-molecule techniques, like atomic force microscopy-based single molecule force spectroscopy (AFM-SMFS), allow the determination of the conformational diversity of these monomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref041">41</xref>]. We focused on the disordered region comprising the first 162 amino acid residues of Orb2A-PLD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s006">S5A Fig</xref>) as the sequence that is necessary and sufficient for prion-like behaviour and amyloid formation, as well as for memory consolidation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref021">21</xref>]. We performed AFM-SMFS in the length-clamp mode (at a constant pulling speed of 0.4 nm/ms) in order to compare the amyloidogenic properties of Orb2A PLD with those of pathological amyloids at the monomer level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref041">41</xref>]. As a single-molecule reporter, we constructed a fusion protein whereby the Orb2A PLD was mechanically protected inside the fold of a reference protein (carrier), rendering it amenable to unequivocal single-molecule analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s006">S5B Fig</xref>). Prior to AFM-SMFS analysis, to verify that both the PLD region and the carrier in the fusion protein preserve their structural integrity, we performed 1D <sup>1</sup>H and 2D <sup>1</sup>H nuclear Overhauser effect spectroscopy (NOESY) nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) and far-UV CD spectroscopies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s006">S5C–S5E Fig</xref>). Furthermore, turbidimetry analysis, CR binding, and negative-staining TEM experiments corroborate that the PLD region maintains its amyloidogenic properties when protected inside the fold of the carrier (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s007">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>For SMFS analysis, after fitting the force-extension recordings to the worm-like chain (WLC) model of polymer elasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref043">43</xref>], we found that Orb2A PLD exhibited a rich mechanical conformational polymorphism that could be classified into two general classes of conformers depending on their mechanical resistance to unfolding (<italic>F</italic>): nonmechanically resistant, or NM, (<italic>F</italic> ≤ 20 pN, 62.3% NM) and mechanically resistant, or M, (<italic>F</italic> &gt; 20 pN, 37.7% M) conformers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s008">S7 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s017">S1 Table</xref>). Within the M class, a variety of monomeric conformers with different mechanical stabilities were observed. These conformers showed resistance barriers (often more than one per molecule) located at a number of positions, as measured by the length released upon unfolding (increase in contour length, Δ<italic>L</italic><sub><italic>c</italic></sub>), indicating the high conformational diversity of Orb2A PLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s008">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s009">S8A–S8C Fig</xref>). Like in other pathological amyloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref041">41</xref>], we observed extremely stable M conformers whose unfolding forces approached the values needed to break a covalent bond [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref044">44</xref>]. Intriguingly, it must be noted that some of these M conformers might be related to the prion conformers stabilized by strong noncovalent forces thought to account for prion inheritance and transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref037">37</xref>]. Interestingly, the F5Y mutation showed a significantly reduced conformational polymorphism, as measured by SMFS (10.1% of M conformers; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s009">S8D–S8F Fig</xref>). This reduction is in agreement with the decreased ability of the F5Y variant to form self-perpetuating amyloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s005">S4 Fig</xref>) and the failure to stabilize memory beyond 48 h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>].</p>

<title>Orb2 Forms Transient Toxic Oligomers</title>
<p>The similarities in the amyloidogenic cascade between Orb2A and pathological amyloids led us to wonder why, despite these common features, Orb2A is functional rather than toxic to the cell. One possibility is that the lifetime of the toxic oligomers formed by Orb2A and pathological amyloids is different. To test this possibility, we first used the two aforementioned conformational specific antibodies raised against A<italic>β</italic>: A11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref045">45</xref>] and OC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref046">46</xref>]. We found that Orb2 initially formed A11-reactive SDS-sensitive oligomers that rapidly (minutes time scale) evolved to form at least two different OC-reactive species: a SDS-sensitive species and a more mature, SDS-resistant species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<p>In the light of these data, and to determine whether the transient Orb2 oligomers are indeed cytotoxic, we used conformational trapping with two small inhibitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5C</xref>): EGCG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref047">47</xref>] and Amphotericin B (AmB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref048">48</xref>]. We found that AmB slowed down Orb2A assembly and arrested it in the A11-reactive conformation, while EGCG seemed to direct the protein to the fibril state through a pathway that does not involve the formation of toxic A11-reactive oligomers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). To test cell viability, the different samples were microinjected into cultured cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref049">49</xref>]: Orb2A and the Orb2A:EGCG complex, in which Orb2A is stabilized in the OC-reactive conformation, were not cytotoxic, similar to the negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). By contrast, the Orb2A:AmB complex, which is stabilized in the A11-reactive oligomeric state, caused extensive and acute cell death 24 h after microinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s010">S9 Fig</xref>). Notably, incubation of the Orb2A:AmB complex with a very low concentration of the conformational A11 antibody (complex:A11, 100:1) attenuated this toxicity, indicating that toxicity was indeed due to the A11 specific conformation acquired by Orb2A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5E and 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s010">S9 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine whether these differences in kinetic parameters are inherent features of nontoxic and toxic amyloids, we performed a domain swapping analysis between Orb2A and a disease-associated version of Huntingtin Htt exon 1 (ex1HttQ72). We compared ex1HttQ72 with two chimeric proteins in which the PLD and the Q-rich region have been swapped (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s011">S10A Fig</xref>). When the Q-rich region of ex1Htt was substituted with Orb2A PLD, it formed nontoxic, short-lived species reactive to the A11 antibody, similar to Orb2A (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Conversely, the substitution of the PLD of Orb2A by the Q-rich region of the expanded ex1Htt resulted in the formation of stable A11-reactive species that exhibited a high cytotoxicity, similar to that found for ex1HttQ72 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s011">S10B–S10D Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Orb2A can form a toxic conformer, which structurally resembles that of toxic amyloids. However, intrinsic structural features in Orb2A-PLD renders this toxic conformation rare and transient; furthermore, it appears that Orb2A may have evolved to form mature amyloidogenic oligomers much more efficiently than pathological amyloids.</p>

<title>Orb2 Can Be Trapped by Pathological Amyloids</title>
<p>Our observations suggest that in solution, Orb2 and polypeptides that form pathological amyloids sample similar conformational ensembles. We wondered whether in spite of being transient and rare, because of their structural similarity, these Orb2 transient toxic conformations could be hijacked by similar, yet longer-lived conformers from neurotoxic amyloids. To test this hypothesis, we coexpressed EGFP-tagged Orb2A protein with the Huntingtin protein-containing expanded polyQ repeats (HttQ128) in the larval motor neuron. HttQ128, unlike Orb2A, is neurotoxic, and its chronic expression produces lethality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref050">50</xref>]. In contrast to when it is expressed alone, Orb2A formed larger fluorescence puncta in the presence of HttQ128, indicative of its aggregation, and in some cases these Orb2A puncta were surrounded by HttQ128 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s012">S11A Fig</xref>). The effect of HttQ128 on Orb2 appears to be specific, given that it had no obvious effect on other EGFP-tagged proteins, such as the synaptic protein synaptotagmin or the Golgi-associated protein GRASP-65, used as negative controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s012">S11B Fig</xref>). Similarly, removal of the PLD from Orb2A abrogated its HttQ128-enhanced aggregation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Since the structural properties of Orb2A are similar to those of the NM PLD of yeast prion Sup35, we also studied a chimeric protein in which the Orb2A PLD was substituted with the Sup35 PLD. Consistent with the structural studies, this chimeric construct was also recruited into the HttQ128 aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g005">Fig 5G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s012">S11C Fig</xref>). These results suggest that pathological amyloids, when present in excess, can nucleate Orb2A aggregation, presumably by capturing the transient toxic conformers of Orb2 proteins.</p>

<title>A Small Anti-amyloidogenic Peptide Blocks Orb2 Amyloidogenesis</title>
<p>Polyglutamine-binding peptide 1 (QBP1) is a known inhibitor of the amyloidogenesis of HttQ expansions. This hydrophobic peptide binds monomeric expanded polyQ proteins and blocks the initial critical <italic>β</italic>-conformational transition of these species, suppressing their subsequent oligomerization and fibrillogenesis, and consequently, the associated cytotoxicity and neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref053">53</xref>]. QBP1 acts as a polyvalent anti-amyloidogenic agent on several amyloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref041">41</xref>], and thus, we examined the potential inhibitory effect of the minimal active core of QBP1 (Ac-WKWWPGIF-NH<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref054">54</xref>] on Orb2A amyloid formation. The conformational similarity at the monomer level between Orb2 and HttQ prompted us to further examine whether QBP1 could inhibit Orb2A amyloid formation.</p>
<p>Isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) revealed that QBP1 physically interacts with Orb2A, and that complex formation, a slow event, was exothermic in nature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Under similar conditions, a scrambled version of QBP1 (SCR, Ac-WPIWKGWF-NH<sub>2</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref054">54</xref>] interacted poorly, serving as a negative control in the subsequent experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Unlike the SCR, incubation with QBP1 inhibited Orb2A PLD aggregation and amyloidogenesis, as monitored by turbidimetry and CR binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Far-UV CD spectroscopy revealed that QBP1, but not SCR, suppressed Orb2A PLD signal loss due to protein precipitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). Furthermore, TEM showed a significant reduction in the formation of both oligomers and fibers in the presence of QBP1 but not the SCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g006">Fig 6E</xref>) compared to Orb2A PLD alone (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Consistent with these results, the SMFS analysis revealed that Orb2A PLD treated with QBP1 formed fewer M conformers (from 37.7% to 16.1%), shifting the NM/M proportion towards an increased population of NM conformers, while SCR had no effect on this initial conformational transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g006">Fig 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s013">S12 Fig</xref>). Together, these results indicate that QBP1 interferes with Orb2 amyloid formation in vitro and suggest that early in amyloidogenesis, Orb2 and some pathological amyloid-forming polypeptides adopt similar conformations that are recognized and blocked by QBP1.</p>

<title>QBP1 Interferes with Memory Consolidation</title>
<p>Based on the fact that QBP1 inhibits the transition from the monomeric Orb2A state to conformations that lead to amyloid formation, we tested in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> the physiological consequences of QBP1 expression on memory consolidation. To this end, we used the male courtship suppression memory paradigm, in which a virgin male repeatedly exposed to unreceptive females learns to suppress courtship towards them, and this learned suppression persisted for days. Using the Gal4-UAS system, the QBP1-cyan fluorescent protein (CFP) or SCR-CFP peptides were expressed panneuronally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref053">53</xref>]. QBP1 expression in the nervous system, or that of the control SCR, did not affect fly development, although normal courtship behaviour was slightly dampened (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s014">S13 Fig</xref>). Following training, both experimental flies (Elav-Gal4:UAS-QBP1-CFP or SCR-CFP) and the genetic controls (Elav-Gal4 and UAS-QBP1 or UAS-SCR) displayed a similar suppression of courtship immediately after training, suggesting that the expression of these peptides does not interfere with learning or short-term memory. However, when measured after 24 h, the Elav-Gal4:UAS-QBP1 males displayed elevated courtship compared to the Elav-Gal4:UAS-SCR control flies, indicative of a loss of long-term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g007">Fig 7</xref>). To determine whether QBP1-mediated memory loss is independent of Orb2, we expressed QBP1 in Δ80QOrb2 flies that lack N-terminal Q-rich 80 amino acid residues of Orb2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g007">Fig 7</xref>). The Δ80QOrb2 flies form short-term memory but no long-term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref017">17</xref>]. Expression of QBP1 in Δ80QOrb2 had no additive effect in the loss of long-term memory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Since QBP1 is a low affinity peptide that can only block early stages of oligomerization but not already formed oligomer, we also investigated the consequence of transient expression of QBP1 in courtship suppression memory. To this end, we used RU486-inducible GeneSwitch Elav-Gal4 system and induced expression of the QBP1 peptide in the adult flies 24 h before training [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref055">55</xref>]. Transient expression of QBP1 had no effect on the long-term courtship suppression memory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s015">S14 Fig</xref>). Finally, to determine whether chronic expression of QBP1 results in general disruption of the nervous system, we trained the ElavGal4-UASQBP1 flies in a heat-box paradigm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s016">S15 Fig</xref>). In this operant conditioning paradigm, flies learn to avoid one side of an otherwise symmetrical chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref056">56</xref>]. Intriguingly, the heat box paradigm produces robust short-term memory, but the memory does not persist beyond an hour or two. The memory curve of QBP1 was similar to that of wild type flies, suggesting that QBP1 expression does not interfere with the animal’s ability to form short-lived memories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002361.s016">S15 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that chronic QBP1 expression can interfere with some form of long-term memory and the effects of QBP1 in memory may be partly mediated through Orb2.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Amyloids were discovered and primarily studied in the context of disease or nonfunctional states of proteins. The unique structural features of amyloids set them apart, endowing them with extraordinary stability and, in some cases, the unique capacity to self-perpetuate in a dominant manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref037">37</xref>]. The recent discovery of functional amyloids raises some fundamental questions as to what makes some amyloids pathological and others beneficial, how similar the structures of pathological and functional amyloids are, and how they are formed.</p>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>What Separates Toxic and Nontoxic Amyloids?</title>
<p>Here we have analyzed the structural states of Orb2A, an amyloidogenic protein that is important for memory consolidation. We find that Orb2A not only forms self-perpetuating amyloids but it does so extremely quickly and efficiently. Surprisingly, Orb2A has several structural features and properties that are similar to those of pathological amyloids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g008">Fig 8</xref>). First, the Orb2A monomer shows a rich conformational polymorphism with mechanical stabilities similar to those of the well-characterized pathological amyloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref041">41</xref>]. Second, Orb2 binds to the conformational antibody A11, which detects the toxic oligomeric species of pathological amyloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref045">45</xref>]. Third, like pathological amyloids, Orb2A can form unbranched amyloid fibers and pre-fibrillar oligomers that react against the conformational antibody OC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref060">60</xref>].

<title>Structural basis of memory consolidation mediated by Orb2 amyloid.</title>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the Orb2 protein (<bold>top</bold>) is a functional amyloid with self-sustaining prion-like properties that follows an amyloidogenic pathway resembling that of pathological amyloids (<bold>bottom</bold>). During the assembly pathway, Orb2 and pathological amyloids can form A11-reactive toxic oligomers, and Orb2 can be sequestered by pathological amyloids to form hetero-oligomers. However, intrinsic structural features make Orb2 toxic oligomers rare and transient, suggesting that this functional amyloid appears to have been honed by evolution in adopting a self-sustaining amyloid-like state much more efficiently than pathological amyloids in order to avoid cytotoxicity and perform its role in memory consolidation. This function is supported by the amyloid state of Orb2, since its inhibition by an anti-amyloidogenic peptide (QBP1) selectively interferes with the long-term persistence of memory.</p>

<p>What makes Orb2A PLD beneficial despite sharing all these features with pathological amyloids? Orb2 amyloid-like oligomers are formed in response to neuronal stimulation to support memory, which indicates the existence of a highly regulated mechanism in the cell to drive Orb2 amyloid formation and most likely to avoid the toxicity of its A11-reactive oligomers. One such regulation is the tight control of the Orb2A protein level via phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref020">20</xref>] and possibly other mechanisms. Here we show the existence of additional intrinsic kinetic factors in Orb2A, i.e., the lifespan of A11-reactive oligomers, which is probably related to its efficiency to form a functional amyloid state. We postulate that although the early events in Orb2 amyloid formation are similar to those of pathological amyloids, in subsequent steps it acquires structural features to rapidly evolve to a nontoxic amyloid-like state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g008">Fig 8</xref>). For Orb2 proteostasis, these intrinsic structural features could be further enhanced in the cell by association with other components or by the direct modification of proteins, such as phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref020">20</xref>]. Both the presence of A11-reactive oligomers and the ability to form amyloids efficiently have been also reported for the intracellular nonpathological amyloids of the yeast Sup35 prion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref048">48</xref>], which suggests that this may be a general mechanism for some amyloids to avoid cytotoxicity. Still, it must be noted that neuronal CPEB/Orb2 is the only known functional amyloid-like protein in the nervous system. This distinction is fundamental for two reasons: first, the nervous system is particularly susceptible to amyloid-based disease and; second, amyloids are known to interfere with cognitive abilities including memory.</p>

<title>Amyloid-like States as a Stable Substrate of Memory</title>
<p>The persistence of memories over months and years raises the fundamental question of how memory is protected against molecular turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref061">61</xref>]. Structural changes in individual proteins and in supramolecular protein assemblies have been proposed to play an important role in long-term memory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref063">63</xref>]. The prion features of the specific neuronal CPEB isoform, such as Orb2 in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref011">11</xref>], or CPEB3 in mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref012">12</xref>] that can adopt a self-sustaining state at synapses very rapidly, provide a plausible solution as to how memories can remain stable in the face of constant molecular turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref064">64</xref>]. Although exactly to what extent the self-sustaining amyloidogenic properties observed in vitro reflect the in vivo properties remains unclear, accumulating evidence reinforces the hypothesis that an amyloid-like state of neuronal CPEB is involved in long-lasting memory. In this regard, the present study provides evidence that mutations in Orb2, such as the 5th residue in Orb2A, that are known to interfere with memory consolidation also impair the protein’s ability to attain a self-sustaining amyloidogenic state as monitored by in vitro measurements. Similarly, the expression of QBP1, an amyloid-blocking peptide, impairs memory consolidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g008">Fig 8</xref>). However, we are not sure whether the memory-disrupting effect of QBP1 is applicable for all forms of long-term memory or whether the effects of QBP1 in memory are mediated exclusively through the Orb2 protein. Furthermore, in the absence of atomic-level 3D structural analysis of endogenous CPEB protein in the amyloid-like state, it remains unclear exactly to what extent they are similar to toxic amyloids.</p>
<p>Our observations also highlight certain features of functional amyloids that may be relevant for neuropathologies of amyloid-based diseases. First, the short life span of Orb2 toxic oligomers supports a therapeutic approximation based on speeding up the conversion of toxic oligomers into stable amyloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref065">65</xref>]. Second, Orb2’s capacity to form toxic conformers resembling those of pathological amyloids, and its sequestration into HttQ128 aggregates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g008">Fig 8</xref>), suggests that pathological amyloids might hijack Orb2 into a nonfunctional state, impairing its physiological activity. Third, anti-amyloidogenic compounds that target early stages of amyloidogenic pathways might inadvertently interfere with functional amyloid formation, impairing their associated function. Finally, the polyvalent amyloid blocker QBP1, or improved analogues based on its recently determined structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref066">66</xref>], could be used in the future to block newly formed traumatic memories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g008">Fig 8</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref067">67</xref>]. However, we are cognisant of the inherent limitations of our ideas since none of our studies are carried out with human proteins in the human nervous system. These anticipated connections of our in vitro findings with memory need to be explored in detail.</p>

<title>FTIR Spectroscopy</title>
<p>FTIR spectroscopy was carried out using the same His-tagged recombinant proteins used in ThT binding assay. FTIR was performed with a Nicolet 6700 spectrometer equipped with a ZnSe multibounce ATR accessory. The instrument was corrected for ATR penetration. Spectra were collected at 2 cm<sup>-1</sup> resolution and averaged over 64 scans. Samples were precipitated by addition of methanol to a final concentration of 50% and incubated overnight at 4°C. Pellets were spread on the ATR and dried with a stream of air before each measurement. Spectra were corrected for water vapor by subtracting the background collected immediately after each scan scaled to fit the local shape of the spectrum in the 1,600–1,700 cm<sup>-1</sup> region. The liquid water spectrum was subtracted by matching the signal at 2,200 cm<sup>-1</sup> to a liquid water spectrum via linear least squares. A linear background between 1,580 and 1,720 cm<sup>-1</sup> was subtracted, and the spectrum in this region was normalized to obtain the final spectrum. The resulting spectra were fit to four Gauasian peaks with nonlinear least squares. All subtractions and fittings were performed using custom plugins written in ImageJ (NIH, Bethesda, MD) and are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins" xlink:type="simple">http://research.stowers.org/imagejplugins</ext-link>. The 1,620 cm<sup>-1</sup> band with a width of ~13 cm<sup>-1</sup> was assigned to extended cross-<italic>β</italic> sheet structures only found in amyloid proteins. The 1,637 cm<sup>-1</sup> band with a width fixed at 13 cm<sup>-1</sup> was assigned to typical <italic>β</italic>-sheet structures such as those found in concanavalin-A.

The yeast were grown in YPD media and plated on either YPD-agar or SC-agar lacking adenine and the [<italic>PSI</italic>+] colonies were selected 2–3 d after plating.

A courtship index (CI) was measured as the fraction of time the tested male spent chasing the female in a 10 min interval.

<title>Heat Box Paradigm</title>
<p>The heat box apparatus was built in the workshop of Konrad Ochsner at the Universitiy of Wuerzburg and is a modified version of the one used by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref074">74</xref>]. In brief, the heat chamber system consists of an array of 16 chambers (length, 29 mm; width, 4 mm; height, 2 mm) operated in parallel. Upper and counter ceilings are equipped with Peltier elements that control the temperature in the chamber. Glass side walls allow the transmission and detection of infrared light from an LED source (invisible to the flies). When a fly walks along the length of the chamber, it casts a shadow on a bar code reader (light gate array), and this signal is sent to a computer. The fly position signal from the bar code reader is sent to the computer with a frequency of 10 Hz. All experiments were conducted in complete darkness. Measurements are performed on at least three different days to avoid effects of daily variability. The experiment consists of a preference test, training and memory test. A computer controls the experiment in all three phases by continuously monitoring the time and direction of transition at the light gate. One half of the chamber is defined as the punished side and the other half as the unpunished side. These designations are switched for every experiment to avoid aftereffects of previous experiments (e.g., pheromones or stress signal). During the preference test (30 sec), the fly can explore the chamber at a constant temperature of 24°C, providing a measure of experience-independent spatial preference. In the training phase (4 min) the whole chamber is heated at 37°, whenever the fly enters the punished side and cools down to 24°C when it enters the unpunished side. In the following 3 min test phase, the temperature is kept constantly at 24°C. The performance index (PI) is calculated as the difference between the time the fly spent in the unpunished versus that in the punished side of the chamber divided by the total time. Thus, the PI can range from −1 to 1, with a PI of 0 indicating no side preference. The PI is a measure of heat avoidance and memory score during the training and memory test, respectively. To yield a measure of general activity, the sum of position changes over time is calculated. The thermosensitivity assay is recorded adjusting the temperature in the front versus back half of the chamber independently and also independent of the flies’ actions. It is stepped from 24°C on both sides to 24°C/37°C and 24°C/41°C for 1 min intervals, sequentially alternating the side with the higher temperature. The time spent on a given side is measured, and heat avoidance indices are calculated as above (PI). All animals that do not show substantial motor activity or do not experience punishment were excluded from the study.</p>

Consistent with its prion-like behaviour (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g001">Fig 1H</xref>), the proportion of Orb2A in the pellet fraction was higher, and it formed more SDS-resistant oligomers than Orb2B.

The expression of the TEV protease was induced by adding 0.7 mM CuSO<sub>4</sub>, and the cells were analyzed 12 h after induction. The punctuate appearance of Orb2AEGFP does not depend on protease expression when the TEV site was within the PLD (Orb2A88TEV), both in the presence or absence of the TEV protease. However, when the TEV lies outside the PLD (Orb2A216TEV), the C-terminus of Orb2A carrying the EGFP tag is cleaved in the presence of TEV protease, and the punctate appearance of Orb2A is no longer evident.

<title>The PLD can adopt distinct protease-accessible states in its monomeric form.</title>
<p>The studies of adult brain lysates suggested that the monomeric Orb2 proteins may also have distinct protease accessibilities. To test this, S2 cell extracts were first clarified by centrifugation at 10,000 × g to remove the large aggregates. The supernatant was centrifuged at 174,000 × g to obtain the supernatant and pellet fractions, and each fraction was treated with the TEV protease in a high salt solution. The N- and C-terminal fragments obtained by TEV protease cleavage are indicated. The TEV target sequence located inside the PLD of the Orb2A monomer in the pellet fraction (Orb2A88TEV or Orb2A216TEV) is inaccessible, whereas it is partly accessible in the monomer form that was found in the supernatant (Sup). When the TEV is located outside the Orb2A PLD, it is equally accessible in the supernatant and the pellet fraction (Orb2A216TEV). The N-terminal fragment of Orb2A (red) derived from the pellet fraction is not recognized by Ab273 (middle panel) but it is recognized by Ab2233, whereas both antibodies recognize the same fragment that partitions to the supernatant. When the TEV site is in the Orb2B PLD (Orb2B242TEV), it was partially accessible to the protease, while in Orb2B from the supernatant and pellet fractions it was fully accessible when the TEV site lies outside the PLD (Orb2B370TEV). Unlike Orb2A, in Orb2B the N-terminal fragment derived from both the pellet and supernatant fractions is recognized by Ab273 and Ab2233.</p>

Compared to the spectrum of I27 that carries a small loop resulting from the translation of the multicloning site (I27-MCS, black), in the I27-Orb2A PLD spectrum (blue) the signals of native I27 are retained but somewhat broadened due to the slower tumbling, indicating that I27 remains folded while Orb2A PLD is still disordered. <bold>(E)</bold> Left panel: 2-D <sup>1</sup>H NOESY spectrum of I27 (black) showing the downfield region.

<title>Expression of QBP1 interferes with long-term male courtship suppression.</title>
<p>CI of male flies that were exposed to an unreceptive female was compared to that of naïve, untrained male flies. Pan-neuronal expression of QBP1 using the Elav-Gal4 driver interferes with long-term but not short-term memory, while the SCR control peptide has no effect (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002361.g007">Fig 7</xref>).

<title>Transient expression of QBP1 does not interfere with long-term memory.</title>
<p>The QBP1 peptide was expressed in the adult nervous system 1 d prior to the behavioral training using the RU486-inducible GeneSwitch-Gal4 system. The 3–4 d old flies were fed with 1 mM RU486 for 24 h to induce the expression of QBP1. Following drug feeding the flies were trained in the male courtship suppression paradigm and memory was measured at 24 h. Both control (-RU486) and experimental groups showed significant courtship suppression at 24 h, suggesting that long-term memory was not affected by the transient expression of QBP1.

<title>QBP1 expression does not interfere with short-term avoidance memory.</title>
<p><bold>Top</bold>. Schematic of the single training protocol in the heat box operant conditioning paradigm. In this operant conditioning paradigm, individual flies were conditioned to avoid one side of a uniform chamber [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002361.ref074">74</xref>]. Each time the fly enters the predetermined “punish” side of the chamber, the temperature of the entire chamber is heated to 37°C and the temperature is brought back to 24°C when the fly moves to the other “unpunished” side. Following training, the flies learn to avoid the punish side even in the absence of punishment. Memory is measured as the duration of the preferred response for unpunished side. Flies are either trained in a single trial protocol or multiple trial protocol where the single training protocol is repeated successively the indicted times. <bold>Bottom</bold>. The avoidance index after each training session. With repeated training, the avoidance index increases, and after six training sessions the performance plateaus. There was no significant difference in the performance between wild type flies and flies expressing QBP1 chronically in the nervous system.
