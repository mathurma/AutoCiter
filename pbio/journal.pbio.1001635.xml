<p>The HILDA complex coordinates three regulatory elements located in the 3′ UTR of the <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA in a RNA switch that controls translation in response to inflammation and hypoxia.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cell regulatory circuits integrate diverse, and sometimes conflicting, environmental cues to generate appropriate, condition-dependent responses. Here, we elucidate the components and mechanisms driving a protein-directed RNA switch in the 3′UTR of vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A. We describe a novel HILDA (hypoxia-inducible hnRNP <italic>L</italic>–<italic>D</italic>RBP76–hnRNP <italic>A</italic>2/B1) complex that coordinates a three-element RNA switch, enabling <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA translation during combined hypoxia and inflammation. In addition to binding the CA-rich element (CARE), heterogeneous nuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L regulates switch assembly and function. hnRNP L undergoes two previously unrecognized, condition-dependent posttranslational modifications: IFN-γ induces prolyl hydroxylation and von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-mediated proteasomal degradation, whereas hypoxia stimulates hnRNP L phosphorylation at Tyr<sup>359</sup>, inducing binding to hnRNP A2/B1, which stabilizes the protein. Also, phospho-hnRNP L recruits DRBP76 (double-stranded RNA binding protein 76) to the 3′UTR, where it binds an adjacent AU-rich stem-loop (AUSL) element, “flipping” the RNA switch by disrupting the GAIT (interferon-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) element, preventing GAIT complex binding, and driving robust <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA translation. The signal-dependent, HILDA complex coordinates the function of a trio of neighboring RNA elements, thereby regulating translation of <italic>VEGFA</italic> and potentially other mRNA targets. The <italic>VEGFA</italic> RNA switch might function to ensure appropriate angiogenesis and tissue oxygenation during conflicting signals from combined inflammation and hypoxia. We propose the <italic>VEGFA</italic> RNA switch as an archetype for signal-activated, protein-directed, multi-element RNA switches that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression in complex environments.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many cells of our body, particularly cells such as monocyte/macrophages involved in host immunity, are exposed to diverse and constantly changing environments. These cells require mechanisms by which they can rapidly respond to multiple, sometimes conflicting, environmental cues to generate appropriate responses. The 3′ untranslated regions (UTRs), i.e. the noncoding tail of messenger RNAs, often contain multiple protein- and RNA-binding elements, thereby making it an ideal setting for receiving multiple such environmental cues, which can then be integrated into a single response that regulates the gene's expression. Monocytic cells exposed to inflammation and hypoxia produce vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A, a critical factor in blood vessel formation. VEGF-A expression is regulated under these conditions via a complex regulatory mechanism that involves its 3′UTR. Here we show how this regulatory switch works. Inflammation induces formation of a four-protein complex that binds an RNA element present in the <italic>VEGFA</italic> 3′UTR and blocks translation. Hypoxia, however, triggers the assembly of a completely different three-protein complex (termed “HILDA”) that coordinates the function of three neighboring RNA elements to “flip” the RNA conformation in such a way that prevents the first complex from binding, thereby allowing VEGF-A expression. We hypothesize that the <italic>VEGFA</italic> switch might function to ensure appropriate angiogenesis and tissue oxygenation when cells are exposed to conflicting signals from combined inflammation and hypoxia conditions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mammalian cells integrate diverse, and sometimes conflicting, environmental signals to generate appropriate, condition-dependent responses. Tissue myeloid cells are exposed to a plethora of stimulatory and inhibitory signals, and thus its integrated response is particularly complex. This task is made more problematical, and possibly more critical, in dynamic, pathological environments. Myeloid cell vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF)-A is critical for blood vessel formation during development, wound-healing, and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Tammela1">[1]</xref>. Hypoxia is possibly the most potent agonist of VEGF-A expression, working at the levels of transcription, mRNA stabilization, and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Hua1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Pages1">[3]</xref>. VEGF-A synthesis is induced in monocyte/macrophages activated by pro-inflammatory agonists, including interferon (IFN)-γ and bacterial lipopolysaccharide. Overproduction of VEGF-A can cause excessive neovascularization, blood vessel permeability, and enhanced leukocyte recruitment, all hallmarks of chronic inflammatory conditions, including cancer and atherosclerosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ferrara1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Zittermann1">[6]</xref>. Agents that inhibit VEGF-A or its receptor have been applied clinically to successfully limit colorectal and renal cell carcinoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Kamba1">[7]</xref>. Positive and negative regulation of VEGF-A expression has been reported in human macrophages in multiple stressed conditions. We have shown that VEGF-A expression in myeloid cells is translationally repressed by the IFN-γ-triggered GAIT (interferon-gamma-activated inhibitor of translation) system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Yao1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Yao2">[9]</xref>. Importantly, under certain pathological conditions, for example within the avascular cores of tumors and in the thickened intima of atherosclerotic lesions, macrophages are simultaneously exposed to both inflammatory cytokines and hypoxia that act concurrently in multiple pathophysiological scenarios to regulate gene expression.</p>
<p>Treatment of human monocytic cells with IFN-γ induces the synthesis of <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA and protein for up to about 12 to 16 h. However, VEGF-A synthesis and secretion are suppressed about 16 h after IFN-γ treatment despite the presence of abundant <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray1">[10]</xref>. Translational silencing of <italic>VEGFA</italic> and other GAIT targets requires binding of the GAIT complex to its cognate GAIT element in the target mRNA 3′UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray1">[10]</xref>. The GAIT element is a defined 29-nt stem-loop with an internal bulge and unique sequence and structural features. The human GAIT complex is heterotetrameric containing glutamyl-prolyl-tRNA synthetase (EPRS), ribosomal protein L13a, NS1-associated protein–1, and glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GAPDH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Mazumder1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Sampath1">[12]</xref>. A C-terminus truncated form of EPRS, termed EPRS<sup>N1</sup>, functions as a dominant-negative regulator of GAIT complex activity and maintains basal expression of VEGF-A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Yao3">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>RNA-binding proteins (RBPs) that regulate mRNA stability or translation generally recognize their target mRNAs through structural or sequence-specific elements in the 5′ or 3′UTRs of mature mRNAs. The activity of trans-acting RBPs can be modulated by dosage (in turn regulated by synthesis rate and stability), cellular localization, posttranslational modification, noncoding RNAs, and interacting protein partners. Heteronuclear ribonucleoprotein (hnRNP) L is a key posttranscriptional regulator of VEGF-A expression. Human hnRNP L has three consensus RNA recognition motifs (RRM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Guang1">[14]</xref> and binds CA-rich elements (CARE) in coding and noncoding regions of multiple transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Hui1">[15]</xref>. hnRNP L contributes to pre-mRNA splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Rothrock1">[16]</xref>, mRNA nucleocytoplasmic transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Guang1">[14]</xref>, internal ribosomal entry site-mediated translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Hahm1">[17]</xref>, translational repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Hamilton1">[18]</xref>, and mRNA stabilization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Shih1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms by which signal transduction systems integrate multiple environmental cues into a binary response that determines gene expression remain largely unexplored. We have reported that hnRNP L operates a hypoxia-stimulated, binary conformational RNA switch that overrides IFN-γ-induced GAIT-mediated translational silencing of <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA in human monocytic U937 cells and in primary human peripheral blood monocytes (PBMs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref>. The proposed switch permits high-level VEGF-A expression under combined inflammatory and hypoxic stress. Here we elucidate the molecular mechanism underlying the IFN-γ- and hypoxia-dependent regulatory RNA switch. The switching mechanism involves condition-dependent posttranslational modification and relocalization of hnRNP L, and subsequent formation of an hnRNP L-containing heterotrimeric complex that stabilizes the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR in a translation-competent conformation.</p>

<title>VEGFA RNA Switch Is a Heterotrimeric Complex Containing hnRNP L, DRBP76, and hnRNP A2/B1</title>
<p>HnRNP L is an essential component of the RNA switch that blocks GAIT-mediated translational silencing of <italic>VEGF-A</italic> mRNA, and permits high-level expression of VEGF-A in myeloid cells in the presence of IFN-γ and hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref>. To determine whether hnRNP L is sufficient for RNA switch function, the activity of recombinant protein was determined by <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of luciferase reporter bearing the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR in a wheat germ extract system in the presence of active GAIT complex from IFN-γ-treated U937 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). hnRNP L failed to overcome the translational repression suggesting that posttranslational modification of hnRNP L or additional protein factors may be required. Identical results were seen using a rabbit reticulocyte lysate system (not shown). Hypoxia-dependent hnRNP L binding partners were determined by RNA affinity purification using a 30-nt, 5′-biotinylated, extended CARE (CARE-E) from the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To reduce nonspecific binding, lysates from U937 cells incubated under normoxic or hypoxic conditions were pre-cleared with an excess of 5′-biotinylated antisense CARE-E RNA in which CA pairs were mutated to GU. Cleared lysates were incubated with biotinylated, wild-type CARE-E RNA and μMAC magnetic streptavidin microbeads, and applied to a magnetic column. Bound proteins were eluted with salt solution, concentrated, and subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Bands enriched in lysates from hypoxia-treated cells were subjected to mass spectrometric analysis, and peptides corresponding to hnRNP L, hnRNP A2/B1, and DRBP76 (nuclear factor 90 or interleukin enhancer binding factor 3) were identified (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s016">Table S1</xref>). Binding of the proteins to CARE RNA was confirmed by RNA affinity isolation and immunoblot analysis of lysates from hypoxia-treated U937 cells. A hypoxia-inducible complex of hnRNP L, DRBP76, and hnRNP A2/B1 (HILDA) was shown to bind wild-type but not mutant antisense CARE RNA; substantially less binding of the three proteins to CARE RNA was observed in normoxic lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Recombinant hnRNP L by itself does not drive the <italic>VEGFA</italic> RNA switch and restore <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of the GAIT-element-bearing reporter. <italic>In vitro</italic> translation of capped and poly(A)-tailed firefly luciferase (<italic>FLuc</italic>)-<italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR-A<sub>30</sub> reporter transcript was determined in a wheat germ extract in the presence of [<sup>35</sup>S]Met, cytosolic extracts from IFN-γ-treated U937 cells, and recombinant hnRNP L. FLuc expression was determined by activity assay, normalized by RLuc expression, and reported as mean ± standard deviation (SD, <italic>n</italic> = 3). (B) Schematic of HSR in <italic>VEGFA</italic> 3′UTR. CARE (red), GAIT element (green), extended CARE (CARE-E, dotted line), AUSL-A (dashed line), and AUSL-D (dashed and dotted line) are indicated. (C) Mass spectrometric analysis of CARE-binding proteins. U937 cells were treated with normoxia (Nmx.) or hypoxia (Hpx.) for 24 h and the S100 extracts, precleared, and incubated with biotinylated CARE-E (extended CARE, sequences in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and magnetic streptavidin microbeads. Specifically bound proteins were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining. Bands specifically enriched in affinity-purified lysates from hypoxia-treated cells were trypsinized, and peptide sequences of hnRNP L, DRBP76, and hnRNP A2/B1 detected by mass spectrometry. (D) Hypoxia-inducible binding of hnRNP L, DRBP76, and hnRNP A2/B1 to CARE. Cells were treated with Nmx. or Hpx. for 24 h, and the precleared S100 extracts incubated with biotinylated, wild-type, or antisense (A.S.) CARE-E, and then with magnetic streptavidin microbeads. Specifically bound proteins were subjected to immunoblot analysis. (E) DRBP76 and hnRNP A2/B1 form a complex with hnRNP L <italic>in vivo</italic>. Cells were treated with IFN-γ in Nmx. or Hpx. for 24 h. Cell lysates were incubated with or without RNase A, immunoprecipitated with anti-hnRNP L antibody, and subjected to immunoblot analysis (left panel). Total expression of hnRNP L, hnRNP A2/B1, and DRBP76 was determined by immunoblot as input control (right panel). (F) Interprotein interactions of HILDA constituents. Recombinant hnRNP A2/B1 and DRBP76 were incubated with GST-hnRNP L or GST immobilized to glutathione (GSH)-agarose beads. After washing, binding was detected by immunoblot (left). Recombinant hnRNP L and DRBP76 were incubated with GST-hnRNP A2/B1 or GST immobilized to GSH-agarose beads (right). (G) hnRNP L domain mapping. <italic>In vitro</italic> synthesized S<sup>35</sup>-Met-labeled hnRNP L segments (top) were incubated with cytosol from U937 cells. hnRNP A2/B1 (left) and DRBP76 (right) were immunoprecipitated, and the interacting hnRNP L segments detected by autoradiorgraphy. Key hnRNP L domains are shown above.</p>

<p>The formation of an RNA-binding heterotrimeric complex was investigated by co-immunoprecipitation (IP). Lysates from U937 cells and primary human PBM treated with IFN-γ under normoxic or hypoxic conditions were subjected to IP with anti-hnRNP L antibody, and probed with hnRNP A2/B1- and DRBP76-specific antibodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, left panel). A hypoxia-dependent interaction of hnRNP L with hnRNP A2/B1 and DRBP76 was observed. The interaction between hnRNP L and hnRNP A2/B1 was RNA-independent as shown by the lack of an effect of RNase A treatment. However, the RNase diminished the interaction between hnRNP L and DRBP76, suggesting that the hnRNP L-DRBP76 complex is stabilized by RNA. The expression levels of the three HILDA complex constituents were not altered by hypoxia exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, right panel). <italic>In vitro</italic> GST-pulldown experiments showed that recombinant GST-hnRNP L directly interacted with recombinant hnRNP A2/B1 and DRBP76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, left panel). In a parallel experiment, GST-hnRNP A2/B1 was found to directly bind hnRNP L but not DRBP76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, right panel). hnRNP L contains an N-terminal glycine-rich domain, three RNA-binding motifs (RRM1–3), and a proline-rich linker domain connecting RRM2 and RRM3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, top). Domain mapping experiments revealed that hnRNP A2/B1 binds the proline-rich linker in hnRNP L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, left). In contrast, the RRM3-containing, C-terminal domain of hnRNP L was the binding site for DRBP76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1G</xref>, right).</p>
<p>EPRS and hnRNP L from IFN-γ-treated U937 cells, in either normoxia or hypoxia, bind <italic>in vitro</italic> synthesized <italic>VEGF-A</italic> HSR in a mutually exclusive manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref>. To provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence of the VEGF-A switch, RNA from cells treated with IFN-γ in the presence of normoxia or hypoxia for 24 h were immunoprecipitated with anti-EPRS and -hnRNP L antibodies and subjected to qRT-PCR using transcript-specific primers. GAIT complex EPRS and HILDA complex hnRNP L recognized and bound <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA following stimulation by IFN-γ under normoxic and hypoxic conditions, respectively, consistent with previous results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref>. To determine whether hnRNP A2/B1 or DRBP76 are required for hnRNP L binding to <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA, lysates from cells treated with IFN-γ and hypoxia were subjected to ribonucleoprotein IP (RIP) using anti-hnRNP L antibody, coupled with RT-PCR. hnRNP L interacted with <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA in control transfected cells; however, the interaction was substantially reduced following siRNA-mediated depletion of either hnRNP A2/B1 or DRBP76 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Similarly, the interaction of hnRNP A2/B1 or DRBP76 with <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA required the presence of the other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s002">Figure S2</xref>, left and center panels). Moreover, the interaction of hnRNP A2/B1 and DRBP76 with <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA was abolished following hnRNP L depletion by siRNA-mediated gene silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s002">Figure S2</xref>, right panels), suggesting that HILDA binding to <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA requires integrity of the entire complex. To begin to understand the roles of the individual protein components in RNA switch activity, their binding sites within the HSR region were mapped by UV-crosslinking. Of the three proteins, only hnRNP L and DRBP76 directly bind the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR. Interestingly, the two interacting proteins bind different regions of the HSR, hnRNP L binds the CARE, whereas DRBP76 binds the AU-rich stem loop (AUSL) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The less robust binding to the individual ascending (AUSL-A) and descending (AUSL-D) regions of the AUSL suggests that DRBP76 stabilizes the double-stranded AUSL in a conformation that prevents formation of the GAIT element, which overlaps AUSL-A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We determined the specific DRBP76-binding region by constructing a series of mutations in either AUSL strand.

Differences in luciferase activities of the mutant forms were due largely to altered translation as shown by comparable firefly luciferase mRNA levels determined by semi-quantitative RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, insert); renilla luciferase mRNA levels were essentially the same for all transfections (not shown). Complementary covariant mutations (M2–M3, A<sup>381</sup><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUAA</named-content><sup>386</sup> to <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUAUU</named-content>) on the M3 strand opposing M2 were introduced in an attempt to restore function. However, the M2–M3 double mutant failed to recover RNA switch activity, possibly due to disruption of the GAIT element structure by M2 mutation. Thus, we further created complementary mutations of U<sup>358</sup><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">UAUAU</named-content><sup>363</sup> to <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">AAUAUA</named-content> (M4) to restore the GAIT element structure at the distal 6-bp stem region. RNA switch activity was partially restored in the M2–M3–M4 triple mutant, indicating the stem structure, not the sequence, is critical for DRBP76 activity in the RNA switch. As controls, individual M3 and M4 mutants lacked GAIT-mediated translational silencing activity and RNA switch function. In the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR, the CARE adjoins the GAIT element with not even a single nt separating them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s003">Figure S3A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref>. To determine the maximum distance between the elements that permits RNA switch activity, we inserted 5- to 25-nt poly(C) spacers between them in an HSR-bearing reporter. Spacers up to 15 nt permitted RNA switch activity, but 20- and 25-nt spacers were inhibitory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s003">Figure S3A,C</xref>), consistent with a distance limit for an effective interaction between the binding proteins hnRNP L and DRBP76. The insertions did not affect mRNA expression of FLuc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, insert) and RLuc (not shown) significantly, indicating that altered translation was responsible for differential Luc activity. Together these results suggest that whereas hnRNP L is responsible for target selectivity, DRBP76, through binding a nearby stem-loop region, has primary responsibility for stabilizing the RNA form lacking the GAIT structural element, thereby suppressing GAIT complex-directed translational silencing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Knockdown of DRBP76 did not significantly alter <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA half-life, providing additional evidence that DRBP76 influences VEGF-A expression primarily at the level of translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s003">Figure S3D</xref>).</p>

<p>By knockdown and overexpression experiments, we previously reported that hnRNP L is essential for hypoxia-induced switch activity in U937 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref>. To test the requirement for the other HILDA components, DRBP76 and hnRNP A2/B1, both were subjected to siRNA-mediated knock-down (hnRNP L knock-down served as positive control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, top). Cells were treated with IFN-γ and hypoxia for up to 24 h, and lysates tested for their effect on <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of an HSR-bearing reporter. As seen before, 24-h lysates from IFN-γ-treated normoxic cells inhibited translation of the reporter, but 24-h lysates from hypoxic cells were inactive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom). However, deletion of either DRBP76 or hnRNP A2/B1 dramatically impaired the hypoxia-driven RNA switch to an extent comparable to that of hnRNP L knockdown, and permitted GAIT complex-mediated translation inhibition by 24-h lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom). We investigated the effect of these lysates on endogenous gene expression. As before, hypoxia prevented IFN-γ-mediated inhibition of expression of VEGF-A observed at 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). However, siRNA-mediated knock-down of either DRBP76 or hnRNP A2/B1 restored translational inhibition of VEGF-A without significantly altering the steady-state level of <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Polysome profiling was done to verify that the effects on VEGF-A expression were due to altered translation. IFN-γ activation of the GAIT pathway inhibited <italic>VEGF-A</italic> mRNA translation-initiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Kapasi1">[21]</xref>, and this inhibition was reversed by hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref>.

<p>To investigate the mechanism underlying IFN-γ-induced hnRNP L degradation, hnRNP L ubiquitination was determined. IFN-γ treatment in the presence of MG132 induced accumulation of a high molecular weight form of hnRNP L consistent with ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Expression of HA-ubiquitin and detection with anti-HA-tag antibody confirmed formation of high molecular weight, ubiquitinated hnRNP L, and exposure to hypoxia dramatically diminished hnRNP L ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). We considered the von Hippel-Lindau (VHL)-containing ubiquitin ligase complex as a candidate E3 ubiquitin-protein ligase because of its normoxia-dependent role in regulation. VHL specifically targets proteins, e.g., hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α tagged by O<sub>2</sub>-dependent prolyl hydroxylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ivan1">[22]</xref>. VHL was shown to interact robustly with hnRNP L, but not with hnRNP A2/B1 or DRBP76, in an IFN-γ-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Also, siRNA-mediated knockdown of VHL markedly reduced hnRNP L polyubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, left panel) with MG132 treatment, and increased hnRNP L stability following IFN-γ treatment in absence of MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, right panel). However, overexpression of VHL did not affect the stability of hnRNP L or the assembly of the HILDA complex in hypoxia, suggesting that HILDA complex formation might contribute to protection of hnRNP L from VHL-mediated degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s007">Figure S7</xref>). In an <italic>in vitro</italic> ubiquitination system reconstituted with exogenous E1 and E2 enzymes and E3 ubiquitin ligase pVHL derived from lysate of 8 h, IFN-γ-treated U937 cells in normoxia further confirmed robust polyubiquitination of hnRNP L (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s008">Figure S8</xref>). In contrast, cell lysate from hypoxia-treated U937 cells failed to modify hnRNP L. Similar results were obtained with primary human PBM (not shown). These results suggest that proteasomal degradation of hnRNP L in U937 cells and in human PBM is mediated by IFN-γ-triggered ubiquitination by a VHL-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase.</p>

Y359D exhibited much greater binding to hnRNP A2/B1 compared to wild-type or Y359A mutant hnRNP L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g005">Figure 5J</xref>).

Consistent with the cellular translocation of hnRNP L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), Tyr phosphorylation was induced by IFN-γ treatment in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s012">Figure S12</xref>).

<title>HnRNP A2/B1 Binds and Protects hnRNP L from IFN-γ-Induced Prolyl Hydroxylation and VHL-Mediated Degradation</title>
<p>Because hnRNP A2/B1 does not bind the HSR directly, it is more likely involved in regulation of its binding partner hnRNP L, than in operating the RNA switch itself. We tested the possibility that hnRNP A2/B1 contributes to hypoxia-induced stabilization of hnRNP L. siRNA-mediated knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 resulted in hnRNP L destabilization following IFN-γ treatment in hypoxia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). In contrast, hnRNP A2/B1 knockdown did not induce DRBP76 degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Also, siRNA-mediated knockdown of DRBP76 did not affect hnRNP L stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s013">Figure S13</xref>). Interestingly, hnRNP L was subject to IFN-γ-dependent Pro hydroxylation as shown by IP followed by probing with anti-hydroxyproline antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Hypoxia prevented the IFN-γ-inducible prolyl hydroxylation of hnRNP L (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Knockdown of hnRNP A2/B1 under hypoxic condition and in the presence of IFN-γ and MG132 restored marked Pro hydroxylation of hnRNP L after 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Finally, co-IP with anti-hnRNP L antibody revealed that hypoxia induced hnRNP A2/B1 binding to hnRNP L, and completely blocked hnRNP L recognition by VHL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g006">Figure 6F</xref>). These results indicate that the major function of hnRNP A2/B1 in the heterotrimeric switch is to protect hnRNP L from IFN-γ-triggered prolyl hydroxylation, ubiquitination, and subsequent degradation. Treatment of U937 cells with prolyl hydroxylase (PH) inhibitors L-mimosine and dimethyloxalylglycine (DMOG) blocked prolyl hydroxylation of hnRNP L and caused marked stabilization of the protein in the presence of IFN-γ under normoxia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s014">Figure S14</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Rapid degradation of hnRNP L in absence of hnRNP A2/B1. U937 cells were transfected with hnRNP A2/B1-specific (or scrambled) siRNA. After recovery, cells were treated with IFN-γ and Hpx. for 0, 8, and 24 h. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-hnRNP A2/B1, -hnRNP L, and -GAPDH antibodies. (B) Time course of hnRNP L degradation in absence of hnRNP A2/B1. U937 cells were treated as in (A) for up to 24 h. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-hnRNP L and -DRBP76 antibodies. (C) IFN-γ induces prolyl hydroxylation of hnRNP L. U937 cells were treated with IFN-γ and MG132 for up to 24 h. Lysates were immunoprecipitated with anti-hnRNP L antibody and immunoblotted with anti-hydroxyproline and -hnRNP L antibodies. (D) hnRNP L is not subject to prolyl hydroxylation in Hpx.

(E) hnRNP A2/B1 inhibits prolyl hydroxylation of hnRNP L in hypoxia. U937 cells were transfected with hnRNP A2/B1-specific (or scrambled) siRNA. After recovery, cells were treated with IFN-γ, Hpx., and MG132 for up to 24 h. Lysates were immunoblotted with anti-hnRNP A2/B1 antibody. Lysates were also immunoprecipitated with anti-hnRNP L antibody and immunoblotted with anti-hydroxyproline and -hnRNP L antibodies. (F) Hypoxia induces binding of hnRNP A2/B1 to hnRNP L and prevents VHL binding. U937 cells were subjected to Nmx. or Hpx. for 24 h in the presence of IFN-γ stimulus.

<title><italic>In Vitro</italic> Reconstitution of HILDA Complex and RNA Switch Activity</title>
<p>Co-IP and RNA-binding studies suggest a model in which the interaction between DRBP76 and hnRNP A2/B1 is indirect and facilitated by hnRNP L and <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). We investigated the interactions in detail by <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution using recombinant proteins and <italic>in vitro</italic>–transcribed RNA. DRBP76 and hnRNP A2/B1 by themselves did not bind, nor did the addition of either hnRNP L or HSR RNA restore their interaction significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001635.s015">Figure S15</xref>). However, when both hnRNP L and HSR RNA were added, then a modest interaction between hnRNP A2/B1 and DRBP76 was detected. A much stronger interaction was observed when phospho-mimetic hnRNP L (Y359D) was added together with HSR RNA, but not nonspecific RNA, thereby reconstituting the entire HILDA complex <italic>in vitro</italic>. To investigate the sufficiency of hnRNP L, hnRNP A2/B1, and DRBP76 in operating the RNA switch, we determined the regulatory activity of the purified proteins <italic>in vitro</italic>. Phospho-mimetic hnRNP L (Y359D) was used to facilitate interaction with hnRNP A2/B1. The three proteins were pre-incubated in several combinations, and their effect on <italic>in vitro</italic> translation of an FLuc reporter bearing the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR element (and RLuc control RNA) was determined in a wheat germ extract in the presence of <sup>35</sup>S-Met and cytosolic extracts from IFN-γ-treated U937 cells. hnRNP L (Y359D) by itself or with either hnRNP A2/B1 or DRBP76, did not restore translation in the presence of lysates from cells treated with IFN-γ for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). However, the three proteins together substantially overcame the translational inhibition. Substitution of wild-type hnRNP L for the phospho-mimetic was ineffective, suggesting the posttranslational modification is not only required for maintaining a high level of cytoplasmic hnRNP L, but also is required for HILDA complex assembly. As positive controls, lysates from cells treated for 24 h with or without IFN-γ in hypoxia could rescue translation of HSR-bearing FLuc. These results support the role of the heterotrimeric HILDA complex in operating the RNA conformational switch.</p>

<title>HILDA Complex Directs the <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA Switch</title>
<p>The combinatorial activity of pairs of nearby elements has become an area of increasing interest, particularly with the recent recognition that microRNA binding to targets can influence protein binding to nearby target RNA elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ma1">[27]</xref>. There are few cases in which pairs of protein-binding RNA elements dictate the response. In one well-studied example, a combinatorial code in which the number and position of two elements—namely, the cytoplasmic polyadenylation element and Pumilio-binding element—determine translational activation or repression in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Pique1">[28]</xref>. However, there is a dearth of studies on the mechanisms by which nearby RNA elements, and their cognate binding factors, integrate disparate environmental signals to generate a binary response and regulate gene expression. In one known case, the leader sequence of the Mg<sup>2+</sup> transporter gene mgtA of <italic>Salmonella enterica</italic> contains a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-sensing riboswitch and an 18-codon, proline- or hyperosmotic stress-sensing ORF that integrate distinct signals to generate the cell response; however, an interaction between the disparate elements was not observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Park1">[29]</xref>. In the case of the GAIT system, we have reported that hypoxia prevents GAIT complex binding to the <italic>VEGFA</italic> 3′UTR by a switch in the conformation of RNA that masks the GAIT structural element <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Ray2">[20]</xref> by converting the element into the ascending half of a long, double-stranded stem-loop. The switch is initiated by hypoxia-stimulated binding of hnRNP L to a 3′UTR CARE directly adjacent to the GAIT element. In this report we define the components of a heterotrimeric complex that constitutes the RNA switch, their regulation by IFN-γ and hypoxia, and their specific functions in directing the <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA switch in human monocytic cells.</p>
<p>The requirement for each of the components of the HILDA complex to drive the RNA switch was shown by knockdown experiments in cells, and their sufficiency shown by in vitro reconstitution. The HILDA complex has not been previously described, but its individual components are known to regulate distinct mRNA-related functions. DRBP76 was initially identified through its binding to double-stranded RNA and to protein kinase R (PKR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Patel1">[30]</xref>. DRBP76 exhibits multiple RNA-related functions including regulation of transcription, mRNA stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Shi1">[31]</xref>, and translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Kuwano1">[32]</xref>. DRBP76 also binds the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR in hypoxic breast cancer cells, increasing mRNA stability and translation, but the binding region within the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR in these experiments was not determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Vumbaca1">[33]</xref>. The double-stranded RNA-binding property of DRBP76 is most likely the critical function it performs in the context of the HILDA complex, stabilizing the conformation featuring a long, double-stranded stem loop, and disrupting the structure of the GAIT element. hnRNP A2/B1, like hnRNP L, participates in splicing of pre-mRNAs and in translational regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-He1">[34]</xref>. hnRNP A2/B1 also serves as a molecular motor-powered transporter of select mRNAs bearing specific hnRNP A2/B1 response elements (A2RE), for example, neurogranin, Arc, and calmodulin-dependent kinase II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Gao1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Carson1">[37]</xref>. Cytosolic complexes containing heterodimeric hnRNPs have been shown to interact with specific target mRNAs. For example, hnRNP L and I form a complex that binds murine inducible nitric oxide synthase mRNA, and regulates its translation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Soderberg1">[38]</xref>. Interestingly, the same pair of hnRNPs found in the HILDA complex, hnRNP L and A2/B1, interacts with the glucose transporter 1 (Glut1) 3′UTR, inducing translational repression and mRNA instability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Hamilton1">[18]</xref>. However, an interaction between DRBP76 and A2/B1 has not been described.</p>

<title>hnRNP L Is Subject to Dual Regulation by IFN-γ and Hypoxia</title>
<p>hnRNP L is a critical component of the HILDA complex because it is uniquely responsible for stimulus sensing as well as target recognition. Our results show that the steady-state level and cellular localization of hnRNP L in myeloid cells are regulated both by IFN-γ and by hypoxia. Under normoxic conditions hnRNP L is distributed between the cytoplasm and nucleus, the latter for execution of mRNA processing functions. IFN-γ induces prolyl hydroxylation of cytoplasmic hnRNP L and consequent rapid, VHL-mediated ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Near-complete cytoplasmic depletion of hnRNP L permits GAIT complex binding to the <italic>VEGFA</italic> GAIT element in the translationally silent conformer, resulting in low-level translation of <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA. Hypoxia induces phosphorylation of hnRNP L on Tyr<sup>359</sup>, which increases cytoplasmic localization by restricting transport into the nucleus. Hypoxia-inducible phosphorylation suggests the activity of a nonreceptor Tyr kinase such as a member of the Src, Abl, Jak, Syk, or Fak families. The sequence surrounding the Tyr<sup>359</sup> phosphorylation site (pRRGPSR<sup>359</sup><named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple"><bold><underline>Y</underline></bold>GPQYGHPPPPPPPP</named-content>) exhibits 100% conservation in humans, rodents, rabbits, and frogs, and provides insight into the identity of the proximal kinase. “YG” is a specific Src kinase substrate motif (PhosphoMotif Finder), and the downstream polyproline motif is a binding site for SH3-containing proteins, including Src family kinases. hnRNP A2/B1 binds Tyr<sup>359</sup>-phosphorylated hnRNP L and blocks recognition by VHL-containing E3 ubiquitin ligase complex, thus permitting cytoplasmic accumulation. The precise kinetics and binding order have not been determined, but our results suggest that the phospho-hnRNP L and hnRNP A2/B1 recruit DRBP76 to form the heterotrimeric HILDA complex that binds the <italic>VEGFA</italic> CARE. The interaction is weakened by nuclease treatment, indicating that the binding of DRBP76 to other complex members is enhanced by its interaction with the long, AU-rich stem-loop within the <italic>VEGFA</italic> HSR. The HILDA complex stabilizes the translationally permissive conformer that masks the GAIT element, thus resulting in uninhibited translation of <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA, even in the presence of IFN-γ-induced GAIT complex.</p>

<p>The tumor suppressor protein VHL is an essential, target-specific component of a multifunctional E3 ubiquitin ligase complex involved in protein degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Li1">[39]</xref>. The best-known target of VHL is hypoxia inducible factor (HIF)-1α and -2α, transcription factors that stimulate expression of multiple hypoxia-inducible transcripts, including <italic>VEGFA</italic> mRNA. In normoxia, O<sub>2</sub>-dependent prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α triggers recognition by VHL and consequent degradation, thereby inhibiting expression of HIF-1α targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Haase1">[40]</xref>. However, prolyl hydroxylation of HIF-1α is inhibited in hypoxia, thereby stabilizing HIF-1α and increasing target mRNA transcription. Other VHL targets have been identified in renal cell carcinoma cell lines; interestingly, several are downregulated by VHL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Maina1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Xin1">[43]</xref>. hnRNP A2/B1 has been reported to be targeted by VHL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Pioli1">[44]</xref>. However, we find hnRNP A2/B1 binding to hnRNP L prevents targeting by VHL in human monocytic cells. Possibly, cell-type specificity of targets and directionality of regulation—i.e., up or down—are promoted by additional factors within the VHL-bearing E3-ubiquitin ligase complex. Proline hydroxylase inhibitors DMOG and L-mimosine both block hnRNP L prolyl hydroxylation and consequent degradation. Collagen prolyl-4-hydroxylase (C-P4H) is a candidate because it is induced by hypoxia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Turto1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Fahling1">[46]</xref> and hydroxylates and destabilizes another RBP, Argonaute 2 (Ago2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Qi1">[47]</xref>.

<title>HILDA Complex as Archetype Protein-Directed RNA Switch Flipper in Vertebrates</title>
<p>Long, noncoding regions of mRNAs, because of their manifold protein- and RNA-binding elements, are potentially ideal for integration of multiple inputs into a single output—i.e., gene expression. Because of their unusually long length, the 3′UTR, which averages almost 600 nt in human mRNAs versus about 150 nt for 5′UTRs, is a particularly attractive target for signal integration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Mazumder2">[49]</xref>. A plethora of examples of posttranscriptional regulation have been described in which RBPs are activated by environmental signals that alter their binding behavior, generally by posttranslational modification and complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Sonenberg1">[50]</xref>. In most known cases, RBPs or complexes interact one-to-one with preformed sequence or structural elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Sonenberg1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Gebauer1">[51]</xref>. More recently, regulatory processes have been described in which signals alter the conformation of the RNA to modulate gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Mandal1">[52]</xref>. The <italic>VEGFA</italic> 3′UTR RNA switch features alternative interaction of distinct protein complexes in response to environmental signals, culminating in regulated gene expression. The CARE element is analagous to a riboswitch aptamer domain, and hnRNP L acts as a “responder/selector,” responding to environmental cues and determining HILDA complex mRNA target specificity. The AUSL element determines the expression outcome: VEGF-A expression is high when the double-stranded conformation is bound by the HILDA complex, and expression is depressed when the GAIT complex binds the GAIT element in the alternate conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001635-g007">Figure 7</xref>). To our knowledge there are not any previous reports of 3-RNA element switches. Likewise, the integration of two different signals—i.e., hypoxia and inflammatory cytokine—by the <italic>VEGFA</italic> RNA switch lacks precedent.</p>
<p>The principles, protein constituents, and mechanisms utilized by the <italic>VEGFA</italic> switch might be applicable to distinct mRNA switches. One possibility is that the HILDA complex recognizes other transcripts with sequence and structural elements analogous to the <italic>VEGFA</italic> switch region—i.e., CARE and GAIT elements nearby DRBP76-binding double-stranded RNA stretches. Cytoplasmic hnRNP L binds VEGF-A mRNA and other transcripts in multiple cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Hamilton1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Shih1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Soderberg1">[38]</xref>, suggesting that the HILDA complex might direct additional RNA switches. More generally, distinct RBPs may replace hnRNP L as the “specificity factor,” but likewise recruit DRBP76 to stabilize nearby stem-loop structures and drive formation of alternate regulatory conformers. High-throughput screening has identified at least two RBPs hnRNP A1 and FUS (fused in sarcoma) that bind DRBP76 and might direct alternate RNA switches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Saunders1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001635-Jeronimo1">[54]</xref>. Alternatively, other inhibitory factors (microRNA or proteins) might replace the GAIT complex to drive the hnRNP L-directed GAIT-independent RNA switches in more general sense. We speculate that <italic>the VEGFA</italic> switch is a founding member of signal-activated, protein-directed, RNA switches that regulate posttranscriptional gene expression in vertebrates, and similar switches might be widespread RNA sensors in multicellular animals.</p>

<p>S100 extracts (4 mg) from U937 cells cultured in normoxia or hypoxia were pre-cleared by incubation for 30 min at 4°C with 2 µg 5-biotinylated, mutant antisense CARE-E RNA oligomer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-biotin-UCUGUGUGGGUGGGUGUAUGUAUGUAAAUA-3′</named-content>), added to 200 µl of μMACs magnetic streptavidin microbeads for 10 min, and applied to μMACS separator. The cleared lysate was incubated with 2 µg of 5′-biotinylated, wild-type CARE-E RNA oligomer (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-biotin-AGACACACCCACCCACAUACAUACAUUUAU-3′</named-content>), and then with streptavidin microbeads and applied to μMACS separator as above. The column was rinsed with 100 µl protein equilibration buffer and twice with 100 µl of lysis buffer. The bound material was applied to the column and washed 4 times with 100 µl of lysis buffer to decrease nonspecific binding. 200 µl of buffer containing 300 mM NaCl was applied to the column to elute bound protein. The eluate was desalted and concentrated using Centrifugal Filter Unit (Microcon YM-3K, Millipore, Billerica, MA). Eluates were subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie stain. Bands enriched only in hypoxia-treated sample were trypsinized and peptides mapped by capillary column LC-tandem MS (LTQ-linear ion trap MS system, ThermoFinnigan, San Jose, CA). The data were analyzed with Mascot using CID spectra to search the human reference sequence database. Matching spectra were verified by manual interpretation aided by additional searches using the Sequest and Blast.</p>
