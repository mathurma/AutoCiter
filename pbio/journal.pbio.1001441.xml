        <p>Mutagenesis, functional analysis, and crystal structures identify a watery tunnel through which protons enter the interior of a Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport protein involved in acid resistance of enteric bacteria.</p>

      <abstract>
        <p>Chloride-transporting membrane proteins of the CLC family appear in two distinct mechanistic flavors: H<sup>+</sup>-gated Cl<sup>−</sup> channels and Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporters. Transmembrane H<sup>+</sup> movement is an essential feature of both types of CLC. X-ray crystal structures of CLC antiporters show the Cl<sup>−</sup> ion pathway through these proteins, but the H<sup>+</sup> pathway is known only inferentially by two conserved glutamate residues that act as way-stations for H<sup>+</sup> in its path through the protein. The extracellular-facing H<sup>+</sup> transfer glutamate becomes directly exposed to aqueous solution during the transport cycle, but the intracellular glutamate E203, Glu<sub>in</sub>, is buried within the protein. Two regions, denoted “polar” and “interfacial,” at the intracellular surface of the bacterial antiporter CLC-ec1 are examined here as possible pathways by which intracellular aqueous protons gain access to Glu<sub>in</sub>. Mutations at multiple residues of the polar region have little effect on antiport rates. In contrast, mutation of E202, a conserved glutamate at the protein–water boundary of the interfacial region, leads to severe slowing of the Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport rate. An X-ray crystal structure of E202Y, the most strongly inhibited of these substitutions, shows an aqueous portal leading to Glu<sub>in</sub> physically blocked by cross-subunit interactions; moreover, this mutation has only minimal effect on a monomeric CLC variant, which necessarily lacks such interactions. The several lines of experiments presented argue that E202 acts as a water-organizer that creates a proton conduit connecting intracellular solvent with Glu<sub>in</sub>.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Chloride-proton antiport proteins of the “CLC” superfamily are transmembrane proteins that form homodimers and are used for myriad physiological purposes, all requiring the coordinated movements of Cl<sup>−</sup> anions and H<sup>+</sup> cations in opposite directions across biological membranes. While the pathway for Cl<sup>−</sup> ions through CLC antiporters is known, we currently have only indirect glimpses of how protons navigate their way through these membrane-embedded proteins. By combining mechanistic and structural approaches, we identify a proton-access pathway in a bacterial Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter that allows intracellular protons to enter the protein interior and engage in the coupled antiport mechanism. We conclude that E202, a highly conserved glutamate residue, serves to organize water molecules and guide protons to the adjacent glutamate E203 (known as “Glu<sub>in</sub>”), a critical residue for the antiport mechanism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Proton-coupled anion exchange-transporters of the CLC family carry out varied physiological tasks in virtually all eukaryotes and many prokaryotes, transporting Cl<sup>−</sup>, NO<sub>3</sub><sup>−</sup>, or F<sup>−</sup> across membranes in strictly coupled exchange for H<sup>+</sup> ions in the opposite direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Stockbridge1">[2]</xref>. These transporters can thus use a proton gradient to pump anions thermodynamically uphill or vice versa, depending on biological context. CLC proteins are membrane-embedded homodimers in which each subunit acts independently as a functional unit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Middleton1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Robertson1">[8]</xref>. The pathways within each subunit taken by Cl<sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> have been delineated mainly by studies of a homologue from <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, CLC-ec1, which is uniquely tractable at levels of biochemistry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Maduke1">[9]</xref>, electrophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Lim1">[11]</xref>, and X-ray crystallography <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Dutzler1">[12]</xref>. The H<sup>+</sup> and Cl<sup>−</sup> pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g001">Figure 1a</xref>) run together on the extracellular side of the protein, diverging about halfway through, where a “central” Cl<sup>−</sup> ion resides in the ion-coupling chamber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi3">[13]</xref>. A critical “external glutamate,” E148 (Glu<sub>ex</sub>), serves two mechanistically essential purposes. It forms an extracellular gate that closes or opens the ion pathways to the extracellular solution via side-chain rotation between buried and water-exposed positions and, coupled to this structural change, transfers H<sup>+</sup> between protein and solution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Dutzler1">[12]</xref>. If this residue is substituted with a nonprotonatable group, H<sup>+</sup> transport is completely abolished while Cl<sup>−</sup> movement, now uncoupled, persists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi2">[10]</xref>. A second key “internal glutamate” residue located towards the intracellular side of the protein, E203 (Glu<sub>in</sub>), similarly mediates H<sup>+</sup> transfer between protein and the internal solution; mutation of this residue to nonprotonatable moieties also abolishes H<sup>+</sup> movement while preserving Cl<sup>−</sup> transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi3">[13]</xref>. Unlike Glu<sub>ex</sub>, Glu<sub>in</sub> need not physically move to hand off its proton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Lim1">[11]</xref>, but merely places a dissociable group at this location in a proton-transfer pathway.</p>

          <p>(a) CLC-ec1 (PDB #1OTS) is shown in surface view, with subunits of the homodimer differently colored and drawn to indicate different aspects of the antiport mechanism. Key mechanistic residues are space-filled. Bifurcated Cl<sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> pathways are indicated as dashed lines on right subunit. Separation of Glu<sub>in</sub> from the intracellular solution is shown with a blue arrow, central region between Glu<sub>in</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub> with a red arrow, and the internal and central Cl<sup>−</sup> ions as green spheres. In subsequent figures, the internal Cl<sup>−</sup> ion is omitted, since this binds weakly and is unlikely to be directly involved in the transport mechanism. (b) Close-up view of the intracellular surface of CLC-ec1 near Glu<sub>in</sub>. Aqueous clefts are shown as dots, and the twin subunit is shown in greyscale to visualize the subunit interface. Polar and interfacial pathways—possible routes for H<sup>+</sup> access to Glu<sub>in</sub>—are indicated with arrows.</p>

      <p>While the Cl<sup>−</sup> pathway is crystallographically visible, the H<sup>+</sup> pathway has been glimpsed only indirectly through the two carboxylate way-stations visited during the transport cycle, Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Glu<sub>in</sub>. These groups are located ∼15 Å apart, separated by a nonpolar—and in the crystal structure anhydrous—region containing only a single dissociable side chain: a tyrosine residue whose hydroxyl group may be removed without disruption of transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Walden1">[14]</xref>, indicating its nonessential role. Moreover, while Glu<sub>ex</sub> directly communicates with extracellular aqueous protons in its open position, Glu<sub>in</sub> is buried away from the internal solution by a protein layer ∼10 Å thick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). Thus, two basic questions regarding the H<sup>+</sup> pathway remain unresolved: (1) how do intracellular aqueous protons gain access to Glu<sub>in</sub>, and (2) how do protons negotiate the nonpolar desert interposed between Glu<sub>in</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub>?</p>
      <p>This study addresses the first of these questions by examining two potential access pathways through mutations that impair H<sup>+</sup> transport. We find that intracellular H<sup>+</sup> access to Glu<sub>in</sub> can be greatly slowed—indeed, made rate-limiting for Cl<sup>−</sup> antiport—by blocking one of these portals with mutation of E202, a strongly conserved residue of hitherto unknown function that guides aqueous H<sup>+</sup> to several water molecules positioned in proximity to the carboxylate moiety of Glu<sub>in</sub>.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The absence of polar groups between Glu<sub>in</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub> suggests strongly that water wires catalyzing proton transfer somehow connect these essential carboxyl groups during the transport cycle. Previous computational studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Kuang1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Cheng1">[18]</xref> have arrived at pictures of such water-based H<sup>+</sup> pathways, similar in theme but varied in detail. While it is widely thought from the physical character of CLC proteins that water-chains must be involved in H<sup>+</sup> transfer between the two critical glutamates, such waters are neither experimentally manipulable by currently available tools nor crystallographically visible. However, the other unknown feature of the proton pathway—proton access to Glu<sub>in</sub> from intracellular solution—is susceptible to experimental inquiry.</p>
      <p>The unusually high Cl<sup>−</sup> transport rate of CLC-ec1, 2000–3000 s<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Walden1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Picollo1">[19]</xref>, makes it natural to wonder, since Glu<sub>in</sub> is buried, whether cytoplasmic H<sup>+</sup> access to Glu<sub>in</sub> is a rate-determining step in the transport cycle, and if not, why not. To obtain a sharper picture of this region in hopes of locating waters more prominent than in the original high-quality 2.5 Å crystal structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Dutzler1">[12]</xref>, we engineered CLC-ec1 guided by its crystal-packing interfaces, deleting 15 N-terminal and four C-terminal residues. This construct, denoted ΔNC, removes residues either disordered or forming problematic crystal contacts in previous structures and produced high-quality electron density maps from crystals routinely diffracting to 2.2–2.7 Å Bragg spacing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s007">Table S1</xref>). This trimmed construct is essentially identical to wild-type protein in structure, absolute turnover rate, and exchange stoichiometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s001">Figure S1a</xref>,b, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s008">Table S2</xref>). Henceforth, we use a ΔNC dataset refined to 2.5 Å for structural examination and full-length proteins for functional analysis. We confidently localized many fewer water molecules than were modeled in the original structure (52 versus 167, exclusive of the Fab fragment), but the number and locations of waters near Glu<sub>in</sub> in both structures match well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s002">Figure S2a</xref>).</p>
      <p>Inspection of the transporter's intracellular surface reveals two watery clefts that might potentially allow protons access to Glu<sub>in</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g001">Figure 1b</xref>). One of these—the “polar pathway”—contains five crystallographically visible waters embedded within a cluster of polar side chains, some of which form salt bridges (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s002">Figure S2b</xref>,c). The other—the “interfacial pathway”—is a narrow, aqueous invagination, or fjord, between the two CLC subunits topped by a conserved glutamate, E202. As described in the Supporting Information section (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s010">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s003">Figure S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s008">Table S2</xref>), our attempts to disrupt the polar pathway by removing salt bridges, eliminating charges, or replacing polar side chains with hydrophobics caused only unimpressive inhibition of H<sup>+</sup> transport and impaired Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> coupling minimally or not at all.</p>
      <p>We therefore turned our attention to the interfacial pathway, focusing in particular upon E202, for several reasons. First, this residue forms part of the protein surface that separates bulk water in the interfacial fjord from the protein interior where Glu<sub>in</sub> is buried. Second, a network of crystallographic water molecules near E202 and Glu<sub>in</sub>, including one bridging their carboxylates, invites closer examination of E202's role in the transport cycle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s002">Figure S2d</xref>). Third, E202 is arguably the most strictly conserved residue in the CLC superfamily, and yet its function is entirely unknown.</p>
      <p>Since our concern is with H<sup>+</sup> access, and because we have no direct measurement of H<sup>+</sup>-binding kinetics to Glu<sub>in</sub>, we examined the rate of H<sup>+</sup> pumping driven by a Cl<sup>−</sup> gradient. CLC-ec1-reconstituted liposomes loaded with 300 mM KCl were diluted into a lightly buffered solution containing 10 mM Cl<sup>−</sup> and 300 mM K<sup>+</sup>, and the pH of the suspension was monitored continuously. Addition of the K<sup>+</sup> ionophore valinomycin (Vln) initiates transport by electrically shunting Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange and setting the liposome membrane potential to zero. Two nonprotonatable mutants, E202Q and E202A, the former isosteric and polar and the latter small and nonpolar, were first tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g002">Figure 2a</xref>) and found to support H<sup>+</sup> uptake at rates about 20% of WT CLC-ec1. This result demonstrates that protonation of E202 is not required for antiport, an unsurprising conclusion since E202Q has been long known to maintain near-wild-type Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange stoichiometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi3">[13]</xref>. Despite its strict conservation, E202 may be substituted with many other side chains without impairing protein expression, folding, or dimerization, and so we tested a series of nondissociable side chains at this position. A clear pattern emerges (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g002">Figure 2b,c</xref>) in which H<sup>+</sup> transport slows as side-chain volume increases, with the large aromatics producing up to 200-fold inhibition of the H<sup>+</sup> uptake rate. In these very slow mutants, the antiport mechanism remains intact, as shown by measurements of Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux, which slows down in parallel, although not to the same extent as H<sup>+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g002">Figure 2d,e</xref>). All rates are reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s008">Table S2</xref>.</p>

      <p>It is tempting to imagine that the severe inhibition of H<sup>+</sup> transport by these aromatic substitutions at E202 reflects blockage of the path from cytoplasmic water to Glu<sub>in</sub>, such that H<sup>+</sup> access becomes rate-limiting for the transport cycle. But this conclusion would be invalid without evidence that these mutations act upon H<sup>+</sup> movement itself, rather than on Cl<sup>−</sup> transport, the observed inhibition of H<sup>+</sup> uptake being merely a secondary consequence of the coupled antiport mechanism. The question thus becomes: Which ion's pathway is the primary victim of the mutations? We address this question by examining two diagnostics of the Cl<sup>−</sup> pathway that are independent of H<sup>+</sup> involvement: Cl<sup>−</sup> binding and uncoupled Cl<sup>−</sup> transport. Equilibrium binding of Cl<sup>−</sup> indicates that the E202Y mutation does not act directly on the Cl<sup>−</sup> transport pathway, since Cl<sup>−</sup> affinity determined by isothermal calorimetry, known to reflect binding to the central anion site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Picollo1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Picollo2">[20]</xref>, is weakened only 2-fold in E202Y (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g003">Figure 3a,b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s009">Table S3</xref>). These mutations are further tested for Cl<sup>−</sup> transport in a CLC mutant (E148A) wherein all H<sup>+</sup> transport is eliminated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi2">[10]</xref>. This mutant, lacking the external Glu<sub>ex</sub> gate and devoid of acid activation and H<sup>+</sup> coupling, provides a way of testing the effect of E202 mutants on the Cl<sup>−</sup> pathway alone. The question is straightforward: Do large nonpolar substitutions at E202 severely inhibit Cl<sup>−</sup> transport on a background of E148A, as they do on wild-type? The answer is clear: they do not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g003">Figure 3c,d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The Cl<sup>−</sup> efflux rate is altered by trivial factors of 0.5, 1.7, and 1.9 for the F, Y, and W substitutions, respectively. A similarly minimal effect of the F substitution is also seen on a different H<sup>+</sup>-uncoupled mutant background (E148A/Y445S, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s004">Figure S4</xref>) with a 20-fold faster Cl<sup>−</sup> turnover rate than wild-type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Jayaram1">[21]</xref>. These several lines of evidence argue that large, nonpolar side chains at E202 slow the coupled transport cycle not by impairing the Cl<sup>−</sup> transport pathway but rather by rendering H<sup>+</sup> diffusion between Glu<sub>in</sub> and intracellular solution rate-limiting.</p>

      <p>By what mechanism do these E202 substitutions so strongly inhibit H<sup>+</sup> transport? Though unable to grow crystals of any E202 mutant suitable for assessing water organization near this residue, we obtained a single dataset of E202Y at a resolution sufficient (3.2 Å) to observe the disposition of this inhibitory side chain. The mutant is essentially identical in structure to wild-type protein and shows prominent density at the central Cl<sup>−</sup> binding site (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The substituted side chain adopts the position that would otherwise be a polar portal at the top of the fjord, with the phenol ring bricking up that gateway with greasy mortar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g004">Figure 4a</xref>). Moreover, an unexpected consequence of this mutation is the movement of the I201 side chain from the neighboring subunit to pack closely against the Y202 aromatic ring, a subtle cross-subunit rearrangement that contributes additional nonpolar mass to sequester Glu<sub>in</sub> away from aqueous protons in the interfacial fjord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g004">Figure 4b,c</xref>). Thus, even at this rather low resolution, the E202Y structure neatly rationalizes the dramatic slowdown of H<sup>+</sup> transport suffered by the large nonpolar E202 mutants.</p>

      <p>A strong prediction immediately arises from the E202Y structure: that inhibition by this mutation should be much less severe in a monomeric variant of the transporter, where the cross-subunit interaction between Y202 and I201 cannot exist. This prediction was tested by exploiting a monomeric CLC-ec1 construct known to support well-coupled Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiport, albeit at lower absolute rates than the wild-type homodimer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Robertson1">[8]</xref>. On this monomeric background, the E202Y substitution shows only a 4-fold reduction of H<sup>+</sup> transport rate, while maintaining a Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange stoichiometry (3∶1) close to the normal value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Ever since proton movements were understood to be coupled to anion transport in CLCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi2">[10]</xref>, attention has focused on how H<sup>+</sup> navigates its way through these channels and transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Miller1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi3">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Traverso1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Feng1">[24]</xref>. Macromolecular H<sup>+</sup> pathways, notoriously difficult to unravel solely by experimental approaches, can often be perceived only inferentially and indirectly. In CLC-ec1, combined biochemical, electrophysiological, and structural experiments have deduced a rough trajectory for H<sup>+</sup> transit through this Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> antiporter, largely through recognition of Glu<sub>ex</sub> and Glu<sub>in</sub> as key dissociable residues that H<sup>+</sup> transiently occupies on its way across the membrane. But details remain vague on two key issues: (1) how H<sup>+</sup> gains access to the buried Glu<sub>in</sub> residue from solution and (2) how it breeches the nonpolar gap between Glu<sub>in</sub> and Glu<sub>ex</sub>.</p>
      <p>This study establishes a specific role for E202 in the first of these proton-transfer processes. E202 stands out structurally by virtue of its strict conservation and location close to the apex of the interfacial pathway, just as it stands out functionally as the unique governor of H<sup>+</sup> access to Glu<sub>in</sub>. The results confirm that E202 is not itself a compulsory protonation-point in the pathway and instead imply that it acts as a “water-organizer” that promotes H<sup>+</sup> transfer from bulk water in the interfacial fjord to the ordered water molecules inside the protein near E202. We suppose that large nonpolar substitutions here disrupt this water conduit to Glu<sub>in</sub>, thereby slowing H<sup>+</sup> access from intracellular solution so much that this step becomes rate-determining for overall transport. The E202Y crystal structure corroborates this idea by showing the aromatic side chain reaching across the subunit interface to interact with I201 of its homodimeric twin, thereby to plug the water-conduit. This mechanism is further validated by the minimal effect of this mutation in a monomeric variant of the transporter. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001441-g006">Figure 6</xref> summarizes in cartoon form the essential features of the proposal offered here for water/H<sup>+</sup> access to Glu<sub>in</sub>.</p>

      <p>The E202 substitutions inhibit both Cl<sup>−</sup> and H<sup>+</sup> in parallel, showing qualitatively that the basic coupling mechanism remains intact. However, we cannot ignore the higher Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry in these slow mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001441.s006">Figure S6</xref>); this is likely not a disruption of the basic coupling mechanism but rather reflects Cl<sup>−</sup> “slippage” through the inner gate in stalled transporters, which must wait for a proton to arrive before the antiport cycle can continue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Walden1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi4">[25]</xref>. The preservation of Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchange stoichiometry in monomeric E202Y supports the idea that Cl<sup>−</sup> slippage accounts for the higher Cl<sup>−</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> stoichiometry. We emphasize that E202 is unique in controlling H<sup>+</sup> access to Glu<sub>in</sub>; our many mutagenic maneuvers aimed at mutilating the hydrophilic character of the alternative polar pathway produced only minor effects on transport. It is worth recalling that all known CLC channels, which, like the antiporters, require transmembrane H<sup>+</sup> movement for proper function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Miller1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Traverso1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Lisal1">[23]</xref> also carry the E202 equivalent; this conservation may underlie the observation that mutation of this glutamate in a mammalian CLC channel compromises its H<sup>+</sup>-dependent gating process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Zifarelli1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Lisal2">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The internal glutamate (E203) is highly conserved among CLC antiporters, and CLC-ec1 is known to absolutely require protonation at this position for H<sup>+</sup>-coupled Cl<sup>−</sup> movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Lim1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Accardi3">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Feng1">[24]</xref>. But a few violations of this pattern have recently come to light among CLC antiporter homologues with nondissociable residues here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Stockbridge1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Feng2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001441-Phillips1">[29]</xref>. Moreover, H<sup>+</sup> transport is linked to gating of CLC channels, all of which have valine instead of glutamate at this position. These exceptions to the proton-transfer function of Glu<sub>in</sub> make the strict conservation in all CLCs of the neighboring E202 position all the more notable. Thus, we imagine that while the details of H<sup>+</sup> movement within the protein vary among CLC homologues, the water-organizing function of E202 proposed here for proton exchange with intracellular solvent is common to the entire superfamily.</p>
