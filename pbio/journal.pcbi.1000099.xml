Although scaffolds are widely believed to have dramatic effects on the dynamics of signal propagation, the mechanisms that underlie these consequences are not well understood. Here, Monte Carlo simulations of a model kinase cascade are used to investigate how the temporal characteristics of signaling cascades can be influenced by the presence of scaffold proteins. Specifically, we examine the effects of spatially localizing kinase components on a scaffold on signaling dynamics. The simulations indicate that a major effect that scaffolds exert on the dynamics of cell signaling is to control how the activation of protein kinases is distributed over time. Scaffolds can influence the timing of kinase activation by allowing for kinases to become activated over a broad range of times, thus allowing for signaling at both early and late times. Scaffold concentrations that result in optimal signal amplitude also result in the broadest distributions of times over which kinases are activated. These calculations provide insights into one mechanism that describes how the duration of a signal can potentially be regulated in a scaffold mediated protein kinase cascade. Our results illustrate another complexity in the broad array of control properties that emerge from the physical effects of spatially localizing components of kinase cascades on scaffold proteins.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Signal transduction is the science of cellular communication. Cells detect signals from their environment and use them to make decisions such as whether or when to proliferate. Tight regulation of signal transduction is required for all healthy cells, and aberrant signaling leads to countless diseases such as cancer and diabetes. For example, in higher organisms such as mammals, signal transduction that leads to cell proliferation is often guided by a scaffold protein. Scaffolding proteins direct the assembly of multiple proteins involved in cell signaling by providing a platform for these proteins to carry out efficient signal transmission. Although scaffolds are widely believed to have dramatic effects on how signal transduction is carried out, the mechanisms that underlie these consequences are not well understood. Therefore, we used a computational approach that simulates the behavior of a model signal transduction module comprising a set of proteins in the presence of a scaffold. The simulations reveal mechanisms for how scaffolds can dynamically regulate the timing of cell signaling. Scaffolds allow for controlled levels of signal that are delivered inside the cell at appropriate times. Our findings support the possibility that these signaling dynamics regulated by scaffolds affect cell decision-making in many medically important intracellular processes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded through an NIH Director's Pioneer Award and NIH grant PO1 AI071195-01 to AKC.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>In the context of signal transduction, cells integrate signals derived from membrane proximal events and convert them into the appropriate cell decision. Within the complex networks that integrate these signals lies a highly conserved motif involving the sequential activation of multiple protein kinases. Signal propagation through these kinase cascades is often guided by a scaffolding protein that assembles protein kinases into a multi-protein complex.

Differences in signal duration have been implicated as the basis of differential decisions in myriad cell processes. For example, it has been suggested that decisions on growth factor induced cell proliferation, positive and negative selection of T cells, apoptotic programs, cell cycle progression, among many others, are regulated by the duration of signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Murphy2">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Daniels1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, the issue of how a signal output, such as the activity of extracellular regulatory kinase (ERK) in a MAPK pathway, is distributed over time, is of considerable interest.</p><p>There are many ways in which the duration of the output of a kinase cascade can be controlled. Regulation of signaling dynamics can arise from processes upstream of the cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Sasagawa1">[25]</xref>. For example, degradation of upstream signaling components such as the surface receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Schoeberl1">[26]</xref> and differential kinetics of GTPase regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kao1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Boykevisch1">[28]</xref> can be essential in regulating MAPK signaling dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Sasagawa1">[25]</xref>. Also, multisite phosphorylation is predicted to influence signal duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Locasale1">[29]</xref>. It has been also been shown that differential modes of feedback regulation that are manifested under different conditions within the same cascade can regulate signal duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Santos1">[30]</xref>. Scaffold proteins have also been implicated as key determinants in the regulation of signal duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kortum1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kortum2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kiyatkin1">[31]</xref>.</p><p>Because the many factors that control scaffold mediated signaling are difficult to systematically control in a laboratory setting, a precise understanding of how scaffold proteins affect the dynamics of signal transduction has proven elusive. Computational models have been useful in understanding some of the many complex ways in which scaffolds influence signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Heinrich1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kholodenko1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Levchenko1">[34]</xref>. However, it is currently impossible to model theoretically all aspects of any biological signaling process—computational models ultimately require that many gross simplifications be made. Our aim is, therefore, not to attempt to simulate every detail of a specific biochemical pathway but rather investigate the consequences that emerge from a simple scenario of scaffold mediated signaling whereby a model cascade assembles onto a scaffold. In modeling this scenario in itself, we hope to learn more about the functional and mechanistic consequences that these specific physical constraints, imposed by assembling components of a biochemical cascade onto a scaffold, confer to signaling pathways. In parsing these effects from the myriad others that are undoubtedly important, our hope is that our results can serve as a framework for understanding the extent to which these effects are important in specific biological contexts such as the Mitogen Activated Protein Kinase (MAPK) pathway.</p><p>One theoretical analysis of scaffold mediated cell signaling revealed the presence of non mononotic behavior in signal output as a function of scaffold concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Levchenko1">[34]</xref>. If scaffolds are required for signaling, then too few scaffolds will be detrimental to signaling. On the other hand, if scaffolds are present in excess, signaling complexes become incompletely assembled and the signal output is attenuated. As a consequence of this “prozone” effect, scaffolds were shown to also differentially affect the kinetics of signaling.</p><p>The observation that scaffolds can differentially affect signaling dynamics leads to many questions. How do scaffold proteins control the time scales involved in signal propagation? An important metric of cell signaling is the time it takes for a downstream kinase to become active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Lu1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Lan1">[36]</xref>. As signal transduction is stochastic in nature, the more precise question is: what is the distribution of times characterizing the activation of a downstream kinase? How do scaffolds affect this distribution, and what might be the biological consequences of changes in this distribution as a result of signaling on a scaffold? We compute first passage time distributions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Redner1">[37]</xref> using a stochastic computer simulation method to investigate these questions.</p><p>Specifically, we use a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm. We have previously used such methods to study a different question concerning the regulation of signal amplitude by scaffold proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Locasale2">[33]</xref>. It is also possible that a differential equation model that considers mean-field kinetics could be used to study the first passage time distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Redner1">[37]</xref>. However, such an approach would require the imposition of absorbing boundary conditions that can make the numerical analysis difficult.</p><p>Our simulation results suggest that, depending on physiological conditions, scaffold proteins can allow kinase cascades to operate in different dynamical regimes that allow for large increases and decreases in the speed and characteristic time scale of signal propagation. Furthermore, and perhaps more importantly, scaffolds are shown to influence the statistical properties of the times at which kinases are activated in complex ways. Scaffolding protein kinases cascades can allow for broadly distributed waiting times of kinase activation, whereas in the absence of a scaffold, the time it takes for a kinase to be activated is effectively characterized by a single time scale. These stochastic characteristics of scaffold-mediated kinase cascades are, to our knowledge, elucidated for the first time and may have diverse biological consequences that pertain to how signal duration is regulated. It is also our hope that our results provide a framework for achieving a deeper qualitative understanding of how scaffolding proteins can regulate the dynamics of cell signaling and the statistical properties of signal transduction.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Model of a Protein Kinase Cascade</title><p>For our study, we considered a model three tiered protein kinase cascade such as the MAPK pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Chang1">[38]</xref>.

In the regime that we study here, these effects are absent since activation of the cascade requires that an inactive C protein encounter an active B protein; our motivation is thus to investigate how the dynamics of kinase activation can be affected by assembling components of the cascade onto a scaffolding protein that localizes single complexes. Therefore, we do not emphasize how the hierarchical structure of a signaling cascade effects signal propagation and instead focus on how assembly of the cascade onto a scaffold affects signaling dynamics. We also underscore the notion that in our approach, many undoubtedly important effects such as the hierarchical structure of protein kinase cascades, the influence of feedback loops, differential enzymatic mechanisms and allosteric control by scaffolds are neglected. Again, by excising these effects, we restrict our attention to a hypothetical scenario that aims only to investigate the consequences of assembling components of a cascade onto a scaffold protein.</p><p>The key quantities computed and parameters used are discussed below in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000099-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000099-g001">Figure 1B</xref>.

Signal transduction in our model occurs on a time scale that is much slower than the microscopic time scales associated with diffusion, binding/unbinding, and enzyme catalysis. We might therefore expect that some coarse-graining exists whereby events at these fast, “microscopic” time scales interact with other relevant biophysical parameters (e.g. scaffold concentration) to give rise to emergent properties that evolve on slower times scales. These processes are a manifestation of the collective dynamics of the many processes that occur on faster time scales. Understanding the factors that govern these emergent time scales would then provide insight into the origin of the different temporal characteristics that are revealed by our simulations.</p><p>In order for a signal to propagate (i.e. for the last kinase in the cascade to become active), a hierarchical sequence of phosphorylation reactions among kinases must occur that leads to the final kinase in the cascade being activated by its upstream kinases. The activation process may occur either in solution or on a scaffold. Also, in the course of signaling, kinases can exchange from a scaffold. Some kinases are bound to a scaffold that contains an incomplete assembly of the necessary signaling molecules, and are not signaling competent. Ultimately, an inactive kinase can exist in one of three states: in solution, bound to a complete complex, or bound to an incomplete complex. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000099-g004">Figure 4A</xref> contains a diagram of such a minimal picture and arrows denote transitions between the four states.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000099-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000099.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>Dynamics can be characterized by a multi-state kinetic mechanism.</title><p>Important time scales in scaffold mediated signaling.

For low scaffold concentrations (<italic>ζ</italic>≪1), kinases predominately exist in solution and signal transduction is dominated by the time it takes for an upstream kinase to encounter its downstream enzyme. Since a steady-state ensemble is used, the rate limiting step for signal propagation is the diffusion limited collision between an active B* molecule with an inactive C molecule. For high scaffold concentrations (<italic>ζ</italic>≫1), kinases predominately exist in incomplete signaling complexes and signal transduction is limited by a time scale that characterizes the turnover of a signaling incompetent complex to one that is able to signal. For intermediate concentrations, inactive kinases can exist in each of three states and transitions between these states also occur. Thus, the source of the nonexponential relaxation (i.e. <italic>β</italic>&lt;1) arises from the mixing of many time scales that are relevant for intermediate scaffold concentrations. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000099-g004">Figure 4B</xref> illustrates this minimal picture of the kinetics of signal propagation derived from these physical considerations.</p><p>Also note that the sensitivity of our results to changes in model parameters can be understood from this simple picture of scaffold mediated signaling dynamics.

Changes to other parameters such as the rates of activation and deactivation and the concentration of phosphatases alter the rates of transitions between these different states. For instance, if phosphatase concentrations are very large, then activation in solution is very slow and occurs predominantly on a scaffold. Also, slower rates of activation (and larger rates of deactivation) result in a larger portion of signaling originating from kinases that are bound to scaffolds. In general, when the activation of kinases originates more (less) predominantly from a particular state in the minimal model, <italic>β</italic> increases (decreases). When multiple pathways to kinase activation contribute with comparable time scales, <italic>β</italic> is small, and signaling is broadly distributed over many time scales.

Moreover, we showed that the concentration of a scaffold protein can influence signaling dynamics by controlling the distribution of times over which kinases become active. This type of regulation may have many important consequences that are related to the influence of signal duration on cell decisions. Controlling the times over which kinases are activated may also be useful in directing a specific, robust response in a number of ways. Thus, the scaffold concentration itself provides another variable for maintaining signal specificity by controlling signal duration. This is consistent with data from genetic studies involving KSR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kortum1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kortum2">[10]</xref>, where the authors reported that the concentration of KSR1 can control a cell decision involving commitment to adipogenesis.</p><p>Our study focused solely on aspects of scaffold mediated regulation of signal transduction and we only considered the times at which kinases are active in the course of signal transduction. Many other factors also control signal duration. For example, our study does not consider the negative feedback loops that are often associated with the upregulation of phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Murphy1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Kholodenko1">[32]</xref>) or the role of receptor downregulation in controlling signal duration. Also we did not explicitly consider the role of positive versus negative feedback loops in shaping signal duration which is undoubtedly important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Santos1">[30]</xref>. It was our focus to study how spatially localizing kinases on a scaffold protein influences signal duration. We aimed to untangle this effect of scaffold proteins from other essential features of kinase cascades such as allostery and feedback regulation. Also, other theoretical studies have investigated the first passage time statistics in signal transduction cascades and have found interesting dynamics that result from, in part, the sequential activation of multiple steps in a kinase cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Lu1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Lan1">[36]</xref>. Our studies of signaling through scaffold proteins supplement these findings and, to our knowledge, provide the first study that shows how scaffolds affect the statistics of signal transduction.</p><p>Several predictions from our model of how scaffolds regulate signaling dynamics can be tested. Measurements that monitor the time course of signaling for different scaffold concentrations could potentially resolve the differences in signaling dynamics that are predicted. Also, single molecule or fluorescence correlation based spectroscopic methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Lu2">[46]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Slaughter1">[48]</xref> could potentially probe the statistics of signaling dynamics inherent in kinase cascades and study how such statistics are related to reliable cell decisions. Such techniques can monitor the propagation of a signal, at the level of an individual molecule and thus directly measure how kinase activation within a single cell is distributed over time.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Kinetic Monte Carlo Simulations</title><p>We simulate a model protein kinase cascade such as the mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) cascade (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000099-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) in the presence and absence of a scaffold with a kinetic Monte Carlo algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Chandler1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000099-Frenkel1">[50]</xref>, which allows us to monitor the relevant stochastic dynamics. Since we are investigating phenomena that occurs on the time scales of signal transduction, we course-grain the system so that proteins are represented as discrete objects, occupying a site on a lattice of dimensions 100×100×100 lattice spacings. Scaffold proteins are modeled as rigid, immobile objects containing three binding sites that are each specific for a particular kinase. When bound to a scaffold, kinases are tethered in nearest neighbor positions that are proximal to their downstream substrates. Allowing the scaffold and scaffold-bound species to move does not affect the qualitative results. Reflecting, no flux (i.e.Neumann) boundary conditions exist at each of the faces of the cubic lattice. The system is not periodically replicated since our simulation box is a size on the order a cell. Proteins can diffuse (i.e. translate on the lattice in random directions), bind and unbind, and undergo state transformations according to the prescribed reaction network involving a three staged cascade of activation and deactivation events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000099-g001">Figures 1A and 1B</xref>). Protein motion is subject to excluded volume (steric) constraints in that no two proteins can occupy the same site on the lattice. Chemical (state) transformations and binding events are modeled as thermally activated processes with energy barriers for activation, inactivation, binding and unbinding reactions. Parameters used are given in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000099-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p><p>We simulate the dynamics with a fixed time step Monte Carlo algorithm.

If we assume a lattice spacing of 10nm, a typical diameter of a protein, the concentration of kinases in our simulation box is roughly 1 µM for kinase A and kinase B and ∼5 µM for kinase C. In a physiological context, assuming the radius of the cell is about 10 µm, this approximately corresponds to ∼10<sup>5</sup> molecules of kinases A and B and a copy number of ∼5×10<sup>5</sup> for kinase C in our simulation. 600 generic phosphatases are also present.

For the purposes of our simulations, saturation effects were ignored and the kinetics were taken to be in a linear regime. Such a model is reasonable when reactions are not limited by the availability of the enzyme. However, relaxing this assumption does not affect the qualitative behavior of our results provided that the times scales involved in the formation of an enzyme-substrate complex and subsequent catalysis do not compete with the diffusive processes in solution. If additional processes associated with enzyme catalysis dominate over diffusive motion of the proteins or binding and unbinding to and from the scaffold, then these process would be observed in the autocorrelation function and corresponding power spectrum. Given that catalysis would incorporate additional processes into the mechanism of kinase activation, such effects would serve to broaden the distribution at all scaffold concentrations as we have observed in our simulations (data not shown).

This distribution of waiting times underlies the intrinsic duration of signal propagation in a protein kinase cascade—the decay of such a quantity is a measure of how fast the signaling cascade responds to stimuli. Important to note is that this quantity gives information only on the timing of the signal and not on its final magnitude. We also consider the product of the survival probability with the probability that a kinase in the pool of signaling molecules is active in the steady state,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000099.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>f<sub>A</sub></italic> is the fraction of active kinases at steady state.
