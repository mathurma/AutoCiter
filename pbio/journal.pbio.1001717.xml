<abstract>
<p>Histone deacetylase (HDAC) 4 is a transcriptional repressor that contains a glutamine-rich domain. We hypothesised that it may be involved in the molecular pathogenesis of Huntington's disease (HD), a protein-folding neurodegenerative disorder caused by an aggregation-prone polyglutamine expansion in the huntingtin protein. We found that HDAC4 associates with huntingtin in a polyglutamine-length-dependent manner and co-localises with cytoplasmic inclusions. We show that HDAC4 reduction delayed cytoplasmic aggregate formation, restored <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcript levels, and rescued neuronal and cortico-striatal synaptic function in HD mouse models. This was accompanied by an improvement in motor coordination, neurological phenotypes, and increased lifespan. Surprisingly, HDAC4 reduction had no effect on global transcriptional dysfunction and did not modulate nuclear huntingtin aggregation. Our results define a crucial role for the cytoplasmic aggregation process in the molecular pathology of HD. HDAC4 reduction presents a novel strategy for targeting huntingtin aggregation, which may be amenable to small-molecule therapeutics.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a late-onset neurodegenerative disorder caused by protein-folding defects in the huntingtin protein. Mutations in huntingtin can result in extra-long tracts of the amino acid glutamine, resulting in aberrant interactions with other proteins and also causing huntingtin proteins to self-associate and -aggregate. The pathology of HD is therefore associated with nuclear and cytoplasmic aggregates. HDAC4 is a histone deacetylase protein traditionally associated with roles in transcription repression. The HDAC4 protein contains a glutamine-rich domain and in this work we find that HDAC4 associates with huntingtin in a polyglutamine-length-dependent manner and that these proteins co-localise in cytoplasmic inclusions. Importantly, reducing HDAC4 levels delays cytoplasmic aggregate formation and rescues neuronal and cortico-striatal synaptic function in mouse models of HD. In addition, we observe improvements in motor coordination and neurological phenotypes, as well as increased lifespan in these mice. Nuclear huntingin aggregates or transcription regulation, however, remained unaffected when HDAC4 levels were reduced to enable these effects. Our results thus provide valuable insight into separating cytoplasmic and nuclear pathologies, and define a crucial role for cytoplasmic aggregations in HD progression. HDAC4 reduction presents a novel strategy for alleviating the toxicity of huntingtin protein aggregation, thereby influencing the molecular pathology of Huntington's disease. As there are currently no disease-modifying therapeutics available for Huntington's disease, we hope that this HDAC4-mediated regulation may be amenable to small-molecule therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Huntington's disease (HD) is a progressive, inherited neurological disorder characterized by severe motor, cognitive, behavioural, and physiological dysfunction for which there is no effective disease-modifying treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Novak1">[1]</xref>. The disease is caused by the expansion of a CAG repeat to more than 35 CAGs within exon 1 of the <italic>HTT</italic> gene. At the molecular level, mutant huntingtin (HTT) containing an expanded polyQ stretch has a propensity to self-aggregate to produce a wide-range of oligomeric species and insoluble aggregates and exerts a gain of toxic function through aberrant protein–protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Landles1">[2]</xref>. Therefore, as with other neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's disease, Parkinson's disease, and the prion diseases, the polyglutamine (polyQ) disorders including HD are associated with the accumulation of misfolded proteins leading to neuronal dysfunction and cell death.</p>
<p>Transcriptional dysregulation is part of the complex molecular pathogenesis of HD, to which abnormal histone acetylation and chromatin remodelling may contribute <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Cha1">[3]</xref>. The imbalance in histone acetylation was proposed to be caused by the inactivation of histone acetyltransferases, which led to the pursuit of histone deacetylases (HDACs) as HD therepeutic targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Butler1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Kazantsev1">[5]</xref>. There are 11 mammalian Zn<sup>2+</sup>-dependent HDACs divided into three groups based on structural and functional similarities: class I (HDACs: 1, 2, 3, 8), class IIa (HDACs: 4, 5, 7, 9), class IIb (HDACs: 6, 10), and HDAC11 as class IV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Haberland1">[6]</xref>. Initial genetic and pharmacological studies performed in flies, worms, and HD mouse models have suggested that HDAC inhibitors may have a significant therapeutic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Butler1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Kazantsev1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The preclinical evaluation of the HDAC inhibitor suberoylanilide hydroxamic acid (SAHA) demonstrated a dramatic improvement in the motor impairment that develops in the R6/2 HD mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Hockly1">[7]</xref>. Initially, SAHA was shown to inhibit class I and II HDACs at nanomolar concentrations, although it is predominantly a class I inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Marks1">[8]</xref>. More recently, SAHA was shown to lead to the degradation of HDACs 4 and 5 via RANBP2-mediated proteasome degradation in cancer cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Scognamiglio1">[9]</xref>. Following on from this, we demonstrated that in addition to its deacetylase activity and the known effect on decreasing <italic>Hdac7</italic> mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Benn1">[10]</xref>, SAHA treatment results in a reduction in HDAC2 and HDAC4 in brain regions of both WT and R6/2 mice, without affecting their transcript levels <italic>in vivo</italic>. This was associated with a reduction in aggregate load and the restoration of cortical <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcript levels in R6/2 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mielcarek1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is well-established that HDAC4 acts as a transcriptional repressor that shuttles between the nucleus and cytoplasm. Phosphorylated HDAC4 is retained in the cytoplasm through its association with 14-3-3 proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Verdin1">[12]</xref>. The N-terminal region of HDAC4 contains a MEF2 binding site and represses the transcription of MEF2-dependent genes important in the regulation of neuronal cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Bolger1">[13]</xref>. In this context, MEF2 can act as a neuronal survival factor, and its inhibition has been linked to the death of neurons in several cell culture systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mao1">[14]</xref>. Crystallization of the N-terminal domain of HDAC4 suggested that HDAC4 might have the propensity to self-aggregate through its glutamine-rich domains, consistent with cell-culture studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Guo1">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, regions containing high glutamine content in proteins have been observed to facilitate interactions with other glutamine-rich proteins, leading to the spontaneous assembly of insoluble toxic amyloid-like structures in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Fiumara1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we identified a novel mechanism by which HDACs can modify HD pathogenesis <italic>in vivo</italic> and found that HDAC4 reduction delays the HTT aggregation process. We demonstrated that HDAC4 associates with mutant exon 1 and full-length HTT <italic>in vivo</italic> in a polyQ-length-dependent manner and co-localizes with cytoplasmic inclusions in the brains of HD mouse models. HDAC4 knock-down inhibited aggregate formation in both the R6/2 (N-terminal fragment) and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 (full-length knock-in) HD mouse models. This delay in aggregation occurred in the cytoplasm, consistent with the subcellular localisation of HDAC4 in mouse brain. We found no evidence for HDAC4 translocation to the nucleus during disease progression, and HDAC4 knock-down had no effect on HTT aggregation in the nucleus and no impact on global transcriptional dysregulation. HDAC4 reduction led to a marked restoration of the membrane properties of medium spiny neurons (MSNs) and of corticostriatal synaptic transmission. This was associated with an improvement in neurological phenotypes and extended survival. These data provide a clear demonstration that cytoplasmic pathogenic mechanisms contribute to HD-related neurodegenerative phenotypes and identify HDAC4 as a therapeutic target for HD.</p>

<title>Molecular Characterisation of <italic>Hdac4</italic> Knock-Down in Mouse Models of HD</title>
<p>In order to investigate whether HDAC4 is involved in the molecular pathogenesis of HD, we used a genetic approach to reduce HDAC4 levels in both the R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 knock-in HD mouse models. R6/2 mice are transgenic for a mutated N-terminal exon 1 HTT fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mangiarini1">[17]</xref>. The <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice have an expanded CAG repeat knocked in to the mouse huntingtin gene (<italic>Htt</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Lin1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Woodman1">[19]</xref>, which is partially mis-spliced with the result that these mice express mutant versions of both an exon 1 HTT and a full-length HTT protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Sathasivam1">[20]</xref>. Because <italic>Hdac4</italic> knock-out (<italic>Hdac</italic>4KO) mice die in early postnatal life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Vega1">[21]</xref>, the HD mutation could not be transferred onto an <italic>Hdac4</italic> null background. Therefore, we crossed males for each of the HD mouse models to <italic>Hdac4</italic>HET females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Analysis of the progeny indicated that <italic>Hdac4</italic> mRNA levels were decreased to approximately 50% in both <italic>Hdac4</italic>HET and double-mutant mice in both crosses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Since HDAC4 functions as a transcriptional corepressor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Martin1">[22]</xref>, it was important to check whether <italic>Hdac4</italic> knock-down regulated the expression of the R6/2 transgene, as this would be expected to modulate the onset and progression of disease in R6/2 mice. Therefore, we used Taqman qPCR to demonstrate that exon 1 <italic>HTT</italic> mRNA was not altered in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), cerebellum, nor striatum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) of Dble::R6/2 mice. Similarly, we showed that endogenous <italic>Htt</italic> levels were unchanged as a consequence of HDAC4 reduction in both R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g001">Figures 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s001">S1B</xref>). In addition, given that CAG repeat length is linked to aggregation kinetics and disease progression, we ensured that the CAG repeats were maintained at comparable levels throughout the course of this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s004">Table S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Alteration of HDAC4 levels has been shown to modulate <italic>Hdac9</italic> in muscle cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Haberland2">[23]</xref> and <italic>Hdac5</italic> in primary mouse hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mihaylova1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, we used Taqman qPCR to show that <italic>Hdac4</italic> knock-down did not affect the levels of the other 10 <italic>Hdacs</italic> in brain regions of mice that did or did not express the HD mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s001">S1C and S1D</xref>).</p>

<title>HDAC4 Knock-Down Reduces Aggregate Load and Increases Levels of Soluble HTT in Mouse Models of HD</title>
<p>Bioinformatic predictions of HDAC4 structure suggested that HDAC4 has an N-terminal coil–coil domain within which it possesses short polyQ tracts that might convey an increased propensity for amyloid formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Guo1">[15]</xref> as was confirmed in cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Bolger1">[13]</xref>. Hence, we hypothesized that HDAC4 might exhibit pro-aggregation properties in HD mouse models. In order to investigate the molecular consequences of HDAC4 knock-down in HD mice, we employed the Seprion ligand ELISA to quantify aggregate load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Sathasivam2">[25]</xref> and time-resolved Förster resonance energy transfer (TR-FRET) to measure soluble mutant HTT levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Weiss1">[26]</xref>.

<p>In R6/2 mice, the level of soluble exon 1 HTT decreases with disease progression as a consequence of its aggregation. The Seprion ELISA revealed that HDAC4 knock-down reduced the aggregate load in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), brain stem, hippocampus, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) of Dble::R6/2 mice at 4 and 9 wk but that this effect had diminished by 15 wk of age. Accordingly, TR-FRET demonstrated that reduced HDAC4 levels led to an increase in soluble exon 1 HTT in the cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), brain stem, hippocampus, and cerebellum (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s002">Figure S2B</xref>) of Dble::R6/2 mice at 4 and 9 but not at 15 wk of age.

Therefore, to investigate whether the reduction in aggregation occurred in the cytoplasm, as would be consistent with the presence of HDAC4, we perfomed cellular fractionation on 4 wk and 9 wk brain tissue. We then resolved detergent insoluble high-molecular weight aggregates from the nuclear and cytoplasmic lysates by agarose gel electrophoresis (AGERA), prepared western blots, and performed immunodetection with the S830 antibody (epitope: exon 1 HTT).

<title>The Decrease in Aggregate Load Is Not a Consequence of Strain Background</title>
<p>The R6/2 colony was maintained by backrossing to (CBA/Ca×C57BL/6J)F1 mice and the <italic>Hdac4</italic> knock-out mice had been bred to the same F1 background for more than six generations. We know from having bred R6/2 mice for 99 generations and from multiple experiments that the differential segregation of CBA/Ca and C57BL/6J alleles has no effect on HD-related phenotypes in R6/2 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Benn1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Moumne1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Hockly2">[33]</xref>. However, the <italic>Hdac4</italic> null allele had been created on a 129S mouse strain background, and it is inevitable that even after backcrossing to (CBA/Ca×C57BL/6J)F1 mice for multiple generations, the <italic>Hdac4</italic> null allele would be retained in a genomic region of 129S DNA that had not been removed by recombination. Therefore, it was possible that the observed effects might be due to genetic variation in the 129S <italic>Hdac4</italic>-linked haplotype rather than through a reduction in HDAC4. To rule out this scenario, we identified an <italic>Hdac4</italic>-linked single nucleotide polymorphism (SNP) that was polymorphic between 129S and both the C57BL/6J and CBA/Ca strain backgrounds. We crossed R6/2 mice to (129S×C57BL/6J)F1s and identified R6/2 progeny that either did not carry or were heterozygous for the 129S SNP (<italic>n</italic> = 7/genotype). The heterozygous mice contained the 129S haplotype with a wild-type <italic>Hdac4</italic> allele.

<title>HDAC4 Associates with Mutant HTT and Colocalizes with Cytoplasmic Inclusions</title>
<p>To further understand the nature of the reduction in aggregate load by HDAC4 knock-down, we reasoned that HDAC4 might associate with HTT. Hence, we employed an <italic>in vitro</italic> GST pull-down assay and found that HDAC4 interacted specifically with exon 1 HTT containing a 53 polyQ tract but not with its 20 polyQ counterpart (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To determine whether HDAC4 associates with endogenous HTT, we immunoprecipitated HTT (2B7, epitope 1–17) or HDAC4 (DM-15) from brain lysates of 8-wk-old WT (7Q), <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 heterozygous, and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 homozygous mice and immunoblotted with the MW1 (soluble mutant HTT), MAB2166 (soluble wild type and mutant HTT), and H-92 (HDAC4) antibodies. We found that mutant but not wild-type HTT co-immunoprecipitated with HDAC4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). To investigate the effect of polyQ length on this interaction, we repeated the experiment with lysates from 8-wk-old heterozygous knock-in mice carrying polyQ tracts of 20 (<italic>Hdh</italic>Q20) or 80 (<italic>Hdh</italic>Q80). We found that HDAC4 could immunoprecipitate HTT containing 80 but not 20 glutamines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down data. The sequence of HDAC4 is very similar to the class IIa member HDAC5.

Although there was a weak interaction between exon 1 HTT and HDAC5 by <italic>in vitro</italic> pull-down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), this was not specific to mutant HTT, as was the case for HDAC4, and HDAC5 failed to immunoprecipitate HTT from brain lysates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<p>To further explore this association between HDAC4 and mutant HTT, we performed immunohistochemistry to determine whether HDAC4 co-localized with nuclear and/or cytoplasmic inclusions. For this purpose, we validated a number of commercially available antibodies and found CS2072 to be specific for HDAC4 by fluorescent immunolabelling as it gave no signal on HDAC4KO P3 brain sections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s003">Figure S3A</xref>).

This cytoplasmic localisation of HDAC4 is supported by its co-localisation with the synaptic markers synaptophysin and PSD95 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Confocal microscopy showed that the S830 HTT antibody detects huntingtin aggregates in R6/2 and <italic>Hdh</italic>Q150 brains and that HDAC4 co-localised with some but not all cytoplasmic inclusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g003">Figures 3E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s003">S3B</xref>) in both cases.

<title>HDAC4 Reduction Does Not Rescue Global Transcription Dysregulation</title>
<p>Transcriptional dysregulation is a well-documented molecular characteristic of HD pathogenesis.

As expected the cortical expression profile was profoundly changed between WT and R6/2 mice by 9 wk of age and was further dysregulated at 15 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, comparison of the R6/2 and Dble::R6/2 profiles indicated that only a very small number of probe sets were predicted to be differentially expressed at statistically significant levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This suggested that reduction in HDAC4 had not served to rescue transcriptional dyregulation.

<title>HDAC4 Knock-Down Improves MSN Membrane Properties and Cortico-Striatal Synaptic Function</title>
<p>MSNs in symptomatic R6/2 mice show pronounced morphological abnormalities, including dendritic shrinkage and spine loss. Largely consistent with these anatomical changes, at a behaviorally symptomatic age, R6/2 MSNs display a marked increase in membrane resistance, depolarization of the resting membrane potential (RMP), and an increased intrinsic excitability in response to current injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Klapstein1">[36]</xref>. These phenotypes indicate that the R6/2 MSNs are hyperexcitable relative to MSNs in WT animals. In addition, symptomatic R6/2 mice display a progressive impairment in corticostriatal connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Cepeda1">[37]</xref>. In combination, this reduction of cortical input, coupled with the abnormal excitability of the MSNs within the R6/2 striatum, will have serious consequences for appropriate striatal information processing and resultant basal ganglia output. These features likely contribute and in part underlie the impaired behavioral function exhibited by these mice. We determined the extent of functional improvement in MSNs from Dble::R6/2 as compared to R6/2 mice at 7–8 and 12 wk of age. As previously published, R6/2 MSNs exhibited a higher membrane resistance than those from WT and <italic>Hdac4</italic>HET mice at both ages, which was restored to WT levels in Dble::R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5A,E</xref>).</p>

<p>While R6/2 MSNs at 7–8 wk of age were not significantly depolarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), by 12 wk the RMP was depolarized by approximately 3 mV relative to WT MSNs, and this was rescued in the Dble::R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Despite previous reports of reduced rheobasic current (minimum current injection required to elicit an action potential) in R6/2 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Klapstein1">[36]</xref>, this was a modest phenomenon in our hands and the reduction of HDAC4 in the Dble::R6/2 mice had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5C,G</xref>). Action potential amplitude was, however, significantly reduced in R6/2 compared to WT and <italic>Hdac4</italic>HET at both ages and was fully restored in the Dble::R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5D,H</xref>). To assess an improvement in corticostriatal transmission, glutamatergic excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) were evoked by stimulating layer V cortical afferents innervating the striatum. In both 7–8 and 12 wk age groups, R6/2 mice showed significant reduction in EPSC amplitude for any given stimulus intensity applied. There was no difference in evoked EPSCs per genotype between the two age groups, and the data were therefore pooled (<italic>n</italic> = 28–32 neurons per genotype; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). In the Dble::R6/2 mice, a significant restoration of evoked EPSC amplitude compared to R6/2 was noted. To further delineate the locus of this improvement, a paired-pulse stimulation paradigm (20 ms interstimulus interval) was employed to specifically assess glutamate release probability. R6/2 corticostriatal synapses displayed higher paired-pulse ratios than WT synapses, and this was significant in the 12-wk dataset, indicative of impaired glutamate release in this age group. This was fully restored in the Dble::R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5J</xref>). In agreement with the reduction in evoked glutamate release in R6/2 corticostriatal synapses, quantal glutamate release within the striatum, which can arise from release at both thalamostriatal and corticostriatal presynaptic terminals, was severely depressed in the 7–8-wk-old mice [mean frequency of mEPSCs in MSNs from WT = 2.3±0.25 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 12), <italic>Hdac4</italic>HET = 1.87±0.38 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 11), R6/2 mice = 0.13±0.03 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 11)]. The Dble::R6/2 mice showed a profound rescue in this phenotype, with a mean frequency of mEPSCs of 1.1±0.14 Hz (<italic>n</italic> = 12) (significance against R6/2 frequency assessed by Kolmogirov–Smirnoff analysis <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5K,L</xref>). There was no change in the amplitude of mEPSCs in R6/2 compared to WT mice, suggesting that postsynaptic 2-amino-3-(5-methyl-3-oxo-1,2-oxazole-4-yl) propanoic acid (AMPA) receptor function was not impaired in the HD model, and did not contribute to the impairment in glutamatergic transmission. mEPSC amplitude was unchanged in the <italic>Hdac4</italic>HET or Dble:R6/2 animals relative to WT or R6/2 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g005">Figure 5M</xref>).</p>
<p>In conclusion, the combined restoration of the membrane properties of MSNs from the Dble:R6/2 mice alongside the improvement in glutamatergic cortical input to the striatum would be expected to significantly improve striatal information processing, normalize aberrant basal ganglia output, and result in an improvement in behavioral function.</p>

<p>At 14 wk of age, close to end stage disease, the deterioration in the appearance of the Dble::R6/2 mice was considerably less marked than that of R6/2. To document this, we performed a modified SHIRPA analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Rogers1">[38]</xref> and measured 16 phenotypic parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s005">Table S2</xref>), for which nine gave a positive score in R6/2 as compared to WT mice. In all cases, the appearance of these phenotyes was improved in the Dble::R6/2 mice when compared to R6/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In particular, piloerection and tremor could not be detected in Dble::R6/2 mice, and hunched back and body tone were vastly improved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The phenotypic improvements are evident in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s009">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001717.s010">S2</xref>, and in the light of these, it was surprising that we were unabe to detect an any marked decrease in body weight loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The dramatic improvement in the appearance of the mice led us to assess whether HDAC4 knock-down had pro-survival effects, and we found that it extended the lifespan of R6/2 mice by approximately 20%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004 (log-rank test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g006">Figure 6C</xref>).</p>
<p>Brain weight was measured for cohorts of mice that were culled at 8, 12, and 15 wk of age, and as previously described, there was a progressive decrease in the weight of R6/2 brains as compared to WT. HDAC4 knock-down resulted in a very slight but statistically significant increase in brain weight at 9 and 12 but not at 15 wk of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001717-g006">Figure 6E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>There is mounting support for the use of HDAC inhibitors in the treatment of a wide range of brain disorders, predominantly aimed at pathological alterations in the brain transcriptome. HDAC4 is a transcriptional repressor that is normally retained in the cytoplasm, but localises to the nucleus upon de-phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Zhao1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Miska1">[40]</xref>. In line with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Darcy1">[41]</xref>, we found that HDAC4 was located in the cytoplasm in mouse brain and showed that it did not relocate to the nucleus during disease progression. We demonstrated that HDAC4 associates with mutant HTT in a polyQ-dependent manner <italic>in vivo</italic>, consistent with an association that occurs between the polyQ stretch in HTT and the Q-rich domain of HDAC4. In line with these observations, we found that HDAC4 co-localised with cytoplasmic inclusions in both R6/2 and knock-in HD mouse models. The genetic knock-down of HDAC4 led to a significant delay in the cytoplasmic aggregation process and led to a significant restoration of synaptic function. At a physiological level, knock-down of HDAC4 extended lifespan and partially restored motor coordination and other neurological phenotypes. This suggests that a cytoplasm-based pathophysiological mechanism contributes to key aspects of neurodegenerative phenotype observed in HD.</p>
<p>A cytoplasmic mechanism of action for HDAC4-mediated beneficial effects was unexpected. In general, HDACs have been pursued as therapeutic targets because of their impact on epigenetics and transcription. HDAC4 is known to repress <italic>MEF2</italic> in muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Miska1">[40]</xref>, and it has been proposed that HDAC4 binds to HDAC3 to activate its deacetylase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mihaylova1">[24]</xref>. However, we found no impact on global transcriptional dysregulation upon HDAC4 knock-down in R6/2 mice, consistent with a predominantly cytoplasmic localisation of HDAC4. Surprisingly, the absence of HDAC4 in knock-out postnatal brain tissue had little effect on the brain transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mielcarek2">[42]</xref>. In fact, it has been shown that HDAC4 does not function as a lysine-deacetylase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Bottomley1">[43]</xref>, and consistent with this, we found that HDAC4 knock-out had no effect on global acetylation in brain <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mielcarek2">[42]</xref>. Our demonstration that the dysregulation of <italic>Bdnf</italic> promoter transcripts was alleviated in the double mutant mice is consistent with a cytoplasmic-based mechanism of action. <italic>Bdnf</italic> expression is repressed by RE1 silencing transcription factor (REST), which is retained in the cytoplasm in a complex containing HTT and which translocates to the nucleus in response to HD pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Zuccato1">[44]</xref>. The cytoplasmic aggregation process initiates prior to a reduction in <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts in R6/2 and other HD mouse models, and therefore it is not surprising that a delay in this cytoplasmic pathology might in turn result in a delay in <italic>Bdnf</italic> dysregulation.</p>
<p>Our demonstration that a delay in the cytoplasmic aggregation process has beneficial consequences is supported by the published correlation between the appearance of neuropil aggregates and disease progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Li1">[45]</xref> and is consistent with previous predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Benn3">[46]</xref>. In the human HD <italic>post mortem</italic> brain, neuropil aggregates are much more common than nuclear inclusions, present in a large numbers, and potentially associated with onset of clinical symptoms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Gutekunst1">[47]</xref>. Our data suggest that HDAC4 might modulate HTT aggregation through a direct interaction serving to template or nucleate soluble HTT. Alternatively, given that HDAC4 may self-aggregate, it could influence HTT aggregation indirectly through perturbation of proteostasis networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Kikis1">[48]</xref>. The delay in HTT aggregation afforded by a reduction in HDAC4 was most pronounced in presymptomatic and early-stage disease and diminished with disease progression, presumably reflecting changes in aggregation kinetics. This association between phenotypic improvements and a shift from aggregated to soluble mutant exon 1 HTT is consistent with our previously published <italic>in vivo</italic> studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Labbadia1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Labbadia2">[50]</xref>. Our data provide no information as to the aggregate species that is toxic, or as to whether all species of aggregates have detrimental consequences, but only indicate that shifting the equilibrium toward soluble HTT is beneficial <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>The improvement in synaptic function as a consequence of HDAC4 knock-down was not related to a restoration in the expression level of dysregulated synaptic transcripts. Instead, it may act through reducing cytoplasmic aggregation as neuropil aggregates have been shown to inhibit axonal transport, synaptic function, and glutamate release in HD fly models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Gunawardena1">[51]</xref>. The restoration of corticostriatal synaptic function demonstrated that the reduction of HDAC4 has functional consequences in the brain. However, in this study, HDAC4 was ubiquitously knocked down, and as HD has a peripheral component to its pathophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Sassone1">[52]</xref>, it is conceivable that the reduction of HDAC4 also had beneficial consequences in tissues other than the brain. Given that HDAC4 has well-established functions in muscle, that muscle atrophy is a major symptom of HD, and that HDAC4 has been linked to disease progression in an ALS mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Moresi1">[53]</xref>, we are currently investigating the extent to which HDAC4 reduction in muscle might contribute to the improved HD phenotypes.</p>
<p>The administration of HDAC inhibitors has been shown to improve disease phenotypes in a wide range of HD models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Kazantsev1">[5]</xref>. To better understand which HDACs, when inhibited, are most responsible for these beneficial consequences, we embarked on a series of genetic manipulations in HD mouse models. In this article we show that the genetic knock-down of HDAC4 delayed cytoplasmic aggregation, improved synaptic function, and improved disease phenotypes. In contrast, the genetic knock-down of HDAC3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Moumne1">[27]</xref> and the class IIa members HDAC7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Benn1">[10]</xref>, HDAC5, and HDAC9 (our unpublished data) had no effect on R6/2 phenotypes. Strikingly, we recently showed that administration of SAHA caused a reduction in HDAC2 and HDAC4 at the protein but not RNA level in some R6/2 brain regions and that this correlated with a reduction in aggregation and a restoration of cortical <italic>Bdnf</italic> transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Mielcarek1">[11]</xref>. Therefore, we speculate that the beneficial effects of SAHA were at least in part transmitted through the down-regulation of HDAC4 via a mechanism not related to its enzyme activity.</p>
<p>Perhaps the best validated therapeutic target for HD is the HTT protein, and the reduction of HTT through gene silencing is being developed using both antisense oligonucleotides and RNAi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Sah1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Yu1">[56]</xref>. However, delivery to the brain is a major challenge for these approaches, and as HTT has many essential functions, the potential liability of decreasing HTT to a detrimental level cannot be ignored. We have shown that reduction of HDAC4 shifts the ratio from aggregated to soluble HTT and therefore acts directly on the HD mutation. Our demonstration that HDAC4 levels can be decreased through the administration of a small brain-penetrant molecule (SAHA) is extremely promising as more selective inhibitors (e.g., specific to HDAC4 or class IIa enzymes) may have similar effects, making it possible to target HTT aggregation with a small molecule. Finally, these findings may have wider implications as HDAC4 is a component of Lewy Bodies in Parkinson's disease brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-TakahashiFujigasaki1">[57]</xref> and administration of SAHA improved the synaptic plasticity and learning behaviour in an Alzheimer disease model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001717-Kilgore1">[58]</xref>.</p>
