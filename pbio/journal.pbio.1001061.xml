                instantaneously, zipping towards food or away from toxins. How do such simple
                organisms do something so complex? It's all in the flagella, a tail-like
                structure with rotating helical filaments. The flagella work in unison to propel the
                cell forward by rotating counterclockwise and thus bundling together. When the
                flagella reverse their rotation to clockwise, they disrupt the bundle and make the
                cell tumble in place. When the flagella shift back to counterclockwise again, the
                bacteria set off on a new course.</p>
      <p>This description of bacterial locomotion is well known, but the mechanisms that allow
                the flagella to shift gears from counterclockwise to clockwise have proven difficult
                to identify. Now, in a new study in this issue of <italic>PLoS Biology</italic>,
                Katsumi Imada, Tohru Minamino and colleagues bring us closer to answering this
                fundamental question and propose a new model describing how flagella manage this
                switch.</p>
      <p>Filaments in the flagella are powered by rotary motors that span the cell membrane.
                Things of beauty, these motors are tooled so precisely that they are nearly
                100% efficient, and their direction is set by a rotor that can turn thousands
                of revolutions per minute. The rotor shifts from the forward-propelling
                counterclockwise to the tumble-inducing clockwise when chemical gradients tell
                bacteria they've gone astray, for example, away from food. This activates a
                cytoplasmic signaling protein that binds proteins in the rotor switch, changing the
                orientation of another switch protein called FliG and thereby reversing the
                rotor's spin to clockwise.</p>
      <p>The details of the switch mechanism had been hypothesized but were as yet unproven.
                Previous X-ray crystallography studies of a FliG fragment had shown that two of its
                domains (FliG<sub>M</sub> and FliG<sub>C</sub>) are connected by a helical linker
                called helix E, and the 3-D structure of a FliG protein predicted from its DNA
                sequence suggested that helix E might be flexible enough to make a good molecular
                switch. This suggestion was further supported by a 2010 report that compared the
                structure of a full-length FliG to the fragment: helix E was tightly packed in
                closed conformation in the full-length structure, but was in open conformation and
                dissociated from FliG<sub>M</sub> in the fragment.</p>
      <p>To find out if helix E is indeed the molecular switch that sets the direction of
                rotor spin, the researchers compared wild-type and mutant FliG fragments containing
                the two domains linked by helix E. The wild-type motors were set to spin
                counterclockwise by experimental conditions, and the mutant had a type of amino acid
                deletion that sets the rotor spin to clockwise. As expected, X-ray crystallography
                revealed that the wild-type (counterclockwise) and mutant (clockwise) FliG fragments
                had different helix E conformations.</p>
      <p>The difference was in the hinge between helix E and FliG<sub>M</sub>, reorienting the
                former and exposing part of the latter in the mutant fragments, suggesting that this
                hinge may be the molecular switch that shifts FliG's orientation between
                counterclockwise and clockwise states. This conclusion was strengthened by the
                finding that while the FliG proteins studied came from several bacteria species and
                varied considerably, they shared a conserved FliG<sub>M</sub>-FliG<sub>C</sub>
                element.</p>
      <p>Based on their discovery, the researchers propose a new model for rotational
                switching in bacterial flagella. The rotor base has a ring of FliG subunits that
                switch cooperatively between counterclockwise and clockwise states. The model holds
                that besides affecting the orientation of its own subunit, the hinge between helix E
                and FliG<sub>M</sub> also affects the orientation of the neighboring FliG subunit.
                Thus, conformational change of this molecular switch rapidly spreads from subunit to
                subunit, thus propagating it all around the ring.</p>
      <p>This work provides the most direct evidence yet that helix E is the molecular switch
                underlying the flagellar motor's gear shift from counterclockwise to clockwise,
                as well as the most complete model of the cooperative flagellar switch. Besides
                advancing our understanding of the flagellar motor, which is a marvel of nature,
                this study could help lay the groundwork for developing drugs that target key motor
                proteins and so immobilize harmful bacteria.</p>
