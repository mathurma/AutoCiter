        <p>A crystal structure reveals an elegant mechanistic switch whereby helical bending and catalytic domain rotation allow self-activation of a histidine kinase during a bacterial stress response.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Two-component systems (TCSs) are important for the adaptation and survival of bacteria and fungi under stress conditions. A TCS is often composed of a membrane-bound sensor histidine kinase (SK) and a response regulator (RR), which are relayed through sequential phosphorylation steps. However, the mechanism for how an SK is switched on in response to environmental stimuli remains obscure. Here, we report the crystal structure of a complete cytoplasmic portion of an SK, VicK from <italic>Streptococcus mutans</italic>. The overall structure of VicK is a long-rod dimer that anchors four connected domains: HAMP, Per-ARNT-SIM (PAS), DHp, and catalytic and ATP binding domain (CA). The HAMP, a signal transducer, and the PAS domain, major sensor, adopt canonical folds with dyad symmetry. In contrast, the dimer of the DHp and CA domains is asymmetric because of different helical bends in the DHp domain and spatial positions of the CA domains. Moreover, a conserved proline, which is adjacent to the phosphoryl acceptor histidine, contributes to helical bending, which is essential for the autokinase and phosphatase activities. Together, the elegant architecture of VicK with a signal transducer and sensor domain suggests a model where DHp helical bending and a CA swing movement are likely coordinated for autokinase activation.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Two-component signal transduction systems (TCSs) are promising targets for new antimicrobial research because they help bacteria and fungi adapt and survive. One of the main components of TCSs is a sensor histidine kinase (SK), which relays extracellular signals to intracellular pathways. Despite intensive research, a full-length structure of an SK has yet to be solved. In this study, we report the first crystal structure of the complete cytoplasmic region of VicK, an important SK in the tooth decay pathogen <italic>S. mutans</italic>. VicK is composed of several domains (HAMP, PAS, DHp, and catalytic and ATP binding domain [CA]) in addition to a short transmembrane domain. We find that the dimeric VicK protein has an elegant rod-shaped structure with the domains linearly connected like beads on a string. The structure suggests that VicK kinase activates itself by helical bending of the DHp domain and coordinated swinging around of the catalytic CA domain to engage with the target histidine. Structure-based mutagenesis experiments also helped us to identify key residues that are required for VicK's opposing phosphatase activity. Our studies of the multi-modular VicK protein suggest a sequential kinase activation model that may involve helical bending of the DHp domain and repositioning of the CA domains.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Protein phosphorylation is an essential signal carrier. Bacteria respond to transient living environments through transmembrane-integrated sensor histidine kinases (SKs), which act in concert with their intracellular cognate response regulators (RRs) to elicit necessary adaptive responses that are critical for their survival and virulence. The SKs and RRs have evolved into a two-component signal transduction system (TCS), whereby stimulation of the SK autophosphorylates at a conserved histidine residue to initiate a signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Nixon1">[1]</xref>. The phosphoryl group is transferred from the SKs to their cognate RRs, some of which lead to quickly reprogram bacteria by altering the transcriptional level of specific downstream target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Stock1">[2]</xref>. Because of the wide prevalence in bacteria and fungi, TCSs have been considered attractive targets for the development of potential therapeutics to control bacterial infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Stephenson1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Gotoh1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sensor domains are key modulators for SKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Zhulin1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Galperin1">[7]</xref>. PAS domains (acronym for Per, ARNT, and SIM from <italic>Drosophila</italic>) are sensors in a majority of SKs, which respond to alterations in the redox potential, oxygen content, light, and small molecules in their environments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Ponting1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Taylor1">[9]</xref>. Because of their broad involvement in biological processes, the structure and function of the PAS domains in interactions with a variety of ligands have been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Moglich1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Henry1">[11]</xref>. The oligomeric dynamics of PAS domains in cooperation with local conformational changes can affect the stability of the entire SK, which is thought to be part of the mechanism of signal sensing and transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Moglich1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Slavny1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The enzymatic activities of SKs are modulated by HAMP domains, which are commonly found in histidine kinase, adenylyl cyclase, methyl-accepting chemotaxis, and phosphatase proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Aravind1">[6]</xref>. Structural dynamics of the HAMP domain are believed to mediate transmembrane signal transductions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Parkinson1">[13]</xref>. The NMR structure of a HAMP domain from the putative transmembrane receptor Af1503 in <italic>Archaeoglobus fulgidus</italic> revealed an unusual knobs-to-knobs interhelical structure, which suggests a coordinated helical rotation model for the HAMP domain in signal transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Hulko1">[14]</xref>. This model was further supported by a series of experimental structures of the HAMP mutants and detailed bioinformatics analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-DuninHorkawicz1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Ferris1">[16]</xref>. Several other laboratories reached a consensus conclusion using homologous HAMP domains from different TCSs that the dynamic properties of the HAMP domains are essential in mediating signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Manson1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Watts2">[22]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The C-terminal catalytic and ATP-binding domain (CA) of the SKs, also called HATPase_c, in addition to the DHp domain (dimerization and histidine phosphorylation domain), phosphorylates a conserved histidine residue in the middle of DHp helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Stock1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Marina1">[23]</xref>. The active site of an SK is assembled with the CA and DHp domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Marina1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Tomomori1">[24]</xref>. The plasticity of the DHp domain and CA positioning is implicated in the on/off switch of the temperature sensor DesK kinase from <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Albanesi1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>VicRK is a well-characterized TCS that is highly conserved and essential for survival and virulence in a wide range of firmicute bacteria, including <italic>Streptococci</italic>, <italic>Bacilli</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococci</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Dubrac1">[26]</xref>. Because of its critical role in cell wall synthesis, VicRK is also referred to as WalRK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Dubrac2">[27]</xref>. The VicRK in <italic>S. mutans</italic>, which is an important pathogen in caries etiology, regulates acid production and tolerance conducive to dental caries, including proton expulsion (F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub>-ATPase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Ajdic1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Senadheera2">[31]</xref>. VicK belongs to the type IA family based on sequence conservation of the DHp and CA domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Kim1">[32]</xref>. In addition, VicK has one HAMP domain and one PAS domain. However, the function of the PAS domain is not clear because no ligand has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Dubrac1">[26]</xref>.

Although the structure and functions of individual domains are well known, the signal transduction mechanisms remain largely unknown.

        <p>The <italic>S. mutans</italic> VicK has one transmembrane domain (TM, aa 9–30) that anchors itself to the cytoplasmic membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Following the TM domain, a HAMP signal transducer domain and PAS sensor domain are directly connected to the CA domain through a DHp domain. As several attempts to express full-length VicK (aa 1–450) resulted in insoluble protein, the entire intracellular region (TVicK, aa 31–450) was successfully purified and crystallized. TVicK had a K<sub>m</sub> of 44.5 µM and a K<sub>cat</sub> of 0.413 min<sup>−1</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s013">Table S1</xref>).

        <p>VicK crystals diffracted slightly better than 3 Å; however, because of strong anisotropy, the final structure was refined up to only 3.3 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s014">Table S2</xref>). The overall structure of VicK comprises a dimer in the shape of a long slim rod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The longest dimension of this molecule is nearly 150 Å (Cα distance). Each monomer contains a series of helices (α1–α11). One asymmetric unit contains two VicK dimers. Remarkably, the total buried surface area is 7590.8 Å<sup>2</sup> upon VicK dimerization. The dimer interface consists of three tight hydrophobic contact patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figure 1D, I–III</xref>). In addition, the HAMP, PAS, and DHp domains are organized as dimers, which are connected by long, straight coiled-coils of helices α2 and α6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

        <p>The helical interactions within the HAMP domain can be grouped into three shells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). The outer shell is formed by hydrophilic and polar residues at positions <italic>b</italic>, <italic>e</italic>, and <italic>g</italic> of the coiled-coil in addition to two residues from loop L1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The residues at the <italic>b</italic> and <italic>g</italic> positions in helix α1 are rich in basic residues with long side chains, whereas the corresponding positions in α2 are rich in polar residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, gold). The middle shell is formed with hydrophobic residues, including leucine, isoleucine, and valine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s001">Figure S1B</xref>, green). These residues form the canonical knobs-into-holes packing of coiled-coils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Crick1">[37]</xref>. Central to the VicK HAMP bundle are the hydrophobic residues that are all in van der Waals contacts and display knobs-to-knobs or x-layer packing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s001">S1B</xref>, blue).</p>
        <p>The HAMP outer shell is distinct with three bound rings visible on the electrostatic surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Within this bundled structure, there are three pairs of hydrophobic residues in the knobs-to-knobs packing solely from two α2 helices. Two Leu71 residues compose the inside core of the first ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) and two Leu78 residues are inside the core of the second ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Strikingly, the Phe82 pair forms π-π stacking inside the third ring, which is further stabilized by two Tyr56 residues from two L1 loops (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Indeed, Tyr56 is completely conserved in <italic>Streptococci</italic>, whereas Phe82 can be replaced by leucine in Af1503 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In other HAMPs, position 82 can be Ile, Val, or Leu, whereas position 56 is typically Leu, Phe, or Tyr <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-DuninHorkawicz1">[15]</xref>. These residues are also capable of making van der Waals contacts if placed into the VicK HAMP domain (unpublished data).

        <title>The PAS Domain Dimer</title>
        <p>The PAS domain (aa 87–198) in VicK, which is located downstream of the HAMP domain, adopts a canonical fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

The five β-strands form a core of β-sheets, which are sandwiched by two α2 helices on one side and helices α3–5 on the other. The loop L3 and the connected helix α5 form a surface layer on the top of the β-sheet with two flexible loops, L4 and L5, on both edges. Three substantial binding pockets (S1–3) with a large cavity and inside tunnel are observed on this surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

        <p>The VicK PAS domains form a unique dimer, which is mediated by a leucine-zipper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This leucine-zipper further forms hydrophobic networks with the canonical PAS domain, which suggests that the leucine-zipper is an integral part of the VicK PAS domains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). The residues Leu89, Leu96, Leu100, and Lys93 are in key positions to make van der Waals contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The substitution of Leu100 with arginine was previously shown to disrupt VicK autokinase activity in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Echenique1">[38]</xref>. It is likely that the L100R mutation destabilizes the dimerization of the VicK PAS domains, which sheds light on the functional importance of PAS dimerization.</p>
        <p>To look for clues of ligands for VicK PAS domains, we compared the VicK PAS domains with representative structures of all ligand-bound PAS domains according to a recent comprehensive review by Henry and Crosson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Henry1">[11]</xref>. Despite their limited sequence identities (6%–10%), all PAS domains can be structurally aligned to VicK with low rmsd of 2–2.5 Å (Figures S3 and S4). The relatively large shifts were observed in loops L3 to L5 and helix α5 of the PAS domains of NifL, FixL, DcuS, and PhoQ, which form pockets for a variety of ligands to bind. Therefore, the VicK PAS domain may bind some ligands differently from these PAS domains because it has a unique cavity and tunnel properties.</p>

        <title>The Overall Structure of the Histidine-Specific ATPase</title>
        <p>The C-terminal end of VicK (aa 199–450) contains a histidine-specific ATPase, which is often divided into one DHp domain and one CA domain with a short linker (aa 270–278) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The dimeric architecture of these domains looks like a butterfly, wherein the DHp domain (aa 199–269) is a four-helix bundle of helices α6 and α7 with a phosphoryl receptor histidine located in the middle (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Surrounding this helical core are two CA domains with a layer of four helices (α8 to α11) on a layer of β-sheets (β7 to β12), wherein α10 is a short helix (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). The two loop regions, L7 (aa 303–308) and L11 (aa 391–395) in the CA domain, called the lid, could not be well defined because of a weak electron density and are labeled with light dashed lines. One linker (aa 270–274), which connects the DHp and CA domains, was also disordered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s005">Figure S5A</xref>, the monomer in magenta).</p>

The CA domain of VicK is similar to HK853 (rmsd of 1.7 Å) except for structural differences in loops L7 and L8 in addition to the loop L11 region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s005">Figure S5C</xref>).

        <title>Helical Bending in the DHp Domain</title>

Interestingly, the two monomers of the DHp domain bear an asymmetric fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The two monomers are well aligned with an rmsd of 2.2 Å for the bottom part of the coiled-coil (aa 219–255), and the relatively large rmsd of the alignment is mostly caused by flexibility of loop L6. However, the upper parts of helices α6 and α7 are remarkably different, wherein helix α6 bends ∼25° at Pro222 toward the central DHp axis and α7 moves ∼11° away in the opposite direction to avoid a possible clash.</p>

Therefore, we hypothesized that the low helical propensity of the DHp domain may play a role in His217 phosphorylation. To test this, we mutated Pro222 to glycine and measured its autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s013">Table S1</xref>). The P222G mutant retained full activity when compared to wild-type (wt) VicK, as did the T221A mutant.

Consistently, the combined mutants VSP2AAA, VST2AAA, and VSTP2AAAA, which contain Pro222 and Thr221 substitutions, also showed little phosphatase activity (lanes 10–12).

A clear conversion to unphosphorylated VicR was also observed when incubated with the VS2AA mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, run 3). All other VicK mutants, including T221A, P222A, TP2AA, and VST2AAA, failed to dephosphorylate VicR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, runs 4–7).</p>

        <title>Active State of the CA Domain</title>
        <p>Although the overall conformation of each CA domain in VicK is the same, their positions relative to the DHp domain show dramatic differences, which generates an asymmetrical ATPase dimer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

        <p>The large shift of the CA domain of monomer <italic>A</italic> moves its active site to the <italic>in cis</italic> phosphoryl acceptor His217. Recently, a crystal structure of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> YycG CA domain bound to ATP was solved, which is 47% identical to the CA domain of <italic>S. mutans</italic> VicK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Celikel1">[40]</xref>. These two structures of the CA domains aligned well with an rmsd of 1.47 Å of all backbone atoms, which is where the ATP from the structure of the YycG CA domain was modeled nicely in the active pocket of the VicK CA domain. To our surprise, we found that the γ-phosphate of ATP approached His217 to form two hydrogen bonds with εΝ or δN of His217 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, yellow dashed lines). In addition, Leu265 from monomer <italic>B</italic> is close to His217 to form van der Waals interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, grey dashed lines). Arg220 of monomer <italic>A</italic> and Arg269 of monomer <italic>B</italic> are also in close contact with His217.</p>
        <p>In addition to the ATP binding pocket, the CA domain positions itself toward the DHp domain to form a large interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Many residues are involved in the direct interaction between the DHp and CA domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Arg294, Asp326, Gln330, Asn334/337, and Arg385 of the CA domain form hydrogen bonds with Glu218, Thr221, Glu253, Arg256, and Arg259 residues around the middle region of the DHp domain. In addition, Arg382 and Asp387 form hydrogen bonds with Arg206 and Glu207 at the upper part of the DHp domain. Phe295, Ile298, Phe383, and Ile403 of the CA domain also form van der Waals contacts with Asn214, Thr224, Ser225, and Tyr229 of the DHp domain. Ile403, which is located on the back of the ATP binding pocket of VicK, is one of the key residues that contribute to the hydrophobic interaction with Leu267 and the aliphatic side chain of Glu218.</p>
        <p>To test whether these interactions are important for autokinase activity, we generated a series of mutants and analyzed their autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The Arg294, Gln297, Ile298, Asn334, and Asn337 mutations (R294A, Q297A/I298A, and N334A/N337A) were nearly as active as wt VicK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 5, 7, and 9). In contrast, mutations of Asp326, Gln330, Arg382, Arg385, and Phe383 (D326A/Q330A, R382A/R385A, and F383A/R385A) dramatically suppressed VicK autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 8, 10, and 12), whereas the dual mutations of D326A/N337A and R382A/R385A completely eliminated VicK autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 13). As references, two mutations in the ATP-binding pocket (K341A/Y342A) and a deletion of the first G loop (del392–395, RAQG) negatively affected autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 11 and 14). Two Ile403 mutations I403W and I403S did not significantly affect VicK autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, lanes 3 and 4). Interestingly, the I403W mutation was found to dramatically increase autokinase activity in HK853 (I448W) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Marina1">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Together, the CA domain of monomer <italic>A</italic> can position itself toward the DHp domain to form a large interface, which is further centered by two groups of key residues. One group is D326/Q330, which forms hydrogen bonds with Arg259 of the DHp domain. Another group is R382 and R385, which form hydrogen bonds with Glu207 and Glu218 of the DHp domain. F383 inserts into a hydrophobic pocket in the DHp domain and further stabilizes the interactions between the CA and DHp domains. Therefore, a mutant (D326A/Q330A/R382A/R385A) that disrupts both groups of key residues completely eliminated the autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, lane 13).</p>

        <title>Positioning of Inactive CA Domain</title>
        <p>The CA domain of VicK monomer <italic>B</italic> stays away from the DHp domain and represents an inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s005">S5A</xref>). A relatively small interface is formed mainly by van der Waals interactions between Phe383, Ile403, and Leu399 from the CA domain and Phe211, Val215, and Leu264 from the DHp domain, which are further stabilized by several hydrogen bonds between Arg382, Arg385, Asp271, and Glu218 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s010">Figure S10</xref>). The buried surface of this interface is 623 Å<sup>2</sup>, which suggests that it may not be sufficiently stable. Phe383 and Leu399 appear to be the most important residues because they insert into helices α6 and α7 for extensive van der Waals interactions with Leu264 and Val215. When compared with <italic>T. maritima</italic> HK853 alone, the VicK CA domain rotates ∼76° along an axis vertical to the DHp domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Overall, the CA domain remains inactive by positioning itself away from the DHp domain and this interface may act as a hinge.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The ability to mount a rapid response to various stress signals is essential for the adaptation and survival of prokaryotic cells. Some of the TCSs convert these stress signals ultimately to transcriptional reprogramming for necessary adaptive responses. How SKs are activated in response to these stimuli to initiate subsequent signal transduction cascades has been a long-standing question. In this study, we report the crystal structure of the entire intracellular portion of VicK (aa 31–450), which comprises an SK dimer with one signal transducer, one signal sensor, and one intact kinase domain. This structure allows us to dissect the molecular mechanisms underlying SK-mediated signal transduction in prokaryotes.</p>

        <title>VicK Is a Long Rod-Shaped Molecule</title>
        <p>Our crystal structure revealed a long rod-shaped VicK holoenzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The three modules of the HAMP, PAS, and DHp/CA domains are connected through two groups of straight helices. Such an extended VicK molecule may provide sufficient surface and accessibility for potential ligands or protein partners to interact with.</p>
        <p>The long shaped molecules often have the largest radius of gyration and tend to polymerize. VicK and its homologs have one or two integrated TMs rather than being free cytosolic proteins and are localized as clusters within the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Dubrac1">[26]</xref>.

        <title>Signal Transduction by HAMP</title>
        <p>A long-standing question is how HAMP domains serve in signal transduction because they often directly connect TMs and extracellular sensors. The HAMP domains may undergo a 26° rotation, which is derived from the unusual knobs-to-knobs packing of the solution structure of Af1503 HAMP, when they receive transmembrane signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Hulko1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-DuninHorkawicz1">[15]</xref>. The crystal structure of concatenated HAMP domains from <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> Aer-2 implicates that the conformational dynamics may also serve a role in signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Airola1">[20]</xref>. Consistently, a series of structure and functional experiments have shown that intrinsic thermodynamic instability is required for HAMP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Ferris1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Manson1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Zhou1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Zhou2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Kishii1">[43]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The VicK HAMP domain appears to be a stable four-helix coiled-coil with classical knobs-into-holes interactions, wherein three pairs of hydrophobic residues from helix α2 form a central hydrophobic core with knobs-to-knobs packing, and it is unlikely that structural alternations of the HAMP domain play a central role in signal transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s001">S1B</xref>). The VicK HAMP domain is further stabilized by Phe82, which is conserved in the majority of streptococcal species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s011">S11</xref>). However, variable residues, including isoleucine, valine, and occasionally threonine, are present at position 82 in some VicK homologs, which suggests that the stability of HAMP domains may vary in different species.</p>
        <p>It is worth noting that the α2 helices of the HAMP domain connect with downstream PAS domains through continuous helices, part of which (aa 86–103) form a fairly rigid leucine-zipper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This long helical structure most likely serves two purposes: (1) The HAMP domain might be further stabilized by additional interlock packing of the coiled-coil; and (2) The HAMP domain can easily transfer any conformational change down to the PAS domain. In contrast, the connection of the α6 helices between the PAS and DHp domains, particularly a short linker between α6 and β5, is rather flexible. Thus, the VicK molecule also appears to have a potential thermodynamic property for signal transduction from the HAMP or PAS domains to the catalytic CA domains.</p>

        <title>Mobile PAS Domain</title>
        <p>The VicK PAS domains form a stable dimer through the short leucine-zipper (aa 89–103) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In general, canonical PAS domains are rather flexible and readily subjected to ligand-induced conformational changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Taylor1">[9]</xref>. The three loops, L3–L5, form a mobile surface that could be regulated by unknown ligands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Winkler et al. recently demonstrated that deletion of the PAS domain but not a triple mutation (D133N, N136Y, and L140R) of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> VicK reduced the autokinase activity and, more dramatically, phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Gutu1">[33]</xref>. A similar deletion experiment also showed that the PAS domain is essential for the phosphatase activity of <italic>T. maritima</italic> ThkA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Yamada1">[44]</xref>. Our <italic>S. mutans</italic> VicK structure shows that Leu135 (equivalent to N136 of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> VicK) stabilizes helix α4 by interactions with Ile116 and Ile139 (equivalent to L140 of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> VicK), which contributes to the hydrophobic cavity of the PAS domain (unpublished data). Therefore, it is likely that an Ile139 to arginine mutation only disrupted potential ligand binding but not dimerization. In contrast, an L100R mutation disrupted dimerization of the PAS domain, and in turn, the kinase activity of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> VicK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Echenique1">[38]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In ligand-free VicK, helix α5 adapts an open conformation when compared to flavin adenine dinucleotide (FAD)-bound NifL, heme-bound FixL, and malate-bound DcuS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Thus, loop L3 is able to provide a sufficient cavity and tunnel for potential ligands to bind. Interestingly, when aligned with PhoQ, helix α4 and loop L3 of the VicK PAS domain adapt significantly different conformations and the trajectory of helix α5 is similar. Unfortunately, despite our efforts, no ligand specific to the VicK PAS domain has been experimentally identified. Only when such ligands are identified will it be possible to analyze how induced conformational changes regulate VicK catalytic activities. Therefore, this remains an interesting area for future research.</p>

        <title>The Low Helical Propensity of the DHp Domain</title>
        <p>The local region around the phosphoryl receptor histidine of DHp domains is highly conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Huynh1">[45]</xref>. We found that this region has a low helical propensity and is subject to significant helical bending, which is consistent with its low helical propensity. The helical bending most likely helps place His217 in close proximity to the CA domain to allow hydrogen bonds to form with the γ-phosphate of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">6B</xref>).

The HK853 DHp domain also bends 20° when bound to its cognate RR468 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Casino1">[46]</xref>. Therefore, the helical bending appears to be an intrinsic property of the DHp domain and is relevant to its function. Indeed, we showed that the combined mutations, through introducing alanines (VSP2AAA and VSTP2AAAA) into the DHp domain, abolished VicK autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Residues Pro222 and Thr221 are conserved among VicK homologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Interestingly, these residues are essential for phosphatase activity because mutations of either P222A or T221A abolished the phosphatase activity of VicK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Proline, which produces a kink and 18–35° bending that affects the thermodynamic stability of the α-helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Yun1">[47]</xref>, plays key roles in the transmembrane signaling of several proteins, including G-protein-coupled receptors and voltage-gated potassium channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Sansom1">[48]</xref>. In addition to proline, threonine and serine residues are able to bend a helix 3–4° larger than alanine, which is important for the channel gating of voltage-dependent connexin32 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Ballesteros1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001493-Ri1">[50]</xref>.

        <p>The buried surface of the active monomer <italic>A</italic> is 1140 Å<sup>2</sup>. However, this interface is mainly composed of hydrophilic and polar residues, which suggests that these contacts may only be transient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Our mutagenesis experiments showed that these residues are important for VicK autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Interestingly, while Ile403 mediates van der Waals contacts with Asn214 and Glu218 in the active state, it also contributes to the interface in the inactive state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s010">S10</xref>). Thr221 mediates a hydrogen bond with Asn337 and van der Waals interactions with Phe295 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). The T221A mutation eliminated phosphatase activity but did not affect the autokinase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g005">5</xref>).

It is possible that the large arginine side chain may block the CA domain from properly accessing the DHp domain for active site formation.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the asymmetrical positioning of the CA domains and the different conformations of each monomer of the DHp domain are captured in a unique crystal-packing environment. The two VicK dimers form an anti-parallel tetrameric packing where the active CA position is stabilized by direct interactions with HAMP and PAS domains from another dimer in the same asymmetric unit (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001493.s012">Figure S12</xref>). The N terminus of the HAMP domain makes contacts with the inactive CA domain of the VicK dimer from another asymmetric unit through the extended N terminus of monomer B (<italic>N</italic>b) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

        <title>Sequential Autokinase Activation Model</title>
        <p>Together, coordinated helical shifts of DHp and movement of the CA domains can be combined into a model to illustrate the activation steps for VicK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g007">Figure 7</xref>). When both CA domains are inactive, they stay relaxed and further away from the phosphoryl acceptor histidine (I). Upon stimulation, one helix bends ∼25° toward the DHp central axis in coordination with the global shifts of DHp to expose the phosphoryl acceptor histidine. Consequently, one CA domain <italic>in cis</italic> rotates ∼61° to reach this histidine for initial phosphorylation (II). It is likely that this activation does not happen simultaneously for both CA domains because the DHp domain allows only one helix to bend at a time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001493-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To fully activate both histidines (IV), VicK may go through an intermediate state that is similar to the inactive state (III) before the second CA domain rotates. Finally, the CA domains swing back to the initial state (IV to I) through several steps that remain to be determined.</p>
