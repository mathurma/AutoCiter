        <p>Many filamentous organisms, such as fungi, grow by tip-extension and by forming new branches behind the tips. A similar growth mode occurs in filamentous bacteria, including the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, although here our mechanistic understanding has been very limited. The <italic>Streptomyces</italic> protein DivIVA is a critical determinant of hyphal growth and localizes in foci at hyphal tips and sites of future branch development. However, how such foci form was previously unknown. Here, we show experimentally that DivIVA focus-formation involves a novel mechanism in which new DivIVA foci break off from existing tip-foci, bypassing the need for initial nucleation or <italic>de novo</italic> branch-site selection. We develop a mathematical model for DivIVA-dependent growth and branching, involving DivIVA focus-formation by tip-focus splitting, focus growth, and the initiation of new branches at a critical focus size. We quantitatively fit our model to the experimentally-measured tip-to-branch and branch-to-branch length distributions. The model predicts a particular bimodal tip-to-branch distribution results from tip-focus splitting, a prediction we confirm experimentally. Our work provides mechanistic understanding of a novel mode of hyphal growth regulation that may be widely employed.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Amongst the great variety of shapes that organisms assume, many grow in a filamentous manner and develop at least partly into a network of branches. Examples include plant roots, fungi and some bacteria. Whereas the mechanisms of filamentous growth are partially understood in fungi, the same cannot be said in filamentous bacteria, where our knowledge of hyphal growth regulation is very limited. To rectify this we have studied the bacteria <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, which are an excellent model for all hyphal bacteria. The protein DivIVA is known to play a critical role in controlling filamentous growth in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, forming large foci at branch tips and smaller foci that mark sites of future branch outgrowth. However, until now nothing was known about how these foci first appear. We have shown experimentally that new foci appear via a novel mechanism, whereby existing tip-foci split into two clusters. The larger cluster remains at the growing tip, while the smaller cluster fixes onto the adjacent lateral membrane, where it grows in size, eventually initiating a new branch. By mathematically modelling how DivIVA foci grow, we show how this one simple mechanism of focus formation can quantitatively capture the statistical properties of the entire hyphal branching network.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The ability to break symmetry and establish an axis of polarity is crucial for the function and development of almost all cell types. In bacteria, such symmetry-breaking is often mediated by cytoskeletal elements inside the cell that direct new cell wall synthesis. Many rod-shaped bacteria (including <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> and <italic>Caulobacter crescentus</italic>) grow solely through the isotropic insertion of new cell wall material throughout the length of the lateral walls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-DePedro1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Daniel1">[2]</xref>. Here, cell wall growth is directed by MreB, the bacterial ortholog of eukaryotic actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Margolin1">[3]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Garner1">[6]</xref>, whereas cell division is mediated by the bacterial tubulin ortholog, FtsZ. In these rod-shaped bacteria, polarity systems are required to identify and differentiate cell poles that remain inert during cell elongation. However, many other organisms enlarge by hyphal growth, a strategy that has proved successful for the exploitation of soil and other environments. Hyphal growth has evolved independently in both eukaryotic and prokaryotic microbes, including fungi and Gram-positive bacteria of the genus <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. This mode of growth depends on pronounced cellular polarity and the specific localization of cell envelope assembly to one cell pole in order to achieve tip extension. New sites of growth arise by hyphal branching, which requires the re-orientation of cellular polarity and the <italic>de novo</italic> establishment of new zones of cell wall synthesis from which lateral branches emerge. The result is a mycelial network in which the regulation of branching largely determines the morphology and behaviour of the mycelium as it spreads through the environment. However, the general principles that control such cellular branching have remained unknown. Here we report a novel mechanistic basis for branch-site selection in the mycelial actinomycete bacterium <italic>Streptomyces coelicolor</italic>. Since all hyphal bacteria are actinomycetes, this mechanism is likely to be widely relevant in this important phylum of bacteria, which account for the majority of commercial antibiotics.</p>
      <p>Tip extension and hyphal branching in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> are independent of both MreB and FtsZ, and depend instead on the coiled-coil cytoskeletal-like protein DivIVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh2">[8]</xref>. A functional DivIVA-EGFP fusion localizes to tips and marks new branch points well before visible lateral outgrowth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh3">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Hempel1">[10]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>divIVA</italic> is lethal, whereas overexpression leads to greatly increased numbers of DivIVA foci along the lateral wall and <italic>de novo</italic> cell wall outgrowth at these foci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh2">[8]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Hempel1">[10]</xref>. These data suggest that DivIVA can direct cell polarity and recruit the machinery for cell wall synthesis. Additional cytoskeletal components may also be involved (for example, Scy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Walshaw1">[11]</xref>), together forming a tip-organizing complex. However, regardless of whether there are additional components, we can use DivIVA-EGFP as a marker to monitor the dynamics of the tip-organizing complex as a whole.</p>
      <p>The branch-site selection mechanism that localises DivIVA to new sites along the lateral wall, from which branches subsequently emerge, was previously unknown. We therefore used the DivIVA-EGFP fusion to monitor the dynamics of the tip-organizing complex in <italic>S. coelicolor</italic> by live cell time-lapse imaging. These experiments revealed that the new DivIVA foci that initiate lateral branches arise predominantly by a novel tip focus-splitting mechanism that bypasses the necessity for initial nucleation or site-selection. In order to gain a deeper and more rigorous understanding of the regulation of hyphal branching, we then quantified hyphal branching patterns from still images, and developed a mathematical model of the DivIVA dynamics. As we will see, the model demonstrates that a remarkably simple tip-focus splitting mechanism is capable of quantitatively explaining all of our experimental branching pattern data, a result which is far from intuitive. Moreover, the model makes explicit predictions that we have experimentally verified. Intriguingly, a similar splitting mechanism has recently been reported in hyphal growth in fungi (<italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-AraujoPalomares1">[12]</xref>, raising the possibility that this simple mechanism may be widely applicable.</p>

        <title>Lateral DivIVA foci arise from splitting of apical foci</title>
        <p>Our previous studies have shown that DivIVA foci are always present at new branch points before outgrowth occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh3">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Hempel1">[10]</xref>. However, the origin of such DivIVA foci and the factors that determine their localisation have remained unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh2">[8]</xref>. To further understand the branching process, we have therefore studied more carefully how such foci are formed and traced their origin from time-lapse images. These experiments revealed that new small foci often arise from existing DivIVA foci at hyphal tips, by a process where a small cluster of DivIVA separates from the tip-focus and is left on the membrane just behind the tip. An example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g001">Figure 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s012">Video S1</xref> for a movie of this figure). At around 12‚Äì18 minutes the focus of DivIVA at the tip splits and leaves behind a small focus on the adjacent membrane. As the tip continues to extend, the new focus remains fixed in place on the membrane and grows in size and intensity. In between 42 and 48 minutes a new branch is formed at the position of the new focus. Tip-focus splitting is only seen to occur from foci associated with extending tips; foci which have not yet initiated a branch, such as the smaller focus between 12 and 36 minutes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g001">Figure 1</xref>, do not undergo splitting. We traced the origin of 52 nascent branches in time-lapse images and found that 42 of them (81%) were accounted for by tip-focus splitting events. Since only sufficiently large and intense DivIVA-EGFP foci are visible above the background fluorescence, some foci cannot be traced to their point of creation, and so this is likely to be an underestimate of the real proportion of branching arising from tip-focus splitting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Hempel1">[10]</xref>. Thus, tip-focus splitting, rather than other potential mechanisms, such as spontaneous nucleation, appears to be the predominant method for focus initiation in wild-type cells.</p>

            <p>The tip always contains a large DivIVA focus and established tips extend at an approximately constant speed.

After about 42 minutes a new branch is formed at the position of the new focus, with the new focus now sitting at the tip of the new branch.

        <title>Measurements of hyphal growth and lateral branching</title>
        <p>In order to quantitatively understand <italic>Streptomyces</italic> branch-site selection, we have measured two categories of distances from still images: the distance between the tip and the points where branches emerge, and the spacing between the branches themselves. Unlike the branch spacing, the tip-to-branch distance is not fixed: as the hyphae extend in length, the tip-to-branch distances increase. To avoid this difficulty we use our measurements to work out the tip-to-branch distance at the moment when the new branches appear, as discussed in <italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref></italic>.</p>
        <p>Unless care is taken when measuring the distributions from still images, it is easy to introduce biases that uncontrollably skew the data. For example, if only branching events relatively close to hyphal tips can be measured (as is inevitably the case for <italic>Streptomyces</italic> where individual hyphae cannot be traced into the dense mycelial clumps from which they emerge), then long branch-to-branch distances will never be recorded, even if they occur. As explained in <italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref></italic>, we control for this effect by introducing a protocol so that all measured hyphae have effectively the same length, a distance we call the trim length. This is achieved by discarding hyphae which are shorter than the trim length and trimming those which are longer. This protocol does not eliminate measurement bias, but rather controls the bias so that our experimental measurements are unambiguous and can be precisely compared with data generated by our mathematical model (see below).</p>
        <p>The measured tip-to-branch and branch-to-branch distributions with a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> trim are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g002">Figure 2</xref>. The tip-to-branch distribution has two distinct peaks, one between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and one at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This might suggest that two distinct mechanisms are involved in producing new branches. Surprisingly, however, our later analysis will show that a single mechanism can account for both peaks.</p>

        <title>Minimal mathematical model of the growth of DivIVA foci</title>
        <p>We assume that DivIVA foci, either on their own or as part of a tip-organizing complex, assemble the cell wall synthesis machinery to both extend hyphae and form new branches. Most new DivIVA foci do not immediately initiate a new branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We assume this is a result of the small starting sizes of most foci. Foci must instead grow in size by accumulating DivIVA molecules from the cytoplasm until they contain enough molecules to initiate a new branch. To understand where new branches emerge we must therefore understand how the number of molecules, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, in a focus changes with time. We will refer to this number <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the tip-focus size. We consider simple cooperative binding where the rate of DivIVA molecules joining a focus is linearly dependent on both the cytoplasmic DivIVA density, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the focus size, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (alternative growth rules are considered in Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref>, but these alternatives give qualitatively similar results, with no better fit to the experimental data). Thus we have <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a parameter independent of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Although, in the minimal model, we assume foci never lose DivIVA molecules, including this process again makes little or no difference (see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref>). We also assume that the cytoplasmic DivIVA density appearing in the above equation is the same for all foci (this assumption is justified by our full simulations, see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref>). Thus we can replace <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by the single parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which we call the binding parameter, and consider <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We assume that a focus starts with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> molecules and must reach <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> molecules before it can form a branch. We can easily solve the above equation for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to find the time taken, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for this growth from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>By comparing images like <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g001">Figure 1</xref> at 12 and 42 minutes, we estimate a typical value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, so that, to a rough approximation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The absolute value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is difficult to determine, but since the fluorescence of a typical DivIVA focus is not dissimilar to that of an FtsZ ring, and since an FtsZ ring contains on the order of 10,000 molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Lu1">[13]</xref>, we take <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be of a similar order of magnitude. The growth speed of an established tip, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is measured from time lapse images to be about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Due to the trimming issues discussed above, measuring a typical value for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not straightforward. In particular, using the average of a trimmed distribution, such as that in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, will not give a good estimate. However, as explained in <italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref></italic>, by studying the distributions over a range of trims, we estimate a value of about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> under the growth conditions used, which implies that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> should be about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p><italic>Streptomyces</italic> produces branches at a range of distances behind tips, producing a distribution of tip-to-branch distances. In our model, this is due to fluctuations in the parameters in Eq. (1). Note that, although we vary these parameters, we do not model the growth of foci themselves stochastically (instead using a deterministic differential equation) due to the large number (thousands) of molecules involved. Each binding event will itself be stochastic but the overall process involving many thousands of such binding events will be well described deterministically.</p>

        <title>The tip-focus splitting mechanism</title>
        <p>So far we have been concerned with how the number of molecules in a pre-existing focus changes with time. We have not yet discussed the mechanism by which new foci are formed, the tip-focus splitting mechanism. Furthermore, after a tip-focus has undergone splitting, we are interested in the length of time before the focus can split again, which, after both foci have initiated new branches, will translate into the distance between branches. It is important to emphasise that, whereas the growth of foci controls the tip-to-branch distribution, it is the focus-splitting rules that control the branch-to-branch distribution.</p>
        <p>The simplest assumption that could be made would be that the focus-splitting probability per unit time is constant, independent of when the tip-focus last split. This would describe a Poisson process and so imply an exponential distribution for the branch-to-branch distribution. However, as <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g001">Figure 1B</xref> shows, for distances smaller than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the branch-to-branch histogram is not described by a decaying exponential: these shorter distances are measured much less frequently than implied by a Poisson distribution.</p>
        <p>This suppression of short branch-to-branch distances shows that focus-splitting events are not independent of each other: a tip-focus that has just split is less likely to immediately split again. One potential explanation is that the probability of tip-focus splitting depends on the tip-focus size, such that smaller tip-foci are less likely to split. For this reason we implement a minimum tip-focus size (a critical mass), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, below which the tip-focus cannot split, with some constant focus-splitting probability per unit time, characterised by the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for all tip-foci above <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Splitting events cause the tip-focus to decrease in size and so, in some instances, such a splitting will cause the tip-focus size to drop below <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In that case, only after the tip-focus has absorbed more DivIVA from the cytoplasm will it have sufficient size to split again. This time delay effectively reduces the number of short branch-to-branch distances.</p>
        <p>Although it is difficult to analyse tip-focus splitting analytically, it is useful to note that, in the limit where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is very large (compared to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the branch-to-branch distance, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e047" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>a result which follows in a very similar way to Eq.

This is required since Gaussian distributions assign non-zero probabilities to all values, whereas biologically foci cannot contain fewer than zero molecules.

        <p>In our fitting, it was not immediately clear whether <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> should be larger or smaller than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that although we allow the possibility that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the model, this does not mean that foci can split before they have initiated branches; DivIVA foci have only been observed to split when they are associated with a growing tip. However, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> smaller than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would imply that newly formed branches cannot normally produce their own branches until the tip-focus has grown further to size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This in turn results in a gap between where a branch emerges from its parent hypha and the position of its first offshoot. We measured this distribution of distances and found no evidence for such a gap (see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which implies that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is equal to (or smaller than) <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g002">Figure 2</xref>, there is excellent agreement between the minimal model fits and the experimental data. For the trimmed tip-to-branch distributions, our model is sufficiently simple that this distribution can be calculated analytically (see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref>) without recourse to simulations. The analytic prediction is also shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and agrees extremely well with the simulation data, as expected. Note that the reason the tip-to-branch distribution drops to zero at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a consequence of the trimming protocol rather than any inherent property of <italic>Streptomyces</italic>. We chose a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> trim as a trade-off between distribution width and amount of data, but it is also possible to compare the model and the experimental data at other trims. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s008">Figures S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s009">S9</xref> show that there is also good agreement at trims of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>We have checked that the tip-to-branch and branch-to-branch distributions generated by the minimal model are robust to changes in all the parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002423-t001">Table 1</xref>. Further, we tested that adding fluctuations in the tip growth speed, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the on-rate parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, also do not qualitatively change these distributions (see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref>).

        <title>Verifying a model prediction in the tip-to-branch distribution</title>
        <p>One of the most striking features of the experimentally measured tip-to-branch distribution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, is the peak at small distances. Na√Øvely it may be thought that a novel tip-focus splitting mechanism is required to account for this peak. However, our model predicts that this peak can be simply explained without additional assumptions. Since most new foci must attract more DivIVA molecules before they can initiate a new branch, the distributions of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be such that most new foci start with fewer than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> molecules. However, there is a small tail to the distributions that causes a few foci to have <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e101" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> above <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e102" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, i.e. when they are formed these foci already have enough DivIVA molecules to initiate branch outgrowth. These foci will cause branching almost as soon as they are formed, very close to zero distance from the tip. We have directly observed such events and an example is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g003">Figure 3</xref> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s013">Video S2</xref> for a movie of this figure). Furthermore, we also measured the total intensity of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> newly-produced foci from time-lapse images: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from cases where the new branch appears next to the tip and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from normal tip-focus splitting events when the new branch appears much further back. In the first case the average intensity is almost three times greater than in the second case, supporting the hypothesis that events where the branch appears next to the tip correspond to the initial focus size, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, being much greater than average. The entire weight of the distribution with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will give effectively zero tip-to-branch distances, which then naturally explains the peak at the origin in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g002">Figure 2A</xref>. Consequently, our model predicts that if the distribution is analysed with bins of smaller width, then the peak at the origin will become even more dramatic. After reanalysing the measured data, this prediction is strikingly confirmed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002423-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Although the peak in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bin matches well, the agreement is not perfect in the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, we believe this feature is an unavoidable artifact of how the data is analysed: the tip growth speed cannot be measured directly from still images, rather only the distribution of speeds is known, which necessarily slightly smears the data (see <italic><xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref></italic> and Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Full model: curvature-dependent tip-focus splitting</title>
        <p>It has been shown that the DivIVA orthologue in <italic>B. subtilis</italic> preferentially assembles on negatively-curved membranes, and this appears to be an important factor in targeting of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> protein to cell poles and septation sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Ramamurthi1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Lenarcic1">[15]</xref>. Similarly, in <italic>Streptomyces</italic>, a preference for branches to emerge on the outer side of curved hyphae has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Hempel1">[10]</xref>, which suggests, for example, that for tips that bend to the left, foci are more likely to form on the right inner membrane. Although the mechanism by which this occurs is not yet fully understood, it is possible to ask how such an effect impacts our model. To do so we developed and simulated a more detailed computational model (see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref>), which implements hyphal growth in two-dimensional space. At each time step in the simulation, the direction of tip growth is randomly varied by a small amount, such that over sufficiently long distances (a few <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), memory of the previous growth direction is lost. We postulate that tip-foci with sizes above <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can split only when the local curvature near the tip is sufficiently high. Hence the earlier focus-splitting parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is understood as an effective parameter that can be replaced by growth direction variation and a curvature threshold. However, it is worth noting that if curvature is the origin of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, it must be quite a sensitive effect since during growth the mean curvature near the tip only changes by about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The full model (see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref> for full details and parameters) produces colony dynamics that match well with the wild-type phenotype (for example, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s014">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s015">S4</xref>). In particular, the tip-to-branch and branch-to-branch distributions are practically identical to the minimal model, thereby justifying our earlier simplifying assumptions.</p>

        <title>Under- and overexpression of <italic>divIVA</italic></title>
        <p>Since DivIVA is an essential protein, it cannot be completely removed. However, we can consider mild underexpression and various levels of overexpression. We first consider heavy overexpression. Previous work has examined hyphal morphology when <italic>divIVA</italic> was overexpressed in preformed hyphae to approximately twenty-five times its usual level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh3">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Hempel1">[10]</xref>. Such overexpression resulted in increased levels of cytoplasmic DivIVA, swollen hyphal tips and lateral hyperbranching. Interestingly, after inducing increased DivIVA production, many of the new branches developed well behind the tip positions at the moment of induction. This observation is unexpected since, in the minimal model, foci can only be produced from the splitting of tip-foci. It is possible that these new branches are due to foci that were already present at the time of induction but that were too small to be seen, and that overexpression subsequently caused them to develop into branches much more rapidly than normal. However, if this explanation were correct, wild-type <italic>Streptomyces</italic> would form many branches hundreds of microns behind the tips, a strategy which would be very inefficient in terms of nutrition acquisition. For this reason, we favour an alternative explanation, namely that these new branches arise from a separate mechanism of focus formation: spontaneous nucleation. In this process, due to the stochastic dynamics of molecules within the cytoplasm, occasionally a sufficient number of DivIVA molecules come together on the membrane and spontaneously form a cluster.</p>
        <p>As is standard for nucleation dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Howard1">[16]</xref>, and as we confirmed by stochastic simulations, for cytoplasmic DivIVA densities below some threshold, the probability of spontaneous nucleation (involving the near simultaneous binding of multiple DivIVA molecules to overcome a nucleation barrier) is close to zero. Above this threshold, however, we find that the rate of nucleation rises approximately linearly with increasing cytoplasmic density. We assume that for the parameters chosen in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002423-t001">Table 1</xref>, the DivIVA concentrations during wild-type growth fall well below this threshold and hence spontaneous nucleation does not occur. However, at 25-fold overexpression, this threshold is exceeded. In this latter case, we implemented spontaneous nucleation in our full model in the simplest possible way, by having a probability per unit length and time for spontaneously creating a new focus on the membrane, with a linear increase in nucleation probability with increasing cytoplasmic density above the threshold (see Supporting <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s011">Text S1</xref> for full details and parameters). We were then able to produce simulated colony dynamics which successfully matched the observed phenotype of 25-fold overexpression (for example, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s016">Video S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>In addition to heavy overexpression, we can also consider mild under- and overexpression. It was observed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh3">[9]</xref> that underexpression seems to reduce the average tip-to-branch distance. It is important to realise that a change in DivIVA expression will probably not only affect the binding parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the cytoplasmic DivIVA density and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> a constant), but also the tip growth speed <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This is because DivIVA is a critical component of the tip-organizing complex, which is present at all growing tips, and which is presumably important for tip extension. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are unlikely to depend strongly on DivIVA levels, Eq. (1) shows that it is actually the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which controls the average tip-to-branch distance. When DivIVA is underexpressed it is likely that both <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decrease. Since in this case the average tip-to-branch distance decreases, this result suggests that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> proportionally decreases by more than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the case of overexpression <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will increase. However, it is less likely that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will also increase. This is because the tip-organizing complex, which is responsible for tip extension, is likely to consist of many components, of which DivIVA is only one. Unless other components in addition to DivIVA are overexpressed, the effect on tip growth speed could be small, with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> remaining approximately constant. Thus we predict that mild overexpression of DivIVA will reduce <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and so decrease the average tip-to-branch distance. If this is the case, then both mild under- and overexpression of DivIVA will reduce the average tip-to-branch distance, with wild-type levels corresponding to the longest tip-to-branch distance.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Streptomycetes, like other bacteria, lack the motor proteins, vesicle transport systems, and polarisome components that are fundamental in eukaryotic cell biology. Thus, tip extension in <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is likely to be simpler than in, for example, filamentous fungi. Given that a complex of polarity proteins (including DivIVA) must presumably first gather at future branch sites, understanding branch-site selection in filamentous bacteria involves understanding where, when and how these proteins cluster together in sufficiently large groups. One surprising feature of wild-type <italic>Streptomyces</italic> is that this clustering of polarity proteins is not a random, spontaneous process. Rather, we have shown that new branch sites are predominantly created from the tips of previous branches, by a tip-focus splitting mechanism.</p>
      <p>One important question concerns the benefit of producing foci, and hence branches, by tip-focus splitting rather than spontaneous nucleation. One possibility is that this provides a more efficient method of acquiring nutrients. Spontaneous nucleation will produce new branches at positions well behind the tips. This outcome would be suboptimal since regions far behind the tips are likely to have already been well-exploited, with few remaining nutrients. Tip-focus splitting, on the other hand, only generates new foci at tips and so biases branching towards the growing ends of hyphae, where nutrients are still more plentiful. Another potential advantage is that tip-focus splitting allows for a greater level of control over exactly where branching occurs. Unlike spontaneous nucleation where branches can appear anywhere, tip-focus splitting produces branches with an average tip-to-branch distance determined by parameters such as the initial tip-focus size and the binding parameter. By modifying these parameters, it is possible to respond to external stimuli. For example, under conditions when branching further from the tip would be favourable, we speculate that this could be achieved by modifying DivIVA (or other proteins that affect its assembly) so that the binding parameter is decreased (this would correspond to a shift from the morphology shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s010">Figure S10B</xref> to that in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s010">Figure S10A</xref>).</p>
      <p>The morphology of branching organisms can be characterized by both the distance from the tip that new branches appear and the inter-branch distance. Counter-intuitively, our model shows that these distances are controlled by rather different processes. The tip-to-branch distance is governed by how long it takes new foci to gather enough molecules to initiate a new branch. This is related to the initial focus size, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the size at which a new branch is initiated, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the tip growth speed, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the binding parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In contrast, the branch-to-branch distance is governed by how often foci are formed (how long foci take to develop into branches is now irrelevant). This is dependent on a partly overlapping, but nevertheless distinct set of parameters: the minimum tip-focus size for splitting, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the initial focus size, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the tip growth speed, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the binding parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the tip-focus splitting parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
      <p>We have focused on the control of branching during vegetative growth. However, there is a parallel question about how the first germ tube emerges from a spore. By imaging germinating spores expressing functional <italic>divIVA-EGFP</italic>, it has been shown that, exactly as in vegetative growth, a focus of DivIVA is first observed on the spore envelope, which then grows in size before initiating the first branch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Flrdh3">[9]</xref>. It is interesting to inquire how this first focus is formed. It is clear that the tip-focus splitting mechanism cannot be responsible since there are no previous DivIVA foci from which the first focus could arise. It is possible that other proteins, such as SsgA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Noens1">[17]</xref>, aid DivIVA focus formation during spore germination. However, there is another possibility, that the spontaneous nucleation mechanism which plays a role when DivIVA is heavily overexpressed, is also responsible for the first DivIVA focus in a spore. If this is the case, then the DivIVA concentration within a spore would have to first rise high enough to overcome the nucleation barrier, an effect which may well be testable.</p>
      <p>In fungi, branching also occurs at the cellular level and involves establishment of new cell poles at which apical growth will occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Harris1">[18]</xref>. An apical cluster of vesicles and cytoskeletal elements named the Spitzenk√∂rper has a prominent role in fungal tip extension. During branching, a new Spitzenk√∂rper structure is established at the nascent branch tip, aided by proteins that direct cell polarity, cytoskeletal reorganisation, vesicle transport, and exo- and endocytosis (for reviews, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Harris1">[18]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-Riquelme1">[21]</xref>). One of the components that appears to be involved in branch site selection prior to assembly of the Spitzenk√∂rper structure is the protein complex termed the polarisome. Homologs of the budding yeast polarisome component Spa2p have been detected at hyphal tips in several fungi, and intriguingly, in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic>, small foci of SPA-2-GFP were observed to detach from the major SPA-2 assemblies at elongating hyphal tips and subsequently give rise to new lateral branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002423-AraujoPalomares1">[12]</xref>. This observation strongly suggests that, in addition to streptomycetes, tip-focus splitting mechanisms are also involved in the establishment of new hyphal branches in filamentous fungi.</p>
      <p>Streptomycetes appear to regulate hyphal growth and branching in a simple way. Indeed, we have found that a remarkably simple model can quantitatively explain the statistical properties of the entire hyphal network. Even the bimodal nature of the tip-to-branch distribution originates from a single mechanism of forming new foci, combined with variation in the parameter values. It is tempting to speculate that tip-focus splitting might be used by many filamentous organisms amongst fungi and Actinobacteria. In fact, focus splitting could turn out to be a general mechanism in situations where discrete foci must be generated in a growing organism.</p>

        <title>Measurement of tip-to-branch distances</title>
        <p>Still images do not normally capture the exact instant at which a new branch emerges. To find the tip-to-branch distance at the moment the branch emerged, we measure the length of the new branch, calculate how long it has been growing for, and determine where the tip was when the new branch emerged. The calculation incorporates an initial speed for new branch growth of about half that of established branches, increasing linearly in time until full speed is reached after about ninety minutes (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002423.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

        <title>Controlling for biases</title>
        <p>When measuring tip-to-branch and branch-to-branch distances from still images, it is important to control biases that artificially skew the data. For example, as an extreme case, if the measured hyphae segments were all less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in length, it would then be impossible to measure any branch-to-branch distance greater than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To control this problem we use the following protocol. Before any measurements are performed, all hyphae must be trimmed to some fixed length <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: any hyphae shorter than this are discarded and, for those which are longer, only the segment within a distance <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the tip is included in the data set. The effect of trimming is to ensure that all measured hyphae are effectively of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As a consequence, both the tip-to-branch and branch-to-branch distributions explicitly depend on the trimming length <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

        <title>Estimation of average tip-to-branch distance</title>
        <p>Estimating the average tip-to-branch distance from still images is complicated by the need to impose the trimming protocol on all measured data. The true average tip-to-branch distance is the average tip-to-branch distance at infinite trim. Distributions at progressively smaller trims have progressively smaller average tip-to-branch distances. The largest trim that we have a reasonable amount of data for is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with an average tip-to-branch distance of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is not obvious that this trim is sufficiently high to give a good estimate of the true average tip-to-branch distance. However, by fitting the full distributions at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002423.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> trims and extrapolating to infinite trim, this is seen to be a good approximation to the true average.</p>
