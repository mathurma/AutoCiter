These polypeptides usually fold up into non-globular, elongated architectures that are stabilized by the interactions within each repeat and those between adjacent repeats, but that lack contacts between residues distant in sequence. The inherent symmetries both in primary sequence and three-dimensional structure are reflected in a folding landscape that may be analyzed as a quasi–one-dimensional problem. We present a general description of repeat-protein energy landscapes based on a formal Ising-like treatment of the elementary interaction energetics in and between foldons, whose collective ensemble are treated as spin variables. The overall folding properties of a complete “domain” (the stability and cooperativity of the repeating array) can be derived from this microscopic description. The one-dimensional nature of the model implies there are simple relations for the experimental observables: folding free-energy (ΔG<sub>water</sub>) and the cooperativity of denaturation (<italic>m</italic>-value), which do not ordinarily apply for globular proteins. We show how the parameters for the “coarse-grained” description in terms of foldon spin variables can be extracted from more detailed folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes. To illustrate the ideas, we present a case-study of a family of tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat proteins and quantitatively relate the results to the experimentally observed folding transitions. Based on the dramatic effect that single point mutations exert on the experimentally observed folding behavior, we speculate that natural repeat proteins are “poised” at particular ratios of inter- and intra-element interaction energetics that allow them to readily undergo structural transitions in physiologically relevant conditions, which may be intrinsically related to their biological functions.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Repeat-proteins are coded in repetitions of similar amino acid stretches. Unlike typical globular domains, repeat-protein domains fold into elongated superhelical shapes of stacked elements, stabilized only by interactions within each repeat or between adjacent repeats. This architecture allows folding to be treated as a quasi–one-dimensional problem. We introduce an analytical model that describes the folding energy landscape of repeat-proteins, based on a representation in terms of spin variables. This representation groups together conformations on the basis of the degree of order in local quasi-independent folding units, often called foldons. We derive simple relations between the experimentally observed stability and cooperativity of denaturation of the whole repeat-domain, which differ from those found in three-dimensionally connected globular proteins. Folding simulations on perfectly funneled landscapes reproduce these relations. We document that these relations are experimentally observed in a variety of repeat-protein systems. We show the parameters in the foldon spin description can be predicted on the basis, largely, of protein topology, reflecting the funneled energy landscape.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded in parts by NSF grants PHY0216576 and PHY0225630 to the Center for Theoretical Biological Physics, and NIH grants P01GM071862, R01GM44557.

Instead of being formed by ‘apparently random’ amino acid sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Weiss1">[1]</xref>, repeat-proteins are made up of tandem arrays of similar stretches, usually between 20 and 40 amino acids in length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kloss1">[2]</xref>. In ‘physiological’ conditions, these polypeptides fold up into elongated architectures of repeating structural motifs that stack one upon the next producing extended superhelical structures (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kloss1">[2]</xref> and references therein). Quasi-one dimensional, these non-globular folds are stabilized only by interactions within each repeat or between adjacent repeats. In general there are no obvious contacts between residues distant in sequence. This seemingly simple architecture contrasts with typical globular domains in which the polypeptide chain ‘wraps around’ to form multiple sequence-distant interactions. For globular proteins these sequence-distant interactions often play critical roles in folding kinetics, and dictate the overall topology of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ivankov1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Chavez1">[4]</xref>. Repeat proteins, by virtue of their inherent symmetries both in primary sequence and three dimensional structure, should have an underlying folding landscape reflecting these symmetries. The near periodicity of repeat proteins allows a general description of their energy landscape which can help us appreciate their biological function.</p><p>One natural way to model repeat-protein folding is to coarse-grain the description of the protein architecture to be that of a linear array of elementary ‘units’ that interact locally with each other. Though each unit in such an array is complex, their simplification yields a description of the low free energy ensembles as corresponding to those of a classical one-dimensional Ising magnet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Feynman1">[5]</xref>. In Ising models, each site is taken to be in one of two states (i.e.: spin up/spin down; helix/coil, folded/unfolded). Interaction energies are defined only locally between nearest neighbors. Owing to its one dimensional connectivity, the thermodynamic properties of the system can be computed exactly. More than half a century ago, Zimm and Bragg used this Ising description to describe the formation of α-helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Zimm1">[6]</xref>. In their model each residue was considered to be able to be ordered in a helical state of low energy, or be in a coil state of high energy, reflecting an ensemble of possible chain orientations. Recently similar models have been used to describe repeat-protein folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kajander1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Wetzel1">[9]</xref>. In this case each repeating segment is taken to be ordered in a low energy state or to populate a disordered many dimensional ensemble of high entropy. Clearly this description lumps together many different substates in which a repeating unit is only partially ordered. In simpler but somewhat less precise terms, one might say that we approximate each element as folding as a highly cooperative unit. The hope is that in some sense other high free energy states are sufficiently rare as to be unnoticed in the thermal ensemble. In what sense is this description adequate for the low free energy ensemble? Also, can we discover the appropriate units to think of as quasi-independent? Finding such units clearly is related to the question of the existence of foldons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Panchenko1">[10]</xref>, autonomously folding units which can serve as ‘building blocks’ of protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Panchenko2">[11]</xref>.</p><p>The most extensive investigations on the folding of repeat-proteins have focused on the ankyrin (ANK) and the tetratricopeptide (TPR) repeat protein families. Most of the natural members of these families are composed of 4 to 10 repeats, but sequences coding up to ∼50 repeats have been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bjorklund1">[12]</xref>. The shorter members with 2 to 7 repeats have been very carefully characterized in terms of their experimental folding behavior. Folding repeat-proteins of these lengths appears to follow a two-state transition, in which only the fully denatured ensemble and a nearly unique folded state are significantly populated at equilibrium (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Barrick1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Main1">[14]</xref> and references therein). The experiments along with simulations based on perfectly funneled landscapes suggest that this cooperative behavior can be understood if the domains fold up by a mechanism that is reminiscent of nucleation-propagation growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Mello1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro1">[15]</xref>. Once an initial nucleation takes place, the individual structural modules of the repeat-protein serially fold up in a highly cooperative fashion that results in the folding of the complete ‘domain’. Apparently, as in the helix-coil transition, the intrinsic stability of the folding elements is low compared to the free energy of stabilization from forming an ‘interface’ between neighbors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Mello1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro1">[15]</xref>. In the helix-coil transition, the Pauling scheme requires four hydrogen bonds to form an α-helix turn, resulting in a large nucleation free energy that comes from the necessity to properly configuring several successive dihedral angles in a subunit, losing their entropy before hydrogen bond stabilization is gained. In the case of repeat-proteins, because of the delicate balance in each subunit, subtle variations in the interactions in and between the repeats give the impression of major changes in the folding landscape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Street1">[17]</xref>. Such variations may then ‘decouple’ the folding of the elements. This balance implies that for sufficiently long repeating arrays partially folded species become populated. These species may be characterized at equilibrium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro3">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Tripp1">[20]</xref>. In a sense they provide snapshots of ensembles closely resembling the fleetingly formed transition state ensemble for globular proteins, providing information about the fine structure of the energy landscape, about its symmetry and deviations from it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Street1">[17]</xref>.</p><p>The energy landscape theory of protein folding is based on the ‘principle of minimal frustration’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bryngelson1">[21]</xref>. This principle states that the energy of the protein decreases more than what may be expected by chance as the protein assumes conformations progressively more like the ground (native) state. In other words, there is a strong energetic bias towards the native basin that overcomes both the asperities of the landscape and ultimately the entropy of the chain. The resulting overall landscape picture is that of a rough funnel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bryngelson2">[22]</xref>. When energetic frustration is low enough, the native energy and folding entropy primarily compete. Since these mainly depend on protein topology, topology becomes a key factor governing folding reactions. It has been shown that the structures of transition state ensembles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Clementi1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Koga1">[24]</xref>, the existence of folding intermediates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Clementi2">[25]</xref>, dimerization mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Levy1">[26]</xref>, and domain swapping events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Yang1">[27]</xref> are often well predicted in models where energetic frustration has been removed and topological information of the native state is the sole input. Still, inhomogeneity in the native contacts energetics, non-native interactions and the residual local frustration present in the native ensemble do contribute to the functional characteristics of proteins, ‘molding’ the roughness that underlies the detailed protein dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro4">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Frauenfelder1">[29]</xref>.</p><p>The internal symmetries of repeat-proteins suggest that the overall folding properties of a complete ‘domain’ (the stability and cooperativity of the array) may be derived from a microscopic description of the energy balance within each folding element and its interactions with its neighbors. Furthermore, the minimal frustration principle suggests that “on average” these interactions can be inferred from knowledge of the protein topology. However, the paucity of contacts in interfaces can give significant fluctuations.</p><p>Here, we study how an ‘Ising-like’ description in terms of foldon spin variables for the repeat-containing proteins can be obtained from a more fundamental model based on perfectly funneled energy landscapes. The parameters of the description follow to a first approximation from the protein topology. By explicitly transforming from this more detailed model, we show how an Ising foldon-spin description for the low free energy states emerges and ultimately leads to the ability to predict the global folding properties of repeat-proteins. For illustration we show how the parameters in the Ising description of the energy landscape of a family of TPR proteins can be extracted from the elementary interactions between residues. We find that the parameters in the Ising model, like kinetic barriers for folding globular proteins, are most strongly a property predictable from native state topology, although again subtle but important changes can be made by tuning the sequence. We must emphasize that the general structure of the energy landscapes of proteins are robust, but the details of the kinetic routes taken through it depend on smaller energy scales, associated with inhomogeneities. Small perturbations may therefore re-route the transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Oliveberg1">[30]</xref>. The one-dimensional physics where a single defect can interrupt the development of other stabilizing interactions, makes the macroscopic ensembles more sensitive to local details than one usually finds for the folding of the three dimensionally connected globular proteins, where sequence tuning may be less important for geometrically correct overall folding, but may be critical for function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro4">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Frauenfelder1">[29]</xref>.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Analytical Repeat-Protein Folding Model</title><sec id="s2a1"><title>Definitions</title><p>Repeat proteins may be thought of as a linear array of structural elements. The low free energy ensembles of these arrays may be represented as the states of a collection of elementary folding units. Each unit can assume two macro-states: folded (F) or unfolded (U). Both macrostates represent ensembles of atomic level structures. Interaction between nearest neighbors are most important and depend on whether each unit can be considered to be folded or not. The two states can be thought of as foldon spin variables. Hence the free energy of the bulk of the thermally occupied states can be described with a coarse-grained one-dimensional Ising model having a Hamiltonian:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p><p>An unfolded subunit contributes a low free energy because of the entropy of its available configurations, <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic>.

Since the systems we want to treat are linear and finite, the end elements (or ‘caps’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kohl1">[31]</xref>) must be explicitly treated as having only one neighbor. The influence of a chemical denaturant can be modeled as binding with the unfolded elements. This influence can be described as an increase in the entropy of the system, by allowing the protein to access a greater configurational space, <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> = <italic>s</italic><sub>0,<italic>j</italic></sub>+α<italic><sub>j</sub>x<sub>j</sub></italic>, where <italic>x<sub>j</sub></italic> is the denaturant concentration [i.e. urea, guanidine], <italic>s</italic><sub>0,<italic>j</italic></sub> the accessible entropy without denaturant. α<italic><sub>j</sub></italic> is a denaturation parameter that describes the susceptibility of a given element to interact with the denaturant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kajander1">[7]</xref>.

Often one quotes the overall change in free energy between the macroscopic thermodynamic states in the absence of chemical denaturant (ΔG<sub>water</sub>) or the folding temperature (T<sub>f</sub>), along with a cooperativity parameter that describes how rapidly the free energy changes with denaturant (<italic>m</italic>). In case of a chemical denaturation, commonly one speaks of the cooperativity ‘<italic>m</italic>-value’ usually obtained assuming a linear extrapolation of the form <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Schellman1">[32]</xref>.

Intuitively it is easy to see that when units further apart are more correlated in their macrostate occupation, the protein thermodynamically responds more strongly to changes in concentration of denaturant or temperature, i.e.: folding is more cooperative. The precise correlation function for temperature or chemical denaturation are different. A three-point correlation function enters for the susceptibility in temperature denaturation. Thus, the cooperativity of the transition will appear to be a more global phenomenon for temperature denaturations (see below).</p><p>When end-effects are neglected, i.e. for a translational invariant system (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>s<sub>j</sub></italic> = <italic>s</italic>) having therefore many repeats, these expressions become:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>n<sub>F</sub></italic> is the number of folded elements and <italic>n<sub>i</sub></italic> is the number of folded elements that have folded elements as neighbors.</p></sec><sec id="s2a3"><title>Folding mechanism</title><p>We first recall some analytical results for the case in which all repeating elements are identical and the protein consists of a large number of repeats.

We analyze these effects by numerical calculations of a N = 14 protein for which only the parameters for one element are perturbed, mimicking a site-directed mutation. If the energetic stabilization of the mutant element is smaller than that of the others, then both the cooperativity and the stability increase when the parameter of a given element increases (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). Small changes in either intra-element or inter-element energetics result in big overall effects. However, these changes reach a threshold when the local parameter becomes larger than those that describe the typical energy scales. In this case the protein does not behave as a single folding unit and ‘splits’ into folding domains, thus the overall cooperativity decreases (insets to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). This can be interpreted as a global effect ‘felt’ by the whole protein, a situation that is more drastic when the number of repeating units is of the order of the correlation length of the system. In order to pin down the parameter regime for natural repeat-proteins, we now compare these general results for the one-dimensional Ising behavior to results obtained from molecular dynamics folding studies on perfectly funneled landscapes and to the experimentally determined folding mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Analyzing the Folding by Discrete Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><p>We study a perfectly funneled folding model.

These quantitative measures of frustration show that CTPR is unusually unfrustrated, justifying the use of perfectly funneled models to capture folding. Also, experiments have been already successfully interpreted with a simplified Ising-like description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kajander1">[7]</xref>, which is also unfrustrated.

We noted that as the number of repeats increases, higher temperatures are needed to reach the unfolded state, that is, the proteins are more stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The shorter proteins display a single peak in the heat capacity as a function of temperature. This peak becomes broader and moves to higher temperature as the protein grows larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). For proteins longer than six repeats a second peak can be distinguished. The shorter proteins conform more closely to a phenomenological two-state like behavior in which at any time mainly the fully folded or fully unfolded configurations are present. The decrease in cooperativity with increasing length is expected from the analytical model presented above only if the energetic parameters for the repeats are not homogeneous. To test this, we deleted the terminal repeats and strictly conserved the central ones, thus having a set of fully homogeneous proteins of increasing length. Following the same simulation and analysis protocol as before, we note that as the number of repeats increase, higher temperatures are needed to reach the unfolded state, but in this case the peak of heat capacity as a function of temperature becomes sharper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

In order to quantify these results and measure the correlation length of the simulated CTPR proteins, we computed the cross correlation of the folding of each repeat with every other, for each of the proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000070.s002">Text S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g005">Figure 5B</xref> shows the cross correlation matrix for the longer 8-repeat protein, where two main correlation ‘domains’ are distinguished, centered towards the topological ends. The correlation length was extracted by fitting the cross correlations evaluated for all the proteins with the expected exponential decay in distance separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The absolute value of the correlation length is 2.9±0.3, roughly 3 repeats. Thus, it seems likely that as the number of repeats increases above the correlation length, the protein can ‘split’ into separate folding domains with a relatively low energy cost. The simulations show that the new peak in the heat capacity plot indeed does appear when the protein sequence is more than two times the correlation length, and that it corresponds to the folding of the new ‘domain’ formed by the additional repeats. Moreover, the overall cooperativity <italic>m</italic>-value calculated from the cross-correlations corresponds to the one fitted from the two-state approximation described above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g005">Figure 5C insert</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Extracting the Folding Parameters from the Molecular Dynamics Simulations</title><p>The residue level folding simulations qualitatively agree with the results from the analytical treatment of the one-dimensional reduced model that represents repeating elements as two-state objects. For quantitative analysis we developed a method for extracting the internal energetic parameters of each folding unit and its interactions. To do this we compute from the molecular dynamics trajectories the probability of occurrence of each possible folding macro-state as a function of temperature. The parameters of the reduced model are then fitted to reproduce these distributions for the residue-level simulations, by minimizing the Kullback-Leibler divergence between the model probabilities (<italic>p<sub>m</sub></italic>) and those extracted from the simulation data (<italic>p<sub>s</sub></italic>), <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To define the totality of possible folding states and count them, one must first define boundaries between the folding elements. It is important to bear in mind that given the repeating patterns of repeat-proteins, this choice of division into subunits is not <italic>a priori</italic> unique. One natural choice is to define the folding element as the smallest strictly repeating unit in sequence, which corresponds to a whole TPR repeat. We analyzed the ensemble of trajectories using this definition, assigning a folding macro-state to each snapshot (from 000 to 111 in case of CTPR3), but found that the non-linear fitting was inconsistent and highly sensitive to the choice of initial parameters. This suggests that there are multiple minima to the error function. Similar inconsistencies were also observed for the longer proteins, suggesting that this initial choice of a quasi-independent ‘folding element’ was incorrect in the sense that the analytical model cannot describe the statistics of the low free energy ensembles of the topology-based model. Looking more carefully at the sampled structures it became apparent that each repeat can better be further decomposed into smaller folding units, namely two (or three in the case of C-terminal repeats) α-helices along with the interfaces between them. Since the present pure topology based model is biased to form α-helices because of the dihedral constraints and the low contact-order, we chose to assign the foldedness of each element based on the non-helical contacts formed. We use a cutoff value close to the separatrix of this projection to assign the microscopic state of each element (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000070.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Kajander et. al. also employed a similar decomposition of the TPR-protein individual α-helices in a homogeneous Ising-like description of these proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kajander1">[7]</xref>. Using this choice of fundamental element, a CTPR3 protein can occupy any of 32 states (00000 to 11111), and the populations of these can be well described with the one-dimensional model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

The fully unfolded state is at the top of the funnel, a state that has the highest entropy and the lowest energy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). At the bottom, the fully folded state has the opposite contributions. In between there exist several discrete possibilities corresponding to the folding of different numbers of elements. Each of these ‘steps’ has a characteristic energy/added entropy balance, reflecting the fact that the protein is finite and inhomogeneous. The added entropy is a result of the underlying degrees of freedom, which we describe within the coarse grained model. The population of each of the states depends on this precise balance at any given temperature. At low temperatures, the fully folded states and states with 4 elements folded (or 1 ‘crack’ introduced) are mostly populated, while at high temperatures the fully unfolded and the states with one-element folded are populated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Right at the folding temperature several intermediate species become populated, and this distribution need not be homogeneous (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Each of these intermediate states will contribute to the overall cooperativity and stability of the repeat-protein domain, and the spontaneous population of them might be functionally relevant, as discussed below.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000070-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Folding energy landscape of repeat-proteins.</title><p>(A) A 5-element repeat-protein folding landscape is shown.

The model predicts that single site mutations will affect both of these global folding descriptors simultaneously. In order to test this prediction, we collected data from the literature for several independent folding experiments performed on distinct repeating proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Mello1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Venkataramani1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bradley1">[40]</xref>.

The slope of the <italic>m vs.</italic> Δ<italic>G</italic> plot is constant for each set of mutants, and we attribute the offset between them to the fact that the proteins themselves and the experimental conditions under which they were measured are not identical, and are expected to change the definition of ‘native’ stability. This indicates that the (de)stabilizing effect of a single mutation can be explained only in terms of the alteration it causes to the interactions of the repeat with its immediate neighbors, modifying the cooperative behavior of the whole system, as predicted from the analytical model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-1000070-g009" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000070.g009</object-id><label>Figure 9</label><caption><title>Experimental observations of the effect of single point mutants on the overall folding behavior.</title><p>(A) Folding parameters determined by urea denaturation of various mutants of ankyrin repeat proteins, upon fitting to two-state models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Mello1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Venkataramani1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bradley1">[40]</xref>.

The change in slope of the plot is directly related to the change in the denaturation midpoint (<italic>x<sub>c</sub></italic> in the model), that is expected to change with denaturant. We further note that the width in the distribution of the data points is different for each denaturant. This observation is well modeled by a change in the repeat interaction parameter (ε<italic><sup>S</sup></italic>), suggesting that the solution conditions modify the interfaces between the repeating elements as well as the folding of the elements themselves. In principle, the detailed thermodynamic contribution of each ‘unit’ can be extracted from experiments by analyzing the effect that analogous mutations along the repeating domain cause on the global folding parameters.

In order to decompose the contributions from these energy scales, the effects on the cross-correlation of the folding elements of several independent mutations should be evaluated. Unfortunately, in the laboratory, temperature unfolding of these proteins is often irreversible owing to aggregation, limiting the strict quantification of the thermodynamic profiles at this stage.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Concluding Remarks</title><p>Repeat proteins constitute excellent biological systems for which simple physical folding models can be directly evaluated. In contrast to globular domains they lack interactions distant in sequence and have fairly regular architectures. This features greatly simplifies the coarse-graining of the interactions internal to and between the folding elements. The Ising model was originally conceived as a description of magnetism in crystalline materials, and has been applied to model phenomena as diverse as the freezing and evaporation of liquids, the behavior of glassy substances, flocking birds, neural networks, and the folding of protein secondary structures. Recently this type of model has been also applied to describe the experimental folding of repeat proteins (for a recent review see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Kloss1">[2]</xref>). Here, we have shown how some puzzling features of the folding of repeat proteins when analyzed viewing them as single cooperative units like globular proteins in fact follow from their one dimensionality. The finite correlations intrinsic to one dimensionality yield a direct relationship between stability and cooperativity of the folding transitions. We have shown how this relationship arises, and how this relation changes in different parameter regimes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g003">3</xref>). Depending on the balance between the folding energy of each unit and the interactions with neighbors, very different behavior can be obtained when the whole repeating array is evaluated. In which parameter space do natural repeat-containing proteins exist? It is experimentally observed that single-site mutations affect both stability and cooperativity simultaneously in the same direction, and we show this is most likely a consequence of changing the interaction energy between repeats. Moreover, from the large absolute values that the single-site mutations exert on both stability and cooperativity, we speculate that the natural wild-type proteins may well be ‘poised’ at particular ratios of inter/intra element energetics that allows small local perturbations to yield large effects. The linear relationship between these global parameters is expected to break down at extreme ratios (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g002"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g003">3</xref>), either when the correlation length spans the whole repeating array or the interactions between some elements is low enough to ‘decouple’ them. In line with this prediction, a detailed series of experiments was recently presented by Street et al showing that the <italic>m</italic>-value change upon destabilization saturates when sufficiently large destabilizations are probed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Street1">[17]</xref>. A local effect is felt globally because the near interactions play extraordinarily large roles in stabilizing the repeats, and weak biases can tip the balance to complete folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-LutheySchulten1">[41]</xref>. It has been observed that single substitutions that affect local biases (such as helix propensity), exert profound effects on the overall folding of these domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro3">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bradley1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bradley2">[42]</xref>.</p><p>Modeling folding cooperativity is functionally relevant and was previously addressed in lattice and off-lattice models of globular proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Klimov1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Munoz1">[44]</xref>. In the model presented here, the folding cooperativity can be directly related to the correlation length of the repeating array, and this in turn is a function of the local interaction parameters. Taking the native TPR topology as an example, we have shown that the <italic>m</italic>-value derived from the 2-state approximation corresponds to the cooperative parameter derived from the one-dimensional description (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000070-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Within the 2-state approximation it is the relative population of spectroscopically indistinguishable folding intermediates that affects the <italic>m</italic>-value determination. We found a correlation length of 3 repeats. It is probably not a coincidence that this seems to be also the smallest functional unit for TPRs, found via bioinformatic analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-DAndrea1">[45]</xref>. This correlation length has also been directly measured by NMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Cheng1">[46]</xref>. As the protein grows larger, the repeating array is more likely to tolerate ‘cracks’ and the folding at either end may become anticorrelated. If the protein is sufficiently large the energy of the fully folded state needs to be so favorable (or the temperature so low), that partially cracked species will become dominant under physiologically relevant conditions. There are at least three examples for which partially folded species have been experimentally characterized in repeat-proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Ferreiro3">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Werbeck1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000070-Bradley2">[42]</xref>. The largest repeat protein characterized to date is D34 a 12-ankyrin repeat fragment of the AnkyrinR protein.
