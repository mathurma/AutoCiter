</abstract><abstract>
<p>Wnt signaling maintains the undifferentiated state of intestinal crypt progenitor cells by inducing the formation of nuclear TCF4/β-catenin complexes. In colorectal cancer, activating mutations in Wnt pathway components cause inappropriate activation of TCF4/β-catenin-driven transcription. Despite the passage of a decade after the discovery of TCF4 and β-catenin as the molecular effectors of the Wnt signal, few transcriptional activators essential and unique to the regulation of this transcription program have been found. Using proteomics, we identified the leukemia-associated Mllt10/Af10 and the methyltransferase Dot1l as Tcf4/β-catenin interactors in mouse small intestinal crypts. Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l, essential for transcription elongation, are recruited to Wnt target genes in a β-catenin-dependent manner, resulting in H3K79 methylation over their coding regions in vivo in proliferative crypts of mouse small intestine in colorectal cancer and Wnt-inducible HEK293T cells. Depletion of MLLT10/AF10 in colorectal cancer and Wnt-inducible HEK293T cells followed by expression array analysis identifies MLLT10/AF10 and DOT1L as essential activators to a large extent dedicated to Wnt target gene regulation. In contrast, previously published β-catenin coactivators p300 and BRG1 displayed a more pleiotropic target gene expression profile controlling Wnt and other pathways. <italic>tcf4, mllt10/af10</italic>, and <italic>dot1l</italic> are co-expressed in Wnt-driven tissues in zebrafish and essential for Wnt-reporter activity. Intestinal differentiation defects in <italic>apc</italic>-mutant zebrafish can be rescued by depletion of Mllt10 and Dot1l, establishing these genes as activators downstream of Apc in Wnt target gene activation in vivo. Morpholino-depletion of <italic>mllt10/af10-dot1l</italic> in zebrafish results in defects in intestinal homeostasis and a significant reduction in the in vivo expression of direct Wnt target genes and in the number of proliferative intestinal epithelial cells. We conclude that Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l are essential, largely dedicated activators of Wnt-dependent transcription, critical for maintenance of intestinal proliferation and homeostasis. The methyltransferase DOT1L may present an attractive candidate for drug targeting in colorectal cancer.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The canonical Wnt pathway is a key regulatory pathway controlling intestinal cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance, and its deregulation leads to malignancies in the mammalian gut. A decade has passed since the discovery of the transcription factors TCF4-β-catenin as the downstream intestinal molecular effectors of Wnt, but few transcriptional activators essential and unique to the regulation of this transcription program have been found. In this study, using a proteomics approach, we identify the leukemia-associated Mllt10/Af10 and its partner the histone methyltransferase Dot1l as interactors with Tcf4/β-catenin in the mouse small intestinal epithelium. We demonstrate that Mllt10/Af10–Dot1l are recruited to Wnt target genes in intestinal epithelial cells and are essential to regulate expression of these targets. We also show a genetic link between the Wnt pathway and Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l in zebrafish and delineate their essential role in Wnt-driven endogenous gene expression. Finally, we demonstrate the physiological role of Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l in Wnt-driven intestinal development and homeostasis; depletion of Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l in zebrafish embryos mimics the Tcf4-depleted phenotype in which significant intestinal proliferation defects accompany a decrease in total number of intestinal cells. We conclude that the enzyme Dot1l may present an attractive candidate for drug targeting in colorectal cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The canonical Wnt signaling pathway has been shown to play a central role in cell proliferation, differentiation, and stem cell maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Clevers1">[1]</xref>. Wnt signaling controls developmental fates through the regulation of transcription of TCF/LEF target genes. β-catenin functions as a dedicated transcriptional coactivator of TCF/LEF transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Behrens1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Huber1">[4]</xref>. TCF4 constitutes the main molecular effector of this process in the intestinal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-vandeWetering1">[5]</xref>. In the absence of a Wnt signal, the cytosolic levels of β-catenin are kept low by a protein complex (the destruction complex) including AXIN, APC, and GSK3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Rubinfeld1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Behrens2">[8]</xref>, which induces phosphorylation of β-catenin resulting in its ubiquitination and degradation by the proteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Orford1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Salomon1">[10]</xref>. In the absence of β-catenin, TCF4 is thought to function as a repressor of Wnt target gene expression, in part via interaction with a number of repressive cofactors such as TLE/Groucho <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Roose1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Cavallo1">[12]</xref>. Upon Wnt signaling, the activity of the destruction complex is inhibited and β-catenin is no longer phosphorylated and translocates to the nucleus, where it interacts with TCF4 to turn on the Wnt genetic program in crypt stem/progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-vandeWetering1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-VanderFlier1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>In colorectal cancer, activating mutations in Wnt pathway components, such as APC, AXIN1, or β-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Morin1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Korinek1">[16]</xref>, lead to the stabilization and constitutive nuclear localization of β-catenin. The constitutive presence of TCF4/β-catenin complexes locks the Wnt transcriptional program, normally active only in crypt stem cells and progenitors, in the “on” state, resulting in malignancies in the gut.</p>
<p>The β-catenin/TCF4 complex is thought to drive TCF4 target gene expression by recruitment of activating cofactors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mosimann1">[17]</xref>. Genetic approaches in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have led to the identification of Pygopus and Lgs/BCL9 as cofactors of β-catenin/TCF mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Kramps1">[18]</xref>. The c-terminus of β-catenin has been shown to bind several transcriptional coactivators, including Hyrax/Parafibromin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mosimann2">[19]</xref>. In addition, components of the two broad classes of chromatin modulating complexes, ATP dependent chromatin remodelers and enzymes that mediate covalent modifications on histones, have been implicated in β-catenin mediated transcriptional regulation. We have previously found that the chromatin remodeling factor BRG-1 can interact with β-catenin to promote activation of certain TCF target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Barker1">[20]</xref>. Another chromatin remodeling enzyme, ISWI, and the mixed lineage leukemia H3K4 histone methyltransferase, MLL, were found to co-precipitate with the β-catenin c-terminus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Sierra1">[21]</xref>. TBP and the acetyl transferases CBP and p300 have also been implicated in linking β-catenin to the transcription machinery, allowing access of transcription activators to target gene promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Hecht1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Roura1">[24]</xref>. Recently, we and others have identified the kinase TNIK as a TCF4/β-catenin interactor essential to and specific for Wnt-dependent target gene activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mahmoudi1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Shitashige1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite the passage of a decade after the discovery of TCF4 and β-catenin as the molecular effectors of the Wnt signal, few transcriptional activators essential and unique to the regulation of this transcription program have been found. The identification and study of the complete repertoire of nuclear TCF4/β-catenin coactivator complex components dedicated to this transcriptional program is both required to unveil the key targets and mechanistic events responsible for initiation and progression of cancer and also critical to the definition of potential therapeutic targets in colorectal cancer.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We applied a Mass Spectrometry approach to identify novel components of the endogenous Tcf4 complex in the mouse small intestinal epithelium. Working under the premise that intestinal crypt cells contain activating Tcf4/β-catenin complexes and that villus cells contain repressive Tcf4 complexes, we obtained separated mouse intestinal crypt and villus cells, using a mechanical fractionation method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mahmoudi1">[25]</xref>. This method combines incubations of small intestine sections in chelating solutions with vigorous shaking, followed by separation of crypt and villus fractions according to size by sieving through a mesh. We confirmed the purity of the fractions by the exclusive presence of the Wnt target gene cMyc in the crypt fraction and the villus-specific marker Keratin20 in the villus compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mahmoudi1">[25]</xref>. To identify potential Tcf4 coactivators, we immunopurified Tcf4 from purified crypt fractions and used isotype-matched IgGs as the control. The purified Tcf4 complex was subjected to SDS-PAGE and Coomassie staining, followed by Mass Spectrometry analysis of the Tcf4-associated proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s009">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mahmoudi1">[25]</xref>. We identified Tcf4 and, as a positive control, β-catenin as a Tcf4 interacting protein specifically in the Tcf4 immunoprecipitations, demonstrating the validity of this approach in identifying Wnt-activated Tcf4 complexes from small intestinal crypts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mahmoudi1">[25]</xref>. We thus identified the leukemia-associated Mllt10 (Af10) as an interactor of the Tcf4 complex in the crypt proliferative compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). MLLT10/AF10 was initially identified as one of the MLL translocation partners in leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Chaplin1">[27]</xref>. It has also been found fused to clathrin-assembly protein-like lymphoid-myeloid (CALM) in acute myeloid leukemia (AML) and T-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (T-ALL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Dreyling1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Carlson1">[29]</xref>. MLLT10/AF10 interacts with the H3K79 histone methyltransferase DOT1L <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Okada1">[30]</xref>. Histone modifications play an important role in the modulation of chromatin structure and gene expression. Methylation of lysine 79 of histone H3 (H3K79) is a widespread activating histone modification, which is deposited by DOT1L, the only known H3K79 methyltransferase gene in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Jones1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Steger1">[32]</xref>. The interaction between MLLT10/AF10 and DOT1L was proposed to underlie the main molecular mechanism of leukemogenesis by the MLL-MLLT10/AF10 and CALM-MLLT10/AF10 fusions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Okada1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Okada2">[33]</xref>; mis-targeting of DOT1L and the resulting activating H3K79 methylation causes aberrant activation of target genes, such as Hoxa5, leading to leukemia.</p>

<title>Mllt10/Af10 Co-Immunoprecipitates with Tcf4 in Mouse Small Intestinal Crypts</title>
<p>To confirm that Mllt10/Af10 interacts with Tcf4, we immunoprecipitated Tcf4 complexes from crypt lysates and probed for the association with endogenous Mllt10/Af10 by Western blotting using an antibody specific for Mllt10/Af10. The Tcf4 complex contained Mllt10/Af10 in the crypts of the small intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1A left panel</xref>). Immunoprecipitation of β-catenin complexes from crypts followed by Western blot analysis confirmed the association with Mllt10/Af10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1A right panel</xref>). The same interactions were also detected and confirmed in reverse Western blot analysis of the Mllt10/Af10-associated proteins immunoprecipitated from crypts using antisera directed against Mllt10/Af10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These results demonstrated that Mllt10/Af10 specifically interacts with Tcf4/β-catenin complexes in mouse small intestinal crypts.</p>

<title>Mllt10/Af10 Is Expressed in Crypt (But Not Villus) Compartments</title>
<p>In the mouse small intestine, Mllt10/Af10 was found to be expressed specifically in the crypt proliferative compartment and not the villus as shown by Western blotting on purified crypt and villus fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and by immunohistochemistry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In healthy human colon, MLLT10/AF10 was expressed in a decreasing gradient with the highest concentration at the bottom of the crypts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1E</xref> top panel). MLLT10/AF10 was also highly expressed in human colon tumor samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g001">Figure 1E</xref> bottom panel). The expression of MLLT10/AF10 specifically in the proliferative crypt compartment was consistent with its potential role as an activator of Wnt dependent transcription.</p>

<title>Specific Enrichment of Mllt10/Af10, Dot1l, and H3K79 Methylation at Wnt Target Genes in Proliferative Crypts of Mouse Small Intestine</title>
<p>To test whether Mllt10/Af10 interacts with Tcf/β-catenin target gene chromatin in vivo, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays on mouse small intestinal epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s002">Figure S2</xref>). The purified crypt and villus fractions consist of single-cell layers, allowing direct formaldehyde fixation, an essential step in ChIP. We performed direct conventional ChIP coupled to quantitative PCR (qPCR) and confirmed the technical effectiveness of ChIP on isolated crypts and villi. We designed primers spanning the upstream regulatory regions, gene body, and downstream regulatory regions of the well-described Wnt target genes mouse <italic>Axin2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) and mouse <italic>c-Myc</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). Chromatin prepared from crypt and villus was subjected to ChIP with antibodies specific for Tcf4, β-catenin, and Mllt10/Af10. As the histone H3K79 methyltransferase, and Mllt10/Af10 interacting partner, Dot1l was also identified in the crypt Tcf4 complex by Mass Spectrometry, although with a less robust score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), we also performed ChIPs with antibodies specific for Dot1l, as well as for the activating H3K79 di- and tri-methyl marks.</p>

<title>Recruitment of MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L to Wnt Target Genes Is β-catenin Dependent</title>
<p>We next examined the interaction between TCF4, β-catenin, and MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L in the Ls174T colorectal carcinoma cell line (CRC). In this cell line a point mutation in β-catenin results in its constitutive stabilization and activation of the Wnt pathway. This Wnt “on” system mimics the proliferative crypt compartment, in which the Wnt pathway is active. MLLT10/AF10 was immunoprecipitated from Ls174T CRCs and probed for interaction with TCF4, β-catenin, and DOT1L by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>To examine whether the TCF4-MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L interaction is mediated by β-catenin, we used an Ls174T CRC cell line that inducibly expresses a shRNA against β-catenin in response to doxycycline treatment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-vandeWetering1">[5]</xref>. In these cells, β-catenin is significantly depleted at 72 h post-doxycycline treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This depletion results in abrogation of the constitutive transcriptional activity of the Wnt pathway. We immunoprecipitated TCF4 from Ls174T cells untreated or treated with doxycycline and probed for the presence of MLLT10/AF10 in the transcriptional complex. Depletion of β-catenin resulted in loss of binding of MLLT10/AF10 to TCF4, suggesting that β-catenin bridges the interaction between TCF4 and MLLT10/AF10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Using the same system we then examined the recruitment of TCF4, β-catenin, MLLT10/AF10, DOT1L, and H3K79 methylation on the human TCF4 target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> in vivo by ChIP in the presence or absence of β-catenin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3D–3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s003">Figure S3B</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s003">S3H</xref>).

As expected, removal of β-catenin by shRNA resulted in its removal from the <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). Importantly, while MLLT10/AF10-enrichment mimicked TCF4 binding on the <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> loci in the presence of β-catenin, this enrichment was abrogated upon β-catenin depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). Similarly to its binding pattern in the mouse small intestinal crypts, DOT1L recruitment to <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> target genes was enriched on TCF4 bound regions and spanned the transcribed gene body. Again, DOT1L enrichment was β-catenin dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). The pattern of enrichment of the activating H3K79 di- and tri-methyl marks mimicked DOT1L binding; depletion of β-catenin reduced di-/tri-methylation of H3K79 on <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g003">Figure 3I and 3J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s003">Figure S3G and S3H</xref>). Therefore, we concluded that MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L recruitment to the Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> is mediated by β-catenin. To determine whether MLLT10/AF10 interacts directly with β-catenin, we generated recombinant GST fusion constructs of TCF4, β-catenin, as well as C-terminal and N-terminal MLLT10/AF10. We performed GST-pulldown assays with in vitro transcribed and translated S<sup>35</sup> labeled MLLT10/AF10 and β-catenin deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s004">S4C</xref>).

<p>We next examined the expression levels of several TCF4/β-catenin endogenous target genes upon depletion of MLLT10/AF10 or β-catenin, the latter as a positive control, from Ls174T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Western blot analysis indicated that β-catenin and MLLT10/AF10 were efficiently depleted by the respective siRNAs. As expected, depletion of β-catenin resulted in down-regulation of the TCF4 target genes TCF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Roose2">[35]</xref> and EPHB2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Batlle1">[36]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g004">Figure 4B left panel</xref>). Consistent with its role as an activator of Wnt target genes, depletion of MLLT10/AF10 also resulted in down-regulation of the endogenous TCF4 target genes TCF1 and EPHB2, while the controls Tubulin and GAPDH were not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g004">Figure 4B right panel</xref>).</p>
<p>To examine the specificity of MLLT10/AF10 in Wnt transcriptional regulation, we performed microarray analysis in Ls174T colorectal cancer cells comparing the effect of MLLT10/AF10 depletion with two other known Wnt coactivators, BRG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Barker1">[20]</xref> and p300 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Hecht1">[22]</xref>. The Wnt target gene program in Ls174T CRCs was identified by the resulting differential gene expression pattern (genes with greater than 2-fold variation) following depletion of β-catenin by siRNA. With this criterion 1,003 transcripts were identified representing 827 unique genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s010">Table S2</xref>). Comparison of the corresponding expression pattern of these Wnt target genes in the absence of MLLT10/AF10, BRG1, and p300, respectively, shows that β-catenin suppression shares better expression pattern similarity and correlation with MLLT10/AF10 depletion (Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.509) than BRG1 (Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.026) or p300 (Pearson correlation coefficient = −0.151) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).

Our data suggest that while all three transcription coactivators are required for activation of certain Wnt target genes, MLLT10/AF10 demonstrates a higher specificity for Wnt transcription regulation than BRG1 and p300.

<title>MLLT10/AF10 and DOT1L Are Essential for and Largely Dedicated to the Wnt-Induced Transcriptional Program in the HEK293T System</title>
<p>Our data using the constitutive Wnt activated Ls174T CRC demonstrated that depletion of MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L reduced Wnt target gene expression. To demonstrate that activation of Wnt signaling in unstimulated cells results in a time-dependent association of MLLT10/AF10 and DOT1L on Wnt target gene promoters, we extended our studies to the physiologically relevant HEK293T system. In the latter, Wnt pathway components are intact but not mutationally activated. Wnt stimulation in these cells results in a time-dependent activation of a Wnt target gene program. ChIP analysis in HEK293T cells indicates that while TCF4 is enriched on the Wnt target genes <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>ZCCHC12</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mahmoudi1">[25]</xref>, in the absence or presence of Wnt, recruitment of β-catenin, MLLT10/AF10, DOT1L, and H3K79 di-/tri-methylation occurs in a Wnt dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g005">Figure 5A–5F</xref>). We performed siRNA-depletion of BRG1, p300, and MLLT10/AF10 in HEK293T cells stimulated with Wnt followed by microarray analysis. Unlike Ls174T cells in which depletion of DOT1L resulted in cell death, HEK293T cells appeared healthy upon DOT1L depletion. Therefore, we were also able to examine the requirement and specificity of DOT1L in Wnt target gene regulation in this system. Western blot analysis indicated efficient depletion of each protein in response to its corresponding siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g005">Figure 5G right panel</xref>). Transcripts representing 1,714 unique genes were identified as Wnt targets after stimulation with Wnt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g005">Figure 5G and 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s011">Table S3</xref>). Comparison of the corresponding Wnt signature following depletion of MLLT10/AF10, DOT1L, BRG1, and p300 showed that Wnt induced genes were generally down-regulated in the absence of each coactivator. However, comparison of the overlapping percentage of Wnt-induced genes with those suppressed upon depletion of MLLT10/AF10, DOT1L, BRG1, or p300 demonstrated that over half of MLLT10/AF10 and DOT1L-suppressed genes (53% and 57%, respectively) are Wnt targets, while only 20% and 30%, respectively, of BRG1 and p300 suppressed genes are Wnt-induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). Thus, while the chromatin modifiers BRG1 and p300 are functionally pleiotropic and largely involved in other gene regulatory pathways, MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L show greater specificity for regulation of Wnt targets. As expected, comparison of the corresponding gene expression pattern after siRNA depletion of MLLT10/AF10 and DOT1L in HEK293T cells under Wnt stimulation indicates that they share significant expression pattern similarity and over 60% of their target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s005">Figure S5A and S5B</xref>).</p>

ChIP experiments in Ls174T CRCs containing or depleted of MLLT10/AF10 by siRNA using antibodies against (B) TCF4, (C) β-catenin, (D) MLLT10/AF10, (E) DOT1L, (F) H3K79 dimethyl, (G) H3K79 trimethyl, (H) H3K4trimethyl, (I) RNA Pol II, (J) RNA Pol II Ser2P, and (K) RNA Pol II Ser5P. Immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed by qPCR using primers specific for <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> promoters and unbound <italic>AXIN2</italic> upstream control region. Results are presented as percent immunoprecipitated over input and are representative of three independent experiments.</p>

<p>To dissect the mechanism by which MLLT10/AF10 transcriptionally activates Wnt target genes, we examined the association of the elongating RNA pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Buratowski1">[37]</xref> and H3K4 trimethylation, a mark of actively transcribed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Wohrle1">[38]</xref> on Wnt target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g006">Figure 6H–K</xref>). We found that while the promoters are primed with RNA Pol II and Ser5 phosphorylated RNA Pol II in the presence or absence of MLLT10/AF10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g006">Figure 6I,K</xref>), recruitment of elongating Ser2 phosphorylated RNA Pol II to <italic>AXIN2</italic> and <italic>c-MYC</italic> was abolished upon MLLT10/AF10 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g005">Figure 5J</xref>). Depletion of MLLT10/AF10 did not significantly affect the enrichment of the activating H3K4 trimethyl mark on the Wnt target promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). These results demonstrate that MLLT10/AF10 is essential for transcriptional elongation, and not initiation of transcription at Wnt target genes.</p>

<p>Our data indicated a critical role for MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L as activators of TCF4/β-catenin target genes. To demonstrate the function of MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L in Wnt signaling and intestinal development in vivo, we used zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) as a model system. Zebrafish has been shown to be an important and relevant model system for the study of development of the intestinal epithelium and tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Shelton1">[41]</xref>. <italic>tcf4/tcf7l2</italic> mutant zebrafish were shown to recapitulate the phenotype of the <italic>Tcf4</italic> knockout mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Korinek2">[42]</xref>, i.e. the loss of proliferation in the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Muncan1">[40]</xref>. Thus, <italic>tcf4/tcf7l2</italic> plays a similar critical role in zebrafish intestinal development as it does in mouse. Using the Mllt10/Af10 mouse protein sequence, we identified the full zebrafish Mllt10/Af10 protein sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). Inspection of the protein alignments indicated that the main functional domains of Mllt10/Af10, the PHD fingers, and the LZ domain, which mediates binding to Dot1l <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Okada2">[33]</xref>, are highly conserved across species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s006">Figures S6B and S6C</xref>).

<title><italic>mllt10/af10</italic> and <italic>dot1l</italic> Are Required for the Tcf-Driven Wnt Transcriptional Program In Vivo</title>
<p>The TOPdGFP transgenic line, a faithful reporter line of Wnt signaling, expresses GFP under the control of TCF/LEF binding sites in regions of active Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Dorsky1">[44]</xref>. In these embryos, GFP was highly expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7H, 7N, and 7O</xref>) and moderately in the intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7P, 7V, and 7W</xref>). To investigate the role of <italic>tcf7l2</italic>, <italic>mllt10/af10</italic>, and <italic>dot1l</italic> in Wnt/TCF-driven transcription in vivo, we designed morpholinos (MO) to deplete these genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000539.s006">Figure S6E</xref>). RT-PCR analysis confirmed the efficiency and specificity of the different MOs used to deplete <italic>tcf7l2</italic>, <italic>mllt10/af10</italic> (two independent sequences), and <italic>dot1l</italic> (two independent sequences) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7G</xref>). In all experiments, we co-injected a p53 MO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Langheinrich1">[45]</xref> in order to control for potential off-target effects arising from MO injection. <italic>tcf7l2</italic> depletion caused a striking decrease in GFP expression in the midbrain of heterozygous TOPdGFP embryos at 56 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7I</xref>), indicating that this Tcf member is required for the expression of the GFP reporter in vivo, as has already been reported for <italic>lef1</italic><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Dorsky1">[44]</xref>, while injection of a control unrelated MO had no effect on midbrain GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7O</xref>). Similarly, depletion of <italic>mllt10/af10</italic> and <italic>dot1l</italic> resulted in a decrease in GFP expression in the midbrain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7J–7M</xref>), highlighting their requirement for TCF-driven transcription in vivo.</p>
<p>The GFP fluorescence signal in the intestine of TOPdGFP fish was too weak to be detected directly by microscopy. Therefore, we analyzed the effect of <italic>tcf7l2</italic>, <italic>mllt10/af10</italic>, and <italic>dot1l</italic> depletion on Wnt activity in the intestine of TOPdGFP embryos by in situ hybridization for GFP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7P–7W</xref>). While injection of a control MO displayed robust intestinal GFP expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7V and 7W</xref>), MO depletion of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7Q</xref>), <italic>mllt10/af10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7R and 7S</xref>), and <italic>dot1l</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000539-g007">Figure 7T and 7U</xref>) resulted in loss of intestinal GFP expression.

<p>Control morpholino injected TOPdGFP embryos showed strong expression of GFP within the hindbrain region and the lens, as seen previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Dorsky1">[44]</xref>.

<p>At 124 hpf the zebrafish intestinal tract can be divided into intestinal bulb, posterior intestine, and anal opening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Ng1">[49]</xref>.

<p>The packaging of eukaryotic genomic DNA into chromatin provides a repressive environment for transcription. Activation of transcription requires the reorganization of chromatin into a more open structure, allowing access of sequence-specific transcription factors and the general transcription machinery. Previous studies have shown that to activate TCF target genes, β-catenin recruits chromatin-modifying and remodeling cofactors, which may work to generate a more open chromatin structure. Thus, studies have shown that β-catenin interacts with the chromatin remodeling factors BRG1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Barker1">[20]</xref> and ISWI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Sierra1">[21]</xref>, the histone acetyltransferases p300/CBP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Hecht1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Takemaru1">[23]</xref>, and the H3K4 methyltransferase MLL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Sierra1">[21]</xref>. We demonstrate the requirement of MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L and H3K79 methylation for Wnt target gene activation. Comparison of the differential gene expression profiles following depletion of MLLT10/AF10, DOT1L, as well as the previously known activators BRG1 and p300 reveals that in contrast to BRG1 and p300, which regulate a broad set of targets, most outside the Wnt pathway, over half of the differentially expressed genes upon depletion of MLLT10/AF10 or DOT1L are Wnt/β-catenin regulated targets. Thus, while BRG1 and p300 are pleiotropic activators in the Wnt as well as other pathways, MLL10 is more specific to Wnt target gene regulation than the other co-regulators tested.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the requirement of MLLT10/AF10-DOT1L and H3K79 methylation for Wnt target gene activation, specifically in the elongation step of transcription. While this manuscript was in preparation, Mohan and colleagues demonstrated the requirement of Dot1 and several Dot1 complex components in the regulation of a subset of wingless target genes in Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mohan1">[50]</xref>. Demonstrating epigenetic cross-talk, they also find histone H2B monoubiquitination by Bre1 to be a pre-requisite for bulk H3K79 trimethylation levels, required for the expression of a subset of wingless target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Mohan1">[50]</xref>.</p>
<p>Deciphering the co-factor requirement in the distinct steps of transcription activation will provide valuable mechanistic insight into how β-catenin co-ordinates the recruitment of this diverse series of chromatin modifiers to Wnt targets. An attractive model is the ordered cycling recruitment of chromatin modifying complexes, which are exchanged at the Wnt-responsive regulatory elements, in the distinct steps of transcription activation, ultimately leading to efficient RNA polymerase II-transcription initiation and elongation.</p>
<p>Our results support a model in which MLLT10/AF10 tethers the DOT1L methyltransferase to Wnt target genes. The restricted expression of <italic>Mllt10/Af10</italic> specifically in the mouse crypt proliferative compartment in the intestinal epithelium together with its temporal co-expression with <italic>tcf7l2</italic> in zebrafish embryos suggest a more specific role for Mllt10/Af10 in the regulation of Wnt target gene expression and as a recruiter of Dot1l to Wnt targets. Mllt10/Af10 appears to co-ordinate Dot1l activity with the β-catenin activating protein complex. Interestingly, our ChIP data indicate a distinct enrichment pattern between Mllt10/Af10 and Dot1l on Wnt target genes. While Mllt10/Af10 and β-catenin enrichment on Wnt target genes closely mirrors Tcf4, the recruitment of Dot1l and the resulting H3K79 di-/tri-methylation occurs over the entire target gene body and is essential for recruitment of elongating RNA Pol II to targets.</p>
<p>The mechanisms by which histone modifications introduced by Mllt10/Af10 actually lead to transcription activation are not well understood. Recent studies have shown that in mixed lineage leukemia, several MLL fusion partners, including MLLT10/AF10, may activate elongation of transcription by linking DOT1L to the pTEFb complex essential for transcription elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Slany1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Lin1">[53]</xref>. In fact, DOT1L methylation of H3K79 was shown to be introduced during transcriptional elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Steger1">[32]</xref>. It is tempting to envision a mechanism whereby MLLT10/AF10 recruits DOT1L to the TCF4/β-catenin complex, which contains coactivators that stimulate the initiation phase of transcription. Upon MLLT10/AF10 mediated recruitment to TCF4/β-catenin target genes, DOT1L is loaded onto the elongating RNA pol II complex to facilitate transcription elongation.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the in vivo physiological role of Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l in intestinal development and homeostasis using zebrafish as a model system. Depletion of Tcf4, Mllt10, and Dot1l results in a significant reduction in the number of BrdU stained proliferating intestinal cells in the intervillus junctions of zebrafish embryos. The high rate of intestinal cell proliferation determines the formation of intestinal invaginations, essential for the physiological function of the intestine. Reduction in proliferation in the intestinal epithelium as a consequence of depletion of Mllt10/Af10 or Dot1l demonstrates the relevance of these coactivators in the Wnt dependent maintenance of intestinal structure and function.</p>
<p>Abrogation of Apc function during zebrafish development arrests affected cells in a proliferative state, likely due to inappropriate activation of Tcf target genes, leading to a blockage in differentiation of the intestinal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Nadauld1">[47]</xref>. We previously showed using a Tcf4 mutant line crossed with <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> that although Tcf4 depletion rescues some of the intestinal differentiation defects in <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> fish, it does not rescue the <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> defect in valve formation, blood circulation, and as a consequence, the survival of <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>. Consistent with those observations, MO depletion of <italic>tcf7l2</italic>, <italic>mllt10</italic>, and <italic>dot1l</italic> does not rescue these defects in <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> fish (unpublished data). Despite the inability to revert all of the <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> defects, MO depletion of Tcf4, Mllt10, and Dot1l in <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> fish rescues the block in intestinal differentiation as well as the mis-expression of the Wnt target genes <italic>cyp26a1</italic> and <italic>axin2</italic>. Thus, Tcf4 plays a crucial role during intestinal development and acts as the main downstream effector of the Wnt pathway in this tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>. We present evidence that Mllt10/Af10-Dot1l are part of the β-catenin/Tcf4-dependent transcriptional complex and that these coactivators also play an important role in the organogenesis of the zebrafish intestine.</p>
<p>Our data are consistent with <italic>tcf7l2</italic> as the principle <italic>tcf/lef</italic> family member involved in expression of <italic>axin2</italic> in the intestinal epithelium and GFP in the hindbrain in wild type and TOPdGFP line, respectively. We observe similar down-regulation of GFP expression in the TOPdGFP line as well as down-regulation of the target gene <italic>axin2</italic> also upon depletion of <italic>mllt10</italic> and <italic>dot1l</italic>. While our data suggest that the expression of <italic>axin2</italic> in the intestinal epithelium of wild-type embryos and GFP in the hindbrain of TOPdGFP line is highly depended on <italic>tcf7l2</italic>, we cannot exclude possible redundant regulation of other developmentally important Wnt-targets by other tcf/lef members. The observed residual expression of GFP in the TOPdGFP Tcf4, Mllt10, and Dot1l morphant embryos may reflect the role of other <italic>tcf/lef</italic> members in controlling the expression of Tcf/Lef-derived genes in the hindbrain.</p>
<p>We have previously published that the <italic>tcf7l2</italic> mutant zebrafish line does not show any strong morphological defects during early embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Muncan1">[40]</xref>. Consistent with this observation, our MO depletion of <italic>tcf7l2</italic> mimics the absence of morphological defects during early embryogenesis. The overall lack of early macroscopic morphological defects upon <italic>mllt10</italic> and <italic>dot1l</italic> depletion together with their requirement for intestinal homeostasis is consistent with their specific functional dependence on <italic>tcf7l2</italic> and not other tcf/lef family members (such as the headless phenotype of <italic>tcf7l1a</italic> depleted embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Kim1">[54]</xref> or the macroscopic morphological defects resulting from depletion of lef1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Young1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Lee1">[55]</xref>; unpublished data). Additionally, contrary to Tcf4, Mllt10, and Dot1l depleted embryos, depletion of Tcf7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>,Tcf7l1a <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000539-Faro1">[39]</xref>, and Lef1 (unpublished data) does not rescue any of the intestinal differentiation defects, such as absence of <italic>i-fabp</italic> expression or mis-expression of <italic>cyp26a1</italic> or <italic>axin2</italic> in the <italic>apc<sup>mcr/mcr</sup></italic> line. Thus, altogether, our results suggest that Mllt10-Dot1l exert their activity through Tcf4 and not other Tcf/Lef family members. Future studies will determine the mechanisms underlying the observed specificity of Mllt10 and Dot1l for the Wnt response downstream of Tcf4 as opposed to other TCF/LEF members. Whether this specificity arises merely from the co-expression of these genes in the tissues affected or whether the formation of a specific Mllt10-Dot1l complex with β-catenin and TCF4 but not the other family members mediates a specific response on TCF4 target genes are possibilities that remain to be examined.</p>
<p>Although MLLT10/AF10 contains structural motifs indicative of chromatin-associated functions, its biological role has remained unclear. Our results provide insight into the physiological role of MLLT10/AF10 as a critical coactivator of Wnt target genes essential for transcription elongation. Thus far, studies on mammalian MLLT10/AF10 have focused on its function as a fusion partner of MLL or CALM in leukemia. Given the involvement of MLLT10/AF10 in Wnt target gene activation, it will be interesting to probe potential de-regulation of Wnt signaling as a consequence of the MLLT10/AF10-MLL/CALM translocation in leukemia.</p>
<p>Future studies will illuminate the complex interplay of interactions between β-catenin/TCF4 and the various chromatin modifying and associated cofactors, leading to regulation of Wnt targets in normal intestinal development and tumorigenesis. The discovery of novel enzymatic activities that are essential and dedicated to Wnt target gene activation, such as DOT1L, presents potential new targets for rational drug development for the treatment of cancer.</p>
