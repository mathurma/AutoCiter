<abstract>
<p>MicroRNAs are important regulators of gene expression, acting primarily by binding to sequence-specific locations on already transcribed messenger RNAs (mRNA) and typically down-regulating their stability or translation. Recent studies indicate that microRNAs may also play a role in up-regulating mRNA transcription levels, although a definitive mechanism has not been established. Double-helical DNA is capable of forming triple-helical structures through Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen interactions in the major groove of the duplex, and we show physical evidence (i.e., NMR, FRET, SPR) that purine or pyrimidine-rich microRNAs of appropriate length and sequence form triple-helical structures with purine-rich sequences of duplex DNA, and identify microRNA sequences that favor triplex formation. We developed an algorithm (Trident) to search genome-wide for potential triplex-forming sites and show that several mammalian and non-mammalian genomes are enriched for strong microRNA triplex binding sites. We show that those genes containing sequences favoring microRNA triplex formation are markedly enriched (3.3 fold, p&lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) for genes whose expression is positively correlated with expression of microRNAs targeting triplex binding sequences. This work has thus revealed a new mechanism by which microRNAs could interact with gene promoter regions to modify gene transcription.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We provide physical evidence, using NMR, FRET and SPR, that purine or pyrimidine-rich microRNAs can form triplexes with complementary purine-rich sequences of duplex DNA and provide an algorithm (Trident) to search genome-wide for potential microRNA double-stranded DNA triplex-forming sites. Using this algorithm we document enrichment of microRNA triplex binding sites in mammalian and non-mammalian genomes. We found in primary leukemia cells from patients a significant over-representation of positively correlated microRNA and mRNA expression for genes containing sequences favoring microRNA-duplex DNA triplex formation, suggesting this as a mechanism by which microRNA may enhance gene transcription.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>MicroRNAs influence a broad spectrum of biological processes and have been extensively characterized as negative regulators of gene function. By pairing with complementary sequences in messenger RNA (mRNA), they are known to down-regulate gene function by enhancing transcript degradation or sequestration, or via suppression of translation. MicroRNAs have also been shown to up-regulate mRNA transcript levels for some genes, but the mechanism(s) for increasing gene expression have not been fully elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref005">5</xref>]. One indirect mechanism by which microRNAs may up-regulate gene expression is via suppression of mRNAs encoding transcriptional suppressors. In addition, there are reports that interactions between microRNAs and gene promoter regions may play a more direct role in regulating the efficiency of gene transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref006">6</xref>], for example by mediating <italic>de novo</italic> CpG methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref007">7</xref>]. However, it is possible that there are other unidentified or not fully elucidated mechanisms by which microRNAs directly interact with genes to enhance gene transcription. Because double stranded DNA is capable of forming triple-helical structures through interactions with DNA or RNA in the major groove of the DNA duplex, we and others have postulated that microRNA may form triplex structures with duplex DNA via either Hoogsteen or reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds, and thereby directly interacting with target DNA sequences in regulatory regions and gene promoters in the human genome, with the potential to alter gene function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we provide direct physical evidence that microRNAs of sufficient length and sequence can bind to double stranded DNA to form hetero-triplex structures at specific target sequences in DNA. We computationally show that the human genome, as well as the genomes of multiple other species, contain DNA sequences with properties favoring microRNA triplex formation. We also show that those genes containing sequences favoring microRNA triplex formation are enriched (3.3 fold) for genes whose expression is positively correlated with expression of microRNAs targeting triplex binding sequences, indicating this as a potential mechanism via which microRNA can directly enhance gene expression.</p>

<title>MicroRNA binding sites are enriched in multiple genomes</title>
<p>To assess the landscape of potential microRNA triplex binding sites in genomic DNA, we developed and implemented a computational algorithm (‘Trident’; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trident.stjude.org" xlink:type="simple">http://trident.stjude.org</ext-link>) to identify Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen interactions between single stranded oligonucleotides (i.e. microRNAs) and double-stranded oligonucleotides (i.e. duplex DNA). The algorithm identifies Hoogsteen and Reverse Hoogsteen interactions, independently searching for triplex forming units (e.g. Hoogsteen TA:U and CG:C; Reverse Hoogsteen TA:A and CG:G, in the form XY:Z, where Z represents the microRNA nucleotide) between stretches of polypurine genomic DNA and either polypurine or polypyrimidine third strand microRNAs, on an individual base level. For each detected triplex binding site (those sites capable of forming an interaction of multiple units), a thermodynamic binding energy and heuristic score was determined, with higher heuristic score and lower thermodynamic energy indicating stronger interaction. To determine the thermodynamic energy for binding, first order free energy calculations were performed to determine the amount of binding energy of each type of interaction. Heuristic score was determined based on the number of triplex forming pairs found between the interacting microRNA and double stranded DNA. Using this computational algorithm, we performed genome-wide binding site analyses on the genomes and microRNAs of several species, as well as randomly generated DNA sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

The heuristic score (”Score”, x-axis) represents Hoogsteen or Reverse Hoogsteen base pair complementarity and Thermodynamic Energy (”Energy”, y-axis) represents the binding energy of the triplex (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Methods</xref>). Binding sites were categorized based on the number of hits with better score and energy. Grade 1 hits represent the 99.999<sup>th</sup> percentile of triplex forming interactions, which are sequences most likely to participate in DNA-microRNA triplex formation. Subsequent grades are 10 fold lower in their percentile ranking (e.g. 99.99, 99.9, 99th percentiles). Additionally, randomly generated DNA sequences were analyzed against human microRNAs. The random DNA sequences (M, green surface) showed many orders of magnitude fewer binding sites than the human genome (M, blue surface) and the identified binding sites were of low quality (low score, high energy).</p>

<p>For each genome analyzed, the genome-wide results with heuristic scores greater than or equal to 140 (≥7 triplex forming units) were ranked and categorized on the basis of the number of other identified binding sites with a better energy/score combination (having lower energy and higher score). Those interactions with an energy/score ranking greater than the top 0.001% were classified as grade 1 hits, with grades 2–5 being assigned to interactions with energy/score rankings with successive ten-fold lower criteria (e.g. top 0.01%, 0.1%, and 1%). This analysis revealed a highly significant enrichment of microRNA triplex binding sites in all genomes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1</xref>), including <italic>Homo sapiens</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1I</xref>), <italic>Mus musculus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1J</xref>), <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1N</xref>), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) and <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), when compared to random DNA sequences analyzed for microRNA binding sites.

<title>Imbalance of purine:pyrimidine sequences are favored in microRNAs involved in identified triplex binding sites</title>
<p>To identify potential novel classes of microRNA that bind to double stranded DNA, we assessed the sequence content of the microRNAs computed to participate in triplex formation. Comparisons of the identified binding site frequencies and microRNA sequence content revealed a marked enrichment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) in identified binding sites for microRNAs exhibiting imbalanced purine to pyrimidine content (e.g. high purine content or high pyrimidine content). Notably, the distribution of purine content in known human microRNAs has a mean of approximately 50%, suggesting that those microRNAs with imbalanced purine to pyrimidine content were responsible for a disproportionate number of triplex binding interactions. Indeed, microRNAs with greater than 75% purine or greater than 75% pyrimidine content accounted for 95.3% of binding sites (Grades 1–4) identified and this distribution was significantly different than the distribution of purine content in known human microRNAs (2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction p-value &lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). This enrichment was significantly different as compared to imbalanced GC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) where only 7.8% of identified binding sites had microRNAs with greater or less than 25% GC content (2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction p-value &lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>) or imbalanced microRNA GU (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) content where only 15.8% of hits had microRNAs with greater or less than 25% GU content (2-sample test for equality of proportions with continuity correction p-value &lt;2.2 × 10<sup>−16</sup>). In addition to purine:pyrimidine content, imbalance being an important determinant of triplex formation, lower than average U content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g002">Fig 2H</xref>), higher than average G (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g002">Fig 2F</xref>) or C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g002">Fig 2G</xref>) content also predicted affinity for double stranded DNA binding. We found no evidence that average A content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g002">Fig 2E</xref>) was a determinant of microRNA binding to double stranded DNA.</p>

<title>MicroRNAs bind double stranded DNA</title>
<p>To verify that microRNAs are capable of physical interaction and binding to double-stranded DNA, we designed orthogonal methods to directly interrogate binding. A fluorescence resonance energy transfer (FRET) based method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g003">Fig 3B</xref>) to detect triplex formation was designed such that a double stranded DNA intercalating dye (SYBR Green II), when excited at 480 nm, transfers energy to a carboxy-X-rhodamine (ROX) molecule covalently coupled to a triplex forming RNA. Decreased emission at 520 nm of the double-stranded DNA intercalating donor dye corresponds with increased emission of ROX acceptor dye at 610 nm. Utilizing this method, we detected the interaction of hsa-miR-483-5p (a microRNA high in purine content) and a double stranded DNA (an identified Hoogsteen binding site in our genome wide screen), as evidenced by the decreased SYBR Green emission and increased ROX emission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).</p>

<p>Utilizing a complementary surface plasmon resonance (SPR) based method, we verified that hsa-miR-483-5p immobilized via biotin based coupling to the detector surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) was able to bind duplex DNA, but neither hsa-miR-1 nor hsa-miR-98 (microRNAs with mixed purine/pyrimdine content) was able to bind complementary double stranded DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004744.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>To corroborate our findings by FRET and SPR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we also performed EMSA experiments to document binding between hsa-miR-483-5p and ROX-labeled 24-bp hairpin duplex DNA, but reasoned that the interaction between duplex DNA and microRNA is likely transient and not readily detectable by EMSA, whereas single stranded purine-rich DNA oligonucleotides were more likely to form stable triplexes that are detectable by EMSA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref011">11</xref>]. To test this theory, we performed EMSA experiments which documented that Hoogsteen bond-optimized hsa-miR-483-5p RNA (483-opti) competed with 483-opti DNA oligo with the same nucleotide sequence for binding to duplex DNA, resulting in decreased amounts of triplex DNA and increased amounts of duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, lanes 3–5), providing evidence that Hoogsteen bond-optimized hsa-miR-483-5p (483-opti) binds to duplex DNA. In contrast, because of fewer favorable Hoogsteen bonds, hsa-miR-483-5p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, lanes 6–8) and an RNA oligo with scrambled sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, lanes 9–11) did not compete with the DNA oligo for binding to duplex DNA. In addition, EMSA experiments with 11-nucleotide DNA and RNA oligos corresponding to the 5’ and 3’ regions of Hoogsteen bond-optimized hsa-miR-483-5p, did not result in detectable triplex formation with the hairpin duplex DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004744.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), suggesting that sequence, purine content, and length of the microRNA are important factors influencing binding of microRNA to duplex DNA.

Duplexes and triplexes were resolved on a 20% non-denaturing acrylamide gel, and the ROX-signal visualized. Triplex of 483-opti DNA oligo and duplex DNA is readily detected (lane 2). The 483-opti RNA oligo competes with 483-opti DNA oligo for binding to duplex DNA which is evident by increased amounts of duplex DNA and decreased amounts of triplex (compare lanes 3–5 with lane 2). Hsa-miR-483-5p (483) and scrambled RNA, because of the fewer number of favorable Hoogsteen bonds, did not compete with the 483-opti DNA oligo for binding to duplex DNA (lanes 6–7 and 9–10, respectively). <bold>(B-C)</bold> NMR; Two-Dimensional (2D) [<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>1</sup>H] TOCSY spectra of free single stranded hairpin duplex DNA (blue contours), hairpin duplex DNA combined with hsa-miR-483-5p RNA oligo (green contours; 1:1.5 ratio), and hairpin duplex DNA with single stranded DNA oligo with the same sequence as hsa-miR-483-5p (red contours; 1:1ratio). <bold>(B)</bold> Thymidine cross-peaks between H6 and H7 (methyl), and <bold>(C)</bold> cytosine cross-peaks between H5 and H6.

<p>To corroborate our findings by EMSA, we performed Two-Dimensional (2D) [<sup>1</sup>H, <sup>1</sup>H] NMR of 24 bp hairpin duplex DNA in presence and absence of 22 nucleotide single stranded hsa-miR-483-5p RNA oligo and DNA oligo with the same sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>).

<p>We modeled DNA-microRNA triplex of double stranded DNA and hsa-miR-483-5p <italic>in silico</italic> by simulated annealing with distance restraints derived from Hoogsteen base pairing, and subsequently simulated the structure by Langevin molecular dynamics in generalized born solvent model. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). The model shows that the hsa-miR-483-5p microRNA strand is binding to the targeted DNA duplex region in an antiparallel mode, and most of the predicted Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds are reasonably well maintained even after the removal of external restraints in the top rated predicted sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4D-I</xref>). By comparison, the negative control model of triplex with the reverse RNA sequence cannot maintain Hoogsteen pairs during MD simulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4D-II</xref>). This binding model is overall consistent with the chemical shift changes observed for the cytosine and thymidine signals of DNA duplex upon single stranded RNA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g004">Fig 4B and 4C</xref>). Overall, the molecular modeling is consistent with EMSA and NMR results, which suggests that longer purine-rich RNA can form triplex with DNA duplex in an antiparallel manner. In contrast, there was complete overlap between the two TOCSY spectra of free double stranded DNA and that of double stranded DNA combined with a shorter, 11-nucleotide truncated hsa-miR-483-5p oligo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004744.s002">S2B and S2C Fig</xref>), indicating that this short RNA was incapable of triplex formation, which is consistent with a previous report that shorter purine-rich RNA cannot form triplex with double stranded DNA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref011">11</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we provide multiple lines of direct physical evidence that microRNAs can bind to double stranded DNA to form triplex structures and show that mammalian and non-mammalian genomes are enriched with microRNA triplex binding sites. Regulation of gene expression by microRNA binding directly to messenger RNA is well established. However, several studies have suggested the existence of a mechanism of transcriptional activation by microRNA binding to double stranded DNA, but no definitive mechanism for this microRNA-DNA interaction has been elucidated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref012">12</xref>]. Additionally, the presence of microRNA in the nucleus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref013">13</xref>] and a molecular mechanism for mature microRNA import into the nucleus[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref014">14</xref>] underscores the potential for nuclear functions of microRNAs. Indeed, there have been reports of triplex structures involving RNA-RNA interactions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref015">15</xref>], but microRNA-duplex DNA interactions warrant further study[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref016">16</xref>]. Purine bases have more than one face from which they can form hydrogen bonds, which allows them to simultaneously participate in Watson-Crick pairings and either Hoogsteen or Reverse Hoogsteen pairings. When a run of purines on one strand of the duplex occurs, a third strand of either DNA or RNA with the correct Hoogsteen complementarity can interact with the major groove of DNA to form a triple helix through the formation of Hoogsteen or Reverse Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. Informatics approaches for identifying homopurine sequences in genomes have been reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref018">18</xref>], however these methods did not contextualize these sequences in terms of potential for triplex formation with known microRNA species. Previous studies focused on the identification and interrogation by EMSA of stable interactions between target duplex DNA and purine or pyrimidine rich single stranded DNA or relatively short (12–14 mer) RNA oligonucleotides, with mostly favorable Hoogsteen pairings[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref019">19</xref>]. Indeed, our studies (using either EMSA or NMR) showed that purine rich short microRNA (e.g., 11 nucleotides) do not form stable triplex structures, consistent with previous reports[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref011">11</xref>], whereas longer microRNA (e.g., 22 nucleotides) with the appropriate sequence form triplex structures with duplex DNA as documented by FRET, SPR and NMR. These RNA-duplex DNA triplexes were not sufficiently stable to withstand gel electrophoresis for detection by EMSA, a known limitation of EMSA[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref020">20</xref>], but microRNA with appropriate sequence displaced DNA molecules from DNA-DNA triplexes, as documented by EMSA. The development and refinement of more powerful experimental tools such as FRET, SPR, and NMR have made it possible to identify transient interactions that may occur commonly in cell nuclei, and we used each of these methods to document formation of microRNA-duplex DNA triplexes. Analogous to transient protein-protein and DNA/RNA-protein interactions, transient formation of microRNA-duplex DNA triplexes may have as much biological importance as more stable interactions (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref016">16</xref>]).</p>
<p>Interestingly, helicases capable of unwinding intramolecular DNA triplex structures are known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref021">21</xref>] and it is conceivable that this triplex mediated unwinding is a mechanism by which microRNAs can mediate transcriptional activation. Mutations in the human ChlR1 gene, which encodes a triplex-preferring helicase, result in the genetic disorder Warsaw breakage syndrome, characterized by defects in genome maintenance. Cells that were depleted of ChlR1 had increased triplex DNA content and double-stranded breaks[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref022">22</xref>]. Triplex Structures may promote genome instability by stalling replication forks at (GAA)<sub>n</sub> repeats and inhibiting replication of DNA. Friedreichs ataxia, the most common form of ataxia in humans, is caused by the expansion of a (GAA)<sub>n</sub> repeat in intron 1 of the Frataxin gene, which in turn results in transcriptional silencing, presumably because of the triplex-forming potential of the (GAA)<sub>n</sub> repeat[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref023">23</xref>]. This suggests that, not only may the formation of DNA triplexes be a well-conserved and essential mechanism to regulate gene transcription, but that stable or prolonged triplex formation may have undesirable consequences. Therefore, it is likely that organisms would have multiple mechanisms to destabilize DNA triplexes. Besides the expression of triplex-specific helicases and potentially other ways to disrupt triplexes, the relatively weak or transient binding of microRNAs to target sites in the genome may constitute another mechanism against DNA-DNA triplex formation. Indeed, our EMSA experiments document that microRNA can disrupt DNA-DNA triplexes in a sequence specific manner, and results from both EMSA and NMR indicate that microRNA-duplex DNA triplexes are relatively transient. The binding to duplex DNA by other microRNAs, and characterization of the effects on gene transcription and downstream phenotypic consequences, merit further study to determine the biological function of such microRNA-DNA interactions.</p>
<p>We have shown that DNA sequences that favor microRNA-DNA triplex formation exist throughout the genome of humans and numerous other species. While microRNA-mRNA binding site searches has been done previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref024">24</xref>], methods presented here represent a novel technique for assessing microRNA-DNA binding through Hoogsteen and reverse Hoogsteen interactions. The Trident algorithm resembles microRNA-mRNA binding site algorithms (e.g. miRanda) in its search of binding site pairs, however the algorithm has adapted in it rules for base pair binding. Trident binding rules assign a thermodynamically determined energy to C:G and U:A pairs or G:G and A:A triplex pairs when searching for Hoogsteen and Reverse Hoogsteen binding, respectively. Thermodynamic energies reported by Trident and miRanda differ as well. First order free energy calculations were performed on each possible base pair permutation in a constrained microRNA-DNA triplex and these pair-wise interaction energies are the sum for each base pair in the triplex. Additionally, Trident does not add weighting to base pairs in seed sites due to the symmetric nature of the duplex DNA, microRNA interaction.</p>
<p>In addition to the binding site search algorithm, Trident provides a toolkit for analyzing potential triplex structures. Binding site heuristic is developed using a post-processing sequence provided by Trident. For computational efficiency, the entire process was designed and run on a Hadoop cluster. However, each part of the sequence was built to be run as a standalone Python application as well. In addition to statistical analyses, tools are provided to visualize triplex search data, including an interactive web portal (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://trident.stjude.org" xlink:type="simple">http://trident.stjude.org</ext-link>). While similar websites may be found for microRNA-mRNA binding sites, Trident goes beyond search. Using JBrowse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref025">25</xref>], users can interactively view genome, Trident and gene data, which are all tied to database records. Notably, we have validated the physical interaction of microRNA and duplex DNA using four separate physical methods of triplex detection (FRET, SPR, EMSA, and NMR) and used molecular dynamics to model the interaction. These physical interactions are buttressed by empirical measurement of microRNA and mRNA correlations in two separate cohorts of patients with ALL, revealing a marked enrichment (3.3 fold) for grade 1 Trident binding near genes whose expression is positively correlated with expression of microRNAs.</p>
<p>In conclusion, although intermolecular DNA triplex structures have been detected in cell nuclei, suggesting their possible involvement in gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref027">27</xref>], our study provides direct physical evidence of heterotriplex formation involving microRNA and duplex DNA. Moreover, these triplexes involve microRNAs that are either purine or pyrimidine rich (&gt;75%) and bind to specific targeted sequences in duplex DNA. We also show that microRNAs that are predicted to form sequence specific triplexes with duplex DNA are enriched for those that are positively correlated with mRNA transcript levels of the targeted genes (p&lt;2.2 x 10<sup>−16</sup>). The molecular action of these heterotriplexes may include the inducement of conformational changes in the immediately surrounding DNA, including a slight unwinding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref028">28</xref>], a potential mechanism for promoting transcription. Alternatively, triplex specific binding proteins could conceivably alter the topography of gene promoter regions such that transcription factors are able to bind [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref029">29</xref>]. Our findings provide a platform for discovery of new functions of microRNA in both disease and non-disease states.</p>

Stock solutions of 200–1000 μM triplex forming oligos (TFOs) were prepared in nuclease-free distilled water. The following RNA and DNA TFOs were tested for binding to the duplex DNA: hsa-mIR-483-p (5’-AAGACGGGAGGAAAGAAGGGAG-3’ with 16 favorable Hoogsteen bonds), Hoogsteen bond-optimized hsa-mIR-483-p (483-opti, 5’-GAGACGGGGGAGAAGAAGGGGG-3’ with 21 favorable Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds), scrambled microRNA (483-scramble, 5’-GGAAGGGCAGGGAGGGGGAAGA-3’ with 10 favorable Hoogsteen bonds), truncated hsa-mIR-483-p (L-11nt-opti, 5’-GAAGAAGGGGG-3’ and R-11nt-opti, 5’-GAGACGGGGGA-3’, with 11 and 10 favorable Hoogsteen bonds, respectively).

<title>Identification of microRNA, genomic DNA binding sites</title>
<p>An algorithm (‘Trident’) to identify microRNA, genomic DNA binding sites was developed in C and several post-processing pipelines were created (see Supplement). Extending the techniques developed by Betel et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref038">38</xref>], the Trident algorithm takes known microRNA transcripts and searches genomic DNA for potential binding sites. MicroRNA sequences were obtained from mirbase <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mirbase.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mirbase.org/</ext-link> version 19. Genomic DNA sequences for fifteen species (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004744.g001">Fig 1</xref>) were obtained from National Center for Biotechnology Information, U.S. National Library of Medicine (NCBI/NLM) via anonymous file transfer protocol (FTP).</p>
<p>Trident performs a search of microRNA—DNA triplex forming sites by assigning both a heuristic score and base pair binding energy to each possible alignment of microRNA and DNA strands. For each alignment location, Trident calculates energy and score values for Direct and Indirect Hoogsteen and Reverse Hoogsteen binding types. If heuristic score and energy exceed specified thresholds, the matching site is reported. Memory usage is directly proportional to the DNA sequence length. Therefore, genome sequences were segmented so that the binding site search could be run in parallel on a compute cluster and an in-house distributed grid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref039">39</xref>]. Overlap between each segment is provided to account for the boundary between two neighboring segments. After the binding site search has finished, post-processing is performed on all Trident results to classify relative fitness of matches intra-genomically.</p>
<p>To demonstrate relative fitness, heuristic score and energy pairs were classified within each genome based on their relative values. Frequencies for each energy-score pair were analyzed and ranked by percentile, which was used to classify ranks into five match classifications. Linear interpolation was then used to classify arbitrary energy-score pairs. Random DNA sequences were generated by stochastically selecting A, T, G, or C. Although dinucleotide content across genomes may be heterogeneous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004744.ref040">40</xref>], we did not adjust the nucleotide frequency for each individual genome, rather used a non-biased frequency of 0.25 for each nucleotide for all analyzed genomes.</p>

<title>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations</title>
<p>All simulations were performed by AMBER12 with force field ff10 and generalized Born (GB) model. The reverse sequence of the selected microRNA, which has less potential to form favorable reverse Hoogsteen pairs, was also constructed as a negative control. The initial conformation of B form DNA duplex and microRNA were generated by 3DNA. The starting complex structures were constructed by simulated annealing with positional restraints of DNA duplex and NMR distance restraints of Hoogsteen hydrogen bonds. The positional restraints of DNA duplex were then removed and a 10ns MD simulation was performed on each system with Watson-Crick pair and reverse Hoogsteen pair restraints. This was followed by a final 10ns MD production run which was performed after gradually removing all the distance restraints in 3ns for each system.</p>
