      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Long-term potentiation (LTP) of synaptic transmission represents the cellular basis of learning and memory. Astrocytes have been shown to regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity. However, their involvement in specific physiological processes that induce LTP in vivo remains unknown. Here we show that in vivo cholinergic activity evoked by sensory stimulation or electrical stimulation of the septal nucleus increases Ca<sup>2+</sup> in hippocampal astrocytes and induces LTP of CA3-CA1 synapses, which requires cholinergic muscarinic (mAChR) and metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR) activation. Stimulation of cholinergic pathways in hippocampal slices evokes astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, postsynaptic depolarizations of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and LTP of transmitter release at single CA3-CA1 synapses. Like in vivo, these effects are mediated by mAChRs, and this cholinergic-induced LTP (c-LTP) also involves mGluR activation. Astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations and LTP are absent in IP<sub>3</sub>R2 knock-out mice. Downregulating astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal by loading astrocytes with BAPTA or GDPβS also prevents LTP, which is restored by simultaneous astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging and postsynaptic depolarization. Therefore, cholinergic-induced LTP requires astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, which stimulate astrocyte glutamate release that activates mGluRs. The cholinergic-induced LTP results from the temporal coincidence of the postsynaptic activity and the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal simultaneously evoked by cholinergic activity. Therefore, the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is necessary for cholinergic-induced synaptic plasticity, indicating that astrocytes are directly involved in brain storage information.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Information processing in the brain was classically thought to rely solely on neurons, whereas astrocytes, the most abundant glial cells in the brain, were considered supportive cells for neurons. However, astrocytes are known to respond to neuronal signals and regulate the function of synapses, so they may indeed serve active roles during information processing and storage in the brain. We investigated whether these phenomena occur in vivo and whether astrocytes participate in synaptic plasticity and long-term potentiation (LTP), which are thought to represent the cellular basis of learning and memory. We found that sensory stimulation in rodents triggers the activity of neurons that release the neurotransmitter acetylcholine and activates astrocytes in the hippocampus, a brain region involved in learning and memory. Acetylcholine elevates intracellular calcium in astrocytes, which then stimulates the release of glutamate, another neurotransmitter. Glutamate released from astrocytes acts on synaptic receptors, increasing synaptic strength and leading to LTP of the efficacy of transmission in synapses. This is the first demonstration of the direct involvement of astrocytes in the generation of in vivo LTP. We suggest that astrocytes are cellular sources of signals underlying synaptic plasticity and are directly involved in memory processes and brain information storage.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Compelling evidence obtained by different groups during the last years indicate that astrocytes play important roles in synaptic function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Eroglu1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Volterra1">[4]</xref>. In addition to their well-known passive homeostatic control of synaptic function, astrocytes sense synaptic activity responding with Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations to synaptically released neurotransmitters and, in turn, release gliotransmitters that regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-DiCastro1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Serrano1">[14]</xref>. This evidence has led to the establishment of the Tripartite Synapse concept, in which astrocytes actively exchange information with the neuronal synaptic elements, suggesting that astrocytes may be considered as integral elements of the synapses being directly involved in synaptic physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Eroglu1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Volterra1">[4]</xref>. While this evidence has been largely obtained in brain slices, recent in vivo studies that used transgenic mice in which the gliotransmitter release of ATP was impaired have shown the participation of astrocytes in certain cortical network activity and in animal behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Halassa1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Fellin1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Halassa2">[16]</xref>. However, the exact underlying cellular mechanisms are largely undefined. Furthermore, while the involvement of astrocytes in some forms of long-term potentiation (LTP) has been shown in hippocampal slices (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Henneberger1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>), the active participation of astrocytes in specific forms of synaptic plasticity in vivo remains unknown.</p>
      <p>Cholinergic system is involved in many different processes of brain function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Everitt1">[17]</xref>. In the hippocampus, cholinergic activity modulates neuronal excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Madison1">[18]</xref>, network activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Dudar1">[19]</xref>, as well as synaptic transmission and plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Auerbach1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-FernndezdeSevilla1">[21]</xref>. In the CA1 region, acetylcholine (ACh) induces CA1 pyramidal neuron depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Madison1">[18]</xref>, theta rhythm generation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Dudar1">[19]</xref>, and LTP of glutamatergic CA3-CA1 synaptic transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Auerbach1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-FernndezdeSevilla1">[21]</xref>, as well as astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Araque1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea3">[23]</xref>. However, the physiological meaning of the cholinergic evoked astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal remains unknown.</p>
      <p>In the present work we have investigated two fundamental questions regarding the direct involvement of astrocytes in synaptic physiology, i.e, whether astrocytes actively participate in physiological processes underlying synaptic plasticity, and whether astrocyte synaptic modulation occurs in vivo. We have recently shown that the coincidence of astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations evoked by Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging and mild postsynaptic depolarization induces LTP in hippocampal synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>. Therefore, we have investigated whether the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal evoked by cholinergic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Araque1">[22]</xref> is involved in the generation of cholinergic-induced LTP of glutamatergic CA3-CA1 synapses.</p>
      <p>Using in vivo experimental approaches, we have found that cholinergic activity evoked by sensory stimulation or electrical stimulation of the septal nucleus, the main cholinergic input to the hippocampus, elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> in hippocampal astrocytes and induced LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses. Using hippocampal slices to investigate the underlying cellular mechanisms, we have found that stimulation of cholinergic axons evoked astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations, depolarization of CA1 pyramidal neurons, and LTP in CA3-CA1 synapses. Like in vivo, astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations and LTP required mAChR activation, and LTP also required mGluR activation. Cholinergic-induced astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations and LTP were absent both in IP<sub>3</sub>R2 knock-out mice and in wildtype mice after loading astrocytes with BAPTA or GDPβS (which prevented astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signalling). Notably, LTP was rescued by simultaneous astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging and postsynaptic depolarization. Taken together, these results indicate that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is necessary for cholinergic-induced hippocampal synaptic plasticity.</p>
      <p>In summary, present results show that cholinergic LTP requires the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal, which stimulates the release of glutamate from astrocytes that activates mGluRs on neurons. Then, cholinergic-induced hippocampal LTP results from the coincidence of astrocyte and postsynaptic activities simultaneously evoked by cholinergic signalling.</p>

        <title>Cholinergic Activity Evokes Astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> Elevations and LTP In Vivo</title>
        <p>We first assessed in vivo whether cholinergic activity regulates astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and synaptic transmission (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In anesthetized rats, somatosensory stimulation by tail pinch, which stimulates cholinergic activity and hippocampal theta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Herreras1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Hlscher1">[25]</xref>, evoked Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in hippocampal astrocytes (34 out of 66 astrocytes from <italic>n</italic> = 8 rats) that were abolished by the cholinergic muscarinic receptor (mAChRs) antagonist atropine (5 mg/kg) (<italic>n</italic> = 4 rats; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g001">Figure 1A–C</xref>). We analyzed hippocampal synaptic transmission in CA3-CA1 synapses, recording field EPSPs (fEPSPs) evoked by Schaffer collaterals (SC) stimulation in the CA1 pyramidal layer. Sensory stimulation also induced the LTP of fEPSPs (<italic>n</italic> = 7; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>). Similar LTP was also found after electrical stimulation of the medial septal nucleus (the main cholinergic input to the hippocampus) with a theta-like burst stimulation paradigm (TBS) (<italic>n</italic> = 9; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-FernndezdeSevilla2">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Leung1">[27]</xref>. This LTP evoked by sensory or electrical stimulation was prevented in the presence of antagonists of either muscarinic receptors (mAChRs; 5 mg/Kg atropine) or metabotropic glutamate receptors (mGluRs; 1 mM MCPG) (<italic>n</italic> = 6 in each case) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g001">Figure 1D–G</xref>), indicating that septohippocampal cholinergic activity induced the long-term potentiation (c-LTP) of CA3-CA1 synapses, which also required mGluR activation. Furthermore, because astrocyte responsiveness to sensory stimulation was similar in control and in the presence of MCPG (<italic>n</italic> = 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), mGluR activation was downstream the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal.</p>

        <p>We have recently shown that the coincidence of Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging-evoked glutamate release from astrocytes and a mild postsynaptic depolarization of CA1 pyramidal neurons induced LTP at CA3-CA1 synapses through presynaptic mGluR activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>. Therefore, we then investigated whether c-LTP required astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations by analyzing the consequences of the dialysis of either BAPTA (which chelates intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>) or GDPβS (which prevents G protein-mediated intracellular signaling) into the astrocytic network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>).

      <p>Present results obtained in vivo and in vitro show that hippocampal LTP evoked by cholinergic activity was associated with Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations in astrocytes, and that both phenomena were mediated by mAChRs. Unexpectedly, the cholinergic-induced LTP also required mGluR activation, which prompted us to evaluate the involvement of astrocytes because glutamate is a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent released gliotransmitter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Halassa1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Volterra1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Navarrete1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea3">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Jourdain1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Shigetomi1">[31]</xref>. Analysis of the underlying cellular mechanisms in hippocampal slices indicate that astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> elevations were necessary for the generation of this LTP, which could be elicited by pairing postsynaptic depolarizations and astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> uncaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g006">Figure 6</xref>; cf., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>). Taken together, the present results indicate that cholinergic-induced LTP results from the temporal coincidence of postsynaptic and astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> activities simultaneously triggered by cholinergic axons, which stimulating Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent gliotransmission persistently potentiate synaptic transmitter release through activation of mGluRs. Present data provide the first demonstration in vivo that astrocytes are responsible for a specific physiological phenomenon of synaptic plasticity triggered by sensory stimuli, in which the astrocyte calcium signal and the release of the gliotransmitter glutamate are key elements.</p>
      <p>Our results indicate that cholinergic activation of astrocytes stimulates the release of glutamate, which leads activating mGluRs to the long-lasting potentiation of synaptic transmission when coincident with a postsynaptic depolarization. Consistent with our previous work (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Navarrete1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>), we propose that these receptors are located presynaptically because this c-LTP results from the enhancement of transmitter release probability without changes in synaptic potency, which indicates a presynaptic rather than a postsynaptic underlying mechanism, and it is associated with changes in the paired-pulse facilitation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001259.s001">Figure S1</xref>), which is consistent with a presynaptic mechanism. Therefore, although anatomical evidence for presynaptic mGluRs at Schaffer collaterals needs to be confirmed, electrophysiological data strongly suggest that c-LTP is mediated by activation of presynaptic mGluRs.</p>
      <p>The cholinergic-induced LTP requires the temporal coincidence of the astrocyte signaling and a mild postsynaptic depolarization, which suggests the existence of a retrograde signaling from the postsynaptic neuron to induce the presynaptic expression of LTP. Although further detailed studies are required to identify the possible postsynaptic signal and to elucidate their molecular targets, perhaps the presynaptic molecular events responsible for the astrocyte-induced mGluR-mediated transient potentiation of transmitter release (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001259-g006">Figure 6G</xref>; cf. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Navarrete1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>) could become persistently altered by the signaling pathway stimulated by the postsynaptic signal.</p>
      <p>The consequences of AChR activation on synaptic transmission and plasticity have been extensively studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Everitt1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-FernndezdeSevilla1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Hlscher1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-FernndezdeSevilla3">[28]</xref>, and the ability of cholinergic signaling to induce LTP in hippocampal CA3-CA1 synapses is well known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Auerbach1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-FernndezdeSevilla1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-FernndezdeSevilla2">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Leung1">[27]</xref>. Yet the requirement of mGluR activation was previously untested, probably because its involvement was logically unexpected. However, this participation is not surprising when considering the ability of astrocytes to respond to synaptic transmitters and to release gliotransmitters such as glutamate that can regulate synaptic transmission and plasticity, according to the Tripartite Synapse concept <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Halassa1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Volterra1">[4]</xref>. Thus, a well-known process newly examined considering the possible involvement of astrocytes is revealed to be mediated by novel unexpected mechanisms. Other physiological processes, whose underlying mechanisms are currently interpreted as overlooking the possible participation of astrocytes, might also provide novel unexpected results if revisited, as recently shown for hippocampal heterosynaptic depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Serrano1">[14]</xref> or endocannabinoid-mediated synaptic potentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Navarrete1">[7]</xref>. Nevertheless, possible novel mechanisms mediated by astrocytes might be rather additional than exclusive. Indeed, our results propose a novel mechanism underlying the cholinergic-induced LTP that may co-exist with the classical NMDAR-mediated LTP, which was pharmacologically blocked in our experimental conditions to isolate the studied phenomenon.</p>
      <p>Compelling evidence provided by many laboratories has shown the relevance of the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and the gliotransmission in neurophysiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Halassa1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Panatier1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Serrano1">[14]</xref>. However, recent reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Petravicz1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Agulhon2">[35]</xref> have questioned their physiological importance based on negative results that failed to detect changes in synaptic transmission and plasticity using particular tests in transgenic animals, such as IP<sub>3</sub>R2<sup>−/−</sup> mice. In contrast, here we provide evidence showing that both cholinergic-induced astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and LTP are impaired in this type of transgenic mice. Therefore, astrocyte-synapse interactions are based on complex signaling processes that are not unselectively triggered by any type of stimulus and do not result in unspecific neuromodulation of any type of process; rather they probably depend on specific types of activity of particular circuits and synapses and cause neuromodulation of precise phenomena. Hence, these results further support the concept of the Tripartite Synapse that highlights the relevance of the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal and the gliotransmission, and proposes a key role of astrocytes in synaptic physiology.</p>
      <p>Astrocytes may regulate synaptic function through the release of different gliotransmitters, such as glutamate, ATP, or D-serine, with different neuromodulatory mechanisms and physiological consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Navarrete3">[36]</xref>. The present study was designed to investigate the involvement of astrocytes in a particular phenomenon, the cholinergic-induced LTP. To isolate this particular phenomenon, in vitro experiments were conducted in the presence of NMDA and GABAergic receptor antagonists to prevent interferences from other astrocyte-neuron signaling and other possible synaptic plasticity mechanisms, such as the classical neuronal NMDAR-mediated LTP, the postsynaptic NMDA receptor activation by astrocytic glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Perea3">[23]</xref>, the D-serine-mediated NMDAR modulation involved in LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Henneberger1">[6]</xref>, or the presynaptic NMDAR-mediated synaptic efficacy increase induced by astrocytic glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Santello1">[13]</xref>. Although the present results indicate that NMDAR-mediated mechanisms are not required for the cholinergic-induced hippocampal LTP, additional mechanisms responsible for the involvement of astrocytes in synaptic plasticity may be present. These different mechanisms may be complementary rather than alternative, suggesting that different neuronal and astrocytic signaling processes may coexist, which would result in multiple mechanisms of synaptic plasticity that may be triggered under different network activities, thus providing a higher richness to the synaptic communication (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Navarrete3">[36]</xref>).</p>
      <p>The cholinergic system is involved in multiple brain functions, including learning and memory, as well as behavioral states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Blokland1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Woolf1">[40]</xref>. The present results show a key role of astrocytes in cholinergic signaling, suggesting that astrocytes may directly participate in those brain functions. Furthermore, because dysfunctions of cholinergic transmission contribute to memory loss in some brain disorders such as Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001259-Kuchibhotla1">[41]</xref>, present data suggest that astrocytes may be directly involved in these pathological states of the nervous system. Present data extend the classical Hebbian model for LTP based on the coincident pre- and postsynaptic activity, by including astrocytes as key cellular elements involved in the intercellular signaling occurring during synaptic function, and where the coincidence of astrocyte and postsynaptic activities evoked by a physiological process (i.e., cholinergic activity) induces long-term changes in synaptic efficacy.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the present findings show that the astrocyte Ca<sup>2+</sup> signal is required for the generation of LTP in hippocampal synapses induced by cholinergic activity, indicating that astrocytes are necessary elements in some forms of synaptic plasticity and, hence, they are directly involved in memory processes and brain information storage.</p>
