<p>The conformation of the pseudokinase STRADα, which is regulated by binding to ATP and to the scaffolding protein MO25α, is key to the activiation of the LKB1 tumor suppressor complex.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Pseudokinases lack essential residues for kinase activity, yet are emerging as important regulators of signal transduction networks. The pseudokinase STRAD activates the LKB1 tumour suppressor by forming a heterotrimeric complex with LKB1 and the scaffolding protein MO25. Here, we describe the structure of STRADα in complex with MO25α. The structure reveals an intricate web of interactions between STRADα and MO25α involving the αC-helix of STRADα, reminiscent of the mechanism by which CDK2 interacts with cyclin A. Surprisingly, STRADα binds ATP and displays a closed conformation and an ordered activation loop, typical of active protein kinases. Inactivity is accounted for by nonconservative substitution of almost all essential catalytic residues. We demonstrate that binding of ATP enhances the affinity of STRADα for MO25α, and conversely, binding of MO25α promotes interaction of STRADα with ATP. Mutagenesis studies reveal that association of STRADα with either ATP or MO25α is essential for LKB1 activation. We conclude that ATP and MO25α cooperate to maintain STRADα in an “active” closed conformation required for LKB1 activation. It has recently been demonstrated that a mutation in human STRADα that truncates a C-terminal region of the pseudokinase domain leads to the polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, symptomatic epilepsy (PMSE) syndrome. We demonstrate this mutation destabilizes STRADα and prevents association with LKB1. In summary, our findings describe one of the first structures of a genuinely inactive pseudokinase. The ability of STRADα to activate LKB1 is dependent on a closed “active” conformation, aided by ATP and MO25α binding. Thus, the function of STRADα is mediated through an active kinase conformation rather than kinase activity. It is possible that other pseudokinases exert their function through nucleotide binding and active conformations.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>There are 518 human protein kinases that are responsible for orchestrating the phosphorylation-dependant signal transduction events that regulate almost all cellular processes. Curiously, approximately 10% of protein kinases lack one or more catalytic residues, and these kinases have been termed pseudokinases. It has been proposed that some pseudokinases act as scaffolds, bringing together proteins involved in signalling networks. Here, we report the structure of the pseudokinase STRADα in complex with the adaptor protein MO25α; together these two proteins regulate the LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase. Despite lacking several key catalytic residues, STRADα binds ATP and adopts an active conformation typical of catalytically competent kinases. The affinity of STRADα for ATP is enhanced by MO25α and vice versa. We go on to demonstrate through mutagenesis studies that binding to both ATP and MO25α is essential for the activation of LKB1. Our data suggest that STRADα exerts its functions through an active conformation, not through actual catalytic activity, thus raising the possibility that pseudokinases regulate signalling networks by adopting different structural conformations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pseudokinases are classified as protein kinases that lack key catalytic residues within their kinase domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Manning1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau1">[2]</xref>. These proteins are emerging as important regulators and scaffolding components of various signal transduction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau1">[2]</xref>. Despite being predicted to lack intrinsic kinase activity, several “pseudokinases” such as WNK, CASK, and IRAK2 still possess the ability to phosphorylate substrates. In the case of WNK isoforms, the missing conserved catalytic Lys residue in subdomain-II is substituted by another Lys residue located in subdomain-I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Min1">[3]</xref>. CASK, despite lacking the conserved Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding Asp residue in the DFG motif of subdomain-VII, folds into an active conformation capable of binding ATP and phosphorylating substrates in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Mukherjee1">[4]</xref>. Interestingly, recent studies have shown that mutations in CASK affect brain development and cause mental retardation in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Najm1">[5]</xref>. Recent data also indicate that the IRAK2 pseudokinase, despite lacking the Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding DFG motif as well as the catalytic HRD motif, still possesses activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Kawagoe1">[6]</xref>. These results suggest that some of the other proteins in the human genome that are classified as pseudokinases may still possess catalytic activity and thus function as normal kinases.</p>
<p>The STe-20 Related Adaptor (STRAD) pseudokinase forms a 1∶1∶1 heterotrimeric complex with the LKB1 tumour suppressor kinase and the scaffolding protein MO25 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Baas1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau2">[8]</xref>. In humans, there are two closely related isoforms of STRAD (STRADα and STRADβ) and MO25 (MO25α and MO25β) that similarly interact with and activate LKB1. Loss-of-function mutations in the LKB1 kinase in humans result in the inherited Peutz-Jeghers cancer syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Hemminki1">[9]</xref>. Inactivating mutations in LKB1 are also increasingly being reported in sporadic cancers, in particular lung cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-SanchezCespedes1">[10]</xref>. LKB1 exerts its tumour-suppressing effects by phosphorylating and activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) as well as a number of other related kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Alessi1">[11]</xref>. LKB1-mediated activation of AMPK occurs when cellular energy levels are low, and activation of AMPK inhibits cell growth and proliferation through multiple pathways, including suppressing activity of mTOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Inoki1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Gwinn1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, it was reported that a severe human developmental and epileptic syndrome termed polyhydramnios, megalencephaly, symptomatic epilepsy (PMSE), was caused by a homozygous partial deletion in the STRADα gene (<italic>LYK5</italic>), truncating 180 C-terminal residues of the protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Puffenberger1">[14]</xref>. Individuals affected by this condition suffer from severe mental retardation, gross movement disorders, and childhood mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Puffenberger1">[14]</xref>. How this mutation affects STRADα function and its ability to interact with LKB1 is unknown, although histological staining of neuronal tissues of PMSE patients has suggested elevated mTOR pathway activity, which could potentially result from loss of LKB1 kinase activity.</p>
<p>Unlike the majority of kinases that require phosphorylation of their T-loop, LKB1 is activated through direct interaction with STRADα/β isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Baas1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau2">[8]</xref>. The kinase domain of LKB1 binds to the pseudokinase domain of STRAD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Baas1">[7]</xref>. At least 12 point mutations located in the LKB1 kinase domain that prevent LKB1 from interacting with STRAD isoforms have been identified in human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau3">[15]</xref>. Activation of LKB1 and interaction with STRAD isoforms is markedly enhanced in the presence of MO25α/β isoforms, indicating that MO25 stabilizes the interaction between STRAD and LKB1. The C-terminal Trp-Glu-Phe residues (WEF motif) of STRADα bind to MO25α, and mutations of these residues abolish this interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau2">[8]</xref>. Structural analysis of MO25α revealed a helical repeat, horseshoe-shaped protein that interacts with the WEF motif of STRADα through a hydrophobic pocket located on its convex C-terminal surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>. In contrast, proteins that are distantly structurally similar to MO25α, such as the Armadillo repeat proteins PUM1, β-catenin, and importin-α, interact with their binding partners through their concave surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Graham1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Wang1">[19]</xref>. Many of the surface-exposed residues on the MO25α concave surface are conserved between species, suggesting that these may mediate interactions with (an) unknown regulator(s) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>. Although STRADα mutants lacking the C-terminal WEF motif are unable to interact with MO25α alone, they can still form a heterotrimeric complex with LKB1 and MO25α, demonstrating that STRADα possesses additional interactions with LKB1 and/or MO25α, separate from the WEF motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau3">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>All studies undertaken to date suggest that STRADα expressed in bacteria is incapable of autophosphorylating or phosphorylating other substrates tested (MBP, histone 2A, or LKB1) when assays were undertaken in the presence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Baas1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau3">[15]</xref> (J. Boudeau, unpublished data). Despite lacking detectable kinase activity, STRADα is still capable of interacting with ATP as well as ADP in a magnesium-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau3">[15]</xref>. Mutations that abolish ATP binding do not affect the ability of STRADα to activate LKB1 in the presence of MO25α. Thus, the role of ATP-binding to STRAD is unclear.</p>
<p>Here, we report the structure of STRADα as part of the STRADα/MO25α heterodimer. The data show that despite being inactive, STRADα folds into an ATP-bound, closed conformation with an ordered activation loop similar to that of fully active protein kinases. Our data establish that STRADα is indeed deficient in intrinsic catalytic activity because it lacks most essential catalytic residues. Moreover, we observe that STRADα does not only interact with MO25α through its WEF motif as previously envisaged, but forms an extensive network of interactions with the highly conserved concave surface of MO25α. Binding studies and mutagenesis data show that the closed/“active” conformation that STRADα assumes is maintained through cooperative binding of ATP and MO25α. STRADα mutants incapable of interacting with ATP and MO25α are unable to activate LKB1, despite interacting with it. We conclude that the ability of STRADα to activate LKB1 is dependent on an active conformation rather than catalytic phosphoryltransferase activity. Our results also indicate that the human mutation that causes PMSE syndrome destabilizes STRADα and prevents it from binding to, and activating LKB1.</p>

<title>STRADα Adopts the Canonical Kinase Fold</title>
<p>STRADα comprises a pseudokinase domain (residues 58–401), two nuclear export sequences (residues 21–29 and 417–426) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Dorfman1">[20]</xref>, and a C-terminal WEF motif (residues 429–431) previously shown to interact with MO25α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau2">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>. We focused on the interaction between the STRADα pseudokinase domain (residues 59–431) and full-length MO25α (residues 1–341). These proteins were coexpressed in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and the STRADα/MO25α complex eluted as a heterodimer of the expected size from a gel filtration column, yielding approximately 60 mg of the complex from 4 l of culture (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Initial crystals of the STRADα/MO25α complex in space group P2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub>2<sub>1</sub> diffracted only to 4.8 Å resolution (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000126-t001">Table 1</xref>). With the help of chemical lysine methylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Walter1">[21]</xref>, diffraction of these crystals (retaining the same space group and unit cell dimensions) improved to 2.35 Å (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000126-t001">Table 1</xref>). The structures of both methylated and unmethylated crystals were solved by molecular replacement and revealed the same packing/intermolecular interactions. The high-resolution, methylated form of the complex was refined to a final model with good statistics (<italic>R</italic><sub>free</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>work</sub> of 0.254/0.206; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000126-t001">Table 1</xref>). The structure of STRADα exhibits the classical bilobal protein kinase fold, with the N-terminal lobe (residues 59–152) organized around a central β-sheet, and a C-terminal lobe (residues 153–401) that is largely α-helical (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A well-resolved molecule of ATP was observed in the cleft between the small and large lobes of the pseudokinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). The ATP molecule displays the canonical binding mode and retains a similar conformation to that of ATP molecules bound to active kinases (root mean square deviation [RMSD] = 0.9 Å on all atoms compared to ATP bound to PKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Knighton1">[22]</xref>).</p>

<title>STRADα Binds ATP Using a Mg<sup>2+</sup>-Independent Mechanism</title>
<p>Sequence comparison reveals that STRADα lacks numerous essential catalytic residues found in active protein kinases, namely a conserved Gly residue in the glycine-rich loop (subdomain-I), the Lys residue of the VAIK motif (subdomain-II), the catalytic Asp residue of the HRD motif (subdomain-VIb), a conserved Asn residue (subdomain-VIb), as well as the entire DFG motif in subdomain-VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Despite missing these key residues, STRADα adopts a similar overall conformation to that of TAO2 (sharing 25% sequence identity and 37% sequence similarity), an active protein kinase of known structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Zhou1">[23]</xref> (RMSD = 1.4 Å on 197 Cα atoms). Comparison of the STRADα and TAO2 structures reveals that a number of substitutions of key catalytic residues are found in STRADα. Met83 replaces one of the conserved Gly residues in the glycine-rich loop, Arg100 substitutes the catalytic Lys residue in the VAIK motif, Ser195 replaces the Asp residue in the HRD motif, His200 substitutes for the conserved Asn in subdomain-VIb, and the entire DFG motif is replaced by GLR (residues 213–215).</p>
<p>In active protein kinases, the DFG motif plays a pivotal role in coordinating two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions: one that orients the γ-phosphate into the position required for phosphoryl transfer and the other that controls ATP conformation by interacting with the β/γ phosphates. Consistent with the lack of the DFG motif in STRADα, no Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions were observed in the STRADα-ATP complex, despite 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> being present in the crystallization mother liquor. However, despite the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, the positioning of the β/γ phosphates in STRADα was similar to that of active TAO2 kinase complexed to MgATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The β-phosphate is tethered through interactions with Arg215 from the GLR (DFG) motif, and His200 (subdomain-VIb), basic residues that may substitute for one of the positively charged Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The second Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion and its coordinating residues are also missing; instead, the γ-phosphate only interacts with a conserved lysine (Lys197) in the catalytic loop. Thus, STRADα appears to have evolved a novel, Mg<sup>2+</sup>-independent mechanism to bind the phosphate groups of ATP. The presence of the two hydrogen bonds between N1 and N6 atoms of the ATP adenine ring and the protein backbone, observed in all active protein kinase structures, further illustrates the conservation of the ATP binding pocket. Thus, the STRADα structure explains previous observations that STRADα can bind ATP in the absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup>, and its similar affinity for ADP and ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau3">[15]</xref>.</p>

<title>STRADα Adopts an Active Conformation</title>
<p>Although the activation loop of STRADα (residues 212–245) is not phosphorylated, it is well ordered, a feature normally observed only in structures of activated protein kinases that are phosphorylated on their activation loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Remarkably, Asp232 in the activation loop occupies a position similar to the activating phosphorylated residue found in active kinases, e.g., (phospho)Ser181 in TAO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Asp232 appears to play the same structural role as the activating phosphate group, coordinating the conserved arginine from the catalytic HRD motif (Arg194 in the STRADα HRS motif) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>). Further evidence that STRADα adopts the canonical active conformation stems from the presence of a short antiparallel β-sheet between the β6 and β9 strands, which is a characteristic feature of the active state of kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Nolen1">[24]</xref>. Furthermore, the STRADα αC-helix is rotated into the “closed” conformation found in active kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Johnson1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Huse1">[26]</xref>, with the conserved ion pair between the Glu118 on the αC-helix and Arg100 in subdomain-II formed via two water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Despite STRADα binding ATP in the correct orientation for activity and folding into an active conformation, STRADα (residues 59–431) expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> did not autophosphorylate or phosphorylate myelin basic protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We have attempted to detect activity in the presence and absence of MO25α and/or 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. We have also generated mutations converting all the missing catalytic residues on the STRADα pseudokinase discussed above to the equivalent residues found in the active kinase TAO2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s002">Figure S2</xref>). However, none of these mutants showed autophosphorylation or phosphorylated myelin basic protein in the presence or absence of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions and/or MO25α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s002">Figure S2</xref>). We also tested whether STRADα possessed ATPase activity, employing a highly sensitive ATPase assay kit (Innova Biosciences), but no activity was observed (E. Zeqiraj, unpublished data). Nevertheless, it is impossible to categorically rule out that STRADα will not, highly specifically, phosphorylate an as-yet unidentified substrate.</p>

<title>Identification of the Biological STRADα/MO25α Complex</title>
<p>The asymmetric unit of the STRADα/MO25α complex crystals contains one molecule of MO25α, with a conformation similar to the previously published MO25α/WEF peptide complex structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref> (RMSD = 0.6 Å on 292 Cα atoms), and one molecule of STRADα. The position and conformation of the WEF motif is similar to that in the previously described MO25α/WEF complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref> (RMSD = 0.3 Å on 35 atoms, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Due to tight crystal contacts (total buried surface on MO25α by STRADα and its symmetry mates = 2,833 Å<sup>2</sup>), it was not immediately apparent which contacts represented biologically relevant interactions and which were crystallographic packing artefacts. Whereas clear electron density is present for the last six amino acids of STRADα (residues 426–431, including the WEF motif that interacts with MO25α, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), residues 402–425 of STRADα were not visible in the electron density maps, and it was thus not possible to directly identify the appropriate symmetry mates of STRADα and MO25α that make up the biologically relevant binary complex. Analysis of the crystal contacts between symmetry-related molecules suggested that there were four possible ways in which STRADα could interact with MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We studied all four possible STRADα/MO25α complexes and ranked these in terms of total buried surface area, a possible method for distinguishing crystallographic from biological contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Nooren1">[27]</xref>. Discounting the WEF motif interaction (800 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area), identical in all four possible complexes, the buried surface area in each of the possible complexes is 1,550 Å<sup>2</sup>, 225 Å<sup>2</sup>, 58 Å<sup>2</sup>, and 200 Å<sup>2</sup> for complexes A, B, C, and D, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). In addition, the distances between the last well-defined residue of the STRADα C-terminal lobe and the first well-defined residue of the WEF motif at the extreme C-terminus of STRADα were measured for the four possible complexes. This yielded direct distances of 52, 83, 65, and 55 Å for complexes A, B, C, and D, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Taken together, it appears that complex A is the most likely biological interaction, since STRADα binds to the (highly conserved) concave surface of MO25α and has the largest buried surface area, while also possessing the shortest distance from the C-terminal lobe to the WEF motif (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Similarly, analysis of the possible complexes with PISA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Krissinel1">[28]</xref> yields the highest (1.0) complexation significance score (CSS) for complex A, while predicting that complexes B, C, and D will not be stable in solution.</p>
<p>The 6-His purification tag that extends from the N-terminus of STRADα (450 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area in complex A) forms additional contacts between MO25α and STRADα. SPR studies demonstrate that His-tagged STRADα binds MO25α in vitro with the same affinity as STRADα lacking the His tag (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, MO25α residues 2–5 (Pro-Phe-Pro-Phe, termed the PFPF motif here) make hydrophobic contacts in a pocket adjacent to the STRADα ATP binding pocket on a symmetry-related copy of STRADα (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). This is unlikely to constitute a physiological STRADα/MO25α interaction, as deleting this motif did not impair the in vivo interaction of MO25α with either STRADα alone or a complex of STRADα and LKB1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3C and S3D</xref>). Moreover, we were unable to affinity purify overexpressed STRADα or LKB1 from a cell extract employing a PFPF motif containing biotinylated peptide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). A complex of LKB1/STRADα/MO25α(ΔPFPF) still activated the heterotrimeric AMPK complex expressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> with similar efficiency as wild-type LKB1/STRADα/MO25α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). Nevertheless, it is possible that the PFPF docking site on STRADα does play a role in enabling STRADα to interact with other regulators or substrates of the LKB1 complex. Intriguingly, a similar crystallographic interaction can be observed in the structure of the mammalian AMPK heterotrimeric complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Xiao1">[29]</xref>. In this case, a similar hydrophobic N-terminal motif “MYAF” from the β2 domain interacts with the kinase domain from the neighbouring molecule in the crystal lattice, albeit not near the phospho-nucleotide binding site.</p>

<title>STRADα Interacts with the MO25α Concave Surface</title>
<p>MO25α is composed of seven structurally similar α-helical repeats (named R0–R6) that form a horseshoe-shaped molecule with a concave and a convex surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>. MO25α helical repeats R1–R6 consist of three α-helices (H1–H3) each, whereas repeat R0 consists of only two helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>. Helices H3 from repeat R1–R5 are arranged in an almost parallel fashion and make up the concave surface of MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Other helical repeat adaptor proteins, such as PUM1, β-catenin, and importin-α, make use of a similar concave surface to interact with macromolecular partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Graham1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Wang1">[19]</xref>. Strikingly, the crystal structure of the STRADα/MO25α complex reveals that, in addition to the interaction through the WEF motif, a major additional binding interface involves the STRADα N-terminal kinase lobe and the MO25α concave surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g002">2</xref>). Part of the interaction surface on STRADα is N-terminal to the αC-helix and comprises the loop between the αB/αC helices (residues 104–109), termed the “αB site” here (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g002">2A</xref>). This region forms an extensive hydrogen-bonding network centred on Arg227 from the R5-H3 of MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), burying a total of 245 Å<sup>2</sup> surface area. Residues Tyr223, Arg227, Lys231, and Asn269 of MO25α engage the side chains of residues Glu105 and Asn109 of STRADα, whereas Leu104, Ala106, Cys107, and Ser108 contribute to the interaction via their backbone atoms.</p>

Tethered by hydrophobic and hydrogen-bonding interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), the αC-helix forms the major interaction surface, contributing a total of 405 Å<sup>2</sup> buried surface area on the MO25α concave surface.</p>
<p>C-terminal to the αC helix, a second hydrogen-bonding network with comparable buried surface area (270 Å<sup>2</sup>) to the αB site is present, and involves residues Leu124, Asn126, and Tyr185 from the STRADα helix αE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g002">2A</xref>; termed the “αE site” here). This region interacts with Glu93, Lys96, and Phe92 from the R1-H3 helix of MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Together, the αB site and the αE site appear to act as anchor regions, positioning the αC-helix to run along the H3 helices of R1–R5 of MO25α.</p>
<p>Additional interactions are found between Phe178 of MO25α, forming hydrophobic stacking interactions with residues from the N-terminal β4 and β5 strands of STRADα (termed the “β4/β5 site” here; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g002">2A</xref>). STRADα and STRADβ also possess an insertion of ten residues (221–229) in the activation loop that is not observed in TAO2 or other STE20 kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).

This interaction perhaps explains why the STRADα activation loop is ordered. All of the key interacting interface residues are highly conserved between species of STRADα and MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s005">S5</xref>).</p>

<title>The MO25α Concave Surface Is Required for STRADα Binding</title>
<p>The structure of the STRADα/MO25α complex shows that, in addition to the WEF binding pocket on the convex surface of MO25α, a major network of interactions between STRADα and the concave surface of MO25α is observed over the αB, αC, αE, β4/β5, and activation loop sites. To test the importance of these additional interactions, we investigated how mutations of residues located on the MO25α concave surface affected interaction with STRADα. We mutated residues in MO25α in the novel αB, αC, αE, β4/β5, and activation loop binding sites as well as the previously characterised WEF pocket (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As reported previously, mutation of Met260 in the WEF pocket of MO25α abolishes its ability to interact with STRADα in HEK293 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>. However, we also observed that mutations in the two anchor regions (Phe92, Glu93, and Lys96 from the αE site and Tyr223 and Arg227 from the αB site) abolished MO25α binding to STRADα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Similarly, mutating Phe178 in the β4/β5 site, Ile145 and Ser182 in the αC site, or Arg107 in the activation loop site markedly disrupted the MO25α-STRADα interaction. Mutations of Leu141, Lys231, and Asn269 in the αC site did not significantly affect binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Mutation of the reciprocal interacting residues on STRADα, including Glu105, Asn109, Asn126, Ile138, and Tyr185, also abolished or markedly reduced binding to MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). These results confirm the importance of the network of interactions between the concave surface of MO25α and STRADα in enabling the stable association between these two proteins, at least in the absence of LKB1.</p>

<p>Previous work has shown that MO25α mutants in which the WEF pocket was disrupted, and that were no longer able to form a complex with STRADα, were still capable of forming a heterotrimeric complex with LKB1 and STRADα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau2">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Boudeau3">[15]</xref>. Similarly, MO25α mutants in which key STRADα binding residues located within the concave surface were mutated are still capable of interacting with the LKB1/STRADα complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Even double MO25α mutants in which both the WEF pocket and the αB, αE, or β4/β5 sites were disrupted were capable of associating with the LKB1/STRADα complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Moreover, the specific activity of LKB1/STRADα complexes associated with these MO25α mutants was either normal or only moderately reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This suggests the presence of additional interactions between MO25α and LKB1 in the presence of STRADα.</p>

Arg240 might be involved in interaction with LKB1, as this residue is located on the concave surface of MO25α, distant from STRADα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To further investigate the role of Arg240 in enabling MO25α to associate with LKB1/STRADα, we mutated Arg240 alone or in combination with residues in either the WEF pocket (Met260) or the αB STRADα binding sites (Arg227). We found that mutation of Arg240 alone does not prevent MO25α from interacting with LKB1/STRADα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). However, a double MO25α mutant lacking Arg240 and a key concave surface-binding site in the αB site (Arg227), markedly impaired binding to LKB1/STRADα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). A triple mutant of MO25α lacking Arg240, Arg227, and the WEF pocket site failed to associate with LKB1/STRADα and stimulate LKB1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). These observations indicate that MO25α possesses three sites with which it can interact with the LKB1/STRADα complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g002">Figure 2</xref>), namely two STRADα binding regions (extensive concave MO25α surface and WEF pocket) as well as a putative LKB1 binding site (Arg240).</p>

<title>The STRADα/MO25α Interaction Is Similar to the CDK/Cyclin Complex</title>
<p>Inspection of the STRADα/MO25α complex reveals an unexpected resemblance to the interaction between activated cyclin-dependent kinase 2 (CDK2) and its activating regulatory subunit cyclin A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Jeffrey1">[30]</xref>. Although MO25α/β isoforms are not related to cyclins at the primary sequence level, both proteins consist of multiple α-helical repeats. Crystal structures of CDK2/cyclin A complex have revealed cyclin A binds to the so-called “PSTAIRE (αC) helix” of CDK2 kinase as well as the loop immediately preceding this helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Jeffrey1">[30]</xref>. Comparisons between free CDK2 and CDK2/cyclin A complex structures have shown that the cyclin molecule orients a conserved glutamate residue (Glu51) from the αC-helix of the protein kinase to allow formation of an ion pair with a lysine residue (Lys33) from the conserved VAIK motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Jeffrey1">[30]</xref>, which keeps the CDK2 kinase in a closed conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Similarly, the position of MO25α in the STRADα/MO25α complex is centred on helix αC and the loop preceding this helix (αB region; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The interaction between Glu118 from the αC-helix and Arg100 from the VAIK (VTVR in STRADα) motif (analogous to the Glu51-Lys33 interaction in CDK2) is maintained, albeit via two water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

<p>Another example in which this type of interaction is involved in regulating the activity of protein kinases is the ligand-induced dimerisation of the EGFR family of tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). Although this type of dimer has not been observed in solution, crystal structures and biochemical data demonstrate the importance of dimer formation that involves the intermolecular interaction of the EGFR αC-helix on one monomer and the C-lobe on the other monomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Zhang1">[31]</xref>. A comparison between the structure of active, dimeric EGFR kinase with the monomeric form reveals the role of dimerisation for keeping the EGFR kinase in the closed and active conformation. Similarly, the structure of STRADα in complex with MO25α resembles the closed conformation of both CDK2 and EGFR kinase, with its activation loop and αC-helix positioned in an orientation that is typical of active protein kinases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). Such regulatory mechanism may also explain why some members of the EGFR family of kinases that lack kinase activity and are classified as pseudokinases (Her3) are still able to exert their function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Zhang1">[31]</xref>, despite their “inactivatory” substitutions, similar to what has been observed for STRADα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>The interactions in the EGFR homodimer, the CDK2/cyclin A heterodimer, and the STRADα/MO25α complex are similar only in general topological terms. However, it appears that the mechanism of protein kinase interaction via helix αC with their activity modulators is wider than previously thought, and not exclusive to the CDK family of kinases. Indeed, there are many examples of how protein kinases are stabilised in an active conformation via helix αC. These include members of the MAP kinase family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-White1">[32]</xref>, the AGC family of kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Kannan1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Taylor1">[35]</xref>, and several tyrosine kinases (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Filippakopoulos1">[36]</xref>). Although in these examples the αC-helix is stabilised by flanking N- or C-terminal sequences/domains present in the same polypeptide chain, the mechanisms of allosteric activation are similar.</p>

<title>STRADα ATP Binding Is Markedly Enhanced by MO25α</title>
<p>Although MO25α appears to induce a STRADα active conformation similar to CDK2/cyclin A, the effect of this “active conformation” cannot be measured through ATPase/kinase activity due to STRADα being a pseudokinase. Instead, we investigated how affinity of ATP for STRADα was modulated by its interaction with MO25α. We used the fluorescent ATP analogue 2′,3′-O-2,4,6-trinitrophenyl-ATP (TNP-ATP), whose fluorescence emission is enhanced upon its titration with ATP-binding proteins/enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Hiratsuka1">[37]</xref>, a feature that has previously been exploited to measure equilibrium binding constants of kinases for ATP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Mukherjee1">[4]</xref>. Using this approach, the <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> of STRADα for TNP-ATP in the absence of MO25α was determined to be 1.1 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g005">Figure 5A, 5B, and 5E</xref>). <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> values of STRADα for ATP and ADP were also assessed by their ability to displace bound TNP-ATP and found to be 2–3 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g005">Figure 5C, 5D, and 5E</xref>). Strikingly, addition of an equimolar amount of MO25α to STRADα enhanced binding of TNP-ATP by an order of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g005">Figure 5A, 5B, and 5E</xref>) and TNP-ATP displacement by two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g005">Figure 5C, 5D, and 5E</xref>), indicating significantly stronger affinity compared to the interaction of ATP as a substrate to active kinases. In contrast, the binding of STRADα to TNP-ATP was not enhanced by addition of the MO25α(R227A/M260A) mutant that is unable to bind STRADα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>). The lack of a Mg<sup>2+</sup> binding motif on STRADα suggests that Mg<sup>2+</sup> should not contribute to the STRADα-ATP interaction. Indeed, Mg<sup>2+</sup> did not affect binding of STRADα to TNP-ATP or displacement of TNP-ATP by ATP or ADP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s006">S6</xref>).

<p>It should be noted that although STRADα does not appear to require Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions to bind ATP, most cellular ATP is complexed to Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions. Although there is no space for Mg<sup>2+</sup> to bind in the canonical protein kinase mode through the DFG motif, Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions could reside in the solvent-exposed region of the phosphate moiety, replacing one of the ordered water molecules. Alternatively, it is possible that conformational changes in the structure could accommodate Mg<sup>2+</sup> without affecting the ability of STRADα to bind MO25α (see below). As mentioned previously, the canonical Mg<sup>2+</sup> coordinating residues appear to have been substituted through evolution with positively charged residues (Arg240 and H200), thus making redundant the role of Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions.</p>

<title>ATP Stimulates Binding of STRADα to MO25α</title>

In the absence of ATP, the binding of STRADα for MO25α was fitted to a single-site binding equation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6A and 6E</xref>). From measuring the rate constants for association and dissociation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s007">Figure S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000126.s008">Table S1</xref>), the dissociation constant <italic>K</italic><sub>d</sub> was calculated as 3.8 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6A and 6E</xref>). However, in the presence of ATP, binding could be fitted to a two-site binding equation (Hill slope of 0.4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6A and 6E</xref>). The second binding constant (<italic>K</italic><sub>d2</sub>) was measured as 12 nM, over two orders of magnitude higher than <italic>K</italic><sub>d1</sub> calculated as 2.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6A and 6E</xref>). MgATP enhanced binding of STRADα to MO25α, to a similar extent as ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). These results indicate that binding of ATP to STRADα leads to a high-affinity MO25α interaction site being exposed. Mutation of Met260 in the WEF binding pocket of MO25α did not significantly affect binding of MO25α to STRADα, nor did it influence the effect of ATP at enhancing interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6B and 6E</xref>). It should be noted that this observation contrasts with the data obtained from coexpression studies in 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) and previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>, in which mutation of Met260 inhibits MO25α binding to STRADα, suggesting that the WEF pocket is required for cellular complex assembly of MO25α and STRADα. Mutation of Arg227, in the newly identified concave site of MO25α, which interacts with the αB site of STRADα, virtually abolished binding of STRADα observed by SPR in the absence of ATP. In the presence of ATP or MgATP, no two-site binding of MO25α(R227A) to STRADα was detected, displaying only low micromolar binding with a single site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6C and 6E</xref>). A double MO25α(R227A/M260A) mutant failed to interact with STRADα even in the presence of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>). These results indicate that the key STRADα high-affinity binding site on MO25α lies on the concave surface and is only recognized by STRADα in the presence of ATP. Together with the finding that MO25α also enhances affinity of STRADα for ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g005">Figure 5</xref>), this suggests that the interaction of ATP and MO25α to STRADα is cooperative. A similar synergistic mechanism is observed for the PKA catalytic subunit where a nucleotide analog was shown to stabilise a complex with the PKI inhibitory peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Lew1">[38]</xref>. However, in the case of PKA/PKI interaction the γ-phosphate cannot be transferred because there is no acceptor, whereas in case of STRAD, it cannot be transferred because of the lack of a base catalyst.</p>

<title>ATP and MO25α Are Required for STRADα Activation of LKB1</title>
<p>Having established that ATP increases the affinity of STRADα-MO25α interaction, we next explored whether ATP binding to STRADα also affects assembly and activity of the LKB1 heterotrimeric complex. Using the STRADα-ATP structure, a number of STRADα mutants were designed to disrupt binding of the adenine or phosphate moieties of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Four of these were indeed unable to interact with TNP-ATP in the presence or absence of MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Interestingly, these mutants also affected association with LKB1 when coexpressed in 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), suggesting that binding of ATP to STRADα, in the absence of MO25α, enhances the ability of STRADα to interact with LKB1. However, these mutants were capable of forming complexes with LKB1 when coexpressed with LKB1 and MO25α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), that retained catalytic activity as measured by activation of AMPK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). It is possible that binding of MO25α to these STRADα mutants compensates for their inability to bind ATP, by inducing a closed “active-like” conformation of STRADα, capable of binding and activating LKB1. To explore this idea, we generated mutants of STRADα incapable of binding to both ATP and MO25α. Strikingly, we found that these combined STRADα mutants lost their ability to activate LKB1, despite still being capable of forming a heterotrimeric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g007">Figure 7E</xref>).</p>

<p>Taken together, these observations suggest that the closed “active-like” conformation of STRADα is maintained through binding to ATP and/or MO25α, and is required for activation of LKB1. Mutations that prevent STRADα from binding to ATP or MO25α do not affect activation of LKB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g007">7</xref>), suggesting that ATP binding to STRADα can compensate for loss of MO25α interaction and vice versa. However, loss of both ATP and MO25α binding prevents STRADα from activating LKB1. Such mutations may leave STRADα in the open “inactive-like” conformation incapable of activating LKB1. We have tried unsuccessfully to crystallise STRADα in the absence of MO25α in order to demonstrate this. Binding of ATP to several kinases, including the EGF receptor tyrosine kinase, promotes the closed, active conformation of these enzymes. Moreover, as discussed above, binding of cyclin to CDK2 is reminiscent of the interaction of STRADα with MO25α, and interaction of cyclin A is well known to promote the closed active conformation of CDK2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Jeffrey1">[30]</xref>.</p>

Moreover, STRADα (1–251) failed to interact with or activate LKB1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). These results confirm that the STRADα mutation found in PMSE patients represents a loss-of-function mutation that would be unable to stimulate the LKB1 pathway. This could account for the elevated mTOR pathway activity that was observed in neuronal cells derived from PMSE patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Puffenberger1">[14]</xref>.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>We have described the first structure of the STRADα pseudokinase and its interaction with MO25α, a heterodimeric interaction within the heterotrimer LKB1 tumour suppressor complex. A key discovery is the identification of an unexpected extensive interaction between STRADα and the concave surface of MO25α, previously proposed to harbour a ligand binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Milburn1">[16]</xref>. Armadillo repeat proteins that are structurally related to MO25α, such as PUM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Wang1">[19]</xref>, β-catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Graham1">[17]</xref>, and importin-α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000126-Conti1">[18]</xref>, also bind their macromolecular partners along their concave surface. In general topological terms, the STRADα/MO25α complex resembles the interaction between CDK2 and cyclin A, and the EGFR/EGFR dimer, and provides another example of protein kinase regulatory mechanism via helix αC.</p>
<p>Our data show that, despite lacking most essential catalytic residues, STRADα has maintained its ability to adopt a closed active-like conformation, which binds ATP and possesses an ordered activation loop similar to active protein kinases. This closed conformation is stabilized through binding of ATP and/or MO25α. Moreover, binding of MO25α to STRADα markedly enhances affinity for ATP, and binding of ATP to STRADα stimulates interaction with MO25α. Our findings support a model in which binding of either MO25α or ATP is sufficient to enable STRADα to activate LKB1. Consistent with this, mutant forms of STRADα that are incapable of binding both ATP and MO25α can no longer activate LKB1, whereas mutant forms of STRADα that retain the ability to bind either ATP or MO25α still activate LKB1. Thus, the closed active-like conformation, rather than catalytic phosphoryl transfer activity, is likely to be the key to the mechanism by which STRADα activates the LKB1 tumour suppressor. A model of how STRADα/MO25α might interact and activate LKB1 based on known mutagenesis and structural data is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000126-g009">Figure 9</xref>. Future work may establish other examples of pseudokinases that, like STRADα, regulate signal transduction networks through their conformational state alone.</p>

<title>Model of how STRADα/MO25α might interact and activate LKB1.</title>
<p>The model is based on known mutagenesis and structural data discussed in this paper. Binding of either ATP and/or MO25α to STRADα induces STRADα to adopt a closed conformation, leading to the assembly of a fully active LKB1 complex.</p>

<title>Cloning, Protein Expression, and Purification</title>
<p>A bicistronic expression system was used to coexpress and purify the STRADα/MO25α complex in <italic>E. coli</italic>.

<p>The STRADα/MO25α complex was concentrated to 7.5 mg/ml, followed by addition of ATP to a final concentration of 10 mM and MgCl<sub>2</sub> (final concentration of 1 mM). The sitting drop vapour diffusion method was used to grow crystals by mixing 1 µl of protein solution, 1 µl of mother liquor. For the unmethylated complex, the optimised mother liquor consisted of 20 mM Li<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>, 50 mM sodium citrate (pH 5.6), 6% (v/v) PEG4000. For the methylated complex, the mother liquor was composed of 0.1 M MES (pH 6.4), 10% (v/v) PEG8000. For both conditions, 0.25 µl of 1 M NDSB-256 was added to the crystallisation drop. Rod-shaped crystals of the unmethylated complex appeared after 3 h and grew to 0.05 mm (maximum dimension) after 24 h. The methylated sample yielded bigger crystals that appeared after 24 h and grew to a maximum length of 0.5 mm after 3 d. Crystals were flash frozen in liquid nitrogen after cryoprotection with mother liquor containing 20% (v/v) glycerol (unmethylated) and 25% (v/v) PEG8000 and 10% (v/v) PEG300 (methylated).</p>

Equilibrium constants were also independently calculated from a saturation binding curve, by fitting the measured response (<italic>R</italic>) from specific binding to the following equation: <italic>R</italic> = (<italic>R</italic><sub>max1</sub>[STRAD]/([STRAD]+<italic>K</italic><sub>d1</sub>))+(<italic>R</italic><sub>max2</sub>[STRAD]/([STRAD]+<italic>K</italic><sub>d2</sub>)), where <italic>R</italic><sub>max1</sub> and <italic>R</italic><sub>max2</sub> are the relative maximal changes in response for sites 1 and 2, respectively, and <italic>K</italic><sub>d1</sub> and <italic>K</italic><sub>d2</sub> are the equilibrium dissociation constants for sites 1 and 2, respectively. Dose-response curves for calculating the Hill slope (H) of the data were fitted with the following equation: <italic>R</italic> = minimum+(maximum−minimum)/(1+10<sup>((logEC50−[STRAD])×H)</sup>) using GraphPad-PRISM software.</p>

<p><bold>Isolation of the heterodimeric STRADα/MO25α complex.</bold> (A) Gel filtration profiles of His-STRADα/MO25α coexpressed in <italic>E. coli</italic> and crystallised in this study. The elution profile of separately expressed MO25α monomer as well as the molecular mass standards aldolase (158 kDa), conalbumin (75 kDa), ovalbumin (43 kDa), carbonic anhydrase (29 kDa), and ribonuclease A (13.7 kDa) are also shown. (B) We analysed, by SDS-PAGE, the fractions in which STRADα/MO25α dimer and MO25α monomer were eluted and stained with Coomassie Blue. There is no evidence for large molecular weight aggregates of His-STRADα/MO25α. In the His-STRADα/MO25α purification, a minor low molecular weight eluting shoulder to the main peak was found to consist of mainly uncomplexed His-STRADα. Because His-STRADα was the subunit used for nickel affinity purification of the complex, it will be expected to be present in excess.</p>

(C) The indicated constructs of GST-STRADα and untagged MO25α were expressed in 293 cells. Cells were lysed 36 h posttransfection and GST-STRADα was affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose. The purified GST-STRADα preparation (upper panels), as well as the cell extracts (lower panel), was immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. STRADα R227A mutant, unable to bind MO25α, was used as a control. (D) Wild-type GST-LKB1 and indicated forms of Flag-STRADα and untagged MO25α were cotransfected in 293 cells. Cells 36 h posttransfection were lysed, and GST-LKB1 was affinity purified on glutathione-Sepharose. The purified GST-LKB1 preparations (upper panels), as well as the cell extracts (lower panel), were immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies. (E) Either 0.5 or 1.0 mg of the indicated cell lysates were incubated with 5 µg of the indicated biotinylated peptides conjugated to Streptavidin-Sepharose. Following isolation and washing of the beads, the samples were subjected to SDS-polyacrylamide gel electrophoresis and immunoblotted with the indicated antibodies.

<p><bold>His-tagged STRADα and untagged STRADα bind MO25α with similar affinity.</bold> His-STRADα was treated in the presence or absence of His-TEV protease to remove the 6-His purification tag and then repurified using nickel agarose to remove His-TEV and any uncleaved His-STRADα (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Binding was assessed by SPR analyses where (A) MO25α(WT) (wild type), (B) MO25α(M260A), (C) MO25α(R227A), and (D) MO25α(R227A/M260A) were immobilised to a CM5 sensor chip.
