        <p>The question whether fatty acids can be converted into glucose in humans has a long standing tradition in biochemistry, and the expected answer is “No”. Using recent advances in Systems Biology in the form of large-scale metabolic reconstructions, we reassessed this question by performing a global investigation of a genome-scale human metabolic network, which had been reconstructed on the basis of experimental results. By elementary flux pattern analysis, we found numerous pathways on which gluconeogenesis from fatty acids is feasible in humans. On these pathways, four moles of acetyl-CoA are converted into one mole of glucose and two moles of CO<sub>2</sub>. Analyzing the detected pathways in detail we found that their energetic requirements potentially limit their capacity. This study has many other biochemical implications: effect of starvation, sports physiology, practically carbohydrate-free diets of inuit, as well as survival of hibernating animals and embryos of egg-laying animals. Moreover, the energetic loss associated to the usage of gluconeogenesis from fatty acids can help explain the efficiency of carbohydrate reduced and ketogenic diets such as the Atkins diet.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>That sugar can be converted into fatty acids in humans is a well-known fact. The question whether the reverse direction, i.e., gluconeogenesis from fatty acids, is also feasible has been a topic of intense debate since the end of the 19<sup>th</sup> century. With the discovery of the glyoxylate shunt that allows this conversion in some bacteria, plants, fungi and nematodes it has been considered infeasible in humans since the corresponding enzymes could not be detected. However, by this finding only a single route for gluconeogenesis from fatty acids has been ruled out. To address the question whether there might exist alternative routes in humans we searched for gluconeogenic routes from fatty acids in a metabolic network comprising all reactions known to take place in humans. Thus, we were able to identify several pathways showing that this conversion is indeed feasible. Analyzing evidence concerning the detected pathways lends support to their importance during times of starvation, fasting, carbohydrate reduced and ketogenic diets and other situations in which the nutrition is low on carbohydrates. Moreover, the energetic investment required for this pathway can help to explain the particular efficiency of carbohydrate reduced and ketogenic diets such as the Atkins diet.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>It is well known that excess sugar in the human diet can be converted both into glycerol and fatty acids and, thus, into lipids such as triglycerides. A related question biochemistry students are often asked in their exams is whether the reverse route is also feasible, that is, whether the human body can convert fatty acids back into glucose. As for even-chain fatty acids, the expected answer is “No” (odd-chain fatty acids practically do not occur in mammals). This summarizes the result of a debate that dates back to the late 19th century. However, it was not until the 1950s that such a conversion could be monitored using <sup>14</sup>C labeled fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Weinman1">[1]</xref>. It was found that part of the label arrives at glucose, proving that there is a connected route from acetyl-CoA to glucose. However, as shown mathematically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Weinman1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-deFigueiredo1">[2]</xref>, there cannot be any sustained conversion at steady state along the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle due to stoichiometric constraints. In particular, oxaloacetate would not be balanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). A possible route that does allow this conversion in some prokaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kornberg1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kornberg2">[4]</xref>, plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kornberg3">[5]</xref>, fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Sandeman1">[6]</xref> and nematodes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Liu1">[7]</xref> is the glyoxylate shunt. It produces an additional oxaloacetate, thus balancing this compound (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>). However, the corresponding enzymes have not been found in mammals in spite of controversial speculations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kondrashov1">[8]</xref>. Reports that the glyoxylate shunt would be present in some hibernating animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Davis1">[9]</xref> were not confirmed. In a recent experimental work they have been genetically introduced into mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Dean1">[10]</xref>.</p>

          <p><bold>A</bold> While the conversion of glucose into fatty acids is possible, the product of β-oxidation of even-chain fatty acids, acetyl-CoA, can only enter the TCA cycle by reaction with oxaloacetate to citrate. However, in order to replenish the oxaloacetate consumed in this reaction, the TCA cycle has to be used resulting in the release of two carbon atoms in form of carbon dioxide. Hence, while two carbon atoms enter the TCA cycle in form of acetyl-CoA two others are lost and a net production of oxaloacetate which would be required for gluconeogenesis is not possible. <bold>B</bold> In some organisms the carbon releasing steps of the TCA cycle can be bypassed using the glyoxylate shunt (thick dotted reactions). In consequence, one mole of oxaloacetate can be produced from two mole of acetyl-CoA, allowing for gluconeogenesis from fatty acids. A list of abbreviations can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002116.s001">Table S1</xref>.</p>

      <p>In summary, there is a general consent that carbohydrates cannot be produced from even-chain fatty acids in humans although the opposite conversion is feasible. In consequence, this statement can be found throughout prominent biochemistry textbooks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Lehninger1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Stryer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Voet1">[13]</xref>. It has even been used as a benchmark criterion for the reconstruction of whole-cell metabolic networks in hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Gille1">[14]</xref>. An alternative reconstruction of hepatocyte metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Jerby1">[15]</xref> however, does not use that criterion. This problem is of particular importance with respect to the provision of energy to the brain in situations of drastically reduced carbohydrate uptake. Although the brain can use ketone bodies in these situations, it still needs a certain amount of glucose <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Owen1">[16]</xref>, which has critical implications upon starvation and similar conditions.</p>
      <p>Recently, we re-investigated the problem in question in a small model of human central metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-deFigueiredo1">[2]</xref>. We used the concept of elementary flux modes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Schuster1">[17]</xref>, which allows one to detect all feasible metabolic pathways in small to medium-scale reaction networks. We were able to corroborate the results of Weinman <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Weinman1">[1]</xref>. However, only a small part of metabolism rather than the entire human metabolic network was considered. Hence, alternative potential pathways for gluconeogenesis from fatty acids via acetone, such as those proposed in the 1980s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Argils1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Landau1">[19]</xref> could not be detected. In order to check for the existence of such pathways in a holistic approach, we used the most detailed reconstruction of the human metabolic network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Duarte1">[20]</xref>, which had been reconstructed on the basis of experimental results. Moreover, we employ the concept of elementary flux patterns, which allows an analysis in whole-cell metabolic networks similar to elementary mode analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kaleta1">[21]</xref>. An elementary flux pattern corresponds to a set of reactions within a subsystem of a reaction network that is compatible with feasible pathways through the entire system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Since the entire system is explicitly taken into account, this method allows one to detect all feasible routes on which one compound can be converted into another (for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>). Equipped with this new modeling technique and a genome-scale model of human metabolism, we want to answer the question whether carbohydrates can be produced from fatty acids in humans.</p>

      <p>The question whether fatty acids can be converted into carbohydrates has many biochemical implications: effect of starvation (cf. Owen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Owen1">[16]</xref>), sports physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Goto1">[22]</xref>, the traditional diet of inuit, which is practically carbohydrate-free <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Phinney1">[23]</xref> and high in fish and seal oil. In earlier times, low-carbohydrate diets were also typical for native Americans hunting in the plains. Also the survival of hibernating animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Krilowicz1">[24]</xref> and of embryos of egg-laying animals is crucially dependent on gluconeogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Bate1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, the efficiency of carbohydrate reduced and ketogenic diets such as Atkins diet is worth being studied from this viewpoint. In particular, we will introduce two quantities and compute them for fatty acids and various other storage compounds: gluconeogenic energy efficiency and glucose storage efficiency. The former measure quantifies how much energy in form of ATP is regained if a compound is used for gluconeogenesis and is subsequently catabolized. The latter measure quantifies how much glucose is regained if a compound is produced from glucose and subsequently converted back into glucose.</p>

          <title>Step 1: Elucidating an initial pathway</title>
          <p>In a first step, we checked whether there exists a pathway producing glucose 6-phosphate (G6P) from acetyl-CoA in the network of human metabolism described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Materials and Methods</italic></xref>. This question can be answered by computing the elementary flux pattern of a subsystem just encompassing the inflow reaction of acetyl-CoA and the outflow reaction of G6P. Indeed, we found two elementary flux patterns: one of them contains only the inflow of acetyl-CoA and the other additionally contains the outflow of G6P. The second elementary flux pattern is of special importance since it is a proof of the existence of a pathway in humans that produces G6P from acetyl-CoA, that is, there exists a gluconeogenic route from fatty acids in humans.</p>
          <p>In order to analyze this route in more detail and to determine whether alternative pathways exist, we determined the global pathway connecting acetyl-CoA and G6P using a procedure described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kaleta1">[21]</xref>. Starting from acetyl-CoA, proceeding via several reactions of ketogenesis and acetone degradation, this pathway finally yields pyruvate which is a common gluconeogenic precursor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Strikingly, the pathway proceeds via acetone and is similar to the route which has been put forward in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Argils1">[18]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Landau1">[19]</xref>.</p>

The presented pathway corresponds to the energetically most efficient pathway for the conversion of fatty acids into glucose (pathway 7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002116.s002">Text S1</xref>). A similarly efficient pathway, pathway 14, uses almost the same route but converts acetol directly into methylglyoxal by reduction with NADPH.

        <title>Pathways for gluconeogenesis from fatty acids</title>
        <p>Overall we detected nine possible pathways for the conversion of acetyl-CoA into mitochondrial acetoacetate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002116.s002">Text S1</xref>). In acetone degradation we identified 58 possible pathways.</p>
        <p>In addition to the work of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kalapos1">[26]</xref> in which acetone metabolism was reviewed, we identified a new intermediate of acetone metabolism, D-lactaldehyde, which is used in 14 out of the 58 pathways. This metabolite can be produced from either methylglyoxal or lactoyl-glutathione, an intermediate in the conversion of methylglyoxal to D-lactate. The conversion of methylglyoxal to D-lactaldehyde is catalyzed by an aldo-keto reductase or by a glyoxylate reductase. Aldo-keto reductase is only weakly expressed in the liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Jagt1">[27]</xref>. Thus, this pathway might be of greater importance in other tissues. Another important point is the import of pyruvate into mitochondria. Pyruvate can be either directly imported into the mitochondrion or indirectly via a lactate shuttle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Brooks1">[28]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). We will not consider the indirect import since its importance is disputed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Yoshida1">[29]</xref>. Therefore, only 22 pathways for the conversion of acetol into pyruvate remain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002116.s002">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>One important feature of the described pathways is that many of them involve the reduction of NAD<sup>+</sup> or oxidation of NADPH. Overall, 1–3 moles of NADPH are oxidized and 0–4 moles of NAD<sup>+</sup> are reduced during the conversion of one mole of acetone into pyruvate (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002116.s002">Text S1</xref>). Special emphasis can be put on the oxidation of methylglyoxal to pyruvate. In this case, one mole of NADP<sup>+</sup> can be reduced leading to pathways in which the net balance in oxidized NADPH is only one (pathways 7 and 14, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). Pathways not using this reaction have a net balance of at least two moles of NADPH oxidized. As discussed below, these requirements on the reduction potential impose constraints on the utilization of gluconeogenic routes from fatty acids.</p>

        <title>Comparison to other pathway detection techniques</title>
        <p>Besides the concept of elementary flux patterns, other techniques to determine pathways in genome-scale metabolic networks exist. Among the most widely used techniques is flux balance analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Varma1">[30]</xref> that allows one to identify physiologically feasible fluxes within a metabolic network that optimize a certain objective function. While a single pathway for the conversion of fatty acids in gluconeogenesis can be obtained with this method, a systematic identification of all possible pathways is not possible.</p>
        <p>Another frequently used tool is elementary flux mode analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Schuster1">[17]</xref> that allows one to enumerate all physiological feasible flux distributions in a metabolic network. However, the number of extreme pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Schilling1">[31]</xref>, a subset of the elementary flux modes, is estimated to be 10<sup>29</sup> for the human genome-scale network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Yeung1">[32]</xref>, which makes the full enumeration of all the elementary flux modes impossible. Nevertheless, recently two approaches to enumerate subsets of elementary flux modes with increasing number of reactions have been developed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-deFigueiredo2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Rezola1">[34]</xref>.

        <title>Evidence for gluconeogenesis from fatty acids</title>
        <p>We performed a global survey of gluconeogenic routes from fatty acids in human metabolism using a genome-scale metabolic model and elementary flux pattern analysis. Even though prominent biochemistry textbook negate the existence of such a route in mammals and humans in particular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Lehninger1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Stryer1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Voet1">[13]</xref>, we were able to confirm several routes that have been proposed earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Argils1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Landau1">[19]</xref>. Additionally, we were able to identify 14 new pathways that proceed via a new intermediate in acetone metabolism, D-lactaldehyde. These results further underline the utility of elementary flux pattern analysis in assessing the metabolic capabilities of organisms.</p>
        <p>Gluconeogenesis becomes important when the glucose level in the body cannot be sustained by the glycogen store in the liver, which is sufficient for up to one day in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Owen1">[16]</xref>. Such a situation arises, for instance, during starvation, fasting, prolonged physical exercise, upon carbohydrate-reduced and ketogenic diets like Atkins diet as well as in hibernating animals. In addition to glucogenic amino acids from proteins, the glycerol component of lipids can be converted into glucose while fatty acids serve as principal metabolites to fuel oxidative phosphorylation. In prolonged starvation, not only muscular protein but also proteins essential for the maintenance of principal body functions are broken down to serve for gluconeogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Owen1">[16]</xref>. However, there is obviously a limit to such protein degradation.</p>
        <p>While the principal fuel of the brain under normal conditions is glucose, in starvation, the brain starts using ketone bodies in addition to reduced consumption of glucose. The increase of the production of ketone bodies leads to rising levels of acetoacetate, which is constantly decarboxylated into acetone. For example, in 21 days fasted humans, 37% of the acetoacetate is converted into acetone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Reichard1">[35]</xref>. The putative enzyme catalyzing this reaction, acetoacetate decarboxylase, has been characterized in terms of catalytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-vanStekelenburg1">[36]</xref> and inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-LpezSoriano1">[37]</xref>, but has not yet been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kalapos1">[26]</xref>. 2–30% of acetone is excreted via the urine and breath <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Reichard1">[35]</xref>, while the remainder is metabolized further and could account for up to 11% of gluconeogenesis during starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Reichard1">[35]</xref>. Glucose formation from acetone was indeed suggested as an explanation for the finding that common gluconeogenic precursors alone could not fully account for renal gluconeogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Owen1">[16]</xref>. Additional supporting evidences come from the increased activity of cytochrome P450 (Cyp2e1), an enzyme essential in the presented pathways, during starvation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Johansson1">[38]</xref> and the observation that increased survival time of obese rats during starvation correlates with the activity of acetone metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Coleman1">[39]</xref>. Moreover, increased levels of methylglyoxal, an intermediate of some of the gluconeogenic routes from fatty acids, have been observed in subjects on the carbohydrate reduced Atkins diet during which ketogenesis is particularly active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Beisswenger1">[40]</xref>. Thus, these pathways play an important role in gluconeogenesis also in other situations like the ones mentioned in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> in which ketogenesis is particular active. In hibernating animals, for example, protein may be saved by not using it as the only source for gluconeogenesis. This hypothesis is confirmed by recent results in which it was found that Cyp2e1 and phosphoenolpyruvate carboxykinase (Pck1), both enzymes within the described pathways, are significantly (p = 0.005) upregulated in the liver of hibernating black bears (FoldChange 5.990 and 13.17, respectively) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Fedorov1">[41]</xref>. In a more recent work, also Pck1 (FC = 10.7) and Pc (FC = 2.62) were found to be upregulated in the liver of the animals during hibernation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Fedorov2">[42]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Limited capacity of gluconeogenesis from fatty acids</title>
        <p>Important aspects related to the presented pathways are energetic requirements that constrain their capacity. Experimental investigation of the gluconeogenic role of acetone showed differences in its utilization between species: the net synthesis of glucose from acetone as observed in murine hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kalapos2">[43]</xref> does not seem to occur in perfused rat liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Gavino1">[44]</xref>. Instead, net synthesis from acetone could be demonstrated in either case when also other gluconeogenic substrates were given <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kalapos2">[43]</xref>. This can be explained by the increased requirement for NADPH in the conversion of acetone to pyruvate. Each possible pathway requires the oxidation of at least two moles of NADPH (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). However, there are only two pathways which reduce the net balance in NADPH to-1 moles by the direct conversion of methylglyoxal to pyruvate (pathways 7 and 14, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). During gluconeogenesis, cytosolic pathways for the replenishment of NADPH are impaired since they would further deplete gluconeogenic metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Thurman1">[45]</xref>. In fact, NADPH has to be supplied from mitochondrial sources and its availability represents the rate-limiting factor in acetone metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Coleman1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Bondoc1">[46]</xref>.</p>
        <p>There are two known pathways of NADPH replenishment from mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Thurman1">[45]</xref>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). One of them involves the transport of mitochondrial NADPH into the cytosol and the other the transfer of electrons from mitochondrial NADH to cytosolic NADP<sup>+</sup>. The direct transport from the mitochondrion involves a citrate∶oxoglutarate shuttle. Since both metabolites are intermediates of the TCA cycle, they would potentially reduce mitochondrial fatty acid oxidation when used for this shuttle system. The other pathway of NADPH replenishment uses a route via cytosolic malic enzyme, which decarboxylates malate to pyruvate. Both metabolites are intermediates of gluconeogenesis from acetone. Hence, each oxidized NADPH would require an additional cycle in the conversion of pyruvate to malate. Each of these cycles involves the hydrolysis of one ATP to ADP and the oxidation of one NADH. Especially pathways 7 and 14 in the conversion of acetol to pyruvate are of interest since they only require a net consumption of one mole of NADPH per mole of pyruvate produced. Thus, only a single pyruvate-malate cycle would be necessary to balance NADPH consumption. Since there are several possible pathways in acetone metabolism, there might be species differences in the principal pathways which are used for acetone degradation.</p>

        <p>Another reason for the limited capacity of the pathways in question is that several of their intermediates, such as methylglyoxal and acetone, are toxic in higher or even moderate concentrations. Thus, the organisms can use these pathways only to a limited extent. A further limiting factor may arise if the decarboxylation of acetoacetate indeed proceeds spontaneously. As it had been observed that Caucasian people can adapt to the diet of inuit within about three weeks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Phinney1">[23]</xref>, the limitation in capacity of these pathways is likely to get less severe over time, probably due to induction of specific enzymes along those pathways.</p>

        <title>Energetic characteristics of gluconeogenesis from fatty acids</title>
        <p>We investigated the energetic requirements of the presented pathways in terms of ATP consumption under the assumption that all other metabolites, including NADPH and NADH need to be balanced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g006">Fig. 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002116.s002">Text S1</xref>).

However, since the mitochondrial NADH concentration is already high during ketogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kalapos3">[47]</xref>, pathway 14 might be more favorable because even two moles of cytosolic NADH are reduced on this pathway.

        <title>Gluconeogenic energy efficiency and glucose storage efficiency of fatty acids</title>
        <p>In order to analyze the role of the described pathways during prolonged starvation and fasting, we computed for amino acids, fatty acids, lactate and glycerol how much energy in form of ATP is regained in the net balance if they are used for gluconeogenesis and subsequently catabolized.

        <p>Gluconeogenic energy efficiency and glucose storage efficiencies of a selected list of compounds are displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>. We found that 53–74% of the energy remains if fatty acids are used for gluconeogenesis using the most efficient and most inefficient pathways, respectively (pathways 7 and 20). Thus, 26–47% of the energy contained in fatty acids is lost if they are used for gluconeogenesis. For glucogenic amino acids, in contrast, the energy loss is much smaller; the gluconeogenic energy efficiency is in the range from 73% (leucine)–96% (valine) with a value of 87% for the amino acid composition of a typical dietary protein. For glycerol, the gluconeogenic energy efficiency is 95%. These values can explain the particular efficiency of carbohydrate reduced and ketogenic diets like Atkins diet for weight reduction. The reason is likely to be the increased energy loss of gluconeogenesis from fatty acids and ketogenic amino acids in comparison to gluconeogenesis from glucogenic amino acids. Indeed, intermediates of the pathway for gluconeogenesis from fatty acids have been observed in subjects on the Atkins diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Beisswenger1">[40]</xref>. This is also supported by the observation that the traditional diet of inuit does not lead to obesity in spite of the high content in fat. In contrast, new dietary habits of inuit implying a higher consumption in carbohydrates often lead to obesity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kuhnlein1">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Comparing the glucose storage efficiency of the described compounds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g006">Fig. 6B</xref>), we find fatty acids, using pathway 7, at the lower end with a storage efficiency of 50% in comparison to 39% for glycine, 78% for alanine and 86% for glycerol. Hence, the conversion of glucose to fatty acids and gluconeogenesis from fatty acids results in a loss of half of the glucose. These values show that fatty acids are not very well suited as glucose storage since their use as such is associated to a higher loss of glucose equivalents of carbohydrates in comparison to glycerol and amino acids that are the major carbohydrate storage compounds besides glycogen. Nevertheless, as discussed above, the utilization of fatty acids as glucose storage gives the body additional flexibility in the utilization of its storage compounds and appears to be used as such in situations during which gluconeogenesis is active. Moreover, both quantities can be useful for examining the effect of caloric restriction on ageing which is known to extend life span in a large number of organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kennedy1">[49]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Summarizing our findings, it can be concluded that a thorough, systematic and detailed in-silico investigation of the stoichiometrically feasible routes from fatty acids to glucose based on an experimentally corroborated genome-scale metabolic network provides new insight into human metabolism under glucose limitation. It confirms earlier, anecdotal evidence and hypotheses about gluconeogenesis from fatty acids via acetone and provides hitherto unrecognized pathways for that conversion. This provides a plausible explanation for the surprising independence from nutritional carbohydrates over certain periods (e.g. upon the low-carbohydrate diet of inuit, in hibernating animals and embryos of egg-laying animals). Moreover, we provided a detailed analysis of the energetic balance of these pathways, which explains their limited capacity and their contribution to the particular efficiency of carbohydrate reduced and ketogenic diets.</p>

        <p>Elementary flux patterns have been introduced as a new theoretical tool for the analysis of metabolic pathways in genome-scale metabolic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kaleta1">[21]</xref>. Within a subsystem of metabolism, that is, a set of reactions of interest, elementary flux patterns correspond to basic route through that subsystem that are compatible with steady-state fluxes through the entire network. Thus, every elementary flux pattern is associated to at least one steady-state flux of the entire system and corresponds to the set of reactions used by this steady-state flux in the subsystem. The property of elementarity in the definition of elementary flux pattern requires that no elementary flux pattern can be written as set union of other elementary flux patterns. A formal definition will be provided next.</p>
        <p>Given the stoichiometric matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of a reaction network we assume for simplicity that the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reactions make up the subsystem of interest. A flux pattern <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined as a set of reactions within the subsystem that is compatible with at least one steady-state flux <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the entire system. Hence, a set of reaction indices <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is called a flux pattern if there exists at least one flux vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that fulfills the following conditions:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Furthermore, we call a flux pattern elementary if this set of reactions cannot be written as set union, of other flux patterns. For more details see Kaleta <italic>et al</italic> (2009).</p>

        <title>Pathway detection using elementary flux patterns</title>
        <p>Elementary flux patterns can be used to elucidate all possible pathways consuming a certain compound and producing another. This process builds upon a successive expansion of the subsystem under study to reactions that belong to alternative pathways. It will be outlined by way of a small example network comprising glycolysis and the pentose phosphate pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Within this system we want to find all pathways producing ribose-5-phosphate (R5P), a precursor of histidine and nucleotide syntheses from glucose (Glc).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We start with a subsystem encompassing the inflow reaction of Glc and the outflow of R5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>). Two elementary flux patterns are found. One of them only contains the inflow reaction of Glc and the other the inflow of Glc as well as the outflow of R5P. The first elementary flux pattern indicates the existence of a pathway consuming Glc at steady state without using the outflow of R5P. This corresponds to the glycolytic pathway producing glycerol-3-phosphate (G3P) which is subsequently drained from the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Fig. 8C</xref>). The other flux pattern corresponds to a pathway producing R5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Fig. 8B</xref>). Since we found no elementary flux pattern containing the outflow of R5P without the inflow of Glc we can conclude that the inflow reaction is required for the production of R5P. Otherwise we would have obtained a second elementary flux pattern containing only the outflow of R5P.</p>
        <p>Next, we need to determine an elementary mode through the entire system using exactly the reactions of the elementary flux pattern in the subsystem. Such an elementary mode can be obtained using linear programming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Kaleta1">[21]</xref>. This elementary mode corresponds to a first pathway for the production of R5P from Glc. From this initial pathway it is possible to deduce reactions that are essential for the conversion of R5P to Glc (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002116.s002">Text S1</xref> for more details). Thus, we find that in addition to the inflow of Glc, the conversion of Glc to glucose-6-phosphate (G6P) and the conversion of ribulose-5-phosphate (Ru5P) to R5P are required for production of R5P at steady state. The knowledge of essential reactions can simplify the analysis in two ways. First, we do not need to include essential reactions into the subsequent subsystems since every pathway producing R5P will use them anyway. Second, if we find several sequences of essential reactions the task of searching for pathways can be split into sub-tasks. Each sub-task then consists in the search for a pathway connecting a product of a sequence of essential reactions and the educt of the next sequence of essential reactions.</p>
        <p>In order to determine reactions that belong to alternative pathways, we include the reactions of the first detected pathway into the subsystem of the next step. As noted above, we need not to add essential reactions and consequently, the subsystem of the second step comprises three reactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Fig. 8D</xref>): the inflow of glucose, the conversion of G6P to Ru5P and the outflow of R5P. This subsystem gives rise to three elementary flux patterns. One of them contains the inflow of G6P and the outflow of R5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Fig. 8E</xref>). This elementary flux pattern corresponds to a pathway for the production of R5P. This flux pattern is associated to an elementary mode that also uses reactions that do not belong to the subsystem (and are not essential reactions). Hence, we have identified reactions that belong to an alternative route. These reactions are subsequently added to the subsystem of the third step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Fig. 8F</xref>). In this subsystem we find eight elementary flux patterns, two of which contain the outflow of R5P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g008">Figs. 8G and 8H</xref>). Determining the elementary modes associated to these elementary flux patterns, we find that both use only reactions that are either essential for the pathway or belong to the subsystem. Thus, we have identified all pathways producing R5P from Glc. These pathways correspond to the elementary modes associated to each of the two flux patterns containing the outflow of R5P.</p>

        <title>Pathway detection using elementary flux modes</title>
        <p>We computed the 100 shortest elementary flux modes producing glucose 6-phosphate from acetyl-CoA using a previously described method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-deFigueiredo2">[33]</xref>. This method allows one to enumerate elementary flux modes with increasing number of reactions. The entire set of elementary flux modes cannot be computed for the genome-scale metabolic network of humans since their number is too large <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Yeung1">[32]</xref>. For the computation we set the metabolites H<sub>2</sub>O, CO<sub>2</sub>, Pi, Ppi, protons, O<sub>2</sub>, ATP, ADP, AMP, GTP, GDP, NADH, NAD<sup>+</sup>, NADPH, NADP<sup>+</sup>, coenzyme A and HCO<sub>3</sub><sup>+</sup> to external status to obtain elementary flux modes differing in the underlying carbon conversion pathway rather than in co-factor balancing reactions.</p>

        <title>Calculation of Gibbs free energy changes</title>
        <p>We calculated the Gibbs free-energy changes of the described pathways. We performed these calculations for two scenarios: gluconeogenesis from acetyl-CoA and from palmitate. For the first scenario, we assumed that additionally to the energetic balance as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002116-g006">Fig. <bold>6</bold></xref> four moles of acetyl-CoA are converted into one mole of glucose, four moles of coenzyme A and two moles of carbon dioxide. For the second scenario, we assumed that biosynthesis starts from 0.5 moles of palmitate yielding an additional 3.5 moles of NADH as well as FADH and hydrolyzing one mole of ATP through β-oxidation of fatty acids. We calculated the Gibbs free energy change by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to the Gibbs free energy of formation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the universal gas constant, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the temperature, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the stoichiometric coefficient of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>th product and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the stoichiometric coefficient of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002116.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>th substrate of the pathway. We assumed a pH-value of 7.2 and a temperature of 37°C. We used measured Gibbs free-energy of formation when available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Alberty1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Thauer1">[51]</xref> and estimated values otherwise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002116-Jankowski1">[52]</xref>.
