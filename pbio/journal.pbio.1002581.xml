<abstract>
<p>Although cancers are considered stem cell diseases, mechanisms involving stem cell alterations are poorly understood. Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) is the second most common lung cancer, and its pathogenesis appears to hinge on changes in the stem cell behavior of basal cells in the bronchial airways. Basal cells are normally quiescent and differentiate into mucociliary epithelia. Smoking triggers a hyperproliferative response resulting in progressive premalignant epithelial changes ranging from squamous metaplasia to dysplasia. These changes can regress naturally, even with chronic smoking. However, for unknown reasons, dysplasias have higher progression rates than earlier stages. We used primary human tracheobronchial basal cells to investigate how copy number gains in <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> at 3q26-28, which co-occur in dysplasia and are observed in 94% of SQCCs, may promote progression. We find that SOX2 cooperates with PI3K signaling, which is activated by smoking, to initiate the squamous injury response in basal cells. This response involves <italic>SOX9</italic> repression, and, accordingly, SOX2 and PI3K signaling levels are high during dysplasia, while SOX9 is not expressed. By contrast, during regeneration of mucociliary epithelia, PI3K signaling is low and basal cells transiently enter a SOX2<sup>Lo</sup>SOX9<sup>Hi</sup> state, with SOX9 promoting proliferation and preventing squamous differentiation. Transient reduction in SOX2 is necessary for ciliogenesis, although SOX2 expression later rises and drives mucinous differentiation, as SOX9 levels decline. Frequent coamplification of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> in dysplasia may, thus, promote progression by locking basal cells in a SOX2<sup>Hi</sup>SOX9<sup>Lo</sup> state with active PI3K signaling, which sustains the squamous injury response while precluding normal mucociliary differentiation. Surprisingly, we find that, although later in invasive carcinoma SOX9 is generally expressed at low levels, its expression is higher in a subset of SQCCs with less squamous identity and worse clinical outcome. We propose that early pathogenesis of most SQCCs involves stabilization of the squamous injury state in stem cells through copy number gains at 3q, with the pro-proliferative activity of SOX9 possibly being exploited in a subset of SQCCs in later stages.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) is a deadly and common form of lung cancer. How it develops from stem cells is poorly understood. SQCCs predominantly arise in bronchial epithelia, likely from basal cells, stem cells that normally generate mucinous and ciliated cells. Smoking, however, causes normally quiescent basal cells to proliferate and generate protective squamous epithelia. Continuous smoking eventually causes precancerous changes and, ultimately, SQCC. However, some precancerous changes regress to normal epithelia, suggesting that the natural stem cell injury response is not sustainable indefinitely. Here, we describe how the SOX2 transcription factor and PI3K signaling, which is activated by smoking, induce the squamous injury response in basal cells. We also provide evidence that regeneration of mucociliary epithelia after injury requires basal cells to enter a period of low SOX2 expression and PI3K signaling. Ninety-four percent of SQCCs have copy number gains in chromosome 3 that affect <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, a catalytic PI3K subunit. These gains occur at a point when precancerous tissue has an increased likelihood of progressing to SQCC. Our data suggest that SQCC is genetically initiated by events that sustain a normally self-limiting injury state, which forces stem cells to proliferate indefinitely in the presence of smoking-associated mutagens.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It has been suggested that most cancers arise from normal stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref002">2</xref>]. Mounting evidence supports this being the case for certain leukemias, in which stem cell/progenitor-specific mechanisms are emerging that involve blocks in differentiation and enhanced self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref004">4</xref>]. However, for many carcinomas, it has been challenging to elucidate similar mechanisms, as the normal stem cell biology of many tissues is not well characterized. Thus, to a large extent, the mechanisms through which human stem cells are transformed are poorly understood.</p>
<p>Lung cancer is the worldwide leading cause of cancer mortality [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref005">5</xref>], and, in general, pathogenesis of all types is poorly understood. Squamous cell carcinoma (SQCC) is the second most common form [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref006">6</xref>], and its pathogenesis appears to depend on a critical change in the behavior of the stem cells from which the disease likely initiates. Most SQCCs arise in the bronchial epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref007">7</xref>], which is part of a contiguous epithelium that extends from the nasopharynx through the trachea and bronchi. The major cell types include basal, ciliated, and secretory/mucinous cells, with basal cells being the stem cells for these lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref012">12</xref>]. Basal cells are also thought to be the main origin for SQCCs because virtually all SQCCs express basal cell markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref015">15</xref>]. Under homeostatic conditions, most cells in the epithelium are quiescent, with only 1% cycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref016">16</xref>]. However, vitamin A deficiency, denudation, or smoking—the greatest SQCC risk factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref018">18</xref>]—induces a stereotypical metaplastic response in basal cells, which causes replacement of the mucociliary epithelium with a hyperproliferative squamous epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref026">26</xref>]. This response is reversible, as vitamin A resupplementation or injury/smoking cessation restores mucociliary differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref027">27</xref>]. Many squamous metaplasias also regress in chronic active smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref030">30</xref>], suggesting that the squamous response cannot naturally be maintained indefinitely.</p>
<p>Longitudinal studies have shown, however, that some squamous metaplasias progress to SQCC in a stepwise manner through low and high grade dysplasia and through carcinoma in situ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref031">31</xref>]. Although low grade dysplasias regress at a high rate, high grade dysplasia and carcinoma in situ mark a different phase of progression, as these later stages have more genetic alterations, lower rates of regression, and higher rates of progression to SQCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref036">36</xref>]. Thus, SQCCs appear to arise through phenotypic progression of the squamous injury response, with genetic events possibly stabilizing a dysregulated injury state and preventing regression. One of the earliest genetic events is <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification, which is common in high grade dysplasias and is associated with greater progression to SQCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref040">40</xref>]. Ultimately, <italic>SOX2</italic> copy number gains are found in 94% of SQCCs (54% amplification/40% lower copy number gain only, provisional TCGA (The Cancer Genome Atlas) data, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref042">42</xref>]. Although several studies support <italic>SOX2</italic> being a driver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref044">44</xref>], it resides in a broad amplicon spanning 3q26-28, which includes other oncogenes such as <italic>PIK3CA</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref042">42</xref>]. How <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification may specifically promote progression of premalignant squamous lesions at the expense of mucociliary differentiation is a mystery, especially considering its wide-ranging roles in a variety of stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Although there have been several attempts to genetically model SQCC pathogenesis in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref051">51</xref>], it is unclear to what extent these models faithfully recapitulate human disease pathogenesis, and a stem cell-based mechanism is still lacking. In all cases, which included functionally distinct drivers such as <italic>Sox2</italic> overexpression, <italic>Pten</italic> loss, and <italic>Kras</italic> mutation, <italic>Lkb1</italic> inactivation was necessary for SQCC generation, and in one model, SQCC was generated in distal airways through transdifferentiation of adenocarcinoma (ADC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref050">50</xref>]. However, in human lung cancer, <italic>LKB1</italic> DNA alterations are infrequent in SQCCs and more common in ADCs (3% of SQCCs and 19% of ADCs, provisional TCGA data, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref052">52</xref>], and SQCCs generally do not arise in distal airways. These findings question whether differences between human and mouse airway epithelia affect mechanisms of SQCC pathogenesis. Indeed, although in the murine tracheal epithelium, basal cells are stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref012">12</xref>], 50% of their progeny are club cells (previously known as Clara cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref053">53</xref>]. Club cells are secretory cells that are the major stem cell population in the bronchiolar epithelium, but they can also contribute to renewal in the tracheal epithelium, especially after injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref055">55</xref>]. However, in human bronchial epithelia, the main site of SQCC carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref007">7</xref>], club cells are not found (although they are found in human bronchiolar epithelia) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref056">56</xref>]; instead, there are many more mucinous cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>We thus modeled SQCC pathogenesis in the putative stem cell origin of the disease, using primary human tracheobronchial basal cell cultures. These cultured human basal cells regenerate normal ciliated and mucinous lineages when grown in denuded rat tracheal xenografts or on porous filters in air-liquid-interface (ALI) cultures, where they are fed basolaterally and apically exposed to air [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref062">62</xref>]. In ALI cultures, differentiated epithelia recapitulate in vivo ultrastructure and functional properties, including mucous production, ion transport, bacterial defense, and movement of airway surface liquid by cilia. Using these cultures, we describe a mechanism by which <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification and PI3K signaling cooperate to stabilize a hyperproliferative stem cell injury state that promotes squamous metaplasia at the expense of normal mucociliary differentiation. This mechanism potentially explains selection of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> coamplification during SQCC pathogenesis and how it may promote progression of high-grade dysplasias by altering the behavior of stem cells.</p>

<title>In Normal Quiescent Mucociliary Epithelia, Tracheobronchial Basal Cells Express Similar Levels of SOX2 as SQCCs</title>

<title>During Regeneration of Mucociliary Epithelia, SOX2 Levels Transiently Decline</title>
<p>The similar levels of <italic>SOX2</italic> expression between basal cells in normal mucociliary epithelia and <italic>SOX2</italic>-amplified SQCCs raise several considerations. First, at some point during SQCC progression, <italic>SOX2</italic> promoter activity may decline, necessitating amplification to sustain high levels of expression. Second, because amplification would be expected to raise expression of a driver to levels higher than in the normal cell of origin, if SOX2 is, indeed, a driver, there should be a period during SQCC pathogenesis when SOX2 is expressed at lower levels in normal basal cells. However, this period may not have been captured in our snapshot analysis of healthy tracheobronchial epithelium. Notably, SQCCs do not spontaneously arise in healthy epithelia, but do arise after years of smoking, and <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification is commonly detected in dysplasia, in which it is associated with a higher rate of progression to SQCC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref040">40</xref>]. These data suggest that a decline in SOX2 expression may be part of the mechanism of regenerating mucociliary epithelia following injury, and that <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification may be selected to counteract this decline and, hence, prevent regression.</p>
<p>To determine if SOX2 expression varies during mucociliary differentiation, we used ALI cultures. Although in denuded tracheas, basal cells first undergo squamous differentiation before regenerating mucociliary epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref020">20</xref>], ALI culture conditions, which include retinoic acid, promote mucociliary differentiation without a prior phase of squamous metaplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref058">58</xref>]. Thus, these cultures can be used to study basal cells as they synchronously undergo mucociliary differentiation. To establish such cultures, we first isolated basal cells from normal tracheobronchial tissue and expanded them on plastic dishes in an undifferentiated state. We confirmed that these plastic cultures consisted only of basal cells by quantifying basal cell lineage marker expression (TP63 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref064">64</xref>], KRT5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref065">65</xref>], and CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref066">66</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s007">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>). They also retained stem cell activity, as evidenced by morphological and molecular differentiation into mucinous (MUC16+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref067">67</xref>]) and ciliated (FOXJ1+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref068">68</xref>]) cells when placed in ALI culture and denuded rat tracheal xenografts (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s007">S2C</xref>). During expansion on plastic, <italic>SOX2</italic> expression dramatically declined relative to the quiescent state in normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, “vector” plastic cultures). This low level of <italic>SOX2</italic> expression persisted during the early proliferative phase of ALI culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). However, during mucociliary differentiation after the onset of quiescence, SOX2 expression in ALI culture returned to normal tissue levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">Fig 1B–1D</xref>). Thus, in ALI culture, a SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> state precedes mucociliary differentiation. Based on these data, we re-examined SOX2 expression in native human tracheobronchial tissue to see if SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> cells might also be present in vivo. By immunohistochemistry (IHC), rare SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> basal cells were present in mucociliary epithelia, and appeared to be enriched in non-columnar areas, which could be undergoing mucociliary differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). We confirmed that these SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> cells were, indeed, basal cells by costaining for the basal cell marker KRT5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s006">S1C Fig</xref>). Thus, <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification could prevent regression of dysplasias by preventing generation of a SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> state that might be necessary for normal mucociliary differentiation.</p>

<title>Precocious SOX2 Expression in Proliferating Basal Cells Induces Hyperproliferative Squamous Metaplasia and Inhibits Ciliogenesis</title>
<p>To investigate whether precocious SOX2 expression, which would be caused by <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification, affects mucociliary differentiation, we expressed SOX2 in proliferating basal cell ALI cultures before its normal time of expression. <italic>SOX2</italic> was expressed from a lentiviral vector at the same mRNA levels seen in normal native tissue and <italic>SOX2</italic>-amplified SQCCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, Lenti-SOX2). Proliferating basal cells were infected on plastic dishes overnight, seeded subconfluently into ALI cultures, and differentiated over 5 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Histological analyses of the 5-wk cultures indicated that precocious SOX2 expression enhanced mucinous differentiation and induced squamous metaplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Lenti-SOX2 induced ectopic gland-like structures that were confirmed mucinous by periodic acid-Schiff (PAS) reactivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). It also increased MUC16 expression relative to control cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), wherein endogenous SOX2 expression was naturally correlated with MUC16 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). Although MUC16+ cells have been noted in the tracheal epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref067">67</xref>], we now show that these cells do not express the canonical goblet cell marker MUC5AC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>) and, hence, are a distinct subtype of mucinous lineage that is induced by SOX2.</p>

<p>Although squamous differentiation is normally suppressed in ALI cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref058">58</xref>], Lenti-SOX2 induced squamous metaplasia in some epithelial regions, as evidenced by histological stratification and expression of high molecular weight keratins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), which are normally abundant in upper layers of squamous, but not columnar, epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref069">69</xref>].

<p>Precocious SOX2 expression also affected ciliogenesis. In ALI culture, Lenti-SOX2 reduced the number of ciliated cells, as evidenced by fewer BTUB4-expressing cells, and decreased <italic>FOXJ1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Given that SOX2 expression is ultimately seen in ciliated cells (e.g., <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s006">S1B Fig</xref>), there appears to be an early period when SOX2 levels must be below a certain threshold for ciliated cell fate commitment to occur. Notably, by the time control epithelia had completed mucociliary differentiation, they expressed similar levels of SOX2 as Lenti-SOX2-transduced epithelia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g003">Fig 3J</xref>). This finding supports squamous metaplasia in ALI culture being driven by an alteration in the timing of SOX2 expression rather than by supraphysiologic levels, and suggests that distinct cellular contexts (e.g., associated with proliferation versus quiescence) may alter the stem cell response to similar levels of SOX2.</p>

<title>PI3K Signaling Is Necessary for the Squamous Response to SOX2</title>
<p>Since squamous metaplasia is not observed in ALI cultures when SOX2 levels naturally rise after quiescence but occurs if SOX2 is precociously expressed during the proliferative phase of culture, a signal associated with this phase may cooperate with SOX2 to induce the squamous response. Cigarette smoke extract and nicotine induce activation of AKT, a downstream effector of PI3K signaling, in tracheobronchial basal cell cultures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref073">73</xref>], and PI3K signaling is elevated in dysplasias when <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification is common [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref077">77</xref>]. Furthermore, AKT can phosphorylate SOX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref078">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref079">79</xref>], and <italic>PIK3CA</italic>, which encodes the p110α catalytic subunit of PI3K, is in the 3q amplicon, with gains co-occurring in 99% of SQCCs with <italic>SOX2</italic> gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref042">42</xref>]. To investigate the role of PI3K signaling in squamous differentiation, we first examined its activity in proliferating versus quiescing basal cell cultures. To assess PI3K signaling, we initially focused on phosphorylation of the S6 ribosomal subunit on sites regulated by a PI3K-mTOR-S6 kinase axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref080">80</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref082">82</xref>]. In control ALI cultures, P-S6 was high during the proliferative SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> phase but declined at initial confluence, before SOX2 levels normally rise and mucociliary differentiation occurs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g004">4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">1C and 1D</xref> for SOX2 expression). Nuclear accumulation of phospho-Thr308-AKT, which is PI3K-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref083">83</xref>], tracked with P-S6 and provided additional evidence that PI3K signaling is more active in proliferating rather than quiescing basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Consistent with the ALI data, P-S6 and nuclear P-AKT staining were also low in basal cells of quiescent native tracheal epithelia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s008">S3 Fig</xref>). Thus, PI3K signaling is specifically active during the period when SOX2 levels are normally low and precocious SOX2 expression causes later manifestation of squamous metaplasia. Notably, by contrast to control differentiated cultures, in 5-wk Lenti-SOX2-transduced ALI cultures, PI3K signaling was active, but only in squamous metaplasias and not adjacent glandular areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This finding is consistent with premalignant squamous lesions having elevated PI3K signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref077">77</xref>]. It also suggests that SOX2 may be able to amplify PI3K signaling in certain cell contexts such as squamous-committed cells, which has been observed in esophageal SQCC cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref084">84</xref>].</p>

<p>To determine if PI3K signaling is necessary for the squamous response to SOX2, we treated proliferating basal cell cultures on plastic with pan-class I/II/III and class I-specific PI3K inhibitors LY294002 and BKM120, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref085">85</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref086">86</xref>], concurrently with Lenti-SOX2 infection. Due to growth suppression by these drugs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g005">Fig 5A</xref>), assays were limited to short-term plastic cultures.

<p>To determine if PI3K is necessary for squamous metaplasia in vivo, we seeded basal cells into denuded rat tracheas and engrafted them into immunocompromised mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In this setting, basal cells undergo squamous differentiation before regenerating a mucociliary epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref020">20</xref>], which can be recognized by expression of squamous markers such as IVL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).

<title>SOX2 and PI3K Signaling Cooperatively Repress Expression of <italic>SOX9</italic>, a Gene that Is Expressed Inversely to SOX2 during Mucociliary and Squamous Differentiation</title>
<p>To characterize the mechanism by which SOX2 induces squamous metaplasia from stem cells, we searched for basal cell target genes whose regulation by SOX2 is PI3K-dependent. We first established a time window during which stem cells might be undergoing SOX2-dependent changes that affect lineage determination. For these experiments, we used a FLAG-tagged SOX2 construct that retained the ability to induce mucinous and squamous differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s009">S4A Fig</xref>). By 36 hr post-Lenti-SOX2 infection of plastic basal cell cultures, most cells expressed SOX2 protein, as well as the basal cell marker TP63, but did not yet express markers of overt mucinous or squamous differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s009">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). We therefore used 36 hr as an early time point to identify functionally important genes. SOX2 targets were identified by comparing gene expression between Lenti-SOX2 and vector-transduced cultures, with PI3K-dependency being established with Lenti-SOX2/BKM120 co-treatment. Using this strategy, we identified 32 SOX2-dependent changes in gene expression (1.5-fold or more), with 11 being PI3K-dependent and some targets being induced while others were repressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

Since the proliferative phase of ALI culture identifies a transient state when stem cells are initially committing to mucociliary fates, and transcription factors such as SOX2 show a different expression pattern relative to the differentiated quiescent state, we examined SOX9 expression in ALI cultures. In these cultures, SOX9 was expressed oppositely to SOX2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref> versus <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).

<p>In agreement with our data indicating that SOX2 and PI3K cooperatively repress <italic>SOX9</italic> expression, SOX9 was not detected in squamous metaplasias of rat tracheal xenografts, which had high SOX2 expression and PI3K signaling (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g008">8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g006">6B</xref>, day 3). However, SOX9 was expressed later, during regeneration of mucociliary epithelia when PI3K signaling was not active (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g008">8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g006">6B</xref>, &gt;30 d). In these epithelia, SOX9 expression was higher in areas that appeared incompletely differentiated and was absent in the most well-differentiated areas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, compare green and pink insets). This observation is consistent with the ALI data that shows a temporal decline in SOX9 expression during mucociliary differentiation and suggests that the SOX9-positive areas in the xenograft epithelia are at an earlier stage of differentiation.</p>
<p>Given the transient association of SOX9 expression with early generation of mucociliary epithelia, we re-examined SOX9 expression in native human tracheobronchial epithelia, focusing on areas that might be newly formed. In agreement with our observations in ALI and xenograft epithelia, we identified some areas where TP63-positive basal cells retained nuclear SOX9 expression, which was otherwise generally excluded from nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g008">Fig 8E</xref>).

<title><italic>SOX9</italic> Promotes Basal Cell Growth and Its Repression Is Necessary for SOX2 to Induce Squamous Metaplasia</title>
<p>Given that SOX9 expression is highest during the earliest stages of mucociliary differentiation, SOX9 may affect pre-differentiation properties of stem cells such as proliferation and lineage commitment. To determine how SOX9 affects the stem cell behavior of tracheobronchial basal cells, we first used a constitutively expressing lentiviral vector to raise its expression in plastic cultures of SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> basal cells. Lenti-SOX9 increased basal cell growth while elevating expression of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>MUC16</italic>, but not markers of squamous differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g010">Fig 10A</xref>). The increase in <italic>SOX2</italic> mRNA expression did not translate to a detectable increase in SOX2 protein levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s011">S6 Fig</xref>), and the <italic>MUC16</italic> induction was generally weaker than observed with Lenti-SOX2. These data suggest that SOX9 may have a role in promoting columnar lineage commitment, which is associated with a limited ability to increase <italic>MUC16</italic> mRNA expression. Analysis of the effects of reduced SOX9 expression was problematic, as <italic>SOX9</italic> shRNA lentiviruses suppressed basal cell growth. However, in short-term plastic cultures, partial <italic>SOX9</italic> knockdown increased squamous marker, but not <italic>MUC16</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g010">Fig 10B</xref>). The amount of squamous marker induction was also generally weaker than observed for Lenti-SOX2, supporting the concept that SOX9 is an early determinant of columnar versus squamous lineage commitment, rather than a strong inducer of differentiation.</p>

<title>SOX9 promotes basal cell proliferation and inhibits squamous differentiation.</title>
<p>(A) Elevation of SOX9 expression in tracheobronchial basal cells promotes growth and induces <italic>MUC16</italic> expression. Basal cells proliferating on plastic were infected with Lenti-SOX9 or control vector. The red color in all of the schematics indicates Lenti-SOX2-transduced cells. For growth assays, 5 d after infection, cells were replated at low density and cell number quantified after 7 d by alamarBlue. Data are normalized to the amount of growth in control vector cultures, which was given a value of 100. Means ± SEM from quadruplicate cultures are shown. Significance was calculated using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test. <italic>***p</italic> = 0.0000005. For lineage marker expression analysis, mRNA was isolated 5 d following Lenti-SOX9 infection and quantified by qRT-PCR. Data are normalized to expression in control vector cultures, which was given a value of 1. Means ± SEM of three replicates are shown. Significance was calculated using paired two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests. *<italic>p</italic> = 0.02. (B) shSOX9 spontaneously increases expression of squamous markers in plastic cultures of tracheobronchial basal cells. Basal cells growing on plastic were infected with shlacz or shSOX9; after 5 d, lineage marker expression was measured by qRT-PCR. Data are plotted relative to expression in shlacz control cultures, which was given a value of 1. Means ± SEM from three replicates are shown. Significance was calculated using two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests. *<italic>p</italic> = 0.05 (<italic>SOX9</italic>), 0.03 (<italic>SOX2</italic>), 0.02 (<italic>TMPRSS11B</italic>), 0.01 (<italic>IVL</italic>), 0.003 (<italic>SPRR1A</italic>). (C) Constitutive SOX9 expression suppresses SOX2-induced squamous differentiation in plastic cultures of tracheobronchial basal cells. Basal cells were infected with empty vector, Lenti-SOX2 alone, or Lenti-SOX2 + Lenti-SOX9; after 5 d, lineage marker expression was measured by qRT-PCR and analyzed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g005">Fig 5B</xref>. Fold inductions were first calculated by comparing marker expression between Lenti-SOX2 and control vector (non-SOX2)-transduced cells. The fold-inductions were then compared between matched pairs of Lenti-SOX2 and Lenti-SOX2 + Lenti-SOX9 coinfected cultures. The amount of marker induction in coinfected cultures was then plotted as a percentage of the induction observed with Lenti-SOX2 alone, which was given a value of 100. Means ± SEM of three replicates are shown. Significance was calculated using paired two-tailed <italic>t</italic> tests. **<italic>p</italic> = 0.0006 (<italic>IVL</italic>), 0.002 (<italic>SPRR3</italic>), ***<italic>p</italic> = 0.0002 (<italic>TMPRSS11B</italic>), 0.00004 (<italic>SPRR1A</italic>). (D) Constitutive SOX9 expression suppresses SOX2-induced histologic squamous metaplasia in tracheobronchial basal cell cultures grown at ALI.

Significance was calculated using a two-tailed <italic>t</italic> test relative to Lenti-SOX2 alone. ***<italic>p</italic> = 0.000001.

<p>Because <italic>SOX9</italic> expression is repressed by SOX2, we next determined the consequences of sustained SOX9 expression on SOX2-induced basal cell differentiation. When co-infected with Lenti-SOX2 in plastic cultures, Lenti-SOX9 suppressed squamous differentiation while enhancing <italic>MUC16</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g010">Fig 10C</xref>). Similarly, in ALI cultures, coinfection of Lenti-SOX9 with Lenti-SOX2 inhibited histologic squamous metaplasia, but not MUC16 differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g010">Fig 10D</xref>). Thus, <italic>SOX9</italic> repression is part of the mechanism through which SOX2 and PI3K promote squamous metaplasia from stem cells.</p>

<title>SOX9 Is Not Expressed in High Grade Dysplasia when SOX2 Expression and PI3K Signaling Are High</title>
<p>To further investigate if the mechanism regulating squamous differentiation in stem cells might contribute to progression through early stages of SQCC pathogenesis, we characterized SOX2, SOX9, and P-S6 expression during preneoplasia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g011">Fig 11</xref>). We analyzed an SQCC resection from a smoker that included normal respiratory epithelium, squamous metaplasia, and high-grade dysplasia, in addition to frank carcinoma. As expected, most cells in the normal mucociliary epithelium expressed SOX2, while SOX9 was not detected, and P-S6 expression was confined to some columnar, but not basal cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g011">Fig 11</xref>). In squamous metaplasia, SOX2 was expressed in most cells, but heterogeneously in the basal and suprabasal layers. The heterogeneity in basal cells would be consistent with ongoing squamous differentiation of some basal cells (SOX2<sup>Hi</sup> cells), while other basal cells are poised to regenerate columnar cells during later regression (SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> cells). SOX9 was not expressed in most basal cells of squamous metaplasia, which supports these cells either being squamous-committed or in an early stage of transitioning to columnar fates. Surprisingly, however, SOX9 was heterogeneously expressed in suprabasal cells, possibly signifying a non-stem cell function for SOX9 in some squamous differentiated progeny (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s012">S7 Fig</xref>). P-S6 staining was intense in the uppermost layers of squamous metaplasia but varied in the basal cell compartment. In the centermost basal region, P-S6 staining was low, while its intensity increased in basal cells as they approached areas of dysplasia (lowermost panels). By contrast, in high-grade dysplasia, expression of SOX2, SOX9, and P-S6 was uniform. SOX2 and P-S6 were expressed at high levels, while SOX9 expression was lost (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s012">S7 Fig</xref>), supporting most dysplastic cells being stem cell-like and committed to the squamous fate. The dysplastic expression patterns were maintained in the invasive carcinoma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s012">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>SOX9 Is Generally Expressed at Low Levels in SQCCs, with Highest Expression Associated with Different Clinical and Molecular Phenotypes</title>
<p>We next characterized SOX2, SOX9, and P-S6 expression in a panel of 132 SQCCs using tissue microarrays. First, we evaluated SOX2 and SOX9 expression by IHC using an H-score. Because the basal-most cells could be more stem cell-like and, hence, better recapitulate expression patterns we observed during normal stem cell differentiation, basal and suprabasal layers were scored independently. Overall, 94% of SQCCs expressed SOX2, with most tumor cells expressing moderate to high levels, and 73% had detectable levels of SOX9, although in the majority of cases SOX9 was expressed in very few tumor cells and at low levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s013">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002581.t001">Table 1</xref>). While SOX2 and SOX9 expression were expected to be inversely correlated, we did not observe a strong negative correlation between their H-scores (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s013">S8C Fig</xref>). We also expected that SOX9 levels might vary inversely to the extent of squamous differentiation. Although there was a tendency for histologically well-differentiated tumors to have lower SOX9 and higher SOX2 H-scores (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002581.t001">Table 1</xref>), this trend was not significant. Similarly, when focusing on the highest quartile of SOX9-expressing tumors, there was no difference in differentiation, as compared to the 75% of cases with lower SOX9 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s013">S8D Fig</xref>). Given that SOX2 and SOX9 H-scores were not that different between basal and suprabasal layers, for P-S6, we only scored the fraction of tumor cells that stained positive. In 92% of SQCCs, some P-S6 staining was detectable, and 91% of SQCCs that expressed SOX2 also expressed P-S6, although in many cases, few tumor cells expressed P-S6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s014">S9A and S9B Fig</xref>). As with SOX2 and SOX9, we did not detect strong negative correlations between P-S6 and SOX9 expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s014">S9C Fig</xref>). However, the narrow spreads in the majority of SOX2, SOX9, and P-S6 expression data may have limited the power of our statistical analyses, and histological tumor grade might not have been sensitive enough to detect differences in the extent of squamous differentiation. Nevertheless, the generally high and low expression of SOX2 and SOX9, respectively, are consistent with SOX2 inhibiting SOX9 expression and SOX9 potentially interfering with squamous differentiation in SQCCs.</p>

<p>As a potentially more sensitive way of characterizing <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> expression in SQCCs, we also examined their mRNA levels as quantified by RNAseq in the TCGA SQCC cohort [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref042">42</xref>]. Consistent with our IHC data, in most SQCCs, <italic>SOX9</italic> was expressed at much lower levels than <italic>SOX2</italic>, and there was a weak negative correlation between their expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s015">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002581.t001">Table 1</xref>). Although <italic>SOX9</italic> expression was generally low across SQCCs, given its ability to promote basal cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g010">Fig 10A</xref>), we hypothesized that highest expressors might have distinct characteristics. In support of this possibility, the upper quartile of cases, which, on average, had 4-fold higher <italic>SOX9</italic> expression than the remaining 75% of cases, were associated with fewer high copy number <italic>SOX2</italic> gains (amplification) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s015">S10C Fig</xref>). Furthermore, when using publicly available data from nine SQCC cohorts and stratifying by approximately the upper quartile, there was a tendency for high <italic>SOX9</italic> expression to be associated with a lower probability of survival (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g012">Fig 12A</xref>).

<p>Finally, we used gene set enrichment analysis to explore phenotypic differences between SQCCs that expressed low or high levels of <italic>SOX9</italic>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SQCCs have been grouped into four subtypes based on differences in gene expression, which have been proposed to arise through different mechanisms involving distinct cells of origin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref100">100</xref>]. While at some point transformation mechanisms may diverge, most SQCCs likely originate in basal cells through their natural squamous injury response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref025">25</xref>]. TP63 protein, a hallmark of basal cells, is expressed in virtually all SQCCs, with 96% of cases having strong expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref015">15</xref>], and it is generally accepted that most SQCCs arise following squamous metaplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref101">101</xref>]. How the squamous injury response is initiated and exploited to promote SQCC pathogenesis has been a mystery.</p>
<p>Here, we show that SOX2 and PI3K cooperate to induce the squamous injury response in basal cells. Although in the normal tracheobronchial epithelium SOX2 is expressed at high levels in most basal cells, its expression can vary during injury and regeneration, with a SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> state preceding new mucociliary differentiation. The SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> state appears to facilitate ciliogenesis, while high levels of SOX2 induce distinct types of lineage differentiation, depending on the signaling context. SOX2 can induce a specific type of mucinous differentiation marked by MUC16, or it can drive basal cells into a hyperplastic state that differentiates into squamous epithelia. The squamous response specifically requires PI3K signaling, which cooperates with SOX2 to repress <italic>SOX9</italic>, an inhibitor of squamous differentiation in several stratifying epithelia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref089">89</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref090">90</xref>]. In embryonic stem (ES) cells, AKT directly regulates SOX2 through phosphorylation at Thr116, which increases SOX2 stability and, thus, generally promotes its activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref078">78</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref079">79</xref>]. However, upon PI3K inhibition in basal cells, SOX2 protein expression is not reduced, and one differentiating activity of SOX2 (squamous) is much more affected than the other (mucinous). We also find that PI3K signaling inhibits <italic>SOX9</italic> expression even in the absence of Lenti-SOX2 transduction. Hence, PI3K may act parallel to SOX2, possibly through chromatin modifications, which can be modulated by PI3K signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref102">102</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref103">103</xref>]. PI3K may also help establish the squamous fate as the dominant SOX2 response by antagonizing mucinous differentiation, since shPIK3CA enhances SOX2-dependent induction of <italic>MUC16</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Under uninjured conditions, turnover is low in the tracheobronchial epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref016">16</xref>]. Most basal cells express high levels of SOX2, while in rare cells, SOX2 expression is low. SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> cells may be committed to the ciliated fate, or they may be in a naïve state that has not yet committed to a particular columnar lineage. By contrast, SOX2<sup>Hi</sup> cells could be committed to a mucinous fate or a ciliated fate, if SOX2 expression increased after ciliated cell commitment. Further work will be required to address these questions as well as to determine at what point initial lineage commitments become irreversible. However, given that PI3K signaling is low in basal cells in the uninjured state, squamous differentiation should not occur.</p>

Furthermore, cigarette smoke extract and nicotine increase AKT activation in tracheobronchial basal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref072">72</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref073">73</xref>], and cytologically normal epithelia from smokers with dysplasia have elevated PI3K activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref074">74</xref>]. Thus, smoking likely triggers squamous metaplasia at least partly through PI3K activation in basal cells. Although SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> basal cells should be able to adopt a squamous fate in response to PI3K activation, SOX2 expression would first have to increase, which is not yet known to be a response to smoking. Alternatively, if some of the many SOX2<sup>Hi</sup> basal cells are not irreversibly committed to columnar fates, PI3K activation in these cells might be sufficient to trigger a rapid widespread squamous response. Ultimately, SOX2 is expressed in many basal cells of smoking-associated squamous metaplasia, supporting its role in driving metaplasia. However, SOX2, as well as P-S6, are heterogeneously expressed amongst these basal cells. Because functional PI3K activity may be below our detection limits in some cells, and because it is not certain where the stem cells in the metaplasia reside (e.g., center: low P-S6 versus edges: high P-S6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g011">Fig 11</xref>), the significance of the P-S6 heterogeneity is not clear. On the other hand, regarding heterogeneity in SOX2 expression, it might be that SOX2<sup>Hi</sup> basal cells are actively involved in ongoing squamous differentiation, while SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> basal cells are poised to later regenerate mucociliary epithelia, as we observed during regeneration in various injury models. It is not clear why SOX9 is expressed in suprabasal metaplastic layers, but it may relate to an unknown function in squamous differentiated progeny. Importantly, because squamous metaplasia basal cells are hyperproliferative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref021">21</xref>], the longer they remain in this state, the greater the risk of acquiring genetic driver events from genotoxic damage. Some of the hyperproliferation may be an intrinsic property of the squamous-committed state. In Lenti-SOX2 ALI cultures that contained adjacent squamous and non-squamous epithelia, only basal cells associated with squamous metaplasia were hyperproliferative, and in the absence of smoke.</p>
<p>High-grade dysplasia is a turning point in SQCC pathogenesis in that it appears to mark a transition from an environmentally reactive pathology to one with a strong genetic component. It is the earliest stage when common focal genetic changes are detected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref036">36</xref>], and it is less prone to regression than earlier stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref034">34</xref>]. During this stage, we find that SOX2 and P-S6 are highly expressed in most cells. These observations agree with previous reports that noted high levels of SOX2 and P-AKT in dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref075">75</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref077">77</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref104">104</xref>]. The high expression levels could signify a largely stem cell-like population with strong commitment to the squamous fate. Because some high-grade dysplasias regress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref105">105</xref>], the dysplastic phenotype is not likely to be strictly dependent on genetic alterations. We propose, however, that in order to regress, SOX2 and PI3K signaling levels must decline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002581.g013">Fig 13</xref>). This reduction would be hindered in dysplasias that acquire <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> coamplification. Such 3q-amplified dysplasias would be more prone to progression due to the sustained hyperproliferative squamous-committed stem cell state and the inability to regress to quiescent mucociliary differentiated epithelia. As such, we would predict that 3q amplification would be a biomarker for non-regressing dysplasias.</p>

<title>Stem cell model for the role of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> coamplification in SQCC pathogenesis.</title>
<p>SOX2 (red nuclei), SOX9 (blue nuclei), and PI3K signaling (yellow cytoplasm) levels are highlighted in basal cells of normal and metaplastic epithelia and in all cells of dysplasia and SQCC. In basal cells of uninjured mucociliary epithelia, SOX9 and PI3K signaling levels are low, and most, but not all, cells express SOX2. Smoking induces PI3K activation, which may cause SOX2<sup>Hi</sup> basal cells that have not irreversibly committed to mucociliary fates to enter a hyperproliferative squamous metaplastic state. Alternatively, PI3K signaling may trigger an increase in SOX2 expression in SOX2<sup>Lo</sup> basal cells, which also drives entry into the hyperproliferative squamous metaplastic state. In squamous metaplasia basal cells, SOX2 and PI3K signaling levels are heterogeneous. This heterogeneity may signify the presence of both squamous-committed basal cells, as well as basal cells that are poised to regenerate mucociliary epithelia once injury has subsided. With continued smoking, squamous metaplasia progresses to high-grade dysplasia, in which most cells are in a SOX2<sup>Hi</sup>SOX9<sup>Lo</sup> state, with high levels of PI3K signaling. In this state, the majority of cells are hyperproliferative and committed to a squamous fate, although they do not undergo extensive differentiation. In non-3q-amplified dysplasia and metaplasia, the squamous injury state in basal cells subsides as SOX2 expression and PI3K signaling naturally decline over time. Basal cells then enter a proliferative SOX2<sup>Lo</sup>SOX9<sup>Hi</sup> state, which promotes columnar over squamous fates. From this state, ciliated cell commitment occurs while SOX2 levels are low, and later, as SOX9 expression decreases and SOX2 levels increase, quiescence and mucociliary differentiation occur (with SOX2 inducing the MUC16 mucinous fate [purple]). By contrast, in high-grade dysplasias that have acquired copy number gains at 3q26-28, SOX2 expression and PI3K signaling are maintained and prevent the squamous injury response from waning. Eventually, additional genetic events accrue in clones such that transformation to invasive carcinoma occurs. SQCCs diverge in the level of PI3K signaling and SOX9 expression. While in most SQCCs, SOX9 is expressed at low levels, a subset of SQCCs have higher SOX9 expression, which inhibits the squamous phenotype and may drive more aggressive tumor behavior.</p>

<p>While in theory, as long as there is regular exposure to smoke, a squamous injury state should be sustainable without 3q amplification, this may not actually be the case. First, our finding that tracheobronchial basal cells in normal tissue express similar levels of SOX2 as <italic>SOX2</italic>-amplified SQCCs suggests that <italic>SOX2</italic> promoter activity may decline during SQCC pathogenesis. Second, premalignant squamous lesions regress in smokers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref030">30</xref>], and, intriguingly, regression follows the reverse steps of progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref105">105</xref>], supporting waning of the squamous injury response over time. This is not surprising, as many cellular responses desensitize after chronic stimulation. Moreover, the squamous injury response involves the same stem cells that perpetually renew the epithelium. Hence, it would be important for stem cells to have a natural mechanism that limits the duration of the squamous injury response and exposure of replicating stem cells to genotoxic stress.</p>
<p>Targeting the squamous injury response as early as possible would minimize accrual of genetic drivers and, hence, potentially be chemopreventative. One approach could involve PI3K inhibition. Notably, <italic>myo</italic>-inositol, a natural sugar alcohol, enhanced regression of low-grade dysplasias in a phase I clinical trial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref087">87</xref>]. Although <italic>myo</italic>-inositol can affect multiple signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref106">106</xref>], in the phase I trial, regression was accompanied with PI3K pathway inhibition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref088">88</xref>], which our data support as being part of the mechanism of regression. Thus, natural and targeted PI3K inhibitors should continue to be investigated. We would also suggest that even dysplasias with 3q amplification might respond to anti-PI3K therapy. We and others have found that PI3K signaling is high in dysplasia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref077">77</xref>], and our stem cell data suggest that 3q amplification is initially selected to maintain a waning squamous injury response, which together, support 3q-amplified dysplastic cells being dependent on PI3K signaling. However, such basal cells would be prone to returning to a squamous injury state if therapy was discontinued.</p>
<p>Growth of many cancers is dependent on mechanisms that specify developmental lineages (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref107">107</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref108">108</xref>]), including SQCCs being dependent on SOX2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref109">109</xref>]. Because most SQCCs express high levels of SOX2 and low levels of SOX9 and show evidence of PI3K activity in at least some tumor cells (which could be stem cells), the mechanism we uncovered in stem cells may continue to promote squamous identity in SQCCs. Accordingly, PI3K may be a vulnerability in invasive carcinoma. However, in a clinical trial involving SQCC patients, BKM120 was ineffective [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref110">110</xref>]. This could reflect a problem with the therapeutic index, in which case co-targeting additional components of the squamous injury response mechanism might improve PI3K inhibitor effectiveness. Alternatively, failure of BKM120 could indicate that many SQCCs have lost the dependency on PI3K that is likely prevalent during early stages of progression. Notably, as compared to dysplasia, which had uniformly high SOX2 and P-S6 expression, in 50% of SQCCs, P-S6 expression was observed in 10% or less of tumor cells. On the other hand, in 20% of cases, P-S6 was expressed in at least 70% or more of tumor cells. Further work will be necessary to assess the roles of SOX2, SOX9, and PI3K in maintaining the squamous identity of SQCCs and to determine whether sensitivity to PI3K inhibitors varies with P-S6 expression.</p>
<p>We also discovered that although SOX9 was generally expressed at low levels and in few tumor cells, its expression varied among SQCCs. SOX9<sup>Hi</sup> SQCCs were associated with fewer high copy number <italic>SOX2</italic> gains and a lower probability of survival, suggesting that they represent a distinct SQCC subclass that may at least partly be driven by SOX9. First, by gene set enrichment analysis, these tumors have less of a squamous phenotype, which could reflect the anti-squamous differentiation properties of SOX9. Second, we also found that SOX9 drives proliferation of normal basal cells and that, in several injury models, basal cells enter a transient SOX2<sup>Lo</sup>SOX9<sup>Hi</sup> proliferative state prior to mucociliary differentiation. Thus, during later stages of pathogenesis, in a subset of SQCCs, genetic or epigenetic alterations may be selected that promote this natural, SOX9<sup>Hi</sup> non-squamous-committed stem cell state. This basal cell state may share phenotypic and functional similarities with states established by SOX9 in several other cellular contexts. For example, our gene set enrichment analysis found similarity between SOX9<sup>Hi</sup> SQCCs and certain breast cancers (especially triple negative) and neural crest-derived tumors, whose genesis and malignant properties are affected by SOX9. SOX9 promotes the mammary stem cell state, is associated with poor prognosis in breast cancer, and is thought to be especially active in triple negative tumors, where it enhances the tumorigenic phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref093">93</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref095">95</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref099">99</xref>]. SOX9 also induces neural crest identity and promotes generation of downstream melanocyte and glial lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref092">92</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref094">94</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref096">96</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref097">97</xref>]. In addition, SOX9 promotes malignant properties of melanoma and glioblastoma cell lines and is associated with lower rates of survival for both cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref091">91</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref098">98</xref>]. Interestingly, SOX9<sup>Hi</sup> SQCCs also had similarity to several small cell lung cancer (SCLC) cell lines. However, the role of SOX9 in SCLC has not been examined. Further work should be done to better characterize SQCCs expressing different levels of SOX9 and how they may have distinct clinical outcomes and sensitivities to different treatment strategies.</p>
<p>Basal cells are also stem cells in other stratifying epithelia, where they make similar decisions regarding squamous and non-squamous fates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref111">111</xref>]. As in the lung, homeostatic decisions can be altered by injury to induce hyperproliferative metaplasias that increase cancer risk, especially in the bladder, cervix, and esophagus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref112">112</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref117">117</xref>]. These decisions may analogously be driven by SOX2 and SOX9, with injury-induced changes in their expression causing metaplasia. For example, SOX9 inhibits squamous differentiation of esophageal basal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref089">89</xref>], and during development, the esophageal epithelium transitions from a columnar epithelium that coexpresses SOX2 and SOX9 to a squamous epithelium where only SOX2 is expressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref118">118</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref120">120</xref>]. Injury induced by chronic acid reflux reactivates SOX9 expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref119">119</xref>], and triggers Barrett’s esophagus, a gastric/intestinal metaplasia that increases the risk of developing adenocarcinoma in the formerly squamous epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref114">114</xref>]. Conversely, copy number gains at 3q are associated with SQCCs in different tissues (see also TCGA data, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cbioportal.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.cbioportal.org</ext-link>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref121">121</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref122">122</xref>]. In some cases, such as in the lung and cervix, gains at 3q may be used to stabilize a more proliferative squamous metaplastic injury state in stem cells that do not normally exclusively generate a squamous epithelium. However, in other cases such as in the esophagus, where stem cells are already squamous-committed and quite proliferative [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref112">112</xref>], there is evidence that coamplification of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>PIK3CA</italic> stabilize a non-metaplastic injury state that increases squamous stem cell self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref123">123</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref125">125</xref>]. It thus appears that early steps of carcinogenesis in stratifying epithelia may generally involve environment-induced activation of stem cell injury states, with subsequent selection of genetic driver events that stabilize these states.</p>

<p>A full-length human <italic>SOX2</italic> cDNA in the pOTB7 cloning vector was purchased from the TCAG Genome Resource Facility (The Hospital for Sick Children). This cDNA was used to make two untagged expression constructs in the pMA1 lentiviral vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref134">134</xref>], which were indistinguishable in their biological activity. In this vector, a minimal CMV promoter drives GFP expression, while the PGK promoter drives constitutive expression of the gene of interest. pLenti-SOX2G was constructed by digesting pOTB7-SOX2 with EcoRI, blunting the 5′ end of <italic>SOX2</italic> with Klenow, then releasing <italic>SOX2</italic> by XhoI digestion and cloning the fragment into SmaI/SalI-digested pMA1. pLenti-SOX2B was constructed by cloning <italic>SOX2</italic> into pMALB, a variant of pMA1 in which GFP was replaced with TagBFP, and pMA1 was converted into a Gateway destination vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref135">135</xref>].

<p>pLenti-SOX2-FLAG was constructed through a series of steps beginning with the PCR-based TA-cloning of <italic>SOX2</italic> into pGem-T-easy (Promega) using pOTB7-SOX2 as a template and the primers SOX2-1 (5’- Ccg gaattc ggc atg tac aac atg atg gag acg gag-3’) and SOX2-2 (5’-ctag tctaga cat gtg tga gag ggg cag tgt g-3’). An in-frame 3x FLAG tag was then added to the C-terminus of SOX2 by cloning <italic>SOX2</italic> from pGemSOX2 into p3xFLAG-CMV-14 (Sigma) via EcoRI and XbaI digestion and ligation. The FLAG-tagged <italic>SOX2</italic> cDNA was then amplified using primers CMVFLAG14-1 (5’-5’-TCCAG AGA TCT AGA GCT CGT TTA GTG AAC CGT CAG-3’) and CMVFLAG14-2 (5’-ATAGTA GAT CTG GGG AGG GGT CAC AGG GAT GCC-3’) and cloned into the Gateway entry vector, pCR8/GW/TOPO. SOX2-FLAG was then transferred to pMALB from pCR8 by Gateway cloning.</p>
<p>pLenti-SOX9 were constructed by Gateway cloning of the human SOX9 cDNA from a Gateway entry vector (GeneCopoeia) into pMAL, a pMA1 derivative that was modified into a Gateway destination vector that still coexpresses GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002581.ref135">135</xref>].</p>

<p>Three biological replicate experiments were set up, with each one consisting of an empty vector and two Lenti-SOX2-FLAG-transduced conditions. At the time of virus addition, the empty vector and one of the Lenti-SOX2 conditions were treated with 0.1% DMSO, while the other Lenti-SOX2 condition was treated with 2.5 μM BKM120. After overnight virus incubation, cells were washed in Hepes-buffered saline and refed with LHC-9 containing either BKM120 or DMSO. Thirty-six hours post virus addition, RNA was harvested. The Illumina TotalPrep-96 RNA Amplification Kit was used to generate biotinylated, amplified cRNA for hybridization with Illumina Human HT-12 v4.0 Expression BeadChips. Quantile normalized data were analyzed in R and Genespring (Agilent). Genes significantly changed by SOX2/DMSO or SOX2/BKM120 were identified by comparing the replicates of each condition with the control vector/DMSO replicates using a one-way ANOVA test and a Benjamini-Hochberg-corrected <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 cutoff and a post-hoc Tukey’s HSD test.

<title>Characterization of <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> mRNA expression in SQCCs.</title>
<p>(A–C) All mRNA expression and copy number variation data are from the TCGA analysis of 177 primary SQCCs and are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002581.s002">S2 Data</xref>. (A) Distribution of mRNA expression across the patient cohort. RPKM = Reads Per Kilobase of transcript per Million mapped reads. (B) Relationship between <italic>SOX2</italic> and <italic>SOX9</italic> mRNA expression in SQCC patients. (C) Comparison of <italic>SOX9</italic>-high versus <italic>SOX9</italic>-low SQCCs and their associations with <italic>SOX2</italic> amplification. Statistical significance was calculated using a two-tailed Fisher’s exact test.</p>
