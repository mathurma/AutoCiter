However, in long-lived organisms with extensive cell turnover, cell differentiation often continues after new cell types are no longer needed or produced. Here, we address the question of why this is true. It is believed that multicellular organisms could not have arisen or been evolutionarily stable without possessing mechanisms to suppress somatic selection among cells within organisms, which would otherwise disrupt organismal integrity. Here, we propose that one such mechanism is a specific pattern of ongoing cell differentiation commonly found in metazoans with cell turnover, which we call “serial differentiation.” This pattern involves a sequence of differentiation stages, starting with self-renewing somatic stem cells and proceeding through several (non–self-renewing) transient amplifying cell stages before ending with terminally differentiated cells. To test the hypothesis that serial differentiation can suppress somatic evolution, we used an agent-based computer simulation of cell population dynamics and evolution within tissues. The results indicate that, relative to other, simpler patterns, tissues organized into serial differentiation experience lower rates of detrimental cell-level evolution. Self-renewing cell populations are susceptible to somatic evolution, while those that are not self-renewing are not. We find that a mutation disrupting differentiation can create a new self-renewing cell population that is vulnerable to somatic evolution. These results are relevant not only to understanding the evolutionary origins of multicellularity, but also the causes of pathologies such as cancer and senescence in extant metazoans, including humans.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Darwinian natural selection and evolution is usually studied in populations of organisms.

It is believed that this problem must have been solved somehow to allow the evolutionary emergence of multicellular animals. However, it has also been suggested that some pervasive pathologies reflect the persistence of some level of somatic evolution Here, we propose that a well-known pattern of ongoing cell differentiation in the mature tissues of animals functions to suppress somatic evolution.

Although ongoing cell replacement is clearly necessary for long-lived organisms, it is not obvious why tissue renewal should involve ongoing differentiation from somatic stem cells. In principle, tissues could be maintained by the self-duplication of fully functional cell types, using the same kind of “cell memory,” or direct epigenetic inheritance of cell state, that is typical of unicellular organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b001">1</xref>]. Indeed, some metazoan tissues do seem to replace lost cells through such self-duplication of differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b002">2</xref>]. Such a simple system is both evolutionarily conserved and metabolically efficient. Instead, however, most adult tissues replace lost cells through a much more elaborate system that we call “serial differentiation.” In this system, new fully differentiated cells are not produced by the division of fully differentiated cells (which are incapable of division), but by the division of “transit” cells, or “transient amplifying cells” (TACs). One tissue may include a series of several TAC stages, each of which results from the division of the preceding stage. These cells are transient in the sense that they only proliferate for a limited amount of time before they become terminally differentiated and are eventually shed from the tissue. They amplify the proliferative potential of the somatic stem cells, because each TAC stage doubles the number of descendent cells that ultimately result from the division of a somatic stem cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b003">3</xref>]. Serial differentiation has been described in a variety of self-renewing tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b010">10</xref>]. Relative to direct epigenetic inheritance of cell state by fully differentiated cells, the more elaborate system of serial differentiation presumably requires greater genetic complexity and also entails a metabolic cost in supporting the additional cells. Therefore, it would seem unlikely to have evolved unless it provided some important advantage to the organism. Here, we propose that this advantage lies in the suppression of somatic selection and thus somatic evolution.</p></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>The Challenge of Somatic Evolution</title><p>A multicellular organism can be viewed as a population of cooperating cells. This population is subject to the same evolutionary processes as any other population undergoing reproduction, death, mutation, and competition for limiting resources. Selection within a metazoan will inevitably favor those cells that are better at reproductive competition and survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b003">3</xref>]. Yet, the characteristics that help cells compete effectively within the organism are generally detrimental to organismal integrity and fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b011">11</xref>]. Thus, there is a fundamental conflict between selection among cells within organisms (“somatic selection”) and selection among organisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b014">14</xref>]. Multicellular organisms could not emerge as functional entities before organism-level selection had led to the evolution of mechanisms to suppress cell-level selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b018">18</xref>]. Cell differentiation has previously been recognized as a mechanism to control somatic evolution and its potential for carcinogenesis during development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b020">20</xref>]. However, even in mature tissues, the combination of cell turnover and somatic mutation creates the conditions for somatic evolution. The conflict between the cellular and organismal levels of selection is exacerbated in long-lived organisms with extensive cell turnover. Humans are estimated to contain approximately 10<sup>14</sup> cells with extensive cell turnover [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b021">21</xref>]. For example, each day, the small intestine and the hematopoietic system shed 10<sup>10</sup> and 10<sup>11</sup> cells, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b023">23</xref>]. Furthermore, many of the genes in a metazoan genome may function to constrain cellular competition and coordinate cellular cooperation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b015">15</xref>]. This implies that many loss-of-function mutations may provide a competitive advantage for the mutant cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b024">24</xref>]. Accumulation of such somatic mutations through cell-level selection could lead to two general classes of pathology. First, diversion of cell resources into cell survival and replication and away from organismal function could impair a wide range of organismal functions, leading to general senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b025">25</xref>]. Second, the shedding of restrictions on cell division and survival, if unchecked, ultimately leads to uncontrolled cell proliferation and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b020">20</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>The Hypothesis: Serial Differentiation As a Defense Against Somatic Evolution</title><p>Somatic evolution is inevitable given the cumulative Darwinian selection that occurs in any self-renewing population of proliferating cells, together with a supply of variation in cell fitness from somatic mutation. In multicellular organisms with substantial cell turnover, both self-renewal and cell proliferation are necessary, and the complete suppression of all mutation may not be achievable. However, it may be quite feasible through differentiation patterns to almost entirely suppress somatic selection, without which the appearance of the occasional somatic mutation is harmless to the organism. We hypothesize that this is achieved in animals by compartmentalizing self-renewing tissues such that one cell population (stem cells) undergoes self-renewal, while another (TACs) undergoes active proliferation. If no cell population combines both these necessary elements of somatic evolution, somatic evolution is thereby suppressed. If this separation is imperfect, some somatic selection may occur, but it will be greatly weakened and slowed. Consequently, we would expect to see the pathologies associated with somatic evolution to persist at some level, but primarily as ailments of old age.</p><p>We hypothesize that stem compartments are subject to little somatic evolution because stem cell populations are small and quiescent, with little proliferative activity. Populations of TACs are subject to little somatic evolution because they are not self-renewing, so that somatic Darwinian selection is not in effect: mutations conferring increased cell survival and replication do not increase in frequency within this cell population.</p><p>Here, we test our hypothesis using a simplified computational model of cell population dynamics and differentiation in a tissue or proliferative unit (e.g., an intestinal crypt). Our hypothesis requires the representation of stem cells, TACs, symmetric and asymmetric cell divisions (which may be self-renewing or differentiating), and the ability to track the fate of mutations that increase the fitness of a cell lineage. In addition to the effects of self-renewing cell divisions, we also study factors influencing the rate of somatic evolution under serial differentiation, including symmetric versus asymmetric differentiation, the number of differentiation stages, and loss-of-function mutations in differentiation pathways. The model is not designed to faithfully replicate the details of any one tissue, but rather to capture the essential dynamics relevant to our hypothesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effect of Number of Differentiation Stages</title><p>Our first set of experiments was set in the context of serial cell differentiation, under the assumption that cell differentiation was symmetric, with both daughter cells sharing the same fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030250-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Thus, every cell division outside the stem cell compartment entails differentiation into the next downstream stage, eventually ending in the terminally differentiated cells, which are purged from the tissue (e.g., sloughing of the outer layer of the skin, or the upper cells of an intestinal crypt into the lumen of the gut).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030250.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><sec id="s2a1"><title>Experiment 1A: Fate of single selfish-cell mutations.</title><p>Our first experiment used the introduction of controlled mutations (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) to examine the probability of a single mutation sweeping to fixation within the cell population, as a function of the cell-level fitness advantage it conferred.</p><p>Because our model included stochastic cell mortality and replication, when a novel mutant was first introduced into a population as a single cell, it was in danger of going extinct through drift even if its intrinsic fitness was higher than that of its competitors.

					</p><p>Using the protocol of stochastic mutation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), we allowed the quantitative cell trait of either intrinsic replication rate or mortality rate to mutate at each cell division, and measured the resulting time until the average population replication rate doubled or mortality rate was cut in half. As the number of differentiation stages increased, so did the total number of cells, the number of cell divisions per time step, and the number of novel mutations arising per time step. All else being equal, these factors would increase the rate of somatic evolution. Nonetheless, as the number of differentiation stages increased, so did the waiting time before we recorded a 2-fold evolutionary change in the trait under study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030250-g004">Figure 4</xref>). For every differentiation stage added to the model, the relative risk (RR) of the cell population doubling its intrinsic replication rate was cut in half (Cox proportional hazard RR = 0.498, 95% CI: 0.476–0.522, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The same was true for the effect of number of cell stages on waiting time until intrinsic mortality rates were halved (RR = 0.689, 95% CI: 0.667–0.712, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). The Cox regression takes into account both the time until the 2-fold change, and the fact that some simulation runs were censored at 10,000 time steps [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b026">26</xref>].

It may seem surprising that somatic evolution was more rapid with two cell stages (stem and fully differentiated) than with a single self-renewing cell stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030250-g004">Figure 4</xref>). This is because the two-stage situation required stem cell divisions to supply replacement cells to both the stem cell compartment and the differentiated cell compartment. Thus, even though this situation involved half as many stem cells as the situation with a single self-renewing cell stage, it involved more total stem cell divisions and therefore produced cell turnover in the self-renewing stem compartment, leading to faster somatic evolution than the single-stage situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030250-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030250-g005">5</xref>). Because both the number of stem cells and their replicative activity were important, the most effective suppression of somatic selection occurred with more than four non-stem stages (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030250-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Effect of Asymmetric Differentiation</title><p>For some cells, differentiation may be asymmetric, with one daughter cell remaining in the parental cell stage and the other further differentiating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b027">27</xref>].

We suggest that this pattern of cell differentiation was a critical step in the evolution of large and long-lived metazoans with extensive cell turnover. Serial cell differentiation makes it possible to segregate proliferative activity and population self-renewal into different cell compartments so that no compartment possesses all the attributes necessary for somatic evolution.</p><p>Our simulation experiments confirmed our a priori prediction that self-renewal in TACs would allow rapid somatic evolution because a mutant clone can sweep to fixation within a population of such cells. In addition, they revealed that asymmetric cell divisions are one of the forms of population self-renewal that would increase the rate of somatic evolution. Symmetric cell division without self-renewal suppresses somatic evolution by causing the constant removal of non-stem mutations from the proliferating cell population. All such mutations are trapped in cell lineages that are destined to rapidly die out through terminal differentiation. Any form of self-renewal, including asymmetric cell division, disrupts this purging dynamic, allowing the sequential accumulation of multiple selfish-cell mutations.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Implications for the Evolutionary Transition to Multicellularity</title><p>The evolution of multicellularity from preexisting unicellular life is one example of repeated events during evolution in which new kinds of biological “individuals” have emerged from collections of previously existing entities. In each of these “transitions in individuality,” selection at the level of the newly emergent individual is thought to have created mechanisms to suppress internal selection among its subunits, which would otherwise disrupt its integrity and lower its fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b017">17</xref>]. Several such mechanisms have been proposed for the evolutionary transition to multicellular life. Buss argued for the central role of germ line segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b015">15</xref>], which protects the germ line from being affected by somatic evolution within the soma. In contrast, Queller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b029">29</xref>] emphasized the importance of a single-celled stage in the life cycle for limiting the genetic variation passed on to offspring. Both of these mechanisms may be important to mitigating long-term somatic evolution across many organismal generations.</p><p>Here, we propose another mechanism that has long been known to exist, but the functional significance of which has received little attention (but see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b030">30</xref>]). By suppressing somatic evolution within tissues, serial differentiation may not only suppress somatic evolution across generations of multicellular organisms. In addition, it may also suppress the short-term somatic evolution that can have significant deleterious consequences within the lifespan of a single organism that is large and long-lived [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b031">31</xref>].</p><p>Cell differentiation depends upon epigenetic inheritance. Thus, our results support the suggestion of Jablonka [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b032">32</xref>] that epigenetic inheritance played a central role in the transition from unicellular to multicellular life by helping to control selection among the cells of the newly emergent multicellular individual. Because the epigenetic state of the genome is heritable across cell generations, somatic evolution almost certainly occurs in the epigenome as well as in the genome. Epigenetic alterations are commonly detected in cancers and are thought to often be early events in carcinogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b037">37</xref>]. Thus, changes labeled as somatic “mutations” in our model could also be realized by epigenetic alterations.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>Testing Our Conclusions against Empirical Data</title><p>The main purpose of this paper has been to test a hypothesis for the evolutionary origin and function of an already-familiar pattern of cell differentiation in large metazoans. Given that the existence of this pattern is not in doubt, what testable predictions follow from our hypothesis that could be used to reject or support it? Several predictions concerning the architecture of normal, healthy tissues in long-lived metazoans can be tested experimentally or even by careful observation. One such prediction is that large and proliferating (e.g., non-stem) cell populations are not expected to be self-renewing. Another prediction is that when non-stem cells divide, both daughter cells must be committed to further differentiation. Thus, cell division should be intimately tied to differentiation. Dividing without committing to differentiation is the definition of self-renewal, and we have shown that this is a risk for somatic evolution and associated pathologies.</p><p>Opportunities for testing our hypothesis arise where our predictions appear to conflict with the prevailing view of cell differentiation in some tissues. For example, it has been suggested that mouse pancreas β cells self-renew without contribution of non–insulin-producing stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b002">2</xref>]. If confirmed, this would raise questions about our results, or about how these pancreatic cell populations avoid rampant somatic evolution and accompanying pathologies. Other interpretations of the evidence are possible, however. One hypothesis proposed by Dor et al. that is consistent with our results is that not only terminally differentiated β cells, but also unipotent β stem cells and TACs, produce insulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b002">2</xref>]. If this is true, then serial differentiation in a cryptic form may be present even in pancreas β cells, as our hypothesis would predict.</p><p>As another empirical test, the hematopoietic system is commonly assumed to involve self-renewing TACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b038">38</xref>]. We predict that closer study will reveal these morphologically indistinguishable cells to be functionally stratified into a series of non–self-renewing TAC stages. Our prediction is that when such a TAC divides, its daughter cells are one division closer to terminal differentiation than the parental cell. This must involve some form of “counter” for mitoses such that cells that are more generations removed from their ancestral somatic stem cell in the tissue are closer to terminal differentiation than are cells that are fewer generations removed from their ancestral stem cell. This prediction is supported by the observation that, although hematopoietic cells may appear to be self-renewing stem cells based on cell-surface markers, some have limited self-renewal capacity, as is typical of TACs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b039">39</xref>]. In solid tissues such as an intestinal crypt, the mitosis “counter” might be implemented by position in the tissue, as long as proliferating cells move up the gradient of differentiation when they divide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b040">40</xref>]. However, for the principles we have elucidated to apply, the functional sequence of differentiation stages need not correspond directly to physical location.</p><p>Perhaps the most important empirical counterexample to our hypothesis for the suppression of somatic selection is the adaptive immune system, which contains large cell populations that are both self-renewing and actively proliferating throughout life. The apparent reason for this exception to the general rule of serial differentiation is that the adaptive immune system depends on somatic evolution though clonal selection for its effectiveness ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b041">41</xref>], p. 15). According to our hypothesis, serial differentiation greatly slows somatic evolution in most tissues, forestalling its pathogenic consequences until old age. Because this is not true of the adaptive immune system, we would expect pathologies arising through somatic evolution to manifest at much earlier ages in these cell populations than in other tissues. Indeed, leukemia and lymphoma are unusual cancers in that they are relatively common at younger ages. Whether the adaptive immune system is also vulnerable to accelerated senescence relative to the rest of the body has not been closely investigated to our knowledge, but there are intriguing clues. The thymus is an important site of somatic selection in the adaptive immune system ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b042">42</xref>], p. 223), and it is known to atrophy beginning at puberty ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b042">42</xref>] p. 44). Thymectomized adult mice that received a transplanted thymus enjoyed improved immune function. However, the improvement was significantly greater when the donor was newborn versus 33 mo old ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b042">42</xref>] p. 45). This functional decline, even before the age of 3 y, could be due either to deleterious somatic evolution or to other causes. In humans, the decline in immune competence that occurs with aging is a serious clinical concern. Aging is associated not only with declining competence but also with dysregulation of immunity, including increasing autoimmune disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b043">43</xref>]. This is consistent with a possible failure to suppress inappropriate cell proliferation in the immune system, as might result from prolonged somatic evolution.</p><p>Other empirical predictions of our hypothesis can be tested with phylogenetic data. In organisms with high cell turnover, and thus great potential for somatic evolution, suppression of somatic selection through serial differentiation is especially critical. It is in such organisms that organismal selection should most strongly favor the effective but costly mechanism of DNA methylation as a means of maintaining the differentiated state in somatic cell lineages. This prediction has been met by analysis of taxonomic patterns in DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b032">32</xref>].</p><p>Another empirical prediction concerns body size. Whenever evolution has scaled organisms up from small and short-lived to larger and longer-lived, the potential for somatic evolution has increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b044">44</xref>]. Our model suggests that because somatic stem cells normally form a self-renewing cell compartment, they pose the highest carcinogenesis risk on a per-cell basis of any cells in a tissue. In our model, it is possible to increase the number of cells and the amount of cell turnover per organism without increasing the number or proliferative activity of somatic stem cells, simply by increasing the number of non-stem stages (<italic>n</italic>) as per <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi-0030250-e001">Equation 1</xref> above. This is what we would expect to see in comparisons between species with different body size. This prediction is consistent with previous theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b045">45</xref>] and also with data showing a lower ratio of stem to fully differentiated cells in the feline hematopoietic system relative to that of the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b046">46</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>General Medical Implications</title><p>If we are correct in our hypothesis for the control of somatic evolution through serial differentiation, it may have important medical implications. Both diseases involving uncontrolled cell proliferation (cancers), and those involving generalized loss of normal tissue function, are good candidates for conditions arising through the expression of unrestrained somatic selection. For this reason, research into the etiology of such diseases should include a focus on postembryonic patterns of cell differentiation.</p><p>If our hypothesis is correct, it may help in understanding why senescence and general loss of tissue function is a typical part of aging. Somatic evolution has been proposed as a fundamental source of senescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b025">25</xref>]. We have shown that serial differentiation can reduce somatic evolution, but not completely eliminate it. Some proliferation by stem cells is necessary, and self-renewal of TACs can arise by sporadic somatic mutations disrupting normal differentiation. Be slowing somatic evolution, serial differentiation may not entirely eliminate senescence but delay it until old age. This would suggest that conditions of accelerated senescence, or progeria syndromes, may result from a failure to suppress somatic evolution. In this regard, it is significant that patients with Hutchinson-Gilford progeria syndrome appear normal at birth, while the disease is usually diagnosed near the end of the second year of life after failure to thrive commences. This pattern suggests that in patients with this condition, fetal, but not postnatal, development is normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b047">47</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Implications for Cancer</title><p>The conventional wisdom is that cancer begins with genetic or epigenetic lesions causing excessive cell proliferation. The results presented here suggest a more nuanced picture of the dynamics of carcinogenesis. We have shown that in the context of normal serial differentiation, a genetic lesion causing excessive division by its host non-stem cell will not result in uncontrolled cell proliferation. On the other hand, a genetic lesion that has no direct effect on division rate, but that disrupts normal cell differentiation, may quickly lead to abnormal cell proliferation.</p><p>For purposes of prevention and early detection, it is critical to understand the earliest stages in carcinogenesis. Our results may be useful in this regard. It is clear that any cell population that is both actively proliferating and self-renewing is at high risk of somatic evolution and thus of carcinogenesis. It is also clear, however, that there are two distinct ways this situation may arise. One is that a (normal) self-renewing population of stem cells may acquire mutations that increase proliferation or reduce apoptosis. Such “selfish-cell” mutations will immediately be favored by selection among stem cells, and may rapidly go to fixation within the stem cell compartment if not lost by genetic drift. This route is facilitated by any factors that increase the rate of stem cell replication, including factors that are normal in themselves, such as wound healing and cyclic growth of breast and reproductive tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b049">49</xref>].</p><p>The second basic route to tumorigenesis begins with non-stem cells such as TACs. These compartments are normally large and proliferative but not self-renewing. Here, somatic selection among cells will not favor increased replication or survival unless preceded by an initiating mutation that blocks normal differentiation and thereby converts the resulting clone into a self-renewing population. After this initiating step, all further selfish-cell mutations will spread and accumulate through somatic selection. In contrast to the stem cell pathway, neoplasia originating in TACs is not facilitated simply by higher rates of cell turnover and proliferation. Instead, it is highly dependent on a specific class of mutations, and thus may be more stochastic and unpredictable, but also more dependent on mutagens that tend to target genes involved in cell differentiation.</p><p>It seems likely that distinguishing between these two distinctive pathways in early carcinogenesis may reconcile what could otherwise appear to be conflicting evidence about the earliest steps of tumorigenesis. Moreover, neoplasms resulting from these two different early pathways may retain persistent differences that are relevant to medical strategies for their detection and treatment. The potential importance of stem cells in tumorigenesis has received considerable attention recently, partly due to the recognition of cancer stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b050">50</xref>]. Some research models have therefore focused on the role of somatic stem cells and their differentiation patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b027">27</xref>]. Our results, however, emphasize that proliferating cells with a stem-like capacity for unlimited self-renewal can potentially arise from mutations in either stem cells or TACs.</p><p>The role in tumorigenesis of normal mechanisms for tissue homeostasis has received little attention, but our results suggest this might be a fruitful avenue of research.</p><p>One intriguing result of our model is that the structure of the feedback loops that maintain tissue homeostasis can have a dramatic impact on the probability that the tissue will develop cancer. Without any redundant checks on cell proliferation in this simplified model, a differentiation knockout mutation will generate uncontrolled growth if the mutant cell is not quickly cleared by stochastic background mortality. This single mutation generates uncontrolled proliferation, though an interaction with the negative feedback controlling the production of terminally differentiated cells. When a differentiation knockout mutant arises, that cell's progeny will no longer contribute to the terminally differentiated compartment. Thus, when the terminally differentiated compartment drops below equilibrium levels, stem cells and TACs are stimulated to proliferate, including the mutant. The mutant clone will grow, taking over more of its compartment and thereby further reducing the tissue's capacity to replenish the terminally differentiated cells. A vicious cycle ensues in which the more the mutant clone grows, the more the terminally differentiated compartment signals the need for more proliferation. The result is an exponential expansion of the mutant clone. These results are similar to those of a computational model of skin in which differentiation was based on distance from the basal membrane mediated through mechanical and adhesive forces in the tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b051">51</xref>]. Rashbass et al. found that disruption of the differentiation responses of the cells could lead to exponential cell growth. Of course, in a real tissue, the growth of the mutant clone would be limited by additional proliferative repression and by nutrient availability until further mutations could generate stimuli for neo-angiogenesis. Our model highlights the importance of the relatively understudied mechanisms of tissue homeostasis.</p><p>Based on our results, we predict that genetic lesions disrupting differentiation are often critical to tumor initiation. Because of the small size and low activity of somatic stem compartments, it seems unlikely that any tissue with serial differentiation would accumulate the mutations necessary for cancer unless differentiation was disrupted early in the process. Considerable evidence supports this view. For example, blocked differentiation is a frequent theme in the development of hematopoietic malignancies ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b052">52</xref>], p. 470). Similarly, lesions in <italic>APC,</italic> a gene involved in differentiation in crypts of the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b053">53</xref>], are considered “gatekeeper” lesions that initiate colonic adenomatous polyps and are necessary for the future development of colorectal cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b054">54</xref>]. In another tissue, recent genome-wide analyses have shown that most alterations in acute lymphoblastic leukemia target the B cell differentiation pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b055">55</xref>].</p><p>It is worth noting that many of the cell characteristics considered to be hallmarks of cancer are examples of “selfish-cell” traits that are favored by somatic selection when it is operating. These include traits that reduce intrinsic mortality rate, such as evasion of apoptosis, as well as traits that increase intrinsic division rate, such as self-sufficiency in growth signals and insensitivity to antigrowth signals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b056">56</xref>]. When we understand that somatic selection is the underlying process driving carcinogenesis, it is clearly no coincidence that “most if not all cancers have acquired the same set of functional capabilities during their development, albeit though various mechanistic strategies” ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b056">56</xref>] p. 59). Furthermore, when we understand the central role that disruption of normal differentiation plays in allowing somatic selection, this suggests that early loss of differentiation may eventually be recognized as one of the most fundamental, and earliest to appear, of the hallmarks of cancer. If true, this could point toward important directions in using genetic tests to screen for cancer, or even sporadic cancer risk, before the first directly observable symptoms appear.</p><p>One active area of cancer research involves the use of chemotherapeutic agents that act by promoting cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b057">57</xref>]. The feedback loops that maintain tissue homeostasis are likely to modulate the efficacy of these differentiation agents. It may be important to interrupt those feedback loops so as to prevent the cancer cells from increasing their proliferation rate to compensate for cells lost to differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b061">61</xref>].</p><p>Some of the ideas we have explored in this study have been raised previously in the specific context of carcinogenesis. Cairns proposed that the elaborate system of somatic stem cells, TACs, and terminally differentiated cells in a gastrointestinal crypt is an adaptation to suppress cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b020">20</xref>]. Mutations that occur in the TACs of a crypt are destined to be sloughed off in a matter of days [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b006">6</xref>]. Only the self-renewing stem cell population, or mutant cells that no longer differentiate properly, are vulnerable to mutations that may establish an expanding clone and become locally fixed. Somatic stem cells are typically quiescent and few in number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b062">62</xref>]. These traits may be organismal adaptations that both reduce the frequency of somatic mutations and limit the role of somatic selection relative to genetic drift in stem cell populations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b063">63</xref>]. We suggest that the structure of serial differentiation may be a general principle for the suppression of somatic evolution and thus neoplasia not just in gastrointestinal crypts but in all tissues with extensive cell proliferation. Even in the less physically structured hematopoietic system, serial differentiation may serve to limit somatic evolution.</p><p>Charlton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b064">64</xref>] proposed that somatic evolution underlies the pathogies of both cancer and senescence, but did not address how somatic evolution might have been avoided in people without these pathologies. The idea of somatic evolution has also been explored in some detail in the cancer biology literature: previous agent-based models of carcinogenesis have been used to explore theories of the clonal evolution that drives neoplastic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b065">65</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b069">69</xref>]. Mathematical models have also been used (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b070">70</xref>]). While these previous studies have all highlighted the detrimental effects of somatic evolution, they have not focused on the question of what normally suppresses somatic evolution, and thus have not completely explained what key turning points cause healthy tissue to become neoplastic.</p><p>Kirkland has developed a model of differentiation in the hematopoietic system that is conceptually similar to ours. In Kirkland's model, cell stages are not discrete, but rather, “stemness” is represented as a continuous variable [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b071">71</xref>]. A probability density function determines the stemness of daughter cells. Although “stemness” was represented as a continuous variable in Kirkland's model, and as a discrete variable in our model, the same principles apply in both, and both reached similar conclusions: if daughter cells can be as undifferentiated as the parent cell, then self-renewal occurs and the tissue is vulnerable to somatic evolution. Only tissues in which the daughter cells are more differentiated than the parental cell are protected from somatic evolution. The same concept also applies to theories of stem cell niches where extrinsic properties of the microenvironment determine the differentiation state of cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b072">72</xref>]. In this case, differentiation is determined by migration, and we would predict that non-stem cells should migrate out of but not into the stem cell niche.</p><p>Tomlinson and Bodmer also developed a similar model, with self-renewing compartments of stem cells, TACs, and differentiated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b028">28</xref>], which was extended to include homeostatic feedback mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b070">70</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b073">73</xref>]. In this model, failures of apoptosis or differentiation led either to clonal expansion to higher equilibrium cell numbers (benign tumors) or to extended exponential growth of the cell population (neoplasm). Nowak et al. showed that a linear model of a crypt, with a single stem cell and asymmetric division at all cell stages, limits somatic evolution and slows progression to cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b030">30</xref>]. Frank et al. also analyzed a model of a crypt in which stem cells and TACs could have different mutation and division rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b073">73</xref>]. They found that differences in mutation rates between the cell compartments changed the optimal proportion of cell divisions between the compartments to minimize somatic evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b073">73</xref>].</p><p>Several previous authors have proposed that the failure of cell differentiation plays an important role in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b060">60</xref>]. We have expanded on this idea by showing how cell differentiation prevents the onset of cell proliferation through controlling cells' selective environment and thereby suppressing somatic evolution. Similarly, several previous authors have recognized that somatic evolution occurs and is probably central to neoplastic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b076">76</xref>], and that tradeoffs in evolution and the selective pressure of cancer may have shaped multicellular genomes and bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030250-b031">31</xref>]. Here, we have shown how somatic evolution is normally controlled, and how that control can break down during the events preceding tumorigenesis. Finally, we have shown that the loss of differentiation interacts dramatically with the feedback loops that maintain tissue homeostasis and may lead to clonal expansion and carcinogenesis.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="methods"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>The model.</title><p>To investigate the role of cell differentiation in somatic evolution, we developed a simplified model of the evolutionary dynamics of cells within a tissue of an adult organism.

(Instead, the current differentiation stage was directly inherited without being incremented in various scenarios of self-renewing compartments described below, including stem cells, self-renewing TACs, and mutant TACs with differentiation knockouts.)

We varied the number of cell stages in the model from just one stage (nondifferentiating tissue) to seven cell stages (stem cells, terminally differentiated cells, and five intervening TAC stages).</p><p>We also used mutation experiments to study the effects of differentiation knockout mutations (see Mutations that Disrupt Differentiation). In Experiment 4, we allowed stochastic mutations to disrupt differentiation pathways at a rate of 10<sup>−4</sup> mutations per cell division. This mutation was heritable upon cell division, so that it prevented further differentiation in the entire resulting clone. We stopped the simulation run when either the clock reached 10,000 timesteps or the total cell number reached ten times the initial level, which we interpreted as the initiation of a neoplasm. Each experiment was replicated at least 100 times.</p></sec></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank the Santa Fe Institute for the stimulating environment in which this work was inspired and begun.</p></ack><glossary><title>Abbreviations</title><def-list><def-item><term>OR</term><def><p>odds ratio</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>RR</term><def><p>relative risk</p></def></def-item><def-item><term>TAC</term><def><p>transient amplifying cell</p></def></def-item></def-list></glossary><ref-list><title>References</title><ref id="pcbi-0030250-b001"><label>1</label><element-citation publication-type="journal" xlink:type="simple">
