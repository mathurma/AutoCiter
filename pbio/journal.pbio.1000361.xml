<p>Small "priming" quantities of type I interferon enhance cellular responses to type II interferon by maintaining basal levels of STAT1, explaining the observed crosstalk between these two cytokines.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Autocrine priming of cells by small quantities of constitutively produced type I interferon (IFN) is a well-known phenomenon. In the absence of type I IFN priming, cells display attenuated responses to other cytokines, such as anti-viral protection in response to IFNγ. This phenomenon was proposed to be because IFNα/β receptor1 (IFNAR1) is a component of the IFNγ receptor (IFNGR), but our new data are more consistent with a previously proposed model indicating that regulated expression of STAT1 may also play a critical role in the priming process. Initially, we noticed that DNA binding activity of STAT1 was attenuated in <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> fibroblasts because they expressed lower levels of STAT1 than <italic>wild-type</italic> cells. However, expression of STAT1 was rescued by culturing <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> fibroblasts in media conditioned by <italic>wild-type</italic> fibroblasts suggesting they secreted a STAT1-inducing factor. The STAT1-inducing factor in fibroblast-conditioned media was IFNβ, as it was inhibited by antibodies to IFNAR1, or when IFNβ expression was knocked down in <italic>wild-type</italic> cells. IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> fibroblasts, which cannot respond to this priming, also expressed reduced levels of STAT1, which correlated with their poor responses to IFNγ. The lack of priming in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> fibroblasts was compensated by over-expression of STAT1, which rescued molecular responses to IFNγ and restored the ability of IFNγ to induce protective anti-viral immunity. This study provides a comprehensive description of the molecular events involved in priming by type I IFN. Adding to the previous working model that proposed an interaction between type I and II IFN receptors, our work and that of others demonstrates that type I IFN primes IFNγ-mediated immune responses by regulating expression of STAT1. This may also explain how type I IFN can additionally prime cells to respond to a range of other cytokines that use STAT1 (e.g., IL-6, M-CSF, IL-10) and suggests a potential mechanism for the changing levels of STAT1 expression observed during viral infection.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cells of the immune system release interferons (IFNs) in response to pathogens or tumor cells; these proteins signal to other immune cells to initiate the body's defense mechanisms. The two classes of IFNs—types I and II—have different receptors and distinct effects on the cells; however, there is “crosstalk” between them. In particular, small quantities of type I IFN can “prime” cells to produce a robust response to type II IFN. In this paper, we provide evidence to explain the molecular basis of this crosstalk. We show that continuous expression of the transcriptional activator c-Jun is responsible for producing basal, priming levels of a type I IFN; this signals to immune cells with the type I IFN receptor (IFNAR1) to maintain expression of STAT1 inside these cells. STAT1 is a key factor for immune cell responses to type II IFN. Thus, signaling by low levels of type I IFN primes the cells with sufficient STAT1 to respond robustly to a subsequent type II IFN signal. This work provides an alternative explanation of the priming phenomenon to a previous proposal that the ligand-bound type I receptor, IFNAR1, acts as a component of the type II IFN receptor.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although type I and type II interferons (IFNs) have distinct roles in immune responses, there is substantial overlap between the genes and cellular responses they regulate. It has been known for some time that many cells secrete small priming quantities of type I IFNs that facilitate more potent responses to subsequent stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Vogel1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Marie1">[3]</xref>. Moreover, cellular responses to CSF-1 or IFNγ can be affected by neutralizing type I IFN antibodies or knockout of type I IFN-Receptors (IFNAR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Hamilton1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Muller1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>. Notably, the protective anti-viral effects of IFNγ were much less potent in <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> than <italic>wild-type</italic> fibroblasts which appeared to be caused by a lack of type I IFN priming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Muller1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>. The molecular events that underpin these priming events have not been fully characterized, although it has been proposed that type I and II IFNs shared receptor components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>. However, as the majority of responses to type I and II IFNs require the expression of the STAT1 transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Durbin1">[6]</xref>, this is also a possible point of crosstalk between them.</p>
<p>STAT1 is a key mediator of cytokine-induced gene expression as it is activated either as homo- or heterodimer with other STATs by many cytokines including type I and type II IFNs, interleukin (IL)-6 and IL-10. STAT1 activity is of particular importance to the IFN system as STAT1<sup>−/−</sup> mice display many similar phenotypes to mice lacking IFNAR1 or the IFN Receptor (IFNGR)1. In particular, anti-viral, anti-mycobacterial, and anti-tumor responses are compromised <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Durbin1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Shankaran1">[9]</xref>. Induction of STAT1 expression is a potential explanation for the priming activity of type I IFN because it is an IFN-stimulated gene (ISG) itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Pine1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Der1">[12]</xref> and its 5′ promoter region contains an IRF/gamma activated sequence (GAS) element bound by IFN-stimulated transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Wong1">[13]</xref>. Inducing the expression of STAT1 would increase the pool of this factor available for activation by IFNγ. Consistent with such a hypothesis, low expression of STAT1 correlated with IFN-resistance in melanoma samples when compared to surrounding normal tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Wong2">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>In unstimulated cells, STAT1 resides in the cytoplasm as a latent factor that is activated by a series of post-translational modifications initiated when it is recruited to cytokine receptors following receptor ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Levy1">[15]</xref>. At the receptor, STAT1 is phosphorylated on tyrosine 701, by Janus family kinase (JAK)s, which facilitates its dimerization either with other STAT1 molecules or other STAT proteins depending on the cytokine receptor. In addition, STAT1 proteins are phosphorylated on serine 727 prior to nuclear translocation which is essential for their full transcriptional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Sadzak1">[16]</xref>. Conversely, STAT1 activity is negatively regulated by phosphatases, SOCS proteins, and the SUMO ligase Protein Inhibitor of Activated STAT (PIAS)1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Levy1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recently, in the course of our studies on IFNγ-activated AP-1 DNA binding, we noticed that IFNγ-induced GAS DNA binding was suppressed in <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> cells compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Gough1">[17]</xref> and this correlated reduced levels of STAT1 in <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> cells. The level of STAT1 expression in <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> murine embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) were restored to <italic>wild-type</italic> levels following culture in media conditioned by <italic>wild-type</italic> fibroblasts suggesting that <italic>c-Jun</italic> deficiency caused the disruption of an autocrine/paracrine loop that regulated STAT1 expression. The STAT1-inducing component of media conditioned by <italic>wild-type</italic> fibroblasts was IFNβ, because the activity could be blocked by neutralizing antibodies directed against type I IFN and antibodies used were raised against IFNAR and attenuated by targeted knockdown of IFNβ by RNA interference (RNAi). While c-Jun has been demonstrated to co-operate with ATF-2, IRF-3, and NFκB for virus-induced production of IFNβ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Maniatis1">[18]</xref>, to our knowledge our studies are the first to demonstrate that c-Jun is necessary for basal expression of low-level IFNβ. Fibroblasts in which this autocrine/paracrine loop was disrupted by the loss of components of type I IFN receptors also express lower levels of STAT1. As many biological functions of IFN require STAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Durbin1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Meraz1">[7]</xref>, this suggested that previous observations of attenuated responses to IFN in IFNAR1<sup>−/−</sup> cells may be related to the reduced STAT1 expression that has been observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Fleetwood1">[19]</xref>. Consistent with this hypothesis, restoring STAT1 expression in <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> fibroblasts rescued IFNγ-induced gene transcription and anti-viral properties.</p>
<p>In summary, this study provides evidence of an autocrine/paracrine stimulatory loop that requires the expression of c-Jun, IFNβ, and IFNAR to regulate the expression of STAT1. Importantly, this basal IFNβ production occurs via a mechanism distinct from the pathogen-stimulated IFNβ production mediated by IRF and NFκB pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Maniatis1">[18]</xref>. One model to explain crosstalk between type I and II IFNs states that type I and II IFN-R physically interact in a ligand-dependant manner, such that the presence of type I IFNs is essential for a fully competent IFNγ response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>. Herein, we demonstrated that attenuated IFNγ-mediated gene induction and an associated defective anti-viral response to IFNγ that is observed in IFNAR1-deficient cells can be rescued by re-expressing STAT1 and is therefore independent of IFNAR1. We propose that an alternative model to explain the functional synergy between type I and II IFNs is based on the regulated expression of STAT1 via c-Jun-mediated production of basal levels of IFNβ.</p>

<title>STAT1 Expression Is Attenuated in c-Jun<sup>−/−</sup> MEFs</title>

<title>Constitutive Secretion of IFNβ Maintains Basal Expression of STAT1</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Herein we demonstrate that c-Jun is essential for the constitutive production of small quantities of IFNβ that initiates autocrine or paracrine feedback loops required to maintain the expression of STAT1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000361-g008">Figure 8</xref>). This system was disrupted either by c-Jun deficiency, which prevents production of IFNβ, or by IFNAR deficiency, which affects the ability of cells to respond to the autocrine stimulus. Consistent with our data, others found that cells lacking IFNβ also express much lower levels of STAT1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Thomas1">[22]</xref> and virus-mediated induction of STAT1 is dependent on type I IFN signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Miyagi1">[11]</xref>. As IFNγ signaling is attenuated when the autocrine stimulus is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000361-g008">Figure 8</xref>) but restored by adding back STAT1, it appears the level of STAT1 expressed by the cell determines the response of the cell to other cytokines. These results suggested the ability of IFNγ to induce a protective anti-viral state was due to the type I IFN-mediated maintenance of STAT1 expression rather than the recruitment of IFNAR1 into the IFNγR complex as has been previously proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>. These findings define a novel mechanism through which STAT1-mediated signals can be regulated and highlight the importance of crosstalk between type I and II IFNs for anti-viral immunity.</p>

<p>It has been known for some time that, as well as being produced in large quantities following viral infections, cells can secrete low levels of type I IFN constitutively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Vogel1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Hamilton1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Hata1">[27]</xref>. Virus-induced activation of the IFNβ enhanceasome is one of the best-characterized transcriptional modules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Maniatis1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Falvo1">[23]</xref>. Viral activation of the IFNβ promoter involves the binding of NFκB, IRF3, and ATF2/c-Jun complexes to a series of DNA elements termed PRD I-IV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Falvo1">[23]</xref>. In this setting, c-Jun binds to PRD IV of the promoter and facilitates co-operative binding of the other factors. Removing PRD IV from the promoter, or even reversing its orientation, has a major impact on the transcriptional activity of the promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Falvo1">[23]</xref>, suggesting the role of c-Jun is critical in the context of viral infection. In contrast, little is known of the molecular mechanisms of constitutive type I IFN production. Our study indicates that PRD IV of the IFNβ promoter is occupied by c-Jun even in “resting” cultured cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000361-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This requirement for c-Jun explains why we found that constitutive IFNβ production and hence the expression of STAT1 was attenuated in <italic>c-Jun</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> cells. In addition to regulating basal expression of IFNβ, we have recently demonstrated that c-Jun is activated following IFNγ treatment and may also play a direct role in regulating the expression of a subset of IFNγ-responsive genes (ISGs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Gough1">[17]</xref>. Indeed we identified ISGs that were dependent on c-Jun for induction by IFNγ, others that required STAT1, and others that required both c-Jun and STAT1 for increased expression following treatment with IFNγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Gough1">[17]</xref>. These results, coupled with the functional data provided herein, highlight the complex molecular interplay between c-Jun and canonical mediators of type I and II IFN signaling such as STAT1 in regulating a comprehensive response to IFN treatment.</p>
<p>Takaoka and colleagues previously demonstrated the importance of IFNβ in the production of an IFNγ-mediated anti-viral response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>. In that paper the authors showed that <italic>IFNβ</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs were defective in mounting an IFNγ-induced antiviral response. These data mirror what we have demonstrated herein where we show that <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> MEFs show a similar defect in mounting an IFNγ-induced antiviral response. However, we showed that restoring STAT1 expression in <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells significantly rescued the ability of IFNγ to protect cells against EMCV, suggesting that regulating the levels of STAT1 expression through the autocrine loop may play an important role in responses to this challenge. The ability of type I and II IFNs to co-operate, for example, in treatment of melanoma tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Dezfouli1">[28]</xref> or priming of macrophage cytotoxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Pace1">[29]</xref> has long been recognized. Interestingly, at a cellular level, <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> cells were known to have an anomalously poor response to IFNγ with respect to induction of GAS DNA binding, induction of gene expression, and protection against the cytopathic effects of EMCV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Muller1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Owczarek1">[25]</xref>. IFNγ function is not entirely compromised in <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> animals because <italic>IFNGR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mice have distinct phenotypic differences from <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-vandenBroek1">[30]</xref>. Inhibiting autocrine priming by type I IFN does not only affect signaling by IFNγ. Therefore its is not surprising that IL-6 signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Mitani1">[31]</xref> and CSF-1 signaling are affected by inhibiting priming by type I IFN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Hamilton1">[2]</xref> and that signals induced by IL-10 can be affected by priming with IFNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Sharif1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>It was proposed that the ligand-bound IFNAR1 chain acts as a component of the IFNGR and promotes recruitment of STAT1 to the IFNGR because IFN receptors are clustered within caveolar membrane fractions to facilitate their association <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Takaoka1">[5]</xref>. Such a hypothesis is inconsistent with mapping of the docking site of STAT1 to the IFNAR2 chain of the type I IFN-R rather than the IFNAR1 as specified by the shared receptor model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Zhao1">[33]</xref>.

Our model not only explains the inability of IFNγ to prime <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> cells for an anti-viral response and the rescue of IFNγ function in <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> cells by STAT1α expression but also the attenuated responses to other cytokines, such as IL-6 and CSF-1, observed in <italic>IFNAR1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Hamilton1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Mitani1">[31]</xref> and predicts they may also be rescued by expression of STAT1. As IFNγ function was not entirely recovered following re-expression of STAT1 in <italic>IFNAR</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> cells, we cannot exclude that the shared receptor mechanism makes a contribution, but there are other reasons why reconstitution of STAT1 may not have fully rescued IFNγ function. These include the absence of other as yet unidentified signal transducing proteins from cells of this genotype.</p>
<p>The level of STAT1 expression in cells can have functional consequences with respect to immune responses. In response to viral infection, Ag-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells express peak levels of STAT1 for a shorter period of time than CD4<sup>+</sup> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Gil1">[34]</xref>. This decreased sensitivity to IFN-induced growth inhibition allows expansion of Ag-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> cells while the proliferation of cells with higher STAT1 is inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Gil1">[34]</xref>. The relative amounts of different STATs can also affect the biological responses to cytokines. For example STAT1:3 and STAT1:4 ratios have been shown to alter cellular responses, and thus regulating the levels of these transcription factors will affect the outcome of immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Miyagi1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Qing1">[35]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our previous studies revealed that loss of IFN signaling abrogated the immune-mediated neo-natal lethality of SOCS1<sup>−/−</sup> deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Alexander1">[36]</xref>, and more recently we discovered that deleting <italic>IFNAR1</italic> also rescued this pathology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000361-Fenner1">[37]</xref> to a level equivalent to <italic>SOCS1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> <italic>IFN<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup>. Although SOCS1 directly regulated type I IFN signaling, another reason why <italic>IFNAR1</italic> deficiency can protect SOCS1<sup>−/−</sup> animals may be the similarities and crosstalk between type I and II IFN signaling pathways. These data highlight the patho-physiological importance and mechanism of crosstalk between type I and II IFN that are important considerations in understanding the contributions of individual cytokines to host defense and in their therapeutic targeting.</p>
