<p>This study uses an RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> to identify a UBX protein, Armless, as a novel positive regulator of the important Wingless/Wnt signaling pathway, acting to stabilize Armadillo/?-Catenin by antagonizing its turnover.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The Wingless (Wg/Wnt) signaling pathway is essential for metazoan development, where it is central to tissue growth and cellular differentiation. Deregulated Wg pathway activation underlies severe developmental abnormalities, as well as carcinogenesis. Armadillo/β-Catenin plays a key role in the Wg transduction cascade; its cytoplasmic and nuclear levels directly determine the output activity of Wg signaling and are thus tightly controlled. In all current models, once Arm is targeted for degradation by the Arm/β-Catenin destruction complex, its fate is viewed as set. We identified a novel Wg/Wnt pathway component, Armless (Als), which is required for Wg target gene expression in a cell-autonomous manner. We found by genetic and biochemical analyses that Als functions downstream of the destruction complex, at the level of the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase. In the absence of Als, Arm levels are severely reduced. We show by biochemical and in vivo studies that Als interacts directly with Ter94, an AAA ATPase known to associate with E3 ligases and to drive protein turnover. We suggest that Als antagonizes Ter94's positive effect on E3 ligase function and propose that Als promotes Wg signaling by rescuing Arm from proteolytic degradation, spotlighting an unexpected step where the Wg pathway signal is modulated.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The Wg/Wnt signaling pathway, found in most animals, is essential for regulating tissue growth and the formation of different cell types during development. Defects in the Wg/Wnt signaling relay can have serious consequences, ranging from aberrant organ patterning to malignant tumor formation. A pivotal step in the transmission of the Wg/Wnt signal is the stabilization of the protein Armadillo/β-Catenin, a key component of the pathway. However, the means by which the levels of this protein are regulated remain unclear. Here, we describe a novel control point of Armadillo/β-Catenin levels. Using RNA interference, we performed a screen in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and identified Armless, a protein whose biological function was previously unknown, as a novel regulator of Wg/Wnt signaling, essential for the Wg/Wnt-dependent expression of downstream target genes. Our experiments suggest that Armless interferes with the tagging of Armadillo/β-Catenin with ubiquitin, thereby sparing it from proteasomal degradation. We also show that Armless directly interacts in vivo with Ter94, a ubiquitous ATPase involved in protein turnover. Our results suggest that Armless antagonizes Ter94's function in protein turnover, thereby acting as a positive regulator of Wg/Wnt signaling by promoting the stabilization of Armadillo/β-Catenin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The <italic>wingless</italic> (<italic>wg</italic>) gene was found nearly forty years ago with the characterization of a <italic>Drosophila</italic> mutant without wings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Sharma1">[1]</xref>. The gene encodes a secreted glycoprotein, the founding member of the Wnt family of signaling proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Rijsewijk1">[2]</xref>. In the decades following its discovery, Wg/Wnt signaling has been shown to be essential during embryogenesis. Indeed, it is important throughout an organism's life, controlling also the homeostasis of different organs, for example, regeneration of epithelial cells in the intestine—the aberrant behavior of these cells in cancer is caused by constitutive Wg/Wnt signaling, which is consequently a key focus of medical and translational research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Klaus1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Clevers1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>The relay of the Wg signal is controlled at different levels. However, the pivotal step is the regulation of the levels of Armadillo (Arm)/β-Catenin, the key transducer of the Wg/Wnt pathway. A multiprotein complex consisting of the scaffold proteins Axin and APC and the kinases Shaggy/GSK3β and Casein kinase I (CKI) recruits and phosphorylates Arm/β-Catenin. This marks Arm/β-Catenin for ubiquitination by the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase and subsequent degradation by the ubiquitin-proteasome system (UPS). When Wg/Wnt binds its receptors at the cell membrane, degradation of Arm/β-Catenin is prevented, presumably by protein interactions that lead to the dissociation of the E3 ubiquitin ligase from the Arm/β-Catenin destruction complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Li1">[5]</xref>. As a consequence, Arm/β-Catenin translocates into the nucleus, where it adopts its role as a transcriptional effector of Wg/Wnt signaling. Although this step is crucial, and is a potential point of regulation, little is known about the players involved in the processing of Arm/β-Catenin and its ultimate degradation.</p>
<p>In a genome-wide RNA interference (RNAi) screen we isolated Armless (Als) as a regulator of proximodistal growth of <italic>Drosophila</italic> limbs, and show in subsequent analyses that it exerts its function in the Wg pathway. Detailed genetic studies demonstrate that Als acts downstream of the destruction complex, at the level of the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase. Cells depleted for Als exhibit strongly reduced Arm protein levels. Importantly, the activity of a constitutively active form of Arm, Arm<sup>S10</sup>, which cannot be phosphorylated and hence escapes ubiquitination and proteasomal degradation, is insensitive to depletion of Als. Using immunopurification and mass spectrometry analysis we found that Ter94 interacts with Als. Ter94 is an AAA ATPase associated with protein turnover and proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Schuberth1">[6]</xref>. In sum, our data suggest that Als acts downstream of the Arm/β-Catenin destruction complex to positively regulate Arm protein levels, possibly by rescuing Arm from ubiquitination via Slimb. The human ortholog of Als, UBXN6, can substitute for Als in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and Wnt target gene expression was impaired upon knock-down of UBXN6 in HEK-293 cells. We thus infer that Als and UBXN6 represent regulators of a conserved mechanism that ensures appropriate levels of Armadillo/β-Catenin by antagonizing its entry into the UPS.</p>

<title><italic>CG5469/armless</italic> Is Required for Wing Growth</title>
<p>Among its numerous developmental roles, Wg controls growth and patterning of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing. A hallmark phenotype of reduced <italic>wg</italic> function is nicked wings with reduced size. Positively acting components of the Wg pathway mostly display similar phenotypes when depleted via RNAi during larval stages. We established and used a tester system that allowed screening for genes involved in wing growth and margin formation. Our screen covered approximately 83% of all the predicted 14,306 genes of <italic>Drosophila</italic>. The details of the screen will be published elsewhere. <italic>CG5469</italic> behaved as expected of a putative Wg signaling component: RNAi targeting its transcripts affected wing size in a non-allometric manner and caused a notched margin and loss of sensory bristles. This phenotype could be reproduced by the expression of nine independent <italic>UAS-CG5469<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lines with different Gal4 drivers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g001">Figures 1B–1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s001">S1A–S1J</xref>). Expression of <italic>CG5469<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> effectively reduced mRNA levels of <italic>CG5469</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s001">Figure S1L</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g001">Figure 1B–1E</xref>), and haplo-deficiency exacerbated the wing phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s001">Figure S1M and S1N</xref>); these phenotypes were rescued upon overexpression of <italic>CG5469</italic>, as detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s012">Text S1</xref> and shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s002">Figure S2</xref>.</p>

<p>Wing notches could be caused by increased apoptosis or reduced cell proliferation. To discriminate between these possibilities, we experimentally accelerated cell divisions by <italic>string/cdc25</italic> overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Neufeld1">[7]</xref>, and inhibited apoptosis by Diap1 overexpression. Only <italic>string/cdc25</italic> overexpression restored marginal wing tissue loss caused by depletion of <italic>CG5469</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s003">Figure S3F</xref>). This finding is consistent with a role of <italic>CG5469</italic> in Wg signaling, as impaired Wg pathway activity affects primarily proliferation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s003">Figure S3A–S3C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Couso1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Giraldez1">[9]</xref>). Because of its mutant phenotypes, which are caused by severely reduced levels of Arm (see below), we refer to <italic>CG5469</italic> as <italic>armless (als</italic>; for the nomenclature see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s012">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title><italic>als</italic> Interacts with the Wg Pathway and Is Required for Wg Target Gene Expression</title>
<p>To further test whether <italic>als</italic> interacts with Wg signaling, we analyzed the effects of <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in different, sensitized backgrounds. Interfering with the Wg pathway at various levels leads to typical wing margin notches and loss of distal wing tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s003">Figure S3G–S3J</xref>). These phenotypes were enhanced upon <italic>als</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s003">Figure S3G</xref>′–S3J′). To test whether <italic>als</italic> is also involved in the Wg pathway in other developmental contexts, we expressed <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in the primordia of the dorsal thorax and the legs. Again, consistent with a role of <italic>als</italic> in the Wg pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4D and S4H</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Phillips1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Neumann1">[11]</xref>), thorax and scutellum sizes were affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4B, S4C, S4F</xref>, and S4G, cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), and showed reduced or missing microchaete, a slight misorientation of remnant micro- and macrochaete, and mild thoracic clefts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4B and S4C</xref>). Depletion of <italic>als</italic> in the leg discs caused a reduction of tarsal segments along the proximodistal axis and a dorsolateral shift of the sex combs—phenotypes characteristic of reduced Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4J–S4M</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Couso2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Brunner1">[13]</xref>). Stronger <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> expression caused a dorsalization of the leg as judged from the mirror-image patterning of leg trichomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4K and S4M</xref>). To analyze the phenotype at earlier stages of development, we expressed <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> or Als<sup>HA</sup> (a dominant-negative-like version; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s012">Text S1</xref>) in the embryo with <italic>da-Gal4</italic>. We found that cuticles were shorter than in control embryos, with ventral denticle belts partially fused, which is indicative of a segment polarity defect (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4S–S4V, S4X, and S4Y</xref>). These phenotypes are reminiscent of milder Wg loss-of-function phenotypes caused by <italic>arm<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> or <italic>UAS-Lgs<sup>17E</sup></italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4P–S4R and S4W</xref>) by <italic>da-Gal4</italic>.</p>
<p>To further test whether <italic>als</italic> is required for Wg signaling output, we monitored the expression of well-known Wg target genes. Wg is secreted from a stripe of cells at the dorsoventral (D/V) border and triggers a transcriptional response in cells along the D/V axis of imaginal wing discs (the future proximodistal axis of the adult wing). Wg activates the proneural gene <italic>senseless (sens)</italic> in sensory organ precursors, which develop into the bristles of the adult wing margin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Couso1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Blair1">[14]</xref>. <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> expression in the P-compartment resulted in a loss of Sens therein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g002">Figure 2A and 2A′</xref>). Expression of Distalless (Dll), <italic>frizzled3</italic> (<italic>fz3</italic>), and <italic>wingful (wf)</italic>, which are activated by Wg in a broader region centered on the D/V border <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Sato1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Sivasankaran1">[16]</xref>, was strongly reduced or lost in response to reduction of <italic>als</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g002">Figure 2B–2E</xref>). Conversely, <italic>arrow (arr)</italic>, which is normally repressed by Wg signaling in central pouch regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g002">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Wehrli1">[17]</xref>), became ectopically activated towards the central wing pouch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). In sum, these observations strongly suggest that <italic>als</italic> encodes a component with a positive role in the Wg pathway.</p>

<p>To try to gain insight into the pathways <italic>als</italic> might regulate, we further looked at <italic>als</italic> expression. In situ hybridization and <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter transgenes indicated that <italic>als</italic> is expressed at early third instar wing imaginal discs at the center of the pouch adjacent to the D/V border and, at faint levels, throughout the wing primordium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s005">Figure S5A–S5C</xref>). Furthermore, the expression of <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in the P-compartment of wing imaginal discs caused a strong decrease in <italic>als</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s005">Figure S5B</xref>, inset). Interestingly, although normal when Wg signaling is inhibited, <italic>als</italic> expression could be upregulated when Wg signaling was activated by the overexpression of either Wg or Arm<sup>S10</sup>, and stimulation of Wg signaling by the inhibition of GSK3β caused elevated Als and <italic>als</italic> levels (Figures S5D and 8A). This is consistent with <italic>als</italic> functioning in the Wg pathway and having its activity fine-tuned by feedback mechanisms that ensure maximum pathway activity.</p>

<title><italic>als</italic> Is Not Required for Notch or Hedgehog Signaling</title>
<p>Wing notching is a phenotype characteristic not only of impaired Wg signaling, but also of reduced Notch signaling. The activities of both pathways are required to establish the D/V border and subsequent proximodistal wing growth. To determine whether <italic>als</italic> also plays a role in the Notch pathway, we analyzed the expression of the following Notch targets: (1) the proneural gene <italic>e(spl)m8</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Kramatschek1">[18]</xref>), (2) a Notch responsive element (NRE) reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6A</xref> inset; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Furriols1">[19]</xref>), and (3) the <italic>vestigial (vg)</italic> “boundary enhancer” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Kim1">[20]</xref>). In contrast to what we observed for the Wg targets above, the expression patterns of these Notch reporters were unaltered upon <italic>als</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6A</xref>′–S6B″). Moreover, neither did reduction of <italic>als</italic> function suppress the phenotypes caused by elevated Notch signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6D and S6F</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6C and S6E</xref>), nor did it ever mimic a neurogenic thorax phenotype or fused tarsal segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s004">Figure S4</xref>), which are both typical for reduced Notch signaling. Finally, we monitored the expression of the <italic>wg</italic> gene itself, which is under control of Notch activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-DiazBenjumea1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-deCelis1">[23]</xref>. Neither <italic>wg</italic> transcription nor Wg protein expression were affected at the D/V boundary upon <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s007">Figure S7A–S7G</xref>).</p>
<p>We also tested other pathways involved in wing growth and patterning, such as Hedgehog (Hh) signaling. Increased Hh signaling causes wing overgrowth predominantly along the anteroposterior (A/P) axis, along with ectopic veins in the A-compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6G</xref>). <italic>als</italic> depletion impaired wing growth along the proximodistal axis, which is under control of Wg signaling, but not along the A/P axis, and it did not alter the vein patterning defects caused by increased Hh signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6H</xref>). Furthermore, expression of the Hh target gene <italic>patched (ptc)</italic> was not affected by <italic>als</italic> depletion (Figures S6I, S6J, and 8E). In addition, we tested Upd/Jak/Stat signaling and EGFR/Ras signaling and found that none of these pathways was affected by <italic>als</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s006">Figure S6K–S6N</xref>). Our findings therefore suggest a specific role for <italic>als</italic> in Wg signaling in the tissues that we have tested.</p>

<p>To investigate whether Als functions in Wg producing or receiving cells, <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> was expressed in clones of wing imaginal cells marked by GFP co-expression. Expression of the Wg target Sens was lost in early induced clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g003">Figure 3A–3A″</xref>). This effect is cell-autonomous, i.e., it also occurs when mutant cells are close to wild-type cells that produce Wg. Adult wing clones, marked by <italic>UAS</italic>-<italic>forked<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> co-expression, had wing notches and thickened veins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g003">Figure 3B–3E</xref>), both of which were tightly associated with mutant cells. We observed similar phenotypes when Wg signaling was cell-autonomously impaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g003">Figure 3F–3I</xref>).</p>

<p>To map where Als acts in the Wg pathway, we used phenotypic assays based on the activation or inactivation of Wg signaling in the eye or the wing. Expression of Wg under control of the <italic>sevenless (sev)</italic> enhancer causes small, narrow eyes that lack interommatidial bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g004">Figure 4B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Brunner2">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Bnziger1">[25]</xref>). This phenotype is partially suppressed when Wg signal transduction is hindered, for example, by the expression of a dominant-negative form of Lgs (Lgs<sup>17E</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Kramps1">[26]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g004">Figure 4G</xref>).

<p>We manipulated the Wg signaling cascade in the wing and the eye at successively more downstream positions and assessed the requirement of Als for the manifestation of the respective Wg gain-of-signaling phenotypes (see legend of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5</xref> for a detailed description of phenotypes). First, we found that Als depletion suppressed Wg pathway activation caused by RNAi of <italic>notum/wingful</italic> (encoding an extracellular inhibitor of Wg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Giraldez2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Gerlitz1">[29]</xref>) or by overexpression of Arrow (co-receptor of Wg, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Wehrli1">[17]</xref>) or Dishevelled (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5A–5B′, 5L, and 5L′</xref>). Next, we tested knock-downs of components of the destruction complex, both in the wing and the eye, and found that aberrant Wg output was suppressed by <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> for Axin, APC, and Shaggy/GSK3β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5C, 5C′, 5D, 5D′, 5H–5K′, 5M, and 5M′</xref>). Only the phenotypes of RNAi against the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 ubiquitin ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Jiang1">[30]</xref> and expression of Arm<sup>S10</sup>, a constitutively active form of Arm/β-Catenin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Pai1">[31]</xref>, could not be ameliorated by <italic>als</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5E–5F′ and 5O–5Q′</xref>). Interestingly, wild-type Arm could not overcome the <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes in the wing and the eye, and did not lead to the emergence of ectopic sensory bristles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5G, 5G′, 5R, and 5R′</xref>). We interpret these genetic findings to indicate that Als functions upstream of Arm, but downstream of the Arm/β-Catenin destruction complex, possibly at the level of the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase.</p>

<title><italic>als</italic> Encodes a UBX Domain Protein That Localizes in the Cell Cortex and Depends on a Functional PUG-Domain</title>
<p>Three different protein domains can be distinguished within Als: (1) an N-terminal coiled-coil domain, (2) a PUG domain, and (3) a UBX domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Coiled-coil domains function in protein oligomerization, whereas the PUG und UBX domains are found in ubiquitin regulatory proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Doerks1">[32]</xref>. To find out more about its molecular role, we tested where Als localizes within cells and which of its protein domains are functionally required. N-terminally tagged <sup>HA</sup>Als localized close to the cell membrane in a punctate ring pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s008">Figure S8A–S8B′</xref>), with strongest expression in the apical region of the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s008">Figure S8C, S8D, S8E</xref>). This localization is reminiscent of that of E-Cadherin, Arm, and the Wg receptor Frizzled2 (Fz2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s008">Figure S8C–S8E″</xref>). We then expressed Als protein variants that lacked particular domains and assessed whether these could rescue the <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes. For this we created tagged and untagged constructs that were either sensitive or insensitive to the RNAi used. Expression of Als<sup>ΔN</sup> and Als<sup>ΔPUG</sup> did not alter the <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s009">Figure S9A–S9I</xref>), irrespective of their tag or targetability. However, expression of Als<sup>ΔUBX</sup> as well as full-length Als protein substantially rescued the wing phenotypes caused by <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s009">Figure S9J–S9L</xref>). This suggests that the UBX domain is dispensable for Als function, whereas the N-terminal and the PUG domains are both important. The requirement of the PUG domain implicates Als in playing a role in a ubiquitin-mediated protein degradation process.</p>

<title>Als Interacts with Ter94, a Conserved ATPase Involved in Protein Turnover</title>
<p>To further our understanding of Als function, we expressed HA-tagged variants of Als in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc-167 cells, and after affinity purification we subjected the samples to shotgun liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry (LC-MS/MS). In three independent experiments using Als<sup>HA</sup>, <sup>HA</sup>Als, and <sup>HA</sup>Als<sup>ΔUBX</sup>, but not in the negative control sample, we identified Ter94 as the highest ranking protein interactor of Als (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s012">Text S1</xref>), irrespective of the stimulation of the Wg pathway by Wg. Ter94 is the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog of p97, an AAA ATPase found to be associated with ubiquitin-dependent protein degradation processes, and that can interact with different UBX domain proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Pinter1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Meyer1">[34]</xref>. To further validate the interaction between Als and Ter94 we co-expressed Ter94<sup>HA</sup> together with <sup>FLAG</sup>Als, <sup>FLAG</sup>Als<sup>ΔN</sup>, and <sup>FLAG</sup>Gal4, which served as a negative control, in Kc-167 cells. Western blot analyses following reciprocal immunoprecipitations showed that (1) Ter94<sup>HA</sup> and endogenous Ter94 co-immunoprecipitated with <sup>FLAG</sup>Als and <sup>FLAG</sup>Als<sup>ΔN</sup>, and (2) <sup>FLAG</sup>Als, <sup>FLAG</sup>Als<sup>ΔN</sup>, and endogenous Als co-immunoprecipitated with Ter94<sup>HA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). When we expressed Ter94<sup>HA</sup> in wing imaginal discs, we found a strikingly similar sub-cellular distribution and co-localization with <sup>FLAG</sup>Als (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g006">Figure 6B–6B″</xref>). Importantly, we demonstrated a physical interaction between Als and Ter94 in vivo with bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g006">Figure 6C and 6C′</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Bischof1">[35]</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), where the co-overexpression of Als-VC and Ter94-VN resulted in a Venus-YFP fluorescent signal. In sum, our biochemical and genetic results indicate that Als molecularly interacts with Ter94. The UBX domain is dispensable for Als to bind to Ter94, which is in agreement with our finding that Als lacking the UBX domain could still rescue the <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotype.</p>

<title>Armadillo Levels Depend on <italic>als</italic> Activity</title>
<p>Our biochemical and genetic studies suggest that Als is functionally linked to the proteasomal degradation pathway. Since Als is positively required for Wg signaling, it could exert its function in the pathway either by suppressing the degradation of a positive component, or by enhancing the degradation of a negative component. We first analyzed the protein levels of key negative pathway components in wing imaginal discs. We expressed different <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> lines in the wing primordium with <italic>nub-Gal4</italic>; however, neither Axin nor Shaggy nor Apc2 levels were affected upon <italic>als</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s010">Figure S10A–S10L</xref>); <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Fiedler1">[36]</xref>). In contrast, we found that the protein levels of Arm, the key positive signaling component, were dependent on <italic>als</italic>: when <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> was expressed in the P-compartment under the control of <italic>hh</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic>, Arm levels were strongly reduced in P but not A cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g007">Figure 7A–7A″</xref>). Even when we overexpressed Arm under the control of <italic>nub</italic>-<italic>Gal4</italic>, co-expression of <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> led to strongly reduced Arm levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g007">Figure 7C and 7C′</xref>, cf. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g007">Figure 7B and 7B′</xref>). DAPI staining shows that all cells have normally shaped nuclei and are thus not apoptotic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g007">Figure 7A′, 7A″, 7C, and 7C′</xref>). Constitutively active, non-degradable Arm<sup>S10</sup> localizes like Arm to the apical membrane upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g007">Figure 7D and 7D′</xref>), and was also observed at higher levels in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g007">Figure 7F and 7F′</xref>). Importantly, we found that Arm<sup>S10</sup> levels were not altered in <italic>als</italic>-depleted wing imaginal disc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g007">Figure 7E, 7E′, 7G, and 7G′</xref>). This is consistent with our finding that Arm<sup>S10</sup> overexpression could completely overcome the phenotypes caused by <italic>als</italic> depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5F, 5F′, 5Q, and 5Q′</xref>).

The observation that Arm is subject to degradation in the absence of <italic>als</italic> function is in agreement with our observation that overexpressed Arm—in contrast to Arm<sup>S10</sup>—is not able to rescue <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes in wing and eye primordia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5G′ and 5R′</xref>).</p>

<p>The rescue experiments with Arm and Arm<sup>S10</sup> suggested that Als acts upstream of Arm's proteasomal degradation. To further corroborate this idea, we reduced the levels of <italic>ubiquitin</italic> in addition to <italic>als</italic> depletion. This led to a suppression of the <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes in the wing and the eye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s011">Figure S11I, S11L</xref>, and S11O, cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s011">Figure S11G, S11J</xref>, and S11M). Reduction of <italic>ubiquitin</italic> also suppressed Wg loss-of-function phenotypes that were based on elevated activity of the destruction complex by Axin overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s011">Figure S11A and S11</xref>C). In contrast, depletion of <italic>ubiquitin</italic> did not suppress the Lgs<sup>17E</sup> overexpression phenotype, which intersects the Wg pathway downstream of the proteasome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s011">Figure S11D and S11</xref>F). These findings support the idea that Als acts upstream of Arm's proteasomal degradation.</p>
<p>To check whether Als directly interacts with Arm, we carried out selected reaction monitoring, a highly sensitive mass spectrometry approach that allows the detection of low amounts of peptides in a complex sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Lange1">[37]</xref>. Als and Ter94 were used as bait. In none of the studies was an interaction between Arm and Als detected. Additionally, in shotgun affinity purification mass spectrometry using Arm or Arm<sup>S10</sup> as a bait we did not find Als, whereas, as expected, components of the degradation complex such as Apc2, Axin, Sgg, and CKI were detected in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s012">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We further analyzed the consequences of <italic>als</italic> depletion for Wg signaling in Kc-167 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Stimulation of the Wg pathway by the inhibition of GSK3β led to strong transcriptional upregulation of the Wg targets <italic>naked (nkd)</italic> and <italic>wingful (wf)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8B and 8C</xref>, bar 2), and an increase in Arm levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8D</xref>, lanes 3 and 11). Consistent with the in vivo data, double-stranded RNA (dsRNA)–mediated knockdown of <italic>als</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8A</xref>) caused a reduction in <italic>nkd</italic> and <italic>wf</italic> expression in stimulated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8B and 8C</xref>, bar 6, cf. bar 2).

<p>(A) <italic>als</italic> mRNA levels are downregulated upon <italic>als</italic>-dsRNA treatment. Stimulation of Wg signaling by inhibition of GSK3β (CHIR) or E1 ligase (PYR-41) causes an upregulation of <italic>als</italic> expression. (B and C) The positive Wg targets <italic>nkd</italic> and <italic>wf</italic> were induced upon GSK3β inhibition (bar 2 in [B and C]) and E1 ligase inhibition (bar 3 in [B and C]) in control cells. In <italic>als</italic>-dsRNA-treated cells, <italic>nkd</italic> and <italic>wf</italic> were strongly reduced in GSK3β-inhibited cells (bar 6 in [B and C]) and only mildly reduced in PYR-41-treated cells (bar 7 in [B and C]). Inhibition of the proteasome (MG-132) did not cause upregulated Wg target expression (bars 4 and 8). (D) Inhibition of GSK3β (CHIR) or E1 ligase (PYR) caused an increase of Arm protein levels in control cells (lanes 3 and 5); this increase was reduced upon <italic>als</italic>-dsRNA treatment (lanes 4 and 6); proteasome inhibition (MG132) caused elevated Arm levels in both control and <italic>als</italic>-dsRNA conditions (lanes 9 and 10). Combined depletion of <italic>ter94</italic> and <italic>als</italic> could ameliorate Arm levels (lane 12, cf. lanes 13 and 14, which represent <italic>als</italic> depletion based on different <italic>als</italic> siRNA target regions). (E) Control expression levels are depicted as white bars. In wing imaginal discs (left bar diagram), <italic>als</italic> depletion caused a strong reduction of <italic>wf</italic> expression, a positive Wg target gene (lane 1), and an elevation of <italic>arr</italic> expression, a negative Wg target gene (lane 4).

<p>When we depleted <italic>ter94</italic> in wing imaginal discs and in Kc-167 cells, we found an upregulation of the positive Wg target genes <italic>nkd</italic> and <italic>wf</italic>, and a downregulation of the negative Wg target <italic>arr</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>als</italic>-depleted cells, <italic>ter94</italic> reduction led to an amelioration of the changes in Wg target expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8E</xref>), and to a partial restoration of Arm levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8D</xref>, lane 12). In contrast, the Hh target gene <italic>ptc</italic> was not altered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Overexpression of <italic>ter94<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in wing imaginal discs, however, caused pupal lethality. Because of this, it was difficult to analyze the adult wing phenotype caused by the combined depletion of <italic>ter94</italic> and <italic>als</italic>; because of <italic>ter94</italic>'s pleiotropic role, the analysis of the consequences of <italic>ter94</italic> depletion is challenging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Zhang1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, we found that overexpression of Ter94<sup>HA</sup> suppressed the strong dominant-negative-like effect of Als<sup>HA</sup> overexpression in the wing and the eye primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figure 8F–8I</xref>), while overexpression of Ter94<sup>HA</sup> could not suppress phenotypes caused by <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s002">Figure S2M</xref>).

<p>Together, these results suggest that Als functions downstream of GSK3β and downstream or at the level of E1 Ub ligase and that Als is required to antagonize Ter94 to allow normal Wg signaling. This is in agreement with our genetic epistasis experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and is corroborated by the further finding that overexpression of CSN6, an essential de-ubiquitinating enzyme and negative regulator of SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Ullah1">[39]</xref>, reverted the <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes in the wing and the eye (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s011">Figure S11H–S11N</xref>).

<title>Human UBXN6 Is the Functional Ortholog of Als</title>
<p>To address the evolutionary conservation of Als's function, we tested whether the human ortholog of Als, UBXN6, can substitute for Als in wing and eye development.

We next asked whether UBXN6 is required for Wnt signaling in human cells. We stimulated the Wnt pathway in HEK-293 cells with mouse Wnt3a (mWnt3a) while targeting <italic>UBXN6</italic> by small interfering RNA (siRNA). siRNA against <italic>CTNNB1/</italic>β-<italic>Catenin</italic> served as a control. To monitor the output of the Wnt pathway, we analyzed three established Wnt-responsive genes, <italic>SP5</italic>, <italic>AXIN2</italic>, and <italic>FZD1</italic>, by real-time PCR. All three targets were upregulated upon pathway stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g009">Figure 9G–9G″</xref>, green bars), and this response was abolished upon siRNA treatment of <italic>UBXN6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g009">Figure 9G–9G″</xref>, red bars). The depletion of β-<italic>Catenin</italic> caused a similar downregulation of Wnt target gene expression.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>A prevalent mechanism for controlling information flow in signaling pathways is the alteration of the protein levels of key components. In the Wg/Wnt pathway, the Arm/β-Catenin destruction complex targets Arm/β-Catenin for ubiquitination by the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase, resulting in proteasomal degradation and low cytoplasmic levels of Arm/β-Catenin in the Wnt pathway off state. If the pathway is turned on, Slimb-mediated ubiquitination is prevented, thus rescuing Arm from its proteasomal fate and causing a concomitant increase in Arm protein levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Li1">[5]</xref>. Here we describe Als as a new component of this control system; we found that Als is required to prevent the degradation of Arm/β-Catenin.</p>

<title>Als/UBXN6 Is a Novel Regulator of the Wnt/Wg Pathway</title>
<p>We identified <italic>als</italic> in a genome-wide in vivo RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Because we did not succeed in isolating an EMS- or P-element-induced null allele and because another gene overlaps with <italic>als</italic>, we demanded, and obtained, particularly thorough evidence validating <italic>als</italic> gene function. (1) The <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes could be reproduced by nine different <italic>UAS-RNAi</italic> transgenes encoding independent RNA target sites. Together with an extended off target analysis, we could rule out unintentional RNAi as a cause for the <italic>als</italic> phenotypes. (2) RNAi-mediated inhibition of <italic>als</italic> expression was ascertained by monitoring <italic>als</italic> mRNA expression via real-time PCR and antisense mRNA in situ hybridization. (3) Expression of <sup>HA</sup>Als with different RNAi-insensitive rescue transgenes, as well as with its human ortholog UBXN6, rescued <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes.</p>
<p>Our analyses show that <italic>als</italic> encodes an essential positive Wg signaling component. This conclusion is based on the following evidence. <italic>als</italic> depletion caused wings with notched wing margins and loss of sensory bristles, which is characteristic of impaired Wg signaling. The distal wing region is most sensitive to <italic>als</italic> levels, as is the case for other positive components of Wg signaling. In agreement with this, we found increased <italic>als</italic> expression in the central wing pouch, at least in earlier L3 larval stages. Stimulation of the Wg pathway in wing imaginal discs or Kc-167 cells caused higher <italic>als</italic> expression, suggesting that <italic>als</italic> can be positively controlled by Wg signaling. However, Als levels must be precisely controlled since already mild overexpression of <italic>UAS-als</italic> elicits a dominant-negative effect on Wg signaling. The function of <italic>als</italic> for Wg signaling is not restricted to the wing: also in other tissues, such as the thorax, eyes, legs, and the embryo, <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes are identical to those seen when Wg signaling is disturbed. Also in human HEK-293 cells we found UBXN6/UBXD1, the ortholog of Als, to be required for Wnt signaling, and human <sup>HA</sup>UBXN6 largely rescued the <italic>als<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> phenotypes in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, which suggests their functional conservation. Depletion of <italic>als</italic> also enhanced Wg-sensitized phenotypes, further supporting the notion that its product is a Wg pathway component. Moreover, the expression of positively regulated Wg target genes is reduced or abolished upon loss of <italic>als</italic> function, while Wg-repressed target gene expression is ectopically activated. Importantly, while interfering with <italic>als</italic> function suppressed Wg signaling, it did not affect other pathways, such as Notch and Hh, Jak/Stat, or EGFR signaling. However, we cannot rule out that <italic>als</italic> is not required in another pathway in a different biological context. In humans, UBXN6 is reported to play a role in diverse scenarios: for example, it was shown to play a role in Caveolin turnover in human osteosarcoma U2OS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Ritz1">[40]</xref>. This might indicate a broader role of UBXN6 in mammalians.</p>

<title>Als: A Protector of Armadillo</title>
<p>Our data show that Als regulates Armadillo protein levels. Based on our epistasis experiments, Als acts downstream of Shaggy/GSK3β and upstream of the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase, which is known to ubiquitinate Arm, a prerequisite for proteasomal degradation. Consistent with this, the degradation-resistant form of Arm, Arm<sup>S10</sup>, could completely bypass the requirement for <italic>als</italic>, in contrast to the wild-type form of Arm. This suggests that proteasomal degradation acts downstream of <italic>als</italic>; however, we would like to point out that this cannot be taken as an unambiguous proof. Importantly, depletion of <italic>ubiquitin</italic> and overexpression of CSN6, a negative regulator of SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase, could ameliorate the <italic>als</italic> phenotype (as well as phenotypes based on the overexpression of Axin or Shaggy, which overactivate the destruction complex, thus resulting in enhanced Arm degradation). In contrast, altering these factors did not ameliorate the Lgs<sup>17E</sup> phenotype, which is caused by interfering more downstream in the Wg pathway. These findings suggest that <italic>als</italic> works upstream of proteasomal degradation. A further informative experiment was monitoring Wg pathway components with respect to protein levels: Arr, Fz, Axin, APC, Sgg, and Arm. The only change in the absence of Als function was Arm: its levels were strongly reduced upon <italic>als</italic> depletion. The effects on Arm levels could be due either to a direct effect on Arm or to an indirect effect on a negative component. Importantly, the rate-limiting factor Axin as well as other key negative components of the Arm/β-Catenin destruction complex were unaltered upon <italic>als</italic> depletion.</p>

<title>Als Interacts with Ter94 ATPase</title>
<p>Some further mechanistic insight was obtained with our finding that Ter94 interacts in vitro and in vivo with Als. Interestingly, we found that Als-Ter94 localizes at the cell cortex, as was similarly observed for the Arm/β-Catenin destruction complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Stamos1">[41]</xref>. Our studies are consistent with earlier work that showed that the human ortholog of Ter94, p97, interacts with UBXN6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Madsen1">[42]</xref>. Ter94/p97/Cdc48 is a conserved and highly abundant AAA ATPase that was found to associate with SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligases or proteasomal shuttle factors to mediate UPS-mediated protein degradation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Pinter1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Madsen1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Yen1">[45]</xref>; reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Schuberth1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Meyer1">[34]</xref>). Specifications of the diverse activities of Ter94/p97 and the fate of its substrates are mainly exerted by UBX domain protein co-factors, which eventually either promote or hinder p97's function in protein turnover; an example of the latter involves the dissociation of the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase complex, eventually leading to its inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Yen1">[45]</xref>. Interestingly, it was recently reported that inactivation of the E3 ligase complex upon Wnt signaling is achieved by its dissociation from the destruction complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Li1">[5]</xref>. Based on our experiments and what is known about Ter94/p97, we suggest as a possible mechanism that Als antagonizes Ter94's positive effect on E3 ligase function, thereby rescuing Arm levels. We, however, did not observe increased protein levels of Slimb, Axin, Shaggy, or APC in our analyses; thus, our results favor a model in which Als antagonizes Ter94 to hinder the transfer of Arm to the proteasome by interfering with the SCF/Slimb/βTRCP E3 Ub ligase function or its assembly. Importantly, we did not find an interaction between Arm and Als. This is consistent with the finding that UBX domain family members lacking an UBA domain, such as UBXN6/Als, do not directly interact with substrate proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Beskow1">[44]</xref>, but are necessary for the activity or fate of the Ter94/p97.</p>
<p>Interestingly, Zhang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Zhang1">[38]</xref> found that <italic>ter94</italic> depletion affected the partial proteolysis of Ci. However, they observed neither any typical consequence of disturbed Hh signaling per se (i.e., no alteration of Hh target gene expression in genes such as <italic>ptc</italic>) nor any phenotypical consequence upon overexpression of a dominant negative form of Ter94 (i.e., aberrant wing patterning and growth typical for Hh signaling). This is consistent with our data that neither Ci target expression nor Hh signaling was affected upon <italic>als</italic> or <italic>ter94</italic> depletion (Figures S6G–S6J and 8E).</p>
<p>p97/Ter94 is known as a highly pleiotropic AAA ATPase associated with many cellular functions. Further, p97/Ter94 acts in multifaceted and large protein–protein complexes, and it is its regulatory co-factors, including UBX domain proteins, that render p97/Ter94 specific for a certain task in a particular cellular context. For example, p47/Shp1 is a co-factor of p97/Ter94 that blocks other co-factors from Ter94 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Kondo1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001988-Bruderer1">[47]</xref>. Interestingly, in our Kc-167 cell mass spectroscopy experiments, we found p47 in Ter94/Als protein complexes, but only in the absence of Wg stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001988.s012">Text S1</xref>). On the other hand, we found <italic>als</italic> transcript and Als protein levels elevated upon Wg signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001988-g008">Figures 8A and S5D</xref>). These findings suggest a dynamic regulation of the Ter94 complex upon signaling inputs. The identification and functional analysis of all key components of the Als-Ter94 complex will be needed to obtain a refined insight into Als-Ter94's molecular mechanism.</p>

<title>Concluding Remarks</title>
<p>Critically, our work spotlights an underappreciated facet in the control of the output of the entire canonical Wg/Wnt pathway—how Arm/β-Catenin is handed over to the proteasome— and the potential for regulating this step; our works also indicates that this step, in contrast to the conventional wisdom, is tunable. Our identification and characterization of the UBX protein Als as a positive regulator of Wg/Wnt signaling contributes to this layer of pathway control.</p>

Cell suspension was dounced 20×, incubated 10 min at room temperature, and centrifuged with 13,000 rpm at 4°C. The supernatant (total cell lysates) was incubated either with rabbit anti-HA antibody (Abcam) or mouse anti-FLAG antibody (Sigma), conjugated to Protein-A Sepharose beads (Sigma), and allowed to rotate 3 h at 4°C. The beads were then collected (3,600 rpm, 10 min at 4°C), washed 3× with the lysis buffer, and transferred to a column to allow gravity flow. Protein complexes were eluted with 3×50 µl of glycine (0.2 M, pH 2.5) and neutralized with 50 µl of 8 M urea (containing 100 mM NH<sub>4</sub>CO<sub>3</sub>). The pH of the eluted protein complex was adjusted with NH<sub>4</sub>HCO<sub>3</sub> to a final pH of 8.8 and stored at −20°C prior to sample preparation for mass spectroscopy (see below).</p>
<p>For Western blot analysis, protein complexes were denaturated and resolved on 4%–12% NuPAGE Bis-Tris Mini Gels (Invitrogen) and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane.
