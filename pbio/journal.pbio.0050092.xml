				<article-title>Paradox Resolved? The Strange Case of the Radiation-Resistant Bacteria</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>In the hierarchy of cellular targets damaged by ionizing radiation (IR), classical models of radiation toxicity place DNA at the top. Yet, many prokaryotes are killed by doses of IR that cause little DNA damage. Here we have probed the nature of Mn-facilitated IR resistance in <italic>Deinococcus radiodurans,</italic> which together with other extremely IR-resistant bacteria have high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios compared to IR-sensitive bacteria. For in vitro and in vivo irradiation, we demonstrate a mechanistic link between Mn(II) ions and protection of proteins from oxidative modifications that introduce carbonyl groups. Conditions that inhibited Mn accumulation or Mn redox cycling rendered <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> radiation sensitive and highly susceptible to protein oxidation. X-ray fluorescence microprobe analysis showed that Mn is globally distributed in <italic>D. radiodurans,</italic> but Fe is sequestered in a region between dividing cells. For a group of phylogenetically diverse IR-resistant and IR-sensitive wild-type bacteria, our findings support the idea that the degree of resistance is determined by the level of oxidative protein damage caused during irradiation. We present the case that protein, rather than DNA, is the principal target of the biological action of IR in sensitive bacteria, and extreme resistance in Mn-accumulating bacteria is based on protein protection.</p>

          <p>One original goal of radiobiology was to explain why cells are so sensitive to ionizing radiation (IR). Early studies in bacteria incriminated DNA as the principal radiosensitive target, an assertion that remains central to modern radiation toxicity models. More recently, the emphasis has shifted to understanding why bacteria such as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Deinococcus radiodurans</named-content> are extremely resistant to IR, by focusing on DNA repair systems expressed during recovery from high doses of IR. Unfortunately, as key features of DNA-centric hypotheses of extreme resistance have grown weaker, the study of alternative cellular targets has lagged far behind, mostly because of their relative biological complexity. Recent studies have shown that extreme levels of bacterial IR resistance correlate with high intracellular Mn(II) concentrations, and resistant and sensitive bacteria are equally susceptible to IR-induced DNA damage. The current work establishes a mechanistic link between Mn(II) and protection of proteins from radiation damage. In contrast to resistant bacteria, naturally sensitive bacteria are highly susceptible to IR-induced protein oxidation. We propose that sensitive bacteria sustain lethal levels of protein damage at radiation doses that elicit relatively little DNA damage, and that extreme resistance in bacteria is dependent on protein protection.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The amount of DNA damage caused by a given dose of γ-radiation for resistant and sensitive bacteria is very similar [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b002">2</xref>]. Yet, the range of ionizing radiation (IR) resistances is large [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b003">3</xref>], with a factor of 200 separating the most-resistant from the most-sensitive species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>]. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Deinococcus radiodurans</named-content> can survive levels of IR (10 kGy) that induce approximately 100 DNA double-strand breaks (DSBs) per genome, whereas <italic>Shewanella oneidensis</italic> is killed by levels of IR (0.07 kGy) that result in less than 1 DSB per genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>]. We have reported a relationship between intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios and bacterial survival following exposure to IR, in which the most-resistant cells contained about 300 times more Mn and about three times less Fe than the most-sensitive cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>]. Furthermore, restricting Mn(II) during growth of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> significantly lowered the Mn content of wild-type cells, and IR resistance to levels quantitatively similar to several highly sensitive <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> DNA repair mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>]. However, the nature of Mn-facilitated IR resistance was undefined, and the question of why many bacteria that encode a complement of repair functions are killed by doses of IR that cause little DNA damage has not been resolved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Broad-based bioinformatic and experimental studies have converged on the conclusion that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> uses a relatively conventional set of DNA repair and protection functions, but with far greater efficiency than IR-sensitive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b012">12</xref>]. Despite these efforts, however, the molecular mechanisms underlying the extraordinary IR resistance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> and other Mn-accumulating bacteria remain poorly understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b004">4</xref>]. For example, recent work by Zahradka et al (2006) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b007">7</xref>] showed that DNA polymerase I (PolA) of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> supports very efficient DNA replication at the earliest stages of recovery, and could account for the high fidelity of RecA-dependent DSB fragment assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b007">7</xref>]. However, IR-sensitive <italic>D. radiodurans polA</italic> mutants are fully complemented by expression of the <italic>polA</italic> gene from the IR-sensitive <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b012">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>The reason why repair proteins, either native or cloned, in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cells function so much better after irradiation than in other organisms is unknown. We show that the amount of protein damage caused by a given dose of γ-radiation for intrinsically resistant and sensitive bacteria is very different. High levels of protein protection during irradiation correlated with high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios and high levels of resistance, whereas proteins in radiation-sensitive cells were highly susceptible to IR-induced oxidation.</p>

        <title>Mn(II) Ions Protect Protein, but Not DNA, during In Vitro Irradiation</title>
        <p>In comparison to Fe(II), Mn(II) does not significantly react with dioxygen (O<sub>2</sub>) or hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>) at physiological pH values in water. However, Mn(II) has been reported to react strongly with superoxide radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>). For example, as free ions or when complexed with lactate or succinate, Mn(II) can act as a potent scavenger of O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>, with Mn cycling between the divalent and trivalent states, releasing H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> as an intermediate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b013">13</xref>]. In contrast, when complexed with bicarbonate, Mn(II) catalyzes the disproportionation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b014">14</xref>]. Thus, the presence of Mn might affect the relative abundance of reactive oxygen species (ROS) generated during irradiation. During the γ-radiolysis of water, solvated electrons (e<sup>−</sup><sub>aq</sub>) react rapidly with O<sub>2</sub> to form O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>], which could react with Mn(II) and protons (H<sup>+</sup>) to form H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and Mn(III) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b013">13</xref>]. Mn redox cycling would occur if Mn(III) generated during irradiation was reduced back to Mn(II) by an electron donor such as H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, a major and relatively stable product of the radiolysis of water (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

On the basis of the different reactivities of HO<sup>•</sup> and O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> with DNA and proteins, we tested the ability of Mn(II) to scavenge these ROS during irradiation. DNA is readily damaged by HO<sup>•</sup>, but insensitive to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b016">16</xref>]. In contrast, O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> damages [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing enzymes such as aconitase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b016">16</xref>], and Mn(II) has been reported to protect enzymes from Fe-catalyzed inactivation by O<sub>2</sub> in the presence of electron donor systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b018">18</xref>].

We also tested BamHI for its susceptibility to IR damage in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g002">2</xref>C). The highest IR dose that BamHI could survive and then function after irradiation under aerobic conditions in dH<sub>2</sub>O was approximately 50 Gy; in 1% DMSO, it was approximately 150 Gy; and in 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub>, it was approximately 1,000 Gy. Since the deactivating IR dose for BamHI that has been irradiated anaerobically in dH<sub>2</sub>O in the absence of DMSO or 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> was approximately 1,000 Gy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), we examined whether free Mn(II) ions might protect BamHI from O<sub>2</sub>-dependent modifications during irradiation. In vitro, 5 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> limited IR-induced oxidative protein damage under aerobic conditions in the presence or absence of Fe, as measured by assaying for carbonyl group (aldehydes and ketones) generation into proteins at Lys, Arg, Pro, and Thr residues by oxidative reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).

Since not all oxidative modifications lead to carbonyl derivatives, however, the levels of oxidation detected represent minimal values. These results support our model that Mn(II) ions might protect proteins by scavenging peroxyl radicals (O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>, HO<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>, and R-O<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>) and/or H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, but do not scavenge HO<sup>•</sup> generated during irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Bacterial Radioresistance Is Quantifiably Related to Protein Oxidation</title>
        <p>To demonstrate a mechanistic link between solution-phase radiochemistry of Mn ions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and their physiological targets in vivo, we examined IR-induced protein damage in IR-sensitive and IR-resistant bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Cellular proteins in the most-sensitive bacteria were substantially more vulnerable to IR-induced oxidation than proteins in the most-resistant bacteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g003">Figure 3</xref>); and from the pattern of oxidized bands, we infer that not all proteins in sensitive bacteria are equally susceptible to carbonylation. At 4 kGy, high levels of protein oxidation occurred in cells with the lowest intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios, whereas no protein oxidation was detected in cells with the highest Mn/Fe ratios (see bottom of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g003">Figure 3</xref> for bacterial IR survival values and Mn/Fe concentration ratios). In vitro, proteins from resistant bacteria were readily carbonylated when exposed to IR in the presence of Fe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), which confirmed that proteins in resistant bacteria are not inherently resistant to oxidation. Furthermore, we previously reported that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cells grown in defined rich medium without Mn supplementation (No-Mn DRM) were depleted in Mn and, at 10 kGy, displayed a 1,000-fold reduction in survival compared to cells with normal Mn concentrations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cells grown in DRM without Mn were highly susceptible to protein oxidation during irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).

In vitro, exposure to IR of anaerobic 10 mM MnCl<sub>2</sub> at pH 9 or higher yielded O<sub>2</sub> but not H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, whereas H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> was formed at pH values below 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Consistent with the prediction that Mn redox cycling can be inhibited in vivo by OH<sup>−</sup>, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> irradiated at pH 10.5 did not release H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> or O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). In vivo, the 10% survival value (D<sub>10</sub>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>] of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cells grown, irradiated, and recovered at pH 7 was 16 kGy, whereas the D<sub>10</sub> was 6 kGy for cells grown at pH 7, irradiated at pH 10.5, and recovered at pH 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, top); survival of non-irradiated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> control samples held at a pH of 11 or lower for 16 h was approximately 100% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, bottom). In vivo, the pH-dependent loss in IR resistance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, top) correlated with a substantial increase in oxidative protein damage during irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Thus, at pH values at which IR-driven Mn redox cycling was inhibited in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), the IR resistance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> was significantly decreased, and the cells were highly susceptible to IR-induced protein oxidation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>

        <p>Because the formation of ROS during irradiation is extremely rapid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>], an intracellular protection system which is ubiquitous, but not highly dependent on the induction of enzymes, stage of growth, or temperature over a range at which cells are metabolically active, could provide a selective advantage to the host in some environments.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We previously demonstrated a critical role for the accumulation of Mn(II) in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> in a mechanism toward surviving IR that is not dependent on Mn-SOD (Mn-dependent superoxide dismutase) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>]. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> contains four to ten identical copies of its genome per cell, and when irradiated to a dose of 10 kGy, generates more than 400 genomic DSB fragments per cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b026">26</xref>]. Yet, this amount of DNA damage in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> does not typically lead to cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b008">8</xref>]. Bioinformatic and experimental reports generally support that genome configuration and copy number, and enzymatic protection and repair functions of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> do not have unique properties that are essential or prerequisite for expression of the extreme-resistance phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b012">12</xref>]. For example, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> DNA repair and protection genes do not differ greatly from their counterparts in the IR-sensitive <italic>S. oneidensis, P. putida,</italic> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b006">6</xref>]; several <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> DNA repair genes have been shown to fully restore corresponding radiation-sensitive <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> mutants to wild-type levels of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b027">27</xref>]; Mn-SOD is not needed for survival of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> following acute irradiation or growth under 50 Gy/h [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b011">11</xref>]; non-homologous end joining of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> chromosomal DSB fragments following IR is not observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b028">28</xref>]; and the products of interchromosomal recombination in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> following irradiation are consistent with the canonical version of the DSB repair model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b008">8</xref>]. Over the last decade, several hypotheses to reconcile these findings have built on the idea that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> might use mechanisms that restrict the diffusion of DNA DSB fragments produced following irradiation, to facilitate repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b029">29</xref>]. However, transmission electron microscopy [TEM] of Mn-depleted, radiosensitive <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> displayed normal levels of chromosomal condensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>], and cryoelectron microscopy of vitreous sections of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> supports the conclusion that DNA fragments in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> are mobile and that the arrangement of its nucleoids does not play a key role in radioresistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b030">30</xref>]. Consistently, a series of earlier molecular studies on irradiated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cells showed high levels of recombination between homologous DSB fragments originating from widely separated genomic locations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b031">31</xref>]. Evidence presented here supports the idea that the extreme-resistance phenotype of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> and other bacteria with high intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios is dependent on a mechanism that protects proteins from oxidative damage during irradiation, which could offset the need for highly specialized cellular repair systems.</p>
      <p>Previous work has shown that the linear density of DSBs introduced into genomic DNA by a given dose of IR in extremely resistant and sensitive bacteria is essentially the same [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b002">2</xref>]. In contrast, we find that protein damage is quantifiably related to bacterial radioresistance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">4</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">4</xref>C). The most-sensitive cells had very low Mn/Fe concentration ratios and were highly susceptible to IR-induced protein oxidation, whereas the most-resistant cells had high intracellular Mn/Fe ratios and were relatively insusceptible to protein oxidation. Although the mechanism by which Mn protects proteins during irradiation remains unknown, our results provide insight into how Mn redox cycling could attenuate the detrimental effects of Fe redox cycling.</p>
      <p>Scavenging of ROS in IR-resistant bacteria may be linked to both the presence of Mn and relatively low cytosolic levels of Fe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">6</xref>D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>]. Our observation that resistant bacteria released H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> during irradiation, but sensitive bacteria did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), is consistent with the idea that Fe redox cycling is limited in Mn-accumulating cells. Most bacteria accumulate near-millimolar concentrations of intracellular Fe, primarily for assembly of Fe-S and haem proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b033">33</xref>]. However, resistant bacteria typically encode fewer proteins with Fe-S domains than sensitive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b004">4</xref>]. Since IR-induced ROS likely damage exposed Fe-S clusters, releasing Fe(II) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b032">32</xref>], Fe-laden sensitive cells might be predisposed to Fe redox cycling reactions during irradiation. Since 5 mM Mn(II) does not significantly scavenge HO<sup>•</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), Mn redox cycling likely does not protect cells from HO<sup>•</sup> generated either directly by water radiolysis or indirectly by the Fenton (Fe(II)) reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>]. However, the Haber-Weiss (Fe(III)) reaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>] generates O<sub>2</sub>, which under IR would give rise to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> and other peroxyl radicals (R-O<sub>2</sub><sup>•</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>]. Compared to HO<sup>•</sup>, O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> is relatively unreactive with a large number of compounds including DNA, but can undergo chain reactions leading to organic hydroperoxides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>], which decompose in the presence of Fe to give new radicals, including oxidizing alkoxyl radicals that are more reactive than peroxyl radicals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b034">34</xref>]. Although intracellular Mn(II) does not protect cells from DNA damage caused by HO<sup>•</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>], scavenging of simple peroxyl radicals by Mn redox cycling might prevent the propagation of secondary reactions that ultimately damage proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b034">34</xref>].</p>
      <p>The exceptionally high catalase activities of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b011">11</xref>] might be expected to favor the accumulation of Mn(III) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>), a strong oxidant capable of damaging cell components [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b013">13</xref>]. We did not detect significant levels of Mn(III) or Mn(IV) in irradiated or non-irradiated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> by X-ray-absorption near-edge structure (XANES) spectroscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), indicating that Mn(III) might also be reduced by other mechanisms in vivo. Notably, when Mn is complexed with succinate or lactate in vitro, the efficiency of Mn redox cycling is greatly increased, such that Mn(III) reactivity is similar to that of Mn(II) complexes and re-reduction of Mn(III) by O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> might occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b013">13</xref>]. In this context, metabolic pathway switching in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cells immediately after irradiation has been reported to favor the production of succinate via up-regulation of the glyoxylate bypass of its tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, and down-regulation of degradative steps of the TCA cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b009">9</xref>]. In bicarbonate/CO<sub>2</sub> buffer, Mn(II) is reported to catalyze the oxidation of free amino acids such as leucine and alanine by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and the dismutation of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b035">35</xref>]. Thus, complexes containing Mn and amino acids or organic acids might scavenge H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in addition to O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup> in cells exposed to IR.</p>
      <p>An interesting feature of the systems for energy production in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> is that, unlike most other free-living bacteria, it uses the vacuolar type of proton ATP synthase instead of the F<sub>1</sub>F<sub>0</sub> type [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b006">6</xref>]. Vacuolar (V)-type H<sup>+</sup>-ATPases are typical of eukaryotes and archaea, and central players in intracellular acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b036">36</xref>], which might facilitate Mn redox cycling by providing H<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In this context, our findings generally support bioinformatic studies by Karlin and Mrazek in 2001 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b037">37</xref>], who proffered a new explanation for the resistance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> contingent on a role of predicted highly expressed (PHX) genes for proteases, the glyoxylate bypass of the TCA cycle, ABC-type transporters of amino acids and Mn, and (V)-type ATPases.</p>
      <p>The speciation, distribution, and relatively high concentration of Mn in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">6</xref>C) support the idea that Mn(II) could provide immediate cytosolic protection from O<sub>2</sub><sup>•−</sup>, and facilitate removal of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> from cells exposed to IR. Further, electron-dense granules (EDGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, TEM, circular dark ∼0.2 μM inclusions), which are frequently observed in electron microscopy images at the center of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> nucleoids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b010">10</xref>], were associated with the highest regional Mn concentrations (200 parts per million [ppm]; 3.6 mM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figure 6</xref>D), perhaps to protect enzymic DNA repair functions, many of which are dependent on redox-active [4Fe-4S] clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b038">38</xref>]. Importantly, our findings do not preclude the possibility that intracellular Mn(II) also prevents lipid peroxidation in cell membranes. In this context, however, the lowest regional Mn concentrations (50 ppm) were associated with the cell envelope [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b006">6</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g006">Figures 6</xref>C and S3), indicating that Mn(II) predominantly protects the cytosol; and earlier reports strongly support the idea that lipid peroxidation can be dissociated from lethal damage in irradiated mammalian and irradiated bacterial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b039">39</xref>]. During recovery of irradiated <italic>D. radiodurans,</italic> additional damage might be limited by secondary antioxidant defenses, including attendant cellular responses that limit the production of metabolism-induced ROS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b009">9</xref>], and degradation of oxidized proteins by the expanded family of subtilisin-like proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b006">6</xref>]. The Mn content of bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>] might also determine the amount of protein damage caused in cells exposed to other oxidative stress-inducing conditions, including desiccation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b024">24</xref>] and ultraviolet (UV) radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b012">12</xref>], and xenobiotic agents such as Cr(VI) and mitomycin-C (MMC) that elicit redox-related toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b040">40</xref>].</p>
      <p>Chromosomal DNA is an indispensable molecule whose integrity must be conserved following exposure of a cell to IR to ensure survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b015">15</xref>], such that the functionality of DNA repair and replication systems ultimately determines if an irradiated cell lives or dies, even for the most IR-resistant bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b027">27</xref>]. Our findings that IR-induced cellular protein damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">4</xref>), but not DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b002">2</xref>], is quantifiably related to radioresistance, and intracellular Mn/Fe concentration ratios could help explain why bacteria that encode a similar repertoire of DNA repair functions display such large differences in IR resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b005">5</xref>]. Specifically, we propose that redox cycling of Mn(II) that is accumulated in resistant bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b001">1</xref>] protects proteins from oxidation during irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g001">Figure 1</xref>), with the result that enzyme systems involved in recovery survive and function with great efficiency. This could explain why the <italic>polA</italic> gene of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> fully complements IR-, UV- and MMC-sensitive <italic>D. radiodurans polA</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b012">12</xref>]. In comparison, we attribute the high level of radiation sensitivity of Fe-rich, Mn-poor bacteria to their susceptibility to global Fe-mediated oxidative protein damage during irradiation under aerobic or anaerobic conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050092-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Oxidative modification of proteins by IR could disrupt cellular functions involved in DNA repair either by loss of catalytic and structural integrity or by interruption of regulatory pathways, which in extremely radiation-sensitive cells might render protein damage lethal before significant DNA damage has accumulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b005">5</xref>]. At sublethal IR doses in sensitive cells, oxidatively damaged DNA repair enzymes would be expected to passively promote mutations by misrepair. Oxidized proteins, however, might also actively promote mutation by transmitting damage to other cellular constituents, including DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b041">41</xref>]. In conclusion, our data provide a novel framework for understanding how intracellular Mn and Fe contribute to IR resistance, which is important since these findings may come to affect models of radiation toxicity, as well as approaches to control recovery from radiation injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b042">42</xref>], including the development of systems for delivery into cells of Mn-based radioprotective complexes or Fe-based radiosensitizers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b043">43</xref>].</p>

        <p>O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> concentrations were determined by the Rhodazine D assay (RDA) (CHEMetrics, Calverton, Virginia, United States). All Quick-Seal centrifuge tubes containing cells were centrifuged at 4 °C (2,000 × <italic>g,</italic> 10 min) after irradiation. Supernatants were tested by the RDA. The RDA is suitable for measuring 0.1–1.0 mg/l O<sub>2</sub>, and 1–10 × 10<sup>−5</sup> M H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>. Mn(III,IV) are oxidants that will also cause a positive RDA test result. However, Mn(III,IV) dioxides are insoluble in water (circa-neutral pH) and readily removed from suspension by centrifugation (2,000 × <italic>g,</italic> 5 min) or standing. RDA results indicating 1 mg/l or more O<sub>2</sub> or 10 × 10<sup>−5</sup> M or greater H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> were also tested by the Indigo Carmine assay (CHEMetrics), which yields a blue color suitable for measuring higher concentrations of O<sub>2</sub> and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>.

        <title>XANES.</title>
        <p>Mn K-edge XANES spectra were measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b044">44</xref>] in transmission on standard compounds (MnCl<sub>2</sub>, γ-MnOOH, and MnO<sub>2</sub>) and in fluorescence on the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> samples. The measurements on γ-MnOOH and MnO<sub>2</sub> were made on fine powders spread evenly onto adhesive tape and folded to make samples of appropriate thickness for the transmission experiment. The 1 M MnCl<sub>2</sub> solution and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cell suspensions (OD<sub>600</sub> 0.9) were absorbed on paper and cellulose acetate filters, respectively, frozen, and then stored at −80 °C. For XANES measurements, samples were transferred from dry ice (−78 °C) to a sample stage consisting of an insulated Peltier stack kept under a helium atmosphere. Such samples were maintained at −14 °C during the analysis. The XANES spectra were measured at the MRCAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b045">45</xref>] (Materials Research Collaborative Access Team) sector 10ID beamline at the Advanced Photon Source (APS). The 10ID is an insertion device beamline using APS undulator-A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b046">46</xref>]. The undulator was tapered by approximately 2 keV to reduce the variation in incident radiation to less than 15% over the energy range used in these measurements. The incident X-ray beam was the undulator fundamental and was monochromated using the (111) reflection of a liquid-nitrogen–cooled, double-crystal, silicon monochromator. Higher harmonic content of the incident beam was rejected using a polished float glass mirror. Ionization chambers were used to measure the incident and transmitted intensities, and were filled with 10% nitrogen/90% helium and 100% nitrogen, respectively. The fluorescence spectra were measured with an ionization detector in the Stern-Heald geometry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b047">47</xref>] filled with Ar gas, and used a chromium oxide filter of three absorption-lengths thickness to reduce the background signal. The incident X-ray beam was 1 mm square. Linearity tests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b048">48</xref>] indicated less than 0.04% variation for a 50% decrease in incident X-ray intensity. The XANES data were processed using the Athena program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b049">49</xref>]. All data scans were aligned in energy using a reference spectrum derived from metallic manganese. Between five and 20 scans per sample were averaged to improve measurement statistics. The averaged data were normalized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b044">44</xref>] by regressing a line to the pre-edge region between approximately 6,400–6,500 eV. This line was subtracted from the data. A quadratic polynomial was regressed to the region from approximately 6,600 eV to the end of the data range. This quadratic polynomial was extrapolated to the edge energy (6,548.5 eV for the samples containing <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content>). The normalized data were divided by the value of this polynomial at the edge energy. Notably, the edge positions of XANES spectra of irradiated or non-irradiated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> samples were essentially the same as for aqueous MnCl<sub>2</sub> solutions. This is consistent with oxygen atoms surrounding Mn(II) in <italic>D. radiodurans,</italic> and with no significant change in Mn valence during irradiation, which would have been observed in cell samples containing 5% or more Mn(III,IV).</p>

        <title>XRF.</title>
        <p>XRF microprobe analysis measurements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b025">25</xref>] were made at beamline 2ID-D at the APS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b050">50</xref>]. The 2ID-D is an undulator beamline with Fresnel zone plates focusing optics that produced a focal spot with a FWHM (full width at half maximum) spatial resolution of approximately 120 nm for these experiments. A silicon (111) double-crystal monochromator was used to shine 10-keV photons on the Fresnel zone plates. The sample was rastered through the focal spot of the X-ray beam. For each pixel, the full XRF spectrum between approximately 2 keV and 10 keV was measured using a silicon drift detector. Thus, the distribution of elements between phosphorus and zinc on the periodic table of elements could be measured with 120-nm resolution throughout a cell and its periphery. XRF microprobe measurements were made on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. radiodurans</named-content> cells grown to OD<sub>600</sub> 0.3. The cells were deposited on grids as suspensions in TGY liquid medium, which served to help maintain the structure and viability of the cells as they dried. The complete results for two distinct diplococci (no. 109 and no. 110) are presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050092-sg003">Figure S3</xref>. The position coordinates of individual diplococci mounted on formvar-coated gold TEM grids were determined by light microscopy (LM). TEM grids were subsequently placed in the focal plane of the X-ray optic, and the grid markers were used to locate the targeted cells. Data from 2ID-D were initially processed using the program MAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050092-b051">51</xref>]. The average XRF spectral intensities from 28 adjacent pixels in the upper right-hand corners of XRF images, in areas beyond the boundaries of a cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050092-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), were used to determine the background signal for the elements under investigation. The average background spectrum for an element being mapped was subtracted from all other pixels of the image. Next, a mathematical model representing the original morphology of cells was constructed in approximate likeness to diplococci, which resemble adjoined truncated spheres. Within each pixel, the intensity of an element's XRF signal was weighted by the average thickness of the diplococcus subtended by a respective pixel. The contour lines are straight-line segments between points of equal intensity, in which linear interpolation of the actual data was used to determine the locations of the contour values. The contours were generated using the algorithm Gnuplot (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gnuplot.info" xlink:type="simple">http://www.gnuplot.info</ext-link>). In combination, this approach limited the effect of cell thickness on the elemental distribution maps, and facilitated correlation between electron-dense granules (EDGs) and Mn hotspots. Element distributions are presented as mass parts per million (ppm).</p>

Bright-field electron micrographs were recorded using a Gatan Ultrascan Model 894 cooled CCD camera containing four mega-pixels and operated with a four-port parallel read-out. Images were analyzed using Gatan Digital Micrograph software (version 3.4). Pixel intensities were transformed to a logarithmic scale to visualize the EDGs (∼ 0.2 μm in diameter) in cells.</p>
