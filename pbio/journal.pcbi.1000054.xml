Instead, they often act by participating in macromolecular complexes and play different functional roles depending on the other members of the complex. It is therefore interesting to identify co-complex relationships. Although protein complexes can be identified in a high-throughput manner by experimental technologies such as affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (APMS), these large-scale datasets often suffer from high false positive and false negative rates. Here, we present a computational method that predicts co-complexed protein pair (CCPP) relationships using kernel methods from heterogeneous data sources. We show that a diffusion kernel based on random walks on the full network topology yields good performance in predicting CCPPs from protein interaction networks. In the setting of direct ranking, a diffusion kernel performs much better than the mutual clustering coefficient. In the setting of SVM classifiers, a diffusion kernel performs much better than a linear kernel. We also show that combination of complementary information improves the performance of our CCPP recognizer. A summation of three diffusion kernels based on two-hybrid, APMS, and genetic interaction networks and three sequence kernels achieves better performance than the sequence kernels or diffusion kernels alone. Inclusion of additional features achieves a still better ROC<sub>50</sub> of 0.937. Assuming a negative-to-positive ratio of 600∶1, the final classifier achieves 89.3% coverage at an estimated false discovery rate of 10%. Finally, we applied our prediction method to two recently described APMS datasets. We find that our predicted positives are highly enriched with CCPPs that are identified by both datasets, suggesting that our method successfully identifies true CCPPs. An SVM classifier trained from heterogeneous data sources provides accurate predictions of CCPPs in yeast. This computational method thereby provides an inexpensive method for identifying protein complexes that extends and complements high-throughput experimental data.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Many proteins perform their jobs as part of multi-protein units called complexes, and several technologies exist to identify these complexes and their components with varying precision and throughput. In this work, we describe and apply a computational framework for combining a variety of experimental data to identify pairs of yeast proteins that partipicate in a complex—so-called co-complexed protein pairs (CCPPs). The method uses machine learning to generalize from well-characterized CCPPs, making predictions of novel CCPPs on the basis of sequence similarity, tandem affinity mass spectrometry data, yeast two-hybrid data, genetic interactions, microarray expression data, ChIP-chip assays, and colocalization by fluorescence microscopy. The resulting model accurately summarizes this heterogeneous body of data: in a cross-validated test, the model achieves an estimated coverage of 89% at a false discovery rate of 10%. The final collection of predicted CCPPs is available as a public resource. These predictions, as well as the general methodology described here, provide a valuable summary of diverse yeast interaction data and generate quantitative, testable hypotheses about novel CCPPs.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by National Institutes of Health awards NHGRI R33 HG003070 and NCRR P41 RR11823.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Proteins carry out most of the work in the cell, and they frequently do so by interacting with other proteins. Therefore, understanding protein and hence cellular function often entails knowing about various types of protein-protein interactions. This paper describes a method for predicting these interactions using a supervised classification algorithm that learns from a variety of genome-wide data sets.</p><p>Three classes of methods for predicting protein-protein interactions are described in the scientific literature. The first class consists of docking methods that employ detailed molecular simulations to dock two protein structures. These methods do not scale to the entire genome, both because they require protein structures and because they are computationally expensive. High-throughput computational methods fall into two classes: those that predict direct physical interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Sprinzak1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-BenHur1">[9]</xref>, and those that predict both direct and indirect interactions (i.e., co-membership in a protein complex) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Jansen1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Lin1">[13]</xref>. The current work focuses on the latter problem: predicting co-complexed protein pairs (CCPPs).</p><p>We frame the problem as a supervised learning problem, and we train a support vector machine (SVM) classifier to discriminate between pairs of proteins that are co-complexed and pairs that are not. The SVM is a non-parametric statistical method for discriminating between two classes of data. SVMs have been applied widely in bioinformatics, in applications as diverse as protein homology detection, alternative splicing prediction, microarray analysis and mass spectrometry analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Noble1">[14]</xref>. Most relevantly, they have been used successfully to recognize physically interacting pairs of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gomez1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Martin1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-BenHur1">[9]</xref>. The SVM operates by projecting the data into a vector space and finding a line (or, more generally, a hyperplane) that separates the classes in that space. SVMs are motivated by statistical learning theory, which suggests an optimal method for identifying this separating hyperplane. Furthermore, SVMs are part of a class of methods, known as <italic>kernel methods</italic>, that make use of a specific notion of pairwise similarity (<italic>kernel functions</italic>) to project data into a high-dimensional vector space. The benefits of the kernel approach are three-fold: the kernel function can incorporate prior knowledge of the problem domain; the kernel function can operate on non-vector data such as strings, sets or graphs, and kernel algebra allows us to combine heterogeneous types of data within a single classification framework. The SVM algorithm and its application to biological data is described in an accessible fashion in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Noble2">[15]</xref>; a much more detailed description of SVM applications in computational biology is available in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Schoelkopf1">[16]</xref>.</p><p>The ability to learn from heterogeneous data is of particular value in the prediction of CCPPs, because so many types of data are relevant to this task. In this work, we define separate kernels that operate on each relevant data type. These include three kernels on protein sequences, three kernels on different types of protein networks derived from high-throughput data, and kernels on gene expression, interologs, Gene Ontology terms, co-regulation and localization data. We combine all of these kernels in a single classifier that achieves state-of-the-art predictive accuracy.</p><p>In this work, we demonstrate the utility of a particular type of kernel, the <italic>diffusion kernel</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Kondor1">[17]</xref>, for predicting CCPPs. The diffusion kernel can be naturally applied to protein interaction networks. Various types of networks, representing protein physical interactions, complexes and genetic interactions, can be identified by large-scale experiments: yeast two-hybrid assays for physical interaction detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Ito1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Uetz1">[19]</xref>, affinity purification coupled with mass spectrometry (APMS) for complex detection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gavin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gavin2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Krogan1">[22]</xref>, and large-scale mapping of genetic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Tong1">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The resulting protein interaction networks have been shown to exhibit several distinctive properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Goldberg1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Tong1">[23]</xref>. First, the degrees of vertices exhibit a power-law distribution, with many vertices having a small number of connections, and few vertices having a large number of connections. Second, the networks belong to the class of small world networks and contain densely connected local neighborhoods.</p><p>These network properties can be exploited to improve statistical inferences about protein-protein interactions. Tong et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Tong1">[23]</xref> showed that, although there is small overlap between genetically interacting protein pairs and CCPPs, proteins sharing a large number of neighbors in the genetic interaction network tend to be members of the same complex. Goldberg and Roth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Goldberg1">[11]</xref> used a mutual clustering coefficient (MCC) to describe the cohesiveness in the physical interaction network. They showed that vertices with a high MCC are more likely to share an edge and that ranking by MCC improves the accuracy of edge inference.</p><p>MCC considers the number of common neighbors shared by two vertices, i.e., it only considers paths of length two. In this study, we generalize upon MCC by using the diffusion kernel, which takes into account paths of all lengths <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Kondor1">[17]</xref>. The diffusion kernel quantifies the distance between two nodes as the weighted sum of all paths connecting them, assigning larger weights to shorter paths. Our experiments show that the diffusion kernel performs much better than MCC in ranking protein pairs. In addition, we show that using a diffusion kernel in the context of an SVM classifier improves upon direct ranking by the diffusion kernel alone, and that a diffusion kernel performs much better than a linear kernel, which also only considers paths of length 2 in a network.</p><p>Next, we show that integration of different data sources improves the performance of our classifier. The summation of sequence and diffusion kernels yields much better performance than either sequence or diffusion kernel alone. This classifier successfully identifies 4789 out of 10980 positives before producing the first false positive. The addition of features such as co-expression, co-regulation, interolog, co-localization and GO annotation improve the ROC<sub>50</sub> score from 0.859 to 0.937.</p><p>We also validate our method using two recently decribed large scale APMS data sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gavin2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Krogan1">[22]</xref>. When these data sets are not used for training, our predicted positives are significantly enriched with protein pairs that occur in both data sets.</p><p>After validating our method, we trained two SVM classifiers, one using all available data, and one that excludes GO annotations, and applied both classifiers to all pairs of yeast proteins.

The rest of the MIPS complex catalogue contains manually curated complexes derived from the scientific literature. This manually curated database is believed to be highly accurate and has been used to define gold standard CCPPs in several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Martin1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Jansen1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Zhang1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Qi1">[26]</xref>. The MIPS complex catalogue organizes complexes into a hierarchy, with each lower level sub-complex contained within the corresponding upper level complex. Our CCPPs come from the lowest level and are hence the most specific complexes in the MIPS complex catalogue. The set consists of 217 complexes, containing 1190 proteins and 10,980 CCPPs.</p><p>We select negative examples (non-CCPPs) at random from among all protein pairs that do not co-occur in any top level MIPS complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-BenHur1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Zhang1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Qi1">[26]</xref>. The resulting set of negatives may be contaminated with some positive CCPPs; however, given the ratio of co-complexed versus non-co-complexed pairs in the yeast genome, the level of contamination is likely to be low. Several studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Jansen1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Jansen2">[27]</xref> have attempted to remove these false negative CCPPs from the gold standard by requiring that non-CCPPs localize to different cellular compartments. However, Ben-hur and Noble <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-BenHur2">[28]</xref> have shown that this strategy constrains the distribution of negative examples in such a way that the classification task becomes significantly easier. We use a data set with the number of negative examples the same as positive examples to compare the performance of various methods, and use a larger data set with a negative-to-positive ratio of 10 to estimate the false discovery rate.</p><p>The complete collection of labeled examples, as well as all of the kernels described in the next section, are available at the on-line supplement <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/coco" xlink:type="simple">http://noble.gs.washington.edu/proj/coco</ext-link>.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Kernel Methods</title><p>A kernel method is an algorithm that can be written such that all occurrences of data vectors appear within a scalar product operation. When this is the case, the scalar product operation &lt;<italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>,<italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic>&gt; can be replaced with a generalized similarity function <italic>K</italic>(<italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>,<italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic>), known as the <italic>kernel function</italic>. If the kernel function is positive semidefinite and symmetric, then there provably exists some vector space (the <italic>feature space</italic>) in which the kernel function plays the role of the scalar product. In other words, if Φ defines a mapping from the space that the data resides in (the <italic>data space</italic>) into the feature space, then Φ(<italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>)×Φ(<italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic>) = <italic>K</italic>(<italic>X<sub>i</sub></italic>,<italic>X<sub>j</sub></italic>). The kernel function provides an intuitive way to encode prior knowledge about a data set. Furthermore, kernel methods provide a natural way of combining heterogeneous data sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Pavlidis1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Lanckriet1">[30]</xref>, because the sum of two kernels is itself a kernel and is equivalent to concatenating the vector representations of each data point in the two corresponding feature spaces. This capability is particularly valuable in the context of predicting CCPPs, because so many types of data are relevant.</p><p>Predicting edges in a protein interaction or co-complex network presents an additional difficulty for which kernels can provide a solution. Many relevant types of data—protein sequence, gene expression, etc.—concern individual proteins, whereas the predictor evaluates protein pairs. This begs the question, how do we define a similarity between two pairs of proteins, given a similarity function that is defined on single pairs. Several groups have used SVMs to predict protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Martin1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-BenHur1">[9]</xref> and have used a tensor product transformation to derive a kernel on protein pairs from a kernel on individual proteins. Given a kernel <italic>K</italic> that measures the similarity between two proteins, the corresponding tensor product pair kernel (TPPK) <italic>K<sub>p</sub></italic> is defined as <italic>K<sub>p</sub></italic> ((<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>),(<italic>C</italic>,<italic>D</italic>)) = <italic>K</italic>(<italic>A</italic>,<italic>C</italic>)<italic>K</italic>(<italic>B</italic>,<italic>D</italic>)+<italic>K</italic>(<italic>A</italic>,<italic>D</italic>)<italic>K</italic>(<italic>B</italic>,<italic>C</italic>). It is straightforward to show that the feature space of <italic>K<sub>p</sub></italic> defined on protein pairs is equivalent to the tensor product of the feature vector spaces of <italic>K</italic> defined on individual proteins.</p><p>In this work, we employ a variety of kernel functions. Three different amino acid sequence kernels are described in the next section. For several vector data types, we use a radial basis kernel (RBF) <italic>K<sub>R</sub></italic>(<italic>A</italic>,<italic>B</italic>) = <italic>exp</italic>(−γ∥<italic>A</italic>–<italic>B</italic>∥<italic><sup>2</sup></italic>), with γ = 0.5. Finally, for networks, we use the diffusion kernel, defined as follows. Given a graph <italic>G</italic> = (<italic>V</italic>,<italic>E</italic>), define a generator matrix H:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000054.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The generator matrix <italic>H</italic> corresponds to the adjacency matrix with the diagonal entry equal to the negative of the degree of the corresponding vertex. The diffusion kernel matrix <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> is then computed as the exponential of the generator matrix: <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> = <italic>e</italic><sup>β<italic>H</italic></sup>. <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic>(<italic>i</italic>,<italic>j</italic>) can be regarded as the sum of probabilities of reaching <italic>j</italic> from <italic>i</italic> following all paths from <italic>i</italic> to <italic>j</italic> in a random walk. The parameter β controls how rapidly a random walk diffuses away from a vertex. In this study, we use a fixed diffusion parameter of 1. It can be shown that the exponential of any symmetric matrix is symmetric and positive semidefinite. Therefore, the matrix <italic>K<sub>D</sub></italic> is a kernel matrix.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Data Types</title><p>Our CCPP predictor combines eleven different data types, listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000054-t001">Table 1</xref>.

Combining the three networks into one network fails to preserve the different semantics associated with the three types of edges, leading to worse prediction performance. Indeed, combining the three networks in this fashion leads to even worse performance than is given by the best single network (APMS). In contrast, diffusing on each network separately and subsequently summing the three diffusion kernels improves significantly over the APMS diffusion kernel alone.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000054-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000054.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Combining different kernels.</title><p>(A) Two-hybrid, APMS, and genetic interaction represent the performance of an SVM trained using the TPPK of the diffusion kernel on a single network.

In particular, in a cross-validated test, the sequence and diffusion kernel is able to rank 4789 out of 10980 positives above all negatives. The addition of the RBF kernel based on co-expression, interolog, co-regulation, co-localization and GO annotation features further improves the ROC<sub>50</sub> performance from 0.859 to 0.937.</p><p>The accuracy of the top-ranked predictions with the inclusion of additional RBF kernel seems to decrease compared with the TPPK of sequence and diffusion kernels alone, as indicated in the leftmost region of the ROC<sub>50</sub> plot. In particular, six pairs are ranked high by the final classifier but are not labeled as positives according to MIPS. We investigated each of these pairs. The proteins ARC40 and ARC35 are annotated to be in complex ARp2/3 complex by the Saccharomyces Genome Database (SGD), and NOP14 and UTP7 are annotated to be in complex U3snoRNP by SGD. Thus, these two pairs are likely true positives missed by the MIPS database. In another top-ranked pair, UTP9 is a component of the U3snoRNP that is involved in processing of pre-18S rRNA, and CBF5 is the pseudouridine synthase catalytic subunit of box H/ACA snoRNPs, which is also involved in rRNA processing. This pair has been identified by two APMS studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Krogan1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Krogan2">[47]</xref>. The classifier with both the RBF kernel and TPPK of sequence and diffusion kernels also predicts PDA1 and KGD1 to be in the same complex with high confidence. PDA1 is the E1 alpha subunit of the pyruvate dehydrogenase complex, and KGD1 is a component of the mitochondrial alpha-ketoglutarate dehydrogenase complex. Both proteins bind to mitochondrial DNA and are part of mitochondrial nucleoid. Finally, for two pairs, this classifier predicts one protein in the kinetochore, DAD2 or DAD4, to be in the same complex with one protein in the spindle pole body, CNM67 or SPC98. Although the kinetochore and the spindle pole body are both part of spindle, they are two separate components. The classifier has difficulty distinguishing these two components from each other. Thus the apparently worse performance of the classifier with the additional RBF kernel in the leftmost region of the ROC plot may partially be due to the presence of true CCPPs in the negative training set as a result of incomplete MIPS annotations.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The SVM Makes Predictions from Partial and Indirect Evidence</title><p>A significant concern for any method that simultaneously exploits multiple types of data arises from the increased prevalence of missing data.

We examined the 7,510 true positive interactions identified before the 50th false positive for the SVM trained using the summation of the three diffusion kernels.

We next estimate the false discovery rate of the classifier with both the RBF kernel and the TPPK kernel assuming a negative-to-positive ratio of 600. Ideally, we would like to train on a training set with the number of negatives equal to 600 times the number of gold standard positives in our data set. However, this would involve training an SVM on a data set of 10,980×601 = 6,598,980 protein pairs, which is not computationally feasible. Therefore, we instead perform three-fold cross validation on a data set with the number of negatives chosen to be ten times the number of positives. In the computation of the false discovery rate, each occurrence of a false positive is then multiplied by 60 to simulate a negative-to-positive ratio of 600.</p><p>We train two classifiers, one that uses GO term annotations and one that does not. GO term annotations are sometimes derived from experimental observations of physical interactions or complex memberships. Using GO term features may therefore artificially inflate the performance of the classifier. To eliminate the possibility of circularity, we trained a classifier using the TPPK kernel and the RBF kernel without GO term features. On the other hand, biologists may be interested in the best possible predictions we can get using all available data. Especially when we apply the classifier to the prediction of protein pairs without interaction data, the issue of circularity is not a concern, and GO term annotations from sources other than physical interaction or complex membership may be useful in CCPP prediction.

This is why we instead chose to train on a data set with all available positive training pairs and a negative-to-positive ratio of 10, and simulate the real scenario by magnifying each false positive by 60, as described above.</p></sec><sec id="s3g"><title>Predictions for All Yeast Protein Pairs</title><p>Having demonstrated that our method produces accurate predictions, we proceeded to apply the two classifiers described previously—trained with and without GO annotations—to all protein pairs in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, excluding 809 dubious open reading frames and 7 pseudogenes. For the SVM trained without GO term annotations, 19,258 out of 17,307,786 protein pairs are identified using an FDR threshold of 10%, including 3,946 pairs that are not already annotated in the MIPS complex catalogue. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000054-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows the number of predicted pairs as a function of FDR threshold for both classifiers. As expected, at a given FDR threshold, the classifier trained with GO terms predicts more protein pairs than the classifier trained without GO terms.

First, we divided these novel predictions into two sets: those protein pairs in which one protein is a member of a MIPS complex, and those pairs in which neither protein is in the manually curated MIPS complex catalogue. Among the 3,946 novel CCPPs, 3,260 pairs are linked to one of the 1,237 members of any MIPS complex, and the remaining 686 pairs do not involve any MIPS complex.</p><p>We began by investigating the extent to which the former set of predictions extend known MIPS complexes. Ideally, a newly identified member of a protein complex would be predicted to co-complex with all known members of that complex. We therefore identified all proteins that are predicted to be co-complexed with every member of a known MIPS complex containing at least five proteins. These predictions are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000054-t002">Table 2</xref>. Not surprisingly, the majority of these predictions are not truly novel; rather, they reflect the incompleteness of the MIPS annotation that we used to train our SVMs. In fact, for all predicted new members in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000054-t002">Table 2</xref>, we were able to find convincing evidence in the scientific literature supporting the prediction , and the citations are given in the table. All the six predicted new members of the mRNA splicing complex—SMB1, SNU114, SYF2, CLF1, ISY1 and CUS1—have GO annotations of “nuclear mRNA splicing, via spliceosome.” The predicted new member of the exocyst complex 160, EXO84 has the GO annotation “exocyst.” SOH1 (MED31), the predicted new member of the mediator complex has been annotated by SGD to be part of the mediator complex. Finally, our classifier also predicted MHR1 to be part of mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit. Although MHR1 is primarily annotated to be involved in homologous DNA recombination and genome maintenance in mitochondria, Gan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gan1">[49]</xref> has shown that MHR1 is present in the mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit fraction separated by sucrose density gradient centrifugation, and the stoichiometry of MHR1 in purified large subunit is roughly equal to that of MRPL1, a member of mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit. In addition, Gavin et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gavin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gavin2">[21]</xref> found MHR1 to be associated with mitochondrial ribosomal large subunit proteins by high-throughput APMS studies. Overall, this consistent literature support suggests that our classifier makes meaningful predictions. Note that, for this analysis, we selected predictions by using very stringent criteria, requiring that each predicted new member is predicted to be in a co-complexed pair with every member in the MIPS complex. In principle, we could make a larger number of predictions with a more lenient cutoff.

At an FDR threshold of 10%, this set contains 686 CCPPs among 200 proteins. These predictions can be represented as an undirected graph, with proteins as nodes and predicted co-complex relationships as edges. We identified predicted new complexes as maximal cliques in this graph, where a <italic>clique</italic> is a set of nodes with every pair of nodes in the set connected by an edge, and a <italic>maximal clique</italic> is a clique to which no node in the graph can be added to create a larger clique. In general, finding maximal cliques is an NP-hard problem, but because our network is relatively small and sparse, we were able to perform exhaustive enumeration to identify all maximal cliques. We thereby identified 199 maximal cliques with size of at least 3, including one clique of size 11, one clique of size 10, seven cliques of size 9, and so on down to 48 cliques of size 3. Many of these cliques overlap one another. For example, the clique of size 11 and the clique of size 10 share 9 proteins in common. We therefore created a network consisting of just these predicted cliques. This network, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000054-g007">Figure 7</xref>, consists of four connected components. We performed GO enrichment analysis on these components with GO::TermFinder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Boyle1">[50]</xref> and summarized the results in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000054-t003">Table 3</xref>.

We applied the diffusion kernel to the two-hybrid, APMS and genetic interaction networks, and we found that, in all three cases, a diffusion kernel performs much better than a linear kernel or the mutual clustering coefficient (MCC). A diffusion kernel computes the similarity between two vertices by summing over all paths connecting the two vertices with paths of shorter lengths receiving higher weight. In contrast, a linear kernel or MCC only considers paths of length 2. Our results indicate that taking into account the full network topology improves the prediction of CCPP edges. We also applied our prediction scheme to the protein pairs identified by two recent large scale APMS data sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Gavin2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Krogan1">[22]</xref>. Our predicted positives are enriched with protein pairs identified by both groups with high statistical significance, and are consistent with the highly accurate data set of Collins et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Collins1">[48]</xref> Our method can thus be used to select a subset of these large scale results with better accuracy and reliability.</p><p>Different data sources provide complementary information, and each data source may have the best predictive power for a subset of data points. For instance, some protein pairs may have no sequence homologs, and some other protein pairs may not be included in the yeast two-hybrid screen experiments. Therefore, the combination of a variety of data sources has the potential to improve CCPP recognition. Kernel methods present a natural way to combine features by the summation of kernel matrices. Our results show that the TPPK applied to the summation of the sequence and diffusion kernels performs significantly better than either the sequence or the diffusion kernels alone. Inclusion of RBF kernels on five additional data sets improves the ROC<sub>50</sub> performance further from 0.859 to 0.937. We did not optimize the relative weights of the TPPK and RBF kernels. One future direction is to learn these weights by using semidefinite programming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Lanckriet2">[51]</xref>, sequential minimal optimization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Bach1">[52]</xref> or semi-infinite programming <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000054-Sonnenburg1">[53]</xref>.</p><p>The method described here is specifically designed to work well in the presence of heterogeneous data—primary sequence, expression, interaction networks, etc. As such, the method can be applied fairly directly to other well-studied eukaryotic genomes. The minimal requirement for applying this method, or indeed any supervised learning algorithm, to a new organism is the availability of data (e.g., protein sequences) and labels (a set of known protein-protein interactions). In practice, the latter is much more difficult to come by. Typically, a genome with a sufficiently large set of high-quality interaction labels will likely also have available non-sequence data such as high-throughput interaction data and expression profiles.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to thank Trisha N.
