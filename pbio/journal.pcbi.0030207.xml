The known functions of genes enable the characterization of the aggregate biological functions of these modules. In this paper, we use a high-throughput approach to identify the effective mutual regulatory interactions between modules composed of mouse genes from the Alliance for Cell Signaling (AfCS) murine B-lymphocyte database which tracks the response of ∼15,000 genes following chemokine perturbation. This analysis reveals principles of cellular organization that we discuss along four conceptual axes. (1) Regulatory implications: the derived collection of influences between any two modules quantifies intuitive as well as unexpected regulatory interactions. (2) Behavior across scales: trends across global networks of varying resolution (composed of various numbers of modules) reveal principles of assembly of high-level behaviors from smaller components. (3) Temporal behavior: tracking the mutual module influences over different time intervals provides features of regulation dynamics such as duration, persistence, and periodicity. (4) Gene Ontology correspondence: the association of modules to known biological roles of individual genes describes the organization of functions within coexpressed modules of various sizes. We present key specific results in each of these four areas, as well as derive general principles of cellular organization. At the coarsest scale, the entire transcriptional network contains five divisions: two divisions devoted to ATP production/biosynthesis and DNA replication that activate all other divisions, an “extracellular interaction” division that represses all other divisions, and two divisions (proliferation/differentiation and membrane infrastructure) that activate and repress other divisions in specific ways consistent with cell cycle control.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>In a eukaryotic organism such as the mouse, the complete transcriptional network contains ∼15,000 genes and up to 225 million regulatory relationships between pairs of genes. Determining all of these relationships is currently intractable using traditional experimental techniques, and, thus, a comprehensive description of the entire mouse transcriptional network is elusive. Alternatively, one can apply the limited amount of experimental data to determine the entire transcriptional network at a less detailed, higher level. This is analogous to considering a map of the world resolved to the kilometer rather than to the millimeter. Here, we derive from mouse microarray data several high-scale transcriptional networks by determining the mutual effective regulatory influences of large modules of genes. In particular, global transcriptional networks containing 12 to 72 modules are derived, and analysis of these multiscale networks reveals properties of the transcriptional network that are universal at all scales (e.g., maintenance of homeostasis) and properties that vary as a function of scale (e.g., the fractions of module pairs that exert mutual regulation). In addition, we describe how cellular functions associated with large modules (those containing many genes) are composed of more specific functions associated with smaller modules.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received no specific funding for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>de Bivort B, Huang S, Bar-Yam Y (2007) Empirical multiscale networks of cellular regulation.

High-throughput data has yielded progress in molecular-level descriptions of interactions of genes, proteins, and metabolites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b014">14</xref>]; however, understanding an entire cell or its major components from genetic information is a major methodological challenge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b015">15</xref>]. Here, we use genome-wide expression Alliance for Cell Signaling (AfCS) data to first empirically obtain modular functions and then empirically obtain the effective inhibitory and activating regulatory influences between these modules at many scales of resolution (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This approach yields copious results about effective regulatory interactions so that a complete discussion is not possible in a single manuscript. Thus, we approached the results in the manner of other high-throughput and genome-wide analyses, presenting general principles that apply across all the data as well as a selection of individual observations that are discussed in greater detail in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-sd002">Text S1</xref>.

This correlative analysis aggregates direct and indirect causal influences, and co-occurring behaviors. Still, the transition matrix obtained can be used to predict [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b015">15</xref>] the transcriptional level changes of large cellular modules over fixed time intervals with surprising accuracy (<italic>r</italic> &gt; 0.95). This approach generates many specific results, each of which is the strength and polarity (activating or inhibiting) effective regulatory influence of one functional module on another. The results are derived directly from experimental data and are statistically validated.</p><p>This multiscale analysis yields a description of cell behavior in terms of traditional biological concepts (i.e., cellular or physiological systems such as “respiration” and “mitosis”), identifying the genes whose collective behavior they comprise. At all scales, new network models of regulatory interactions among modules encompassing the behavior of the <italic>entire</italic> cell are presented. Previous studies have considered genome-wide multiscale groupings of genes according to their expression behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b018">18</xref>]. This work extends the paradigm of multiscale gene grouping by determining for the first time, at multiple scales, the network of mutual regulation of groups of genes on groups of genes, an approach that is analogous to having geographic maps of varying resolution.</p><p>Our analysis of attributes of these novel cellular-level regulatory networks reveals principles of organization, such as scale-dependent homeostatic feedback and target specificity, and asymmetric restrictions on the number of ingoing and outgoing regulatory influences. Knowledge gained that is unique to multiscale analysis includes how functions of smaller modules contribute to the aggregate function of larger modules, which is analogous to how physiological systems are composed of organs, and organs out of tissues.</p><p>We provide all of the networks and Gene Ontology (GO) data in the supporting information, as well as a discussion of the statistical methods used to identify them. Specific questions about interactions between cellular modules can be addressed with these databases, as well as general insights or quantitative models of cellular response to perturbations. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-sd002">Text S1</xref>, we discuss in detail samples of (1) randomly chosen and (2) particularly intriguing regulatory relationships inferred from our analysis. These examples can be considered at length, as they provide a large number of specific insights into the complex biological functioning of the cell, manifesting the ability of our methodology to extract them, and the informational value of the large AfCS datasets. Given the high complexity of cellular function, it should not be expected that a simple summary of modular interactions would serve as a sufficient description of the large number of results obtained. In the Results section, we focus on a selection of results that demonstrate the variety of interesting results that were found and general principles that have been abstracted from them.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Regulatory Implications</title><p>The mutual regulatory influences for networks comprising <italic>n</italic> = 12, 20, 42, and 72 cellular modules are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g002">Figure 2</xref> for the 1.5-h time-interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-st003">Table S3</xref>). These regulatory networks reveal a wealth of information about regulation at the cellular level. For the <italic>n</italic> = 12 scale, we have previously reported a number of key results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b015">15</xref>]. Considering the new results at the <italic>n</italic> = 20 scale, module 3 is a global (pleiotropic) activator. Appropriately, module 3 contains a significant overabundance of genes involved in aerobic respiration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-st004">Table S4</xref>). Since these genes contribute to increased cellular energy, it is not surprising that module 3 is a ubiquitous activator of transcription. Module 9 is activated by module 3, and has a statistically significant association only with mitosis. Cell proliferation is known to suppress transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b019">19</xref>], so it is appropriate that module 9 is a repressor of many modules, including itself. Its targets include module 3, one of many examples of negative/homeostatic feedback, consistent with the known coupling of respiration and the cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b020">20</xref>]. Some modules have no regulatory outputs in these networks, e.g., module 15, which has an overabundance of genes involved in nucleosome assembly. This is surprising because increased DNA binding by nucleosomes correlates with lower transcriptional levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b022">22</xref>]. Examples of positive autoregulation can also be found; module 16 is associated with oxygen regulation and is self-activating. The specific strengths of these and all other effective influences are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-st003">Table S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-sd002">Text S1</xref> provides a discussion of many additional specific regulatory interactions, including intuitive and surprising examples.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030207-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030207.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Effective Regulatory Influences at Many Scales (Top to Bottom) over a 1.5-h Interval</title><p>(A,E,I,M) Regulatory influence networks, with red arrows indicating inhibition and black activation.

It is striking, particularly for <italic>n</italic> &gt; 12, that while every module has several inputs, many modules have no outputs (shown in gray). These correspond to modules that are nonregulatory. Not surprisingly, similar expression responses (adjacency in the SOM arrays) more often correspond to input similarity than to output similarity.</p><p>To convey the distribution of all interactions, from strongly activating to strongly inhibiting, we cluster-ordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b023">23</xref>] the rows and columns of the <italic>n</italic> × <italic>n</italic> transition matrices at each scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g002">Figure 2</xref>, right panels). Rows were ordered by similarity in functional input and columns by similarity in functional output, since the value at row <italic>i</italic>, column <italic>j</italic> is the effect of module <italic>j</italic> on module <italic>i</italic>. Vertical bands in the matrices imply that modules tend to have a uniform output, a property absent in randomized controls (unpublished data). These global influences may reflect a restricted energy economy in which consumption or production transcriptionally inhibits or activates all other cellular activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>A goal of developing larger-scale models is to relate genetic function to conceptually accessible models of cellular function. Still, even at the largest scale given above, with 12 modules and 144 potential interactions, it is hard to develop a complete mental picture of the behavior of the cell. We therefore developed an even more accessible, larger-scale summary of cellular function, which can serve as a first guide to the understanding of cell behavior at all finer levels of organization. Inspecting the regulatory effects of the groups reveals that the cell transcription network at <italic>n</italic> = 12 can be partitioned into five functional divisions: (1) energy and component production, (2) proliferation and differentiation, (3) extracellular interaction, (4) membrane infrastructure, and (5) DNA replication. Groups 0, 1, and 4 comprise the first division. They are all enriched for genes involved in ATP synthesis and the production of nucleic acids and proteins, and are appropriately all global activators of transcription over short time-scales (1.5 h). Each group has unique sub-behaviors, with group 0 involved in endocytosis and group 1 in apoptosis and protein folding. Group 4 is involved in cell-cycle regulation (group 4 is also a global activator over 1 h), providing a connection between energy production and proliferation.</p><p>Groups 2 and 3 belong to the division contributing to proliferation and differentiation. They are both enriched for genes involved in small-molecule metabolism, and unlike the previous division, they are not global activators of transcription. Instead, they activate their own division over all time-scales and inhibit the DNA replication division (below), particularly after 1 and 3 h. This periodic repression of DNA replication by the proliferation division may provide for the timing of S-phase during the cell cycle. Group 2 shares some functions with the first division, containing genes involved in translation and transcription, but has no role in ATP synthesis. Like group 4, it is involved in regulating the cell cycle. Group 3 has specific sub-functions related to the immune response, cell adhesion, and, more generally, behaviors unique to particular cell types.</p><p>Groups 5, 8, and 9 are unified by gene content related to interactions between the cell and its external environment (division 3). They are respectively enriched for genes involved in cell matrix/adhesion and endocytosis; oxygen transport and exocytosis; and oxygen transport, chemotaxis, and the immune response. Functionally, all of these genes are global repressors of transcription after 1.5 h, with regulatory influences that are in opposition to the energy and component production division. Group 5 is also a weak early (0.5–1 h) activator of global transcription.</p><p>Groups 6 and 7 comprise the membrane infrastructure division, with both enriched for genes involved in the physical production and maintenance of the cell membrane, such as lipid metabolism, lipid catabolism, and cholesterol metabolism. These groups are generally self-activating, but do not exert strong global transcriptional influences on other groups over any time interval, consistent with their infrastructural role. Unlike other divisions, these groups are virtually indistinguishable in terms of gene function.</p><p>Last, groups 10 and 11 form the DNA replication division. They are enriched for nucleotide synthesis, nucleosome assembly, and regulators of DNA methylation. They are both strong global activators of transcription 2 h after they are activated, and while group 11 is at other times a weak global activator of transcription, group 10 is essentially not globally regulatory over other intervals. Group 10 is also uniquely enriched for genes promoting and suppressing apoptosis, and, like groups 8 and 9, has role in oxygen regulation.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Behavior across Scales</title><p>We analyzed trends in the networks to determine which cellular properties hold across scales of observation and which vary with scale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The sparseness (identified interactions/total possible interactions; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g002">Figure 2</xref>, second column of panels) follows power-law scaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). Specifically, while the number of possible edges grows as <italic>n<sup>2</sup></italic>, the number of inferred influences grows linearly. This leads to progressively sparser and sparser matrices. For our four scales, this trend was very closely fit (<italic>r<sup>2</sup></italic> = 0.9991) by a power-law with exponent −0.92. Extrapolating this trend gives very rough predictions of ∼39,250 regulating interactions in the 6,000-gene yeast genome and ∼197,000 in mammals. The former falls between the number expected for genetic interactions (97,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b024">24</xref>] and 100,000 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b025">25</xref>]) and the number of expected physical interactions (8,300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b026">26</xref>] and 6,300 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b027">27</xref>]).

We suspect this reflects an inherent limitation—while a module can broadcast regulation over a large number of target modules (i.e., the overrepresentation of high numbers of outputs in the power-law distribution), each module is limited in the number of inputs it can usefully accept. These properties are also seen in influence networks of engineering projects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b029">29</xref>].

The magnitudes of influences appear exponentially distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g003">Figure 3</xref>G) at all scales, implying a functional cutoff in influence strength. Given that the interaction of two modules is composed of the interactions of many pairs of constituent genes, this functional cutoff could be explained by assuming that individual gene interactions have a characteristic strength and occur effectively randomly. However, these assumptions may be too strong, and there may be selective advantages to bounding interaction strengths, such as limiting total module expression. We also considered the relationship between the average input and output of each module. For all <italic>n</italic>, these measures were anticorrelated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g003">Figure 3</xref>H).</p><p>At the finest scale of <italic>n</italic> = 72, the targets of a particular module output tended to have similar expression profiles. This was manifested in the frequent adjacency of modules' targets in the SOM array (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). We would expect this result at finer scales, since modules with similar expression patterns should have similar regulators at fine scales. The modules were hierarchically clustered according to correlation in their effects on target modules using the Fitch-Margoliash algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g004">Figure 4</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g004">4</xref>E). The coarser trees (<italic>n</italic> = 12 and 20) only show variation along a single dimension ranging from all-activating to all-inhibiting outputs, without sub-branches. This implies that outputs of each module tend to be uniform across all targets. More specific targeting at smaller scales appears as sub-trees branching off the linear portion of the tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g004">Figure 4</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g004">4</xref>E insets) composed of modules that activate some targets but inhibit others.

We calculated the average output influence of each module as a function of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-sg001">Figure S1</xref>); modules with similar regulation under all assayed conditions (such as putative housekeeping modules and constitutively repressed modules) have lower-magnitude outputs than modules that are regulated in a situation-dependent manner. Modules with weak outputs tend to occur around the periphery of the SOM array, while modules with the greatest variance are in the interior. “Peripheral modules” tend to have monotonically increasing or decreasing responses to all perturbations, whereas the interior modules' responses are more complex.</p><p>Averaging the magnitudes of the mean outputs of each module over all the modules reveals which time intervals mediate the greatest changes in expression. At all scales the average influence magnitude varies periodically with time, with greater frequency at finer scales (i.e., for <italic>n</italic> = 12, the most potent influences occur over <italic>t</italic> = 1.5 h, and the least over <italic>t</italic> = 3 h, whereas for <italic>n</italic> = 42, those times are 1 h and 2 h, respectively; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-sg001">Figure S1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-sg001">S1</xref>D). Moreover, the magnitude of influences decreases at finer scales.

The module partitioning is not strictly hierarchical, since the boundaries between modules at one scale need not align with the boundaries between modules at a different scale. Thus, a set of genes in a single module at smaller scales may be found across more than one module at larger scales. Moreover, the nonhierarchical organization of genes into behaviorally related modules is an observation derived from the data. If gene behavior were hierarchically organized, the SOM algorithm would have found fine-scale modules that were strict subsets of large-scale modules.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030207-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030207.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>Contribution of Smaller-Scale Modules to Larger-Scale Modules and Aggregation of Ontological Function</title><p>(A–C) Mappings of modules at finer scales (right array) to larger scales (left array).

For example, in the <italic>n</italic> = 12 case, the “intracellular protein transport” function is coassociated with either ”protein biosynthesis” (in module 0) or “glycolysis” (in module 1), respectively, but at the <italic>n</italic> = 20 scale, “intracellular protein transport” occurs independently in modules 1 and 6, and in conjunction with “protein synthesis” in module 5 and “glycolysis” in module 2. In addition, the dissociation of the two modules labeled “intracellular protein transport” at <italic>n</italic> = 12 into four modules at <italic>n</italic> = 20 also illustrates how higher-specificity functions are aggregated to form larger-scale functions of lower specificity.</p><p>Finally, we examined to what extent the distribution of sub-functions across the multiscale SOM groupings can predict relatedness of GO function.

The deepest distinctions in the tree are based on differences in distribution at the <italic>n</italic> = 12 scale, while the shallowest branches are determined by the <italic>n</italic> = 20 scale. The clustering indicates that the hierarchy of GO functions (in an abstract functional sense) can be inferred solely from the distributions of genes across the SOM groupings. That the association between GO groups and multiscale SOM gene modules can be used to partially reconstruct the GO hierarchy implies that SOM module identity predicts a gene's function in terms of familiar large-scale cellular behaviors. This indicates that SOM grouping across levels provides an additional tool for identifying gene function.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>We have determined networks of regulatory influences exerted by large groups of similarly behaving genes on other such large groups across multiple scales of resolution. These effective regulatory influences between modules are composed of direct and indirect causal mechanisms as well as temporally correlated effects that are seen across all 33 perturbations. Given a perturbation of gene expression, all of these components contribute to a prediction of the transcriptional state at later times [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b015">15</xref>]. Since the effective regulatory interactions accurately predict the transcriptional state, they capture almost all of the biologically relevant causal regulation occurring within that time interval.</p><p>We determined these effective regulatory interactions between gene modules at different scales of observations comprising between five and 72 components. The gene composition of these modules is not strictly hierarchical; i.e., two genes in the same fine-scale group may not belong to the same large-scale group. This is a natural consequence of imposing discrete classification categories onto systems that need not be hierarchically structured across scales. For example, if one were to classify visible colors into six categories, they might very well comprise red, orange, yellow, green, blue, and indigo. The hues “yellow-orange” and “yellow-green” might reasonably fall into the yellow category of this six-group partitioning. However, if one divides the same colors into three higher-scale categories—red, green, and blue—those two same hues would fall into separate categories (red and green, respectively). Similar considerations apply to physiological and metabolic categories. Therefore, our a priori expectation should be that gene modules would be nonhierarchical across multiple scales, as is observed in results of the SOM partitioning.</p><p>From these groups and regulatory influences, we derived many results comprising a first multiscale analysis of global gene-regulatory influences. We consistently observed mechanisms consistent with the maintenance of homeostatic equilibrium across the modules, particularly at higher scales. For example, the apparent regulatory dissimilarity of modules with similar expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g002">2</xref>F, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g002">2</xref>J, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g002">2</xref>N) likely reflects a homeostatic mechanism in which it is unfavorable to have all coactivated modules as either strong activators or strong inhibitors. This pattern is found at all scales analyzed. The near parity between the number of activating modules and inhibiting modules in networks of all analyzed scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g003">Figure 3</xref>F) could reflect a homeostatic requirement that the total rate of transcription remain roughly constant (provided regulatory strength and transcriptional rate are uncorrelated). We observe that the net input and average output of a module are negatively correlated, particularly at the highest scales. This can be understood as reflecting another homeostatic mechanism. If a module is on average an activator (inhibitor), its input tends to be inhibitory (activating) to avoid positive feedback that causes large fluctuations from equilibrium in the total transcriptional level. Interestingly, at finer scales, there is increasing correlation between average module input and output, reflecting the increasing possibility of positive feedback. Positive feedback often leads to bistability or multistability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b030">30</xref>], a property required for developmental differentiation. Consistent with our finding of positive feedback at small scales, cell-fate decisions are typically controlled by small circuits of mutually regulatory “master genes” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b032">32</xref>]. In contrast, homeostatic regulation (e.g., of basic metabolic states) involves large-scale biochemical networks where robustness to fluctuations is necessary for overall stability of cell function. Positive feedback would therefore be excluded at this highest scale to avoid unsustainable abrupt genome-wide changes in gene expression.</p><p>A multiscale approach is conceptually essential given the organization of living systems into structures at many scales, and is critical given the staggering challenge of obtaining a complete description of pairwise gene interactions. Still, in view of the complexity of biological function, there is a large amount of information that arises from a multiscale analysis. In this sense, our analysis can be considered as foundational to the development of many other results. It is a high-throughput analysis methodology analogous to high-throughput experimental methods of genome sequencing or gene expression data collection; through our approach, a seemingly overwhelming amount of data is generated by high-throughput consideration of the large number of regulatory interactions of modules across multiple scales. Our analysis of these results has been correspondingly multiscale. First, we identified global principles, such as the many facets of homeostasis and universality of regulatory effects at larger scales. Second, we found new patterns of multiscale organization, such as the dichotomous distributions of the number of regulatory inputs and outputs at various scales, the increased target specificity and speed of regulation at finer scales, and the aggregation of sub-module functions into collective larger-scale functions. Last, we provide detailed discussion of many specific regulatory relationships in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030207-sd002">Text S1</xref>. The diversity of analysis points the way to many new lines of investigation, in particular experimentally testable hypotheses at large scales of cellular organization.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><p>To separate genes into modules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b009">9</xref>] and determine their mutual regulation, we used the AfCS murine B-lymphocyte perturbation expression data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b033">33</xref>] tracking the response of ∼15,000 genes to 33 perturbations at four time points (0.5 h, 1 h, 2 h, and 4 h; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030207-g001">Figure 1</xref>B).

Generally, genes that had monotonic responses to many perturbations (i.e., always being activated or repressed) tended to be placed in the corner positions of this array. These groupings were performed using the GEDI software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030207-b035">35</xref>].</p><p>Varying <italic>n</italic> allowed us to consider global sets of modules at various scales of description.
