Cognition-related behavior has also been described along “well-trodden paths”—spatial habits established by animals in the wild and in captivity reflecting a form of spatial memory. In the present study we combine the study of Open Field behavior with the study of behavior on well-trodden paths, revealing a form of locational memory that appears to correlate with spatial memory. The tracked path of the mouse is used to examine the dynamics of visiting behavior to locations. A visit is defined as either progressing through a location or stopping there, where progressing and stopping are computationally defined. We then estimate the probability of stopping at a location as a function of the number of previous visits to that location, i.e., we measure the effect of visiting history to a location on stopping in it. This can be regarded as an estimate of the familiarity of the mouse with locations. The recently wild-derived inbred strain CZECHII shows the highest effect of visiting history on stopping, C57 inbred mice show a lower effect, and DBA mice show no effect. We employ a rarely used, bottom-to-top computational approach, starting from simple kinematics of movement and gradually building our way up until we end with (emergent) locational memory. The effect of visiting history to a location on stopping in it can be regarded as an estimate of the familiarity of the mouse with locations, implying memory of these locations. We show that the magnitude of this estimate is strain-specific, implying a genetic influence. The dynamics of this process reveal that locations along the mouse's trodden path gradually become places of attraction, where the mouse stops habitually.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Spatially guided behavior and spatial memory are central subjects in behavioral neuroscience. Many tasks have been developed for laboratory investigations of these subjects since no single task can reveal their full richness. Here we turn to the simplest and oldest “task”, which involves no task at all: introducing a mouse into a large arena and tracking its free behavior. Traditionally, the test is used for studying emotionality and locomotor behavior, using simple summaries of the mouse's path such as its length and the percent of time spent away from walls. More sophisticated computational analysis of the dynamics of the path enables us to separate visiting behavior at locations into stops and passings. Using this distinction, the mouse's path reveals quantifiable locational memory: the mouse's decision to stop in a location is based on its visiting history there. In some strains of mice, the visited locations gradually become places of attraction where the mouse stops habitually. In other strains, the phenomenon is not evident at all. Such quantifiable characterization of locational memory now enables further exploration of the senses that mediate this type of memory and allows measurement and comparisons across mouse strains and across genetic and pharmacological preparations.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by grant 915/05 from The Israel Science Foundation.

We use the organization of elementary patterns for revealing memory-related phenomena.</p><p>Low-level kinematic features such as the animal's instantaneous location and speed are extracted from the tracked paths by using special smoothing algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Drai1">[1]</xref>. These have been used to statistically partition the mouse's trajectory into intrinsically defined segments of progression and of staying-in-place (stops, lingering episodes; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Drai2">[2]</xref>). In previous work on rats, examination of the spatial distribution of stops revealed the home base-the most preferred place in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Eilam1">[3]</xref>. The home-base is used by the animal as a reference around which it performs structured roundtrips <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Tchernichovski1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Tchernichovski2">[5]</xref>. The home-base also exerts a constraint on the number of stops per roundtrip: the probability of returning to the home-base is an increasing function of the number of stops already performed by the animal in that roundtrip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Golani1">[6]</xref>. The home-base acts as an attractor in 2 ways: first, in the vast majority of cases the animal stops in this place upon visiting it, and second, within a roundtrip, this place exerts a gradually increasing attraction on the rat to return to it. Both forms of attraction imply recognition and memory of home-base location. In the present study, starting with the same trajectory data, we approach the issue of recognition and memory of places in a different way, by examining stopping behavior across all locations in the periphery of the open field.</p><p>We accomplish this aim by establishing the history of visits to locations all around the periphery of the arena, where visits are classified as stops or passings. We then determine whether the number of previous visits to a location affects the animal's decision to stop in it. An effect of visiting history on the probability of stopping would imply recognition and therefore locational memory.</p><p>We used two inbred strains commonly contrasted for their spatial memory—C57BL/6, which is considered to have good spatial memory, and DBA/2, whose performance is poor (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Bolivar1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Upchurch1">[9]</xref>; see however <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Wahlsten1">[10]</xref>), and as a third strain, the recently wild-derived strain CZECHII whose spatial behavior might be less affected by domestication.</p><p>This study, which has been part of an ethological analysis of mouse exploratory behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Fonio1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Lipkind1">[14]</xref>, provides a high throughput test for locational memory.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><p>Since most activity takes place at the periphery of the circular arena (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), we moved to polar coordinates description of the smoothed path (with (0,0) at the center of the circular arena). As illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000027-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, the polar projection of the mouse's path as a function of time was punctuated by stops (black dots) in an apparently sporadic manner. While the mouse's decision to stop at a specific location upon traversing it could be taken randomly we wanted to take a closer look at the possibility that it still depended on the history of visits to that location. For that purpose we first established a record of visits in reference to a location, classifying each visit as a stop or a passing through. We then studied jointly records for all locations, and calculated the probability of stopping during a specific visit to a location as a function of the ordinal number of that visit. A change in this probability across visits would have implied that the decision to stop was influenced by visiting history.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000027-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000027.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Establishing a Record of Visits in Reference to a Location.</title><p>(A) CZECHII mouse's polar angles across the first 25 min of a session.

In the third strain, the ordinal number of a visit to a location appears to be irrelevant for the decision whether to pass through the location or stop in it. In the strains that show increased probability of stopping with consecutive visits to a location, this is not due to a general tendency of the mice to stop more frequently with time. On the contrary—the tendency to stop either decreases or stays unchanged across the session in all mice and strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000027-g005">Figure 5</xref>).

The locational memory highlighted in the present study implies spatial recognition and familiarity, and therefore also reflects spatial memory, but the particular contribution of each of the sensory modalities to the mouse's orientation is not known. Support for visual guidance by distal cues is indicated by the consistency of our results with those obtained for visually guided tests of spatial memory in 2 of the strains (CZECHII mice have not been tested yet for spatial memory).

The hypothesis that a change in the probability of stopping in locations across visits is mediated by the accumulation of olfactory cues, which are in turn accumulated across visits is untenable, as it would require a mechanism explaining why scent accumulation has no influence on stopping in DBA/2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000027-g006">Figure 6</xref>, lower panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000027.s002">Fig S2</xref>), a strain gifted with a more sensitive olfactory sense than C57 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Mihalick1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Wysocki1">[26]</xref>, does influence stopping, but in 2 opposite ways, in C57 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000027-g006">Figure 6</xref>, middle panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000027.s002">Fig S2</xref>), and only increases stopping in the CZECHII mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000027-g006">Figure 6</xref>, upper panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000027.s002">Fig S2</xref>). Estimating locational memory in open field behavior recorded in full darkness would tell us to what extent this construct is supported by information derived from self movement. Finally, dependence on the hippocampus can be investigated by using lesions or temporary inactivation of this structure, and the role played by memory on this phenomenon, although not specific to spatial memory only, can be investigated by using pharmacological disruption that is predictive of memory loss. Whatever the underlying mechanisms, locational memory, which has been shown to be strain-specific can now be compared across strains and preparations.</p></sec><sec id="s3c"><title>The Relationship between Locational Memory and the Level of Activity</title><p>Since our measure is based on locomotor behavior, there is a concern that this measure is influenced by the animal's level of activity. To rule out this possibility we examined the correlation between distance traveled per mouse-session and the corresponding rate of change in the probability of stopping as a function of the number of visits. The correlation was small and not statistically significant (r = −.2, p&lt;.05), implying that within the range of values obtained in this study, the level of activity does not influence our measure.</p><p>Examination of pharmacological preparations exhibiting hyperactivity (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Geyer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Ralph1">[28]</xref>) could further elucidate the issue of the influence of activity on the measure of locational memory. In 3 previously performed studies on the effect of dopamine-stimulants on locomotor behavior in general, and on stopping in locations in particular, all 3 drugs induced hyperactivity, but had 3 distinct effects on stopping in locations. (+)-amphetamine-induced hyperactivity was associated with a consolidation of stereotypic stopping in a limited number of locations in a relatively fixed order <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Eilam2">[29]</xref>; quinpirole- induced hyperactivity was associated with the performance of stopping in 2 fixed and several varying locations between them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Szechtman1">[30]</xref>; and apomorphine-induced hyperactivity was dissociated from stopping in fixed locations, showing no organization in relation to the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Szechtman2">[31]</xref>. Since under the influence of the first 2 drugs the probability of stopping in specific locations increases, locational memory is implied, and our measure would have reflected it. The absence of an increase in the probability of stopping under the influence of the 3<sup>rd</sup> drug would have resulted in a near-zero rate of change in the probability of stopping implying no locational memory.</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>Newly Derived versus Classical Inbred Strains</title><p>CZECHII mice show a significantly higher rate of change in stopping probability than C57, implying even better spatial abilities.

It defined, therefore, the animal's increasing familiarity with the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Tchernichovski2">[5]</xref>. A high level of familiarity ( =  exposure) was also indicated by a reversal of speed differences in relation to the home-base: in a novel environment, the outbound portion of a trip was characterized by lower speeds, and the inbound portion–by higher speeds; in a well-trodden environment the speed difference was shown to be reversed.

The increasing tendency to stop in well-trodden places, in the sense offered by von Uexkull <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-VonUexkull1">[41]</xref>, reflects the consolidation of a spatial habit: repeated visits to a location are accompanied by an increasing tendency to stop in that location, culminating in turning it into a relatively stable spatial attractor (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Thelen1">[42]</xref>; or, in the case of a decreasing tendency to stop, a repeller).</p></sec><sec id="s3f"><title>Classifying Locations by Their Level of Attraction</title><p>A gradual increase or decrease in the probability of stopping along trodden paths reflects respectively an increasing attraction or an increasing repulsion to a location.

The sim-rat increases excursion distance from home-base as a linear function of two system parameters, one governing the rate of motivation loss during movement away from the home-base, and the other the rate of (location-specific) familiarization. The sim-rat's velocity pattern is correlated with the familiarity with places, changing gradually from slow-outbound–fast-inbound, to fast-outbound–slow-inbound. It had been concluded in that analytical study that one shortcoming of the model was that the sim-rat moved continuously, while the movement pattern of a real animal includes stops. It has been further suggested that a comprehensive model of exploratory behavior should include a stochastic component accounting for the stops. The measured changes in the probability of stopping along well-trodden paths specify this stochastic component.</p></sec><sec id="s3h"><title>A High Throughput Test of Spatially Guided Behavior in a Less Stressful Environment</title><p>The test commonly used for the estimation of spatial memory is the Morris water maze <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000027-Morris1">[43]</xref>.

A visit to a location started when the mouse entered the location and ended when it left the location. Because the locations had been defined in an arbitrary way, small insignificant trespassing of the path into adjacent rectangles would have been considered as visits. Therefore, 2 successive visits to the same rectangle were considered as such only if the mouse reached a “long enough” distance from that rectangle between the 2 visits.
