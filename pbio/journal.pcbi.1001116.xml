                <p>In the past decade, over 50 genome-scale metabolic reconstructions have been
                    built for a variety of single- and multi- cellular organisms. These
                    reconstructions have enabled a host of computational methods to be leveraged for
                    systems-analysis of metabolism, leading to greater understanding of observed
                    phenotypes. These methods have been sparsely applied to comparisons between
                    multiple organisms, however, due mainly to the existence of differences between
                    reconstructions that are inherited from the respective reconstruction processes
                    of the organisms to be compared. To circumvent this obstacle, we developed a
                    novel process, termed metabolic network reconciliation, whereby non-biological
                    differences are removed from genome-scale reconstructions while keeping the
                    reconstructions as true as possible to the underlying biological data on which
                    they are based. This process was applied to two organisms of great importance to
                    disease and biotechnological applications, <italic>Pseudomonas
                        aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic>, respectively.
                    The result is a pair of revised genome-scale reconstructions for these organisms
                    that can be analyzed at a systems level with confidence that differences are
                    indicative of true biological differences (to the degree that is currently
                    known), rather than artifacts of the reconstruction process. The reconstructions
                    were re-validated with various experimental data after reconciliation. With the
                    reconciled and validated reconstructions, we performed a genome-wide comparison
                    of metabolic flexibility between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P.
                        putida</italic> that generated significant new insight into the underlying
                    biology of these important organisms. Through this work, we provide a novel
                    methodology for reconciling models, present new genome-scale reconstructions of
                        <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> that can be
                    directly compared at a network level, and perform a network-wide comparison of
                    the two species. These reconstructions provide fresh insights into the metabolic
                    similarities and differences between these important
                        <italic>Pseudomonads</italic>, and pave the way towards full comparative
                    analysis of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions of multiple species.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Over the past decade, the increasing availability of fully sequenced genomes,
                    functional genomics databases, and a broad existing scientific literature on
                    metabolism have been leveraged towards the generation of genome-scale metabolic
                    reconstructions for a wide variety of organisms. A major hurdle in the field,
                    however, is the lack of standardization in this ‘metabolic
                    reconstruction’ process, which makes it difficult to compare
                    reconstructions of multiple species with each other. Notably, it is difficult to
                    determine if differences seen between the models are of biological origin, or if
                    they reflect noise from the respective reconstruction processes. To address this
                    problem, we have developed a novel method, termed metabolic network
                    reconciliation, in which genome-scale models of two well-studied and
                    phylogenetically related bacteria (<italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P.
                        putida</italic>) were compared such that differences between the models not
                    upheld by biological evidence were eliminated. These reconciled models were
                    re-validated with experimental data, and used to explore differences in the
                    biology of these organisms and to gain insight into the reconstruction process
                    itself.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>With the development of rapid genome sequencing methodologies and powerful, scalable
                computational tools, the past decade has seen the generation of an increasing number
                of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions (metabolic GENREs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Feist1">[1]</xref>. These reconstructions generally
                account for the functions of hundreds to thousands of genes, and are intended to
                incorporate all known metabolic reactions for a particular organism into a
                standardized format, enabling the generation of a computational model that can be
                analyzed with a variety of emerging mathematical techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Oberhardt1">[2]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Despite the reconstruction of over 50 metabolic GENREs to date, little effort has
                been put towards comparison of multiple species at a genome level with a
                network-centric approach. Such a comparison is bound to yield interesting insights
                into the relationships between the structure of a metabolic network and the
                resulting phenotype of an organism, as well as contribute to the explanation of
                various physiological features such as virulence pathways and unique metabolic
                capabilities. Yet in order to draw meaningful conclusions from such a comparison, it
                is necessary to ensure that the identified differences are representative of true
                differences between the organisms, rather than artifacts from the reconstruction
                processes.</p>
            <p>The metabolic reconstruction process integrates the genome sequence and annotation of
                an organism with a multitude of different sources, including biological databases
                (e.g. Expasy, KEGG, BRENDA) and primary literature, to construct the metabolic GENRE
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Thiele1">[3]</xref>. A key
                difficulty in the reconstruction process is that these sources can contain
                incomplete and contradictory information, including ‘putative’ and
                ‘probable’ gene annotations, descriptions of enzymatic functions that
                require interpretation in order to be linked to specific substrates (e.g.,
                substrates such as ‘acceptor’ and ‘long-chain-acyl-CoA’),
                vague or missing data about reaction reversibility, and varying or often unknown
                enzyme efficiencies. Due to these issues, building a metabolic GENRE involves
                hundreds of decisions as to which genes possess which function, which reactions
                should be included, and finally in which direction these reactions occur. As these
                decisions are often based on ambiguous and even conflicting data, there is a high
                risk that, when two independently created GENREs are compared, a considerable number
                of the differences observed would be caused by the ‘noise’ in the
                reconstruction process itself rather than representing actual biology. Therefore,
                making any informative conclusions from a comparison between metabolic GENREs
                necessitates a prior preprocessing that brings the reconstructions to a common
                standard pertaining to naming conventions and, more importantly, that identifies
                whether the observed differences between the reconstructions are upheld by the
                biological evidence.</p>
            <p>To address these concerns, we have performed the first metabolic GENRE
                reconciliation, a process of eliminating erroneous differences between two existing
                metabolic GENRE<bold>s</bold>. Reconciliation is similar to but distinct from
                consensus building efforts such as metabolic reconstruction jamborees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Thiele2">[4]</xref>, as the focus is
                specifically on aligning metabolic reconstructions of two organisms to eliminate
                unverifiable differences, rather than merging different data to improve the
                metabolic GENRE of a single organism. This process was performed for the related but
                phenotypically distinct species, <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic> (PAO) and
                    <italic>Pseudomonas putida</italic> (PPU). These bacteria represent an ideal
                pair of organisms for a genome-scale metabolic comparison due to their tremendous
                scientific and medical importance. <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is an
                opportunistic pathogen, notorious for its chronic inhabitance of the lungs of cystic
                fibrosis patient and its role in causing acute and deadly nosocomial infections in
                immunocompromised patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Murray1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Gilligan1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Kipnis1">[7]</xref>. Both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P.

                insight into metabolic features contributing to pathogenicity.</p>
            <p>The metabolic GENRE of each of these species was previously published by our groups

                reconstruction accounts for the metabolic function of approximately 1000 genes,
                along with gene-protein-reaction associations and full stoichiometric
                representations of the majority of known metabolic reactions present in the genome
                of each bacterium. As a result of the reconciliation process we describe in this

                been validated with BIOLOG substrate utilization data and viability data for
                transposon-derived mutants. The reconstructions achieve similar degrees of accuracy
                as the original reconstructions they were based on, and as a result of the
                elimination of non-biological differences between the metabolic networks, are now

            <p>Network reconciliation is a process in which two previously reconstructed metabolic
                GENREs are compared with the null hypothesis that given no discriminating biological
                evidence for a given reaction to be included in one reconstruction but not the
                other, the reactions should be identically included in both. If sufficient evidence
                emerges that there is in fact a difference between the two organisms, then those
                differences are preserved in the final ‘reconciled’ GENREs that emerge
                from the process. The process of reconciliation is detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> with a specific example

                can then be compared against one another in confidence that differences reflect
                biological differences in metabolism, as differences arising from

                <title>Genome-scale homology search</title>
                <p>As each metabolic reconstruction is a reflection of the genetic content of the
                    respective organism, the comparison of two reconstructions requires
                    identification of the overlap between genomic content of the compared organisms.
                    As <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> are closely
                    related genomically and phylogenetically, it was expected that many orthologs
                    would exist with high homology, and thus shared functions. Therefore, as a first
                    step in the reconciliation process, we identified highly homologous gene pairs,
                    which we termed “reciprocal genes”. These reciprocal gene pairs were
                    used in the reconciliation process to determine the similarity of gene
                    associations for reactions in the two reconstructions, so identifying these
                    pairs was a crucial first step for performing the reconciliation.</p>
                <p>In order to identify reciprocal genes, we performed a homology search using the
                    BLAST algorithm against the <italic>P. putida</italic> genome sequence database
                    with <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> genes as queries and vice versa. The
                    searches were performed both with nucleotide and protein sequences. Two genes
                    were termed reciprocal only if, in every aforementioned BLAST search performed
                    with one of these genes as the query sequence, the other gene was reported as
                    the first hit (e.g., <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> gene X best matches
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> gene X in protein and nucleotide BLAST, and vice
                    versa). The metric used for comparing BLAST matches was the score of the highest
                    scoring pair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Altschul1">[17]</xref>. With this approach, a single gene can have at most
                    one reciprocal gene. Altogether, 3207 such pairs were identified (see Tables 1
                    and 2 in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>). This analysis provided a standard for comparing
                    gene functions between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P.
                        putida</italic>, as the reciprocal genes were assumed to have the same
                    function in the absence of opposing evidence.</p>

                <p>After identifying reciprocal gene pairs, we sought to identify the number of
                    differences between the two reconstructions, which would reveal the scope of the
                    reconciliation task. This step required identification of common metabolites and
                    reactions for both reconstructions, but as the two metabolic GENRE<bold>s</bold>
                    were built and are maintained by different groups and often incorporate
                    different names for many chemical species and reactions, this step was not
                    completely straightforward and could not be performed entirely automatically. Of
                    the set of 1328 reactions present in both reconstructions, we were unable to
                    find a match in the other reconstruction for 619 reactions; 277 reactions were
                    initially determined to have a functional but not an exact equivalent in the
                    other reconstruction (e.g. two reactions differing only in cofactor usage, but
                    performing <italic>de facto</italic> the same conversion). These numbers are
                    shown in Table 4 in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>. Of the Gene-Protein
                    Relationships (GPRs: see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Reed2">[18]</xref> for an in-depth explanation) of the 432 remaining
                    reactions (all of which were present in both reconstructions), 223 had identical
                    gene associations in both reconstructions (i.e. the reciprocal matches of all
                    genes associated with a given reaction in one reconstruction were associated
                    with the reaction in the other reconstruction and the genes were connected by
                    the same logical expression). These 233 reactions were left alone, since they
                    fulfilled the null hypothesis that no difference exists between the
                    reconstructions for the given reactions. Additionally, a set of 20 reactions
                    were removed from the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reconstruction because they
                    were partially redundant with other reactions in the reconstruction. This left a
                    total of 1074 reactions to be reconciled. These reactions contained differences
                    in reaction stoichiometry, reaction participation, or GPRs between the two
                    reconstructions, and during the reconciliation process each of these differences
                    was investigated and resolved in turn.</p>

                <title>Reconciliation process</title>
                <p>Having identified reciprocal gene pairs and outlined the general scope of the
                    reconciliation process, we next developed a system for assessing reactions in
                    the two reconstructions and determining how to best reconcile differences. The
                    process of reconciliation is schematically outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. Each reaction was
                    assessed individually in order to determine if differences between the two
                    reconstructions relating to that reaction were substantiated by experimental,
                    genomic, or other available evidence. First, all genes associated with the
                    reaction were assessed in both reconstructions. This assessment included an
                    evaluation of whether any of these genes were members of a reciprocal pair and,
                    if so, whether the other pair member was also assigned to the reaction. If a
                    discrepancy was found in assignment of the reciprocal pair members to a given
                    reaction, the reason for the discrepancy was identified and this discrepancy was
                    reconciled by either removing one pair member from or adding the other to the
                    GPR of the reaction. In addition to these types of discrepancies, genes not
                    possessing a reciprocal in the other organism were also thoroughly evaluated for
                    their function, in order to avoid creating or retaining apparent differences
                    (e.g., if functionally similar reactions with slightly different stoichiometry
                    were present in iMO1056 and iJP815, but only one had a gene association while
                    the other was added for gap-filling purposes). The decision of how to treat each
                    gene or reciprocal pair was based on gene annotations, functional information
                    from biological databases, and annotations of homologous genes from other
                    organisms. Any literature associated with the reaction during the original
                    reconstruction process was also re-analyzed, and new literature evidence was
                    sought particularly in cases where sequence-based comparisons yielded incomplete
                    or contradictory results. Furthermore, experimentally confirmed physiological
                    phenomena (e.g., from the validation of the original reconstructions) were taken
                    into account in this process. Once the GPR associations had been reconciled for
                    a given reaction, the required changes to the reconstructions were made. These
                    changes could include adding or removing the reaction from one or both
                    reconstructions, or modifying the reaction GPRs. The main factors contributing
                    to decisions about each of the reactions in the reconstructions were recorded in
                    a set of reconciliation notes, which serve as annotations of the reconciliation
                    process for future investigation. The reconciliation notes are provided in Table

                <title>Streamlining the reconciliation process</title>
                <p>It became apparent in the early implementation of the reconciliation process that
                    certain reactions required different types and layouts of data in order to be
                    reconciled. Therefore, to streamline the reconciliation process, reactions were
                    split into groups, each of which would be reconciled with a slightly different
                    procedure. The reactions were split into main groups as listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001116-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>, and
                    the number of reactions and the general process used for each group are
                    indicated. Initially, the groups of reactions to be reconciled were based on
                    patterns of gene associations (e.g., reactions only in one reconstruction,
                    reactions in both reconstructions but with differing GPRs), but it was quickly
                    determined that the reconciliation could be optimized in cases where multiple
                    similar reactions were associated with the same set of genes. Therefore, in
                    addition to information directly relevant to the reconciliation of a reaction
                    (such as reaction stoichiometry and directionality, gene associations and
                    annotated functions), all other reactions in iMO1056 and iJP815 associated with
                    any of the same genes were also considered along with the reaction being
                    reconciled. This consideration of multiple reactions utilizing the same genes
                    assured that the decisions pertaining to one particular gene remain consistent
                    and enabled us, for example, to identify reactions that might have been present
                    in both reconstructions but with slightly different stoichiometries.</p>

                            <p>During reconciliation, reactions were categorized into groups based
                                on the types of information that would likely be useful in
                                reconciling them between the two reconstructions. The major
                                categories are listed, as well as the number of reactions (# Rxns)
                                reconciled in each category and the general reconciliation strategy
                                used. When interpreting the ‘# Rxns’ field, note that
                                some reactions that do not ‘fit’ in a given category
                                were nevertheless reconciled in that category, since the
                                reconciliation of many reactions involved cross-referencing and
                                reconciling other reactions with similar gene associations. The
                                ‘Pathway’ categories were created for sets of reactions
                                that did not easily conform to the general methods used for
                                reconciliation, but had unique or specific methods that were found
                                to be more appropriate.</p>

                <p>Furthermore, we found that certain pathways would be easier to reconcile if split
                    off into separate groups, regardless of their gene association patterns. This
                    division pertained mainly to linear pathways with few cross-connections to other
                    pathways as well as highly organism-specific processes, such as the pathways for
                    beta-oxidation and lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis. Many of the reactions in
                    the LPS pathway, for example, were reconstructed originally from literature
                    sources rather than from database information, so reconciling this pathway as a
                    group made more sense than breaking the reactions up into groups based on the
                    type of gene associations present.</p>
                <p>The panel on the bottom right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> shows data laid out for a reconciliation
                    of the reaction ‘GMP synthase (glutamine hydrolyzing)’, which was
                    initially included in both reconstructions, but with different numbers of genes
                    associated in each model. In iMO1056, there were initially two genes associated
                    (PA1742 and PA3769). In iJP815, only one gene (PP1032) was associated. In the
                    center of the panel, reciprocal gene matches are shown for all genes associated
                    with GMP synthase in either iMO1056 or iJP815. In this case all the assigned
                    genes possess a reciprocal, yet PP1842, the reciprocal of PA1742, was originally
                    not associated with GMP synthase. To determine if the gene annotations
                    corroborated the reciprocal gene pairings, primary gene functions from the
                    PseudoCAP annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Winsor1">[19]</xref> were listed next to each gene. Then, auxiliary
                    information about the genes was collected. In this case, the EC numbers listed
                    in the PseudoCAP annotation were consistent for PA1742 and PP1842 and were the
                    same as that for GMP synthase, contributing to the evidence that these genes
                    both should be associated with GMP synthase. In some cases, various other
                    databases or literature sources were included in this auxiliary section. In this
                    case, the <italic>P. putida</italic> gene PP1842 was added to the reconciled
                    GENRE, since available evidence indicated that this gene, like its reciprocal in
                        <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, encodes a protein with GMP synthase
                    activity.</p>

                <title>Assessing the impact of reconciliation on the reconstructions</title>
                <p>The reconciliation process resulted in a large convergence between the <italic>P.
                        aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> reconstructions. While
                    the original reconstructions shared 432 reactions, with 451 and 445 reactions
                    unique to iMO1056 and iJP815 respectively, the reconciled final reconstructions
                    (iMO1086 and iJP962 for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P.
                        putida</italic>, respectively) share 925 reactions, with only 103 and 48
                    reactions unique to the each reconstruction (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g002"><bold>Figure 2a</bold></xref>). Although such large
                    changes in the overall statistics suggest that the reconstructions underwent
                    major alterations, a detailed analysis of the types of changes at the reaction
                    level reveals that most of the changes relate to equilibration of similar but
                    non-identical functions, and as a whole do not tremendously alter the biology of
                    the networks. Reactions in the final reconstructions were assigned to classes
                    that best describe their fate during the reconciliation process. These
                    assignments are depicted for both reconstructions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g002"><bold>Figure 2b</bold></xref>. The pie charts, along
                    with the legend (lower left), show the types of changes that all reactions in
                    the final reconstructions went through during reconciliation. These classes can
                    be grouped into four meta-classes, as shown in the inset graph. These classes
                    are: (i) <italic>no change</italic>, describing reactions preserved with
                    unchanged stoichiometry, (but including some reactions that had changes in their
                    GPRs); (ii) <italic>added</italic>, describing reactions added to one of the
                    reconstructions during the reconciliation process, such as in cases where a
                    secondary function of an enzyme had been added to one of the pre-reconciliation
                    models but not to the other, and the reconciliation resulted in the function
                    being included in both; (iii) <italic>removed</italic>, describing reactions
                    removed from the one of the reconstructions during the reconciliation process;
                    and (iv) <italic>minor change</italic>, describing reactions whose general
                    functions were preserved despite modifications to the specific stoichiometries
                    or pathway participation of the reactions involved in the process. This last
                    category includes, for example, reactions in the lipopolysaccharide production
                    pathway, which was preserved in both GENREs but was modified based on a

                        less than 8 cumulative changes are omitted from the plot). This plot reveals
                        which pathways contain the most ambiguous information in available databases
                        for <italic>P. putida</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, as the
                        pathways with the most changes tend to be enriched in reactions that
                        required subjective decisions during the initial reconstruction processes
                        for iMO1056 and iJP815, and therefore would be subject to more alterations
                        during reconciliation than other more well defined pathways. Transport
                        reactions are the most altered on the list, partially because of the large
                        number of transport enzymes present in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and
                            <italic>P. putida</italic>, but also due to the high degree of ambiguity
                        present in current knowledge of these transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-DosSantos1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Stover1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Johnson1">[22]</xref>.
                        Lipopolysaccharide (LPS) synthesis, purine metabolism, and fatty acid
                        metabolism and biosynthesis also contained large numbers of changes,
                        partially due to incorporation of new literature data for less understood
                        pathways (in the case of LPS), as well as ambiguity in the directionalities
                        and functions of certain promiscuous enzymes (in the cases of purine and
                        fatty acid metabolism). This characterization of ambiguity in different
                        pathways was similar to a quantification of ambiguity done in building the
                        human metabolic reconstruction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Duarte1">[23]</xref>, which lends an
                        interesting context to the pathways identified as ‘ambiguous’ in
                        this study. The most striking similarity in ambiguous pathways with the
                        human effort is transport reactions (which are highly ambiguous in both).
                        Transport, it should be noted, is not truly a ‘pathway,’ but
                        rather a functional class of related (but not necessarily connected)
                        reactions, which sets it apart from most of the other reaction groups. Aside
                        from transport, many of the other highly ambiguous processes identified for

                        reconciliation, including purine metabolism and fatty acid metabolism, fall
                        into the high confidence category in the human network. This is likely a

                        pathways, including purine, pyrimidine, and beta-alanine metabolism,
                        revealed unique reactions in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> in the
                        reconciled reconstructions. Further, some pathways (e.g.,
                        glycerophospholipid metabolism, tryptophan metabolism, cysteine and
                        methionine metabolism, and some others) show a number of unique reactions in
                        both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and in <italic>P. putida</italic>,
                        indicating that these pathways utilize different mechanisms in the two
                        organisms. Overall, more unique reactions appear to belong to <italic>P.
                            aeruginosa</italic> than <italic>P. putida</italic>, and these span a
                        wide variety of pathways involved in many different cellular processes. It
                        is important to note that many hypothetical enzymes exist in both of these
                        organisms, but that <italic>P. putida</italic> has been considerably less
                        well studied than <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, which might partially

                            aeruginosa</italic> reconstruction. However, it is likely that most of
                        the uncharacterized enzymes participate in peripheral metabolism, so the

                        initial model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Puchalka1">[14]</xref>. The initial reconstruction (iJP815) correctly
                        predicted the lack of growth in the case of 38 genes, while it failed in 13
                        cases. Eight of the genes for which mutations had been generated were not
                        included in the iJP815 reconstruction, so the overall accuracy of the
                        reconstruction (including these eight mutants in unaccounted-for genes) was
                        64%. The reconciled GENRE included one gene more from the set of
                        mutants (PP2001), and made correct predictions in the case of three more
                        genes. This caused an increase in accuracy to 69%. Complete results
                        are given in Table 3 in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>.</p>
                    <p>Additionally, we assessed the accuracy of iMO1086 in predicting essentiality
                        of metabolic genes in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>, using a list of genes
                        deemed essential in both of two independent genome-scale transposon studies
                        of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> as was done in the initial validation of

                        process only slightly influenced the performance of the reconstruction in
                        the prediction of gene essentiality, as the overall accuracy of the
                        reconciled GENRE decreased by 0.8% from that of the original model
                        (see Table 8 in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>). It is important to
                        note that there are different sets of genes associated with iMO1056 and
                        iMO1086, with 143 genes unique to iMO1086 and 123 genes unique to iMO1056.
                        An examination of the 933 genes common to both iMO1056 and iMO1086 indicates
                        that essentiality predictions among this set improved marginally (2 genes
                        out of 933; see Table 9 in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s001">Text S1</xref></bold>). This indicates that
                        only slight improvements were made to the GPRs insofar as gene essentiality
                        predictions are concerned, although the improvements might turn out to be
                        more profound if more or different data were available for validation.</p>
                    <p>The slight improvement that was seen in the essentiality predictions for the
                        933 genes common to iMO1056 and iMO1086 was the result of an almost exactly
                        balanced deterioration (true positive (TP) → false negative (FN) and
                        true negative (TN) → false positive (FP)) and improvement of calls for
                        approximately 6% of genes (see Table 9 in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s001">Text
                                S1</xref></bold>). The most prevalent conversion (24 genes) was
                        TN→FP, which is in agreement with the overall higher fraction of false
                        positive calls in the reconciled reconstruction. The lack of significant
                        change in accuracy of the predictions of gene essentiality between the pre-
                        and post-reconciliation reconstructions suggests the possibility of an
                        intrinsic limit on accuracy, which would likely differ in different
                        organisms based on the completeness of the genome annotation and other
                        available databases, as well as on the amount of validating experimental
                        data available.</p>
                    <p>We additionally assessed the impact on essentiality predictions of including
                        cysteine and some nucleotides in the <italic>in silico</italic> LB medium,
                        and found that inclusion of these components improved accuracy of
                        predictions, suggesting that these components were likely present in the

                    <p>The lack of significant changes in the results of model validation between
                        pre- and post- reconciliation reconstructions led us to hypothesize that a
                        high proportion of the changes to the models might have occurred in
                        peripheral pathways that are not directly involved in growth. To test this
                        hypothesis, we optimized the reconciled models of <italic>P.
                            aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> for biomass and
                        assessed reaction participation. The minimal sets of reactions essential for
                        any growth, as well as the sets of all reactions that must carry flux to
                        sustain optimal growth, were determined for both organisms under the
                        condition of glucose minimal medium. Reactions that fall into these
                        essential sets represent an unbiased attempt to define ‘central’
                        reactions, as defined by their involvement in biomass production.</p>
                    <p>These results, as well as assignments of these reactions to <italic>no

                        over percentages of reactions in these categories from the entire models.
                        This analysis indicates that changes to the reconstructions through the
                        reconciliation process tended to target non-central processes, yet, as will
                        be described below, these changes do affect processes of direct interest for

                    <p>To assess how the reconciliation affected the yield predictions of the two
                        metabolic GENREs, we performed flux balance analysis (FBA) simulations for

                            aeruginosa</italic>, respectively). This increase is due to an increase

                            putida</italic>, and they represent the last non-committed metabolites
                        in the pathways to produce the virulence factors. We were interested in

                            putida</italic> in how metabolically taxing it is to produce these
                        precursors. One way to measure metabolic capacity is to construct a pareto
                        optimum curve between two possible cellular objectives, which displays the
                        tradeoffs between optimal maximization (or minimization) of the objectives
                        (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Oberhardt3">[34]</xref>). To examine the metabolic demands for producing
                        virulence factor precursors in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> versus
                            <italic>P. putida</italic>, we computed pareto curves for all pairwise

                        biomass exchange reaction (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and

                        done in <italic>in silico</italic> glucose minimal medium. In comparing
                        pareto curves, a larger area within the pareto curve for one organism versus
                        the other indicates that the metabolism of that organism has more freedom in
                        choosing tradeoffs between the two reactions, and is thus an indicator of
                        greater metabolic flexibility. These 19 virulence factor precursors are

                    <p>This pareto analysis surprisingly showed only small differences in

                        demand reactions +1 biomass exchange reaction), the biggest difference
                        in area held within the pareto curve for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
                        versus <italic>P. putida</italic> was −4.2%, a negative
                        percentage indicating that the area held within the iMO1086 pareto curve is
                        smaller than that for iJP962 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials

                        pareto areas for the 210 pairings, with pairings showing greater flexibility

                        are significantly more flexible pairings in <italic>P. putida</italic> than
                        in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>.</p>
                    <p>This result suggests that while the difference in ease of production of

                            putida</italic> is small, <italic>P. putida</italic> might have slightly
                        lower metabolic costs to producing these factors. It is notable that many of
                        the virulence factor precursors are fairly central to metabolism, and can be
                        used for a variety of metabolic ends unrelated to virulence. Therefore, the
                        differences in flexibility might relate to selective pressures having to do
                        with non virulence related processes. Still, it is interesting and
                        surprising that <italic>P. putida</italic> shows more flexibility for this
                        functionality.</p>

                    <p>The results of the pareto analysis of virulence precursors give a glimpse of

                        to apportion resources between multiple competing pathways.</p>
                    <p>To extend this analysis to the genome-scale, we performed a survey of
                        differential flux carrying capacity between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
                        and <italic>P. putida</italic> for all paired combinations of 73 metabolic
                        pathways. To do this, we first constructed pareto optimum curves (as
                        described in the previous section) for 10 randomly chosen pairs of reactions
                        belonging to each pathway pair. All simulations were done on <italic>in

                    <p>Next, we utilized a statistical test to determine whether <italic>P.
                            aeruginosa</italic> or <italic>P. putida</italic> displayed a
                        significant degree more flexibility for reaction pairings within each
                        pathway pair (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>
                        for further details). If different reaction pairs in a given pathway pair
                        showed inconsistent results, the pathway pair was deemed not significant.

                                the reconciled models of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (PAO) and
                                    <italic>P. putida</italic> (PPU). For each pathway pair,
                                boundary curves for feasible flux tradeoffs were plotted for 20
                                random pairs of reactions belonging to the two pathways (or 10 pairs
                                for pathways paired with themselves). The area within these feasible
                                flux bounds was calculated in both models for each reaction pair.
                                Then, a statistical test was used to determine whether
                                    <bold>PAO</bold> or <bold>PPU</bold> had a significantly larger
                                area in the set of reaction pairs representing the given pathway
                                pair. The degree to which <bold>PAO</bold> or <bold>PPU</bold>
                                showed a larger area for a given pathway pair is marked by pixel
                                color, as shown in the legend. Blue pixels denote pathway pairs that

                                larger area in a given organism can be interpreted as a higher
                                metabolic flexibility with regards to tradeoffs between the

                    <p>Several interesting results are evident from this analysis. In particular,
                        certain pathways are shown to be more flexible in one organism versus the
                        other when compared against virtually any other pathway. Eight pathways in
                        particular display much more flexibility in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
                        versus <italic>P. putida</italic>, while only three pathways display
                        significantly more flexibility in <italic>P. putida</italic> than in
                            <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. These pathways are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g008"><bold>Figure 8b</bold></xref>.
                        The majority of these pathway pairings differed in area between <italic>P.
                            putida</italic> and <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> by &gt;50%,
                        with many of them displaying close to 100% more area in one organism
                        versus the other. These results strike an intriguing contrast with the
                        analysis of flexibility in virulence precursors, which displayed at most
                        5% difference between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P.
                            putida</italic>. This result suggests that the metabolic factors that
                        most differentiate <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> from <italic>P.
                            putida</italic> might not be directly related to virulence factors, but
                        are rather related to other central processes.</p>
                    <p>Interestingly, three of the pathways indicated to be significantly more
                        flexible in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> versus <italic>P. putida</italic>
                        are sulfur-related: ‘sulfur metabolism,’ ‘cysteine and
                        methionine metabolism,’ and ‘taurine and hypotaurine
                        metabolism.’ This result suggests a possible importance of
                        sulfur-related pathways in supporting the different lifestyles of <italic>P.
                            aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic>. In addition to the
                        sulfur-related pathways, increased flexibility with regards to nitrogen
                        metabolism and virulence factor demand reactions indicate that <italic>P.
                            aeruginosa</italic> is more flexible in areas that are directly related
                        to the habitat of the CF lung and to known virulence determinants.
                            <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is capable of performing denitrification,
                        which is often important in the microaerobic conditions of the CF lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Chen1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Eschbach1">[36]</xref>.
                            <italic>P. putida</italic>, on the other hand, cannot perform
                        denitrification, nor can it survive anaerobically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-DosSantos1">[12]</xref>. The increased
                        flexibility of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> nitrogen metabolism over that
                        of <italic>P. putida</italic> is therefore consistent with the known
                        importance of denitrification for virulence.</p>
                    <p>Increased flexibility in flux through virulence factor demand reactions
                        represents a direct metabolic advantage of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
                        over <italic>P. putida</italic> in factors essential to virulence as well. A
                        puzzling aspect of this result, however, is the contrast between the
                        increased flexibility of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> versus <italic>P.
                            putida</italic> in virulence factor production reactions (i.e., demand
                        reactions), but the more similar flexibility between the two organisms in
                        production of virulence factor precursors, as shown in the previous section
                        (areas of pareto curves for the precursors differ by less than 5%,
                        while certain pairings of pathways against virulence factor demand reactions
                        have as high as 100% difference, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g008"><bold>Figure 8a</bold></xref>). The three
                        virulence demand reactions common to iMO1086 and iJP962 (and therefore
                        included in this analysis) are demand for acetylated alginate and for the
                        two homoserine lactones (HSLs) that form the basis of quorum sensing in
                            <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> (3-oxododecanoyl-HSL and butyryl-HSL).
                        Tradeoffs between production of precursors for these same virulence factors
                        showed minor and mixed differences in flexibility between <italic>P.
                            aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic>, as shown with the
                        comparison of differential percentages in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref> versus those in

                            7</bold></xref>. This result emphasizes the importance of systems
                        analysis in understanding whole-cell metabolic processes, as the intuitive
                        assumption that demand for virulence factors is merely the sum of demands
                        for individual precursors notably fails in differential analysis of
                            <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic>.</p>
                    <p>Several other processes that display more flexibility in iMO1086 versus
                        iJP962 are more difficult to link to a specific virulence trait, but support
                        the general observation that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> appears to
                        display greater metabolic flexibility than <italic>P. putida</italic> in a
                        variety of pathways. Greater flexibility was seen in iMO1086 versus iJP962
                        in 267 pathway pairings, as opposed to 98 pathway pairings in which iJP962
                        displayed greater flexibility than iMO1086. The most notable exception to
                        the observation of greater flexibility in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
                        than in <italic>P. putida</italic> is the ascorbate and aldarate metabolism
                        pathway, which contributes 50 of the 98 pathway pairings that are
                        significantly more flexible in <italic>P. putida</italic> than in <italic>P.
                            aeruginosa</italic>. It is unclear what biological role a greater
                        flexibility in this pathway would play, particularly as related to virulence
                        phenotypes.</p>
                    <p>It is likely that many more interesting results are embedded within the
                        pathways deemed non-significant through this analysis, as the cause for
                        non-significance in many cases is the grouping of reactions into a single
                        KEGG pathway when these reactions do not necessarily act in a biologically
                        concerted manner. An unbiased modularization of metabolic pathways might
                        therefore reveal more differences between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and
                            <italic>P. putida</italic> metabolism, but for the purpose of clarity we
                        have restricted our analysis to accepted KEGG pathways.</p>

            <p>Comparison of genome-scale metabolic reconstructions (GENREs) and the subsequent
                comparison of the metabolic phenotypes available to different organisms is a novel
                method that promises to yield fresh insights into the functioning of metabolism as a
                whole. Despite the large number of manually curated genome-scale metabolic
                reconstructions built to date (more than 50), a conspicuous gap exists in the
                literature for meaningful comparisons between two or more reconstructions of related
                species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Oberhardt1">[2]</xref>.
                Some comparisons have been done in the past, but they either focus on small subsets
                of metabolism, utilize automatically generated and thus less well-curated
                reconstructions, or highlight summary statistics (e.g., numbers of nodes and edges,
                average path lengths) rather than leveraging the full toolset available for analysis
                of constraint-based models, which includes flux balance analysis, extreme pathway
                analysis, and other related methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Oberhardt1">[2]</xref>. Part of the reason why such
                genome-scale comparison efforts have not been undertaken or have not succeeded yet
                lies, in our opinion, in the lack of standards for both the software solutions used
                for the reconstruction process and the reconstruction process itself. This lack of
                standards causes an inconsistency in the relationships between different metabolic
                GENREs and the data used to reconstruct them, thus obscuring the valuable
                information that could be extracted from the comparison of multiple GENREs.</p>

                <title>A workflow for network reconciliation</title>
                <p>In order to overcome this hurdle and to enable a high-quality constraint-based
                    comparative analysis of two organisms at genome scale, we developed a novel
                    process termed metabolic network reconciliation. Reconciliation assesses
                    reactions present in two genome-scale reconstructions, and determines whether or
                    not changes should be made to the reconstructions in order to uphold the null
                    hypothesis that no difference exists between the reconstructions. Differences
                    between the two reconstructions for a given reaction are only upheld if
                    sufficient (preferably experimental) evidence for the differences is present in
                    literature, genome annotations, or online databases such as KEGG and Expasy. In
                    this way, the reconciliation allows for verification of two reconstructions
                    against each other and leads to removal of non-verifiable differences between
                    the metabolic reconstructions, while still staying within the bounds of
                    available knowledge about the organisms. We performed the reconciliation between
                    manually-curated metabolic GENREs of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and
                        <italic>P. putida</italic>. These bacteria are both important for
                    biotechnological applications, in addition to the notorious role of <italic>P.
                        aeruginosa</italic> as an opportunistic pathogen. The biotechnological
                    usefulness of these organisms is based on their extremely varied and expansive
                    metabolic capabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Puchalka1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-SoberonChavez1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Frimmersdorf1">[37]</xref>,
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Nogales1">[38]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The reconciliation process resulted in a significant alignment of the <italic>P.
                        aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> reconstructions. While in
                    the original reconstructions only around 50% of the reactions were in
                    common, the reconciled GENREs shared around 90% of their reactions.
                    Furthermore, although a significant portion of the reactions in the
                    reconstructions were altered, added, or removed during the reconciliation
                    process, it is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g002"><bold>Figure 2b</bold></xref> that most of these changes reflected
                    either an aligning of reciprocal functions (as represented by the <italic>minor
                        change</italic> meta-class) or an addition of pathways that had initially
                    only been reconstructed in one model despite evidence for inclusion in both (as
                    represented by most of the subcategories in the <italic>added</italic>
                    meta-class). Few of the changes altered the fundamental biology of the networks,
                    but these changes were critical in aligning similar functions in the
                    reconstructions so that they could be meaningfully compared. If a comparison
                    between <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> had been
                    attempted without first reconciling the metabolic reconstructions, any
                    biological variance between the bacteria would likely have been obscured by
                    differences in the reconstructions derived from the respective reconstruction
                    processes rather than from true biological differences between the
                    organisms.</p>
                <p>The similar performance of the pre- versus post- reconciliation reconstructions
                    as compared to validating data suggests that the reconciliation did not alter
                    the overall biology of the reconstructions. However, as all analyses performed
                    in the revalidation process relied on FBA with a growth objective, these
                    validating analyses inevitably focus on the portions of the metabolic networks
                    related to production of biomass and utilization of particular substrates. The
                    fact that the changes in network validation were minor suggests that few
                    functional changes occurred in the central portions of the reconstructions, but
                    more functional changes might have occurred in more peripheral portions of
                    metabolism. This hypothesis is consistent with our analysis of
                    reconciliation-derived changes in the essential portions of the reconciled
                    GENREs, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g006"><bold>Figure
                            6</bold></xref>. Since the comparison of the metabolic networks will
                    likely focus on differences in peripheral functions (where <italic>P.
                        aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> most strongly diverge
                    phenotypically), the network reconciliation might have played a larger role in
                    removing non-verifiable functional differences between <italic>P.
                        aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P. putida</italic> than is suggested by the
                    phenotypic stability of the pre- and post- reconciliation reconstructions with
                    regards to validating data.</p>

                <p>In addition to contributing to our understanding of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic>
                    metabolism, the reconciliation process offers a unique opportunity to critique
                    and examine the metabolic reconstruction process itself. Some of the changes in
                    the metabolic GENRE<bold>s</bold> through the reconciliation process rectify
                    inevitable mistakes in the original reconstructions, yet the reconciled
                    reconstructions for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and <italic>P.
                        putida</italic> were built with essentially the same data as the original
                    reconstructions, with the additional constraint that decisions on inclusion of
                    genes must be consistent between the two networks. Therefore, in many cases, the
                    changes are more reflective of ambiguity as to what evidence should be
                    considered sufficient for genes to be included in a reconstruction, or what
                    exact form the reactions they catalyze should take.</p>
                <p>When a reconstruction is built, the weights given to different data sources and
                    the determination of cutoffs for inclusion of genes in the GENRE inevitably
                    involve a degree of subjectivity, since a large amount of available gene
                    annotation data is too vague to enable definitive determinations of gene
                    function. The lack of changes in the validation outcome indicates that the
                    original and reconciled reconstructions reflect phenotypes of the respective
                    organism equally well. Therefore, there seems to be a degree of ambiguity in the
                    genetic makeup of a reconstruction that is not fully represented in the
                    phenotypes. This ambiguity can be described in the terms of a space of
                    comparably accurate reconstructions of a particular organism, where the pre- and
                    post- reconciliation reconstructions represent points in the space. The size of
                    this ‘reconstruction space’ for a given organism is related to the
                    degree of vagueness in functional assignments of genes, a metric for uncertainty
                    in the current state of knowledge of the organism.</p>
                <p>The plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g003"><bold>Figure
                        3</bold></xref> therefore give an estimate of the pathways contributing most
                    strongly to the breadth of this ‘reconstruction space,’ as pathways
                    changing the most during reconciliation are often also the ones whose functions
                    are the most ambiguous based on the current knowledge in databases/literature.
                    Examination of the portions of the reconstructions that changed most during
                    reconciliation may therefore provide a roadmap for future improvement of these
                    metabolic reconstructions. As more data are amassed about the metabolism of an
                    organism and integrated into a reconstruction, the space of possible
                    reconstructions will shrink and become a more accurate representation of the
                    actual metabolism of the organism. This is the aim of the iterative model
                    building and validating process.</p>
                <p>It would be also interesting to reconcile the <italic>P. putida</italic>
                    reconstruction with the other independently performed GENREs of this organism

                    analysis could allow for further assessment of the noise related to the
                    reconstruction process and would surely contribute to the creation of an even
                    more exact model of the bacterium, as well as further defining the shape of the
                    reconstruction space for this organism.</p>

                <title>Standardization of cutoffs and methods</title>
                <p>An issue that contributes greatly to the difficulty of building and comparing
                    metabolic reconstructions is the lack of standardization of the methods used for
                    the reconstruction process. This difficulty, which is the basis for the work
                    presented here, has also catalyzed several efforts towards developing common
                    standards for metabolic reconstructions. One approach is based on reconstruction
                    ‘jamborees’, in which communities of biologists gather over several
                    days for an intensive session of effort to improve and standardize a given
                    metabolic GENRE. Jamborees have been held thus far for <italic>Saccharomyces
                        cerevisiae</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Herrgard1">[40]</xref>,
                        <italic>Homo Sapiens</italic>, and <italic>Salmonella</italic>, for each of
                    which there are multiple independent reconstructions available (with significant
                    variance in size and metabolic capability), and these meetings have resulted in
                    progress in the standardization and improvement of metabolic reconstructions
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Thiele2">[4]</xref>.
                    Another attempt at standardization is represented by the SEED project (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.theseed.org" xlink:type="simple">www.theseed.org</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Overbeek1">[41]</xref>, in which databases of
                    various metabolic subsystems are maintained by dedicated scientists, thus
                    assuring the coherence between reconstructions of each subsystem in the
                    metabolic GENREs of different organisms. A further effort is that of Microme
                        (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microme.eu" xlink:type="simple">www.microme.eu</ext-link>), a large project that aims to extend the scope
                    of microbial genome annotation from functional assignment at gene level to the
                    systematic generation of pathways assemblies and genome-scale metabolic
                    reconstructions, with an initial focus on bacteria. Even with the efforts from
                    jamborees, SEED, and Microme, ambiguity in the evidence used to build metabolic
                        GENRE<bold>s</bold> is unavoidable. Therefore, some type of reconciliation
                    will likely be necessary prior to any multi-reconstruction comparison.</p>
                <p>Even in an ideal case where the knowledge about an organism is complete, there
                    still remains some ambiguous decisions in the reconstruction process resulting
                    from the core approximations of constraint-based modeling, which confine the
                    fundamentally analog nature of biology to digital categorizations (e.g. a
                    continuum of enzyme thermodynamics is categorized into ‘reversible’
                    and ‘non-reversible,’ a continuum of substrate affinities is
                    converted into ‘yes’ or ‘no’ decisions on which
                    metabolites can be acted on by an enzyme, etc.). With regards to this
                    characteristic, metabolic reconstructions are akin to other types of biological
                    models.</p>

                <title>Multi-species comparisons and automation</title>
                <p>The reconciliation process reveals challenges that might arise if a high quality
                    comparison is to be performed between more than two species. Reconciling more
                    than two models might prove difficult, since the addition of more models beyond
                    two adds more degrees of freedom to the task. The issues faced in these cases
                    will be similar to those faced in standardization efforts such as SEED, in which
                    some organism specificity is forfeited in favor of model standardization. Our
                    reconciliation process can inform these efforts, and the reconciled models can
                    serve as a gold standard against which these automated reconstruction platforms
                    can be compared.</p>
                <p>Although we performed the reconciliation of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> manually, much of the process could be automated
                    for future efforts. The workflow developed for performing model reconciliation
                    (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>
                    and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s002">Text

                        1</xref>), coupled with knowledge of the specific information types that are
                    important for making decisions about each given reaction (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001116-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>) and
                    the specific database structures for performing the reconciliation (see Figures
                    2–4 in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1001116.s002">Text S2</xref></bold>) will help make much of
                    the process automatable in the future.</p>
                <p>The reconciliation we performed was for two species that are closely related.
                    However, the process we developed should be equally applicable to more distant
                    species if a comparison is to be attempted. Model reconciliation enables true
                    differences in two metabolic networks to be identified above the noise. This
                    identification enables a more confident comparison of differences, which is
                    crucial whether or not the species are closely related. In comparing species
                    that are more distantly related, more pathways might fall into the
                    ‘organism specific’ categories, and thus need to be reconciled as
                    contiguous pathways as opposed to as collections of reactions (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1001116-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>). This
                    category will include the pathways that most diverge between the species being
                    compared, where whole blocks of reactions might be different between one
                    organism and the other. However, the reconciliation process will be similar in
                    structure, and the insights gained in this study should serve as a guide for
                    such attempts. Rigorous genome-scale, multiple-species comparisons are crucial
                    for the elucidation of the evolution of cellular networks and of the underlying
                    genotype-phenotype relationships. The availability of pathway assemblies and
                    metabolic models for a large variety of microbial species would pave the way for
                    new types of comparative and phylogenomic studies. Furthermore, process-based
                    comparisons would enable the identification of system-wide properties that
                    cannot be detected by a simple comparison of gene annotations and will allow the
                    connection of genotype with phenotypic properties at a phylogenetic level. These
                    phenotypes might include habitat specificity, ecological niche information, and
                    the structure of metabolic systems properties that might be (re)engineered.</p>

                    of sulfate esters or carbon bonded sulfate derivatives into inorganic
                    sulfate—the form of sulfur used by plants for production of cysteine and

                    metabolism is an important process for both <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> and
                        <italic>P. putida</italic>, based on its important role in this common
                    habitat. However, it has also been shown that a significantly different but also
                    sulfur rich environment can be found in the CF lung, where mucin (the family of
                    glycosylated proteins forming the basis of mucus) forms a major source of
                    nutrition for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>. Several findings in literature
                    support the importance of sulfated mucin in defining the <italic>in
                        vivo</italic> environment in the CF lung, including the enhancement of mucin
                    sulfation in CF patients versus in the normal lung, the presence of multiple
                    highly regulated sulfur uptake mechanisms in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> that
                    respond differently to the presence of inorganic sulfate versus the presence of
                    more complex organosulfur compounds, and most notably, the demonstrated ability
                    of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> CF isolates to utilize mucin as a sole sulfur

                    While the specific reactions that extract sulfur from complex organic sources
                    are not represented in the <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> reconstruction, this
                    set of pathways is possibly of great import for <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic>
                    virulence, and is a possible important area of study for the future.</p>
                <p>Taken as a whole, the results of this study uphold the observation that the
                    virulence of <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> is highly multifactorial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1001116-Lee1">[50]</xref>. Flexibility
                    of certain pathways is larger in <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> than in
                        <italic>P. putida</italic> as shown through the pairwise pathway flexibility
                    study, but this result does not extend to virulence precursors. More puzzling is
                    the observation that <italic>P. aeruginosa</italic> displays higher pathway
                    flexibility in production of certain virulence factors than <italic>P.
                        putida</italic>, even though the flexibility of production of the virulence
                    precursors remains similar between the two (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1001116-g007"><bold>Figure 7b–c</bold></xref> versus the

                    bolsters the ‘multifactorial’ hypothesis, even within a
                    metabolically-focused analysis.</p>
                <p>With the reconciled models presented in this study, we have opened an opportunity
                    to gain a deeper understanding of both the difference in virulence of these
                    organisms, as well as the different metabolic features that they possess with
                    relation to metabolic engineering applications. Reconciled genome-scale models
                    of these two organisms will therefore show many uses beyond the analyses of
                    virulence precursor and pathway flexibility presented here.</p>
