        <p>In adults, the growth of blood vessels, a process known as angiogenesis, is essential for organ growth and repair. In many disorders including cancer, angiogenesis becomes excessive. The cellular origin of new vascular endothelial cells (ECs) during blood vessel growth in angiogenic situations has remained unknown. Here, we provide evidence for adult vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) that reside in the blood vessel wall endothelium. VESCs constitute a small subpopulation within CD117+ (c-kit+) ECs capable of undergoing clonal expansion while other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity. Isolated VESCs can produce tens of millions of endothelial daughter cells in vitro. A single transplanted c-kit-expressing VESC by the phenotype lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ can generate in vivo functional blood vessels that connect to host circulation. VESCs also have long-term self-renewal capacity, a defining functional property of adult stem cells. To provide functional verification on the role of c-kit in VESCs, we show that a genetic deficit in endothelial c-kit expression markedly decreases total colony-forming VESCs. In vivo, c-kit expression deficit resulted in impaired EC proliferation and angiogenesis and retardation of tumor growth. Isolated VESCs could be used in cell-based therapies for cardiovascular repair to restore tissue vascularization after ischemic events. VESCs also provide a novel cellular target to block pathological angiogenesis and cancer growth.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Angiogenesis—the growth of blood vessels—is essential for organ growth and repair, but also occurs during tumorigenesis and in certain inflammatory disorders. All blood vessels are lined by endothelial cells (ECs)—thin, flattened cells that form a continuous monolayer throughout the entire circulatory system. The cellular origin of new vascular ECs during blood vessel growth in angiogenic situations in adults is a matter of debate. New ECs could develop, in principle, from as yet undiscovered stem cells, as is well documented for the differentiated cells of skin or epithelia, or by the duplication of existing differentiated ECs. Here, we provide evidence for the existence of vascular endothelial stem cells (VESCs) that reside in the adult blood vessel wall endothelium. VESCs constitute a small subpopulation of ECs capable of clonal expansion, while other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity. When isolated, these VESCs can produce tens of millions of endothelial daughter cells, and a single transplanted VESC can generate in vivo functional blood vessels that connect to host blood circulation. Isolated VESCs could be used in cell-based therapies for cardiovascular repair to restore tissue vascularization following ischemia and could also be pursued as a novel cellular target of inhibition to block pathological angiogenesis, for example during tumor growth.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The early blood vessels of the embryo and yolk sac in mammals develop by aggregation of de-novo-forming angioblasts into a primitive vascular plexus (vasculogenesis). Blood vessels arise from endothelial precursors, which share an origin with hematopoietic progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Coultas1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Salven1">[3]</xref>. In adults, the growth of blood vessels is essential for organ growth and repair. The best-known pathological conditions in which angiogenesis is switched on are malignant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Hanahan1">[4]</xref>, ocular, and inflammatory disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Carmeliet1">[5]</xref>. Endothelial cells (ECs) are thin, flattened cells that line the inside of blood vessels in a continuous monolayer in all blood vessels through the entire circulatory system. ECs are best identified by their specific location and function, but there are also various cell-surface molecules (such as vWF, CD31, CD34, CD105, vascular endothelial cadherin [VE-cadherin], vascular endothelial growth factor receptor 1 [VEGFR-1], VEGFR-2, Tie-1, Tie-2) that characterize their phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Augustin1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Gale1">[7]</xref>. Recently, Weissman and coworkers by performing genetic fate mapping and clonal analysis of individual cells showed that the endothelial stem/progenitor cells involved in adult angiogenesis must be local, non-hematopoietic, and non-circulating tissue resident cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Rinkevich1">[8]</xref>. However, the definite cellular origin of the new ECs necessary for adult neoangiogenesis has remained unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Rinkevich1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Horrevoets1">[16]</xref>. Creation of new ECs in adult tissues could in principle occur by their so far undiscovered tissue resident stem cells, as is well documented for the differentiated cells of skin or epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Tumbar1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Barker1">[19]</xref>, or by the duplication of existing differentiated ECs, as has been described for pancreatic beta-cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Dor1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In passaged human aortic ECs not all cells in the monolayers proliferate at an equal rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Ingram1">[21]</xref>. Previous work has also indicated that very low numbers of cells with endothelial characteristics and high proliferative potential may be found in umbilical cord blood or in peripheral blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Bompais1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Lin1">[26]</xref>. Together, these earlier findings suggest that all ECs in adult tissues may not have an equal potential to produce progeny. Therefore, we wanted to learn if there exists a rare vascular endothelial stem cell (VESC) population that is capable of producing very high numbers of endothelial daughter cells and is responsible for neovascular growth in adults.</p>

        <title>Adult lin−CD31+CD105+ ECs Encompass Rare Endothelial Colony-Forming Cells</title>
        <p>In preliminary experiments we found that rare endothelial colony-forming cells (CFCs) were routinely detected when ECs were isolated from single cell suspensions prepared by enzymatic digestion of adult mouse tissues, and cultured in vitro in low-cell density adherent semi-solid methylcellulose matrix colony assays supplemented with the endothelial growth factor VEGF. To study the possibility that endothelial CFCs might reside in the vascular wall endothelium, we perfused adult C57BL/6J mice with PBS to wash out the circulating hematopoietic cells, and subsequently isolated CD31+CD105+ ECs from the lung vasculature and tested them in vitro in colony assays. After removal of the remaining contaminating hematopoietic cells by immunomagnetic lineage depletion using a standard combination of antibodies designed to remove mature hematopoietic cells from a sample based on their hematopoietic surface-marker (CD5, CD45R [B220], CD11b, Gr-1 [Ly-6G/C], 7-4, and Ter-119) expression, endothelial CFCs could be recovered from the tissues at higher frequencies. In these isolated lineage depleted (lin−) CD31+CD105+ mouse lung ECs, CFCs were detected at a mean frequency of 0.14% (standard deviation [SD]±0.051; <italic>n</italic> = 10), corresponding to approximately one and a half colony-forming units (CFUs) per thousand isolated ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These EC colonies grow beneath the methylcellulose matrix adhered to the plastic bottom of the culture dish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The formed colonies express phenotypic EC markers CD31, CD105, VE-cadherin, and vWF while the cells are negative for the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Quantification of colony-forming ability of lin−CD31+CD105+ cells isolated from the mouse lungs. Freshly isolated cells from ten mice were assayed in duplicate. An EC colony in the semi-solid matrix is also shown. The colonies grow beneath the methylcellulose matrix adhered to the bottom of the culture dish. Scale bar, 150 µm. (B) Freshly isolated GFP-tagged ECs were seeded on standard 2-D EC cultures one CFU per culture dish together with 20 CFUs of wt ECs and grown until the monolayer was confluent. GFP+ cells form a single circular EC batch within the confluent wt EC monolayer, demonstrating the clonal growth pattern of the ECs responsible for creating the confluent monolayer. DAPI and bright field images show also the wt ECs in the confluent monolayer. Scale bar, 200 µm. (C) Colonies formed from isolated lin−CD31+CD105+ mouse lung ECs in low-cell density adherent semi-solid methylcellulose matrix were stained for various cell-surface markers. The colonies express EC markers CD31, CD105, VE-cadherin, and vWF while the cells are negative for the pan-hematopoietic marker CD45. The nuclei are stained with DAPI (blue) to recognize individual cells. MS-1 murine EC line was used as a control. Rabbit anti-β-gal antibodies and rat anti-mouse CD45 antibodies provide the isotype controls for rabbit and rat antibodies, respectively. Scale bars, 50 µm.</p>

        <p>To further study in vitro the endothelial CFCs, we isolated CD31+CD105+ ECs from transgenic C57BL/6-Tg(ACTB-EGFP)1Osb/J mice where all the tissues, including the ECs, are green fluorescent protein (GFP)+. Subsequently, we seeded a mixture of one CFU of GFP+ CD31+CD105+ ECs and 20 CFUs of wild-type (wt) CD31+CD105+ ECs on a standard 2-D EC culture and let the cells grow until the monolayer was confluent, typically for 12 d. The resulting confluent monolayers of wt ECs contained on average one circular, GFP+ EC batch per culture, demonstrating the clonal growth pattern of the ECs responsible for creating the confluent monolayer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <title>Colony-Forming ECs Produce Tens of Millions of Endothelial Daughter Cells In Vitro</title>
        <p>To assess the proliferative potential of the CFCs in vitro, we picked up individual colonies, resuspended them in EC growth medium, and cultured the cells as monolayers in 2-D EC cultures. Some of the formed monolayers were propagated for over 6 mo, splitting the cultures always when they reached 90% confluence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The cultures were transferred in large 75 cm<sup>2</sup> flasks after an average of ten passages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001407.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). When a total of 148 separate colonies originating from distinct CFCs were picked up and cultured ex vivo as monolayers, a total of five colonies could be expanded and passaged for over ten generations, and three of them were propagated for over 20 passages. During the long-term culture, each of these five colonies originating from a single CFC produced tens of millions of daughter cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The long-term cultured colony cells express EC markers CD105, VEGFR-2, and the stem/progenitor cell marker CD117 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Surface marker expression of EC monolayers originating from single CFCs is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001407.s006">Table S1</xref>, and micrographs of immunostainings against the cell-surface markers at the 24th passage are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001407.s001">Figure S1</xref>. Taken together, the experiments demonstrate that a subpopulation of colony-forming ECs exists that are capable of clonal expansion and can produce tens of millions of endothelial daughter cells when expanded as EC monolayers ex vivo.</p>

We therefore prepared CD117-enriched and CD117-depleted fractions of isolated lin−CD31+CD105+ ECs, and assayed them in vitro for CFCs. The CD117-enriched fraction contained CFCs with an almost 10-fold frequency (0.42%, SD ± 0.054 versus 0.045%, SD±0.037; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) compared to CD117-depleted ECs that contained only few CFCs.</p>

            <p>(A) The relative distributions and overlap of CD105+, Sca-1+, and CD117+ subpopulations within isolated mouse lung lin−CD31+ ECs are shown. The results (mean ± SD) are from six FACS analyses of six mice. (B) Comparison of CFCs within the CD117-depleted and CD117-enriched fractions of lin−CD31+CD105+ ECs in vitro in colony-forming assays. Practically all CFCs are encompassed within the CD117+ EC population (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, the Mann-Whitney test). The horizontal lines indicate 10th, 25th, 50th (median), 75th, and 90th percentiles. The results of four independent experiments, each performed in duplicate, are shown. (C) A total of 960 freshly isolated GFP+ lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ single cells were sorted into individual wells of 96-well plates together with a carrier population of 2,500 wt (GFP−) lin−CD31+CD105+ cells per well. At day 7, most (99.4%) of the generated EC monolayers contained only a few GFP+ ECs (above). On six wells (0.6%), the generated monolayer contained a circular, clonal area of GFP+ ECs within the otherwise GFP− monolayer (below). The result thus again reveals a small subpopulation within CD117+ ECs that are capable of undergoing clonal expansion while the other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity. Scale bar, 200 µm. (D) Freshly isolated murine lung lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ ECs were assayed for a large set of endothelial, hematopoietic, and smooth muscle cell-surface markers using FACS. The results show that isolated lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ are highly immunoreactive for various endothelial markers while no immunoreactivity is detected against specific hematopoietic markers or against smooth muscle α-actin (SMA). The numbers indicate the mean fluorescence intensity (MFI) values (±SD) of the gated populations calculated from three mice over three experiments, and the corresponding <italic>p</italic>-values tested for significance in comparison to the respective IgG control. <italic>p</italic>-Values&lt;0.05 were considered significant (Student's <italic>t</italic> test).</p>

        <p>To estimate the frequency of endothelial CD117+ CFCs in yet another assay, a total of 960 freshly isolated GFP+ lin−CD31+CD105+Sca-1+CD117+ single cells were sorted into individual wells of 96-well plates together with a carrier population of lin−CD31+CD105+ wt (GFP-negative) ECs. The presence of a single GFP+ cell per well was checked under fluorescence microscope after sorting. In 7 d, the wt EC carrier population formed a wt (GFP−) EC monolayer in the wells, and the contribution of the single GFP+ cell to the EC monolayer could be studied. The wt (GFP−) EC monolayers on six of the plated 960 wells (0.6% of all wells) contained a clonal area of more than 20 GFP+ ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The rest of the wells (99.4%) contained only a few GFP+ ECs at most (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This occurrence frequency for CD117+ colony-forming ECs (0.6%) is well in line with the results we obtained using the methylcellulose matrix colony assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>
        <p>Further cell-surface marker analyses were performed to better characterize the isolated CD117+ EC population that encloses the progenitor ECs responsible for the clonal expansion. Isolated lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ cells were found to be highly immunoreactive for various established endothelial-cell markers including VE-cadherin (CD144), vascular cell adhesion molecule 1 (VCAM-1, CD106), VEGFR-2, VEGFR-1, CD104 (integrin beta 4), CD34, and for CD14, a marker that is expressed both by hematopoietic cells and by ECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-VermotDesroches1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Jersmann1">[39]</xref>. No immunoreactivity was detected against hematopoietic lineage markers such as CD45 (leukocyte common antigen), CD11b (macrophage-1 antigen, Mac-1), CXCR4 (chemokine receptor type 4, CD184), F4/80 (a pan macrophage marker), CD115 (macrophage colony-stimulating factor receptor), or against smooth muscle α-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). mRNA expression profile from the isolated ECs was analyzed by using real-time quantitative reverse transcription (RT)-PCR, and corresponded to what is expected from ECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001407.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, the results provide functional evidence that CD117+ ECs are enriched for endothelial CFCs, and that there exists a small subpopulation within CD117+ ECs that are capable of undergoing clonal expansion while other ECs have a very limited proliferative capacity.</p>

(D) The possibility that contaminating hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells are the origin of the EC colonies was studied in control experiments. No colonies were formed by isolated BM lin− cells when studied in endothelial colony-forming assays (six independent experiments performed in duplicate). BM lin− cells were separated by standard immunomagnetic lineage depletion. In standardized hematopoietic colony-forming assays BM lin− cells produced classical hematopoietic colonies, confirming their viability.

        <p>The possibility that hematopoietic lineage cells might constitute the EC CFCs was further studied using lineage depleted or CD45-enriched murine BM hematopoietic cells. In standardized murine hematopoietic CFC assays the BM hematopoietic produced classical hematopoietic colonies thus confirming their viability. In contrast, lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ lung ECs produced only completely dissimilar EC colonies on the same assay system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g004">Figures 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001407.s004">S4</xref>). Importantly, the hematopoietic lin− or CD45+ BM cells could not form any colonies in the endothelial colony assay format even when plated up to 100,000 cells per plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g004">Figure 4D</xref>; for both populations six independent experiments were performed in duplicate). Therefore, we conclude the EC colonies we have studied here do not originate from hematopoietic cells.</p>
        <p>Additionally, we also tested our findings by using two different genetic reporter systems for the gene expression of the receptor tyrosine kinases VEGFR-2 and Tie-2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). These transgenic reporter systems were chosen because VEGFR-2 and Tie-2 are expressed primarily by vascular ECs (although also VEGFR-2+ or Tie-2+ HSCs have been described). lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ cells were isolated from transgenic mice with a lacZ-β-gal reporter under the VEGFR-2 promoter (C57BL/6J-Kdrtm1Jrt; lacZ mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Shalaby1">[40]</xref>) or under the Tie-2 promoter (FVB/N-Tg(TIE2-lacZ)182Sato/J mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Schlaeger1">[41]</xref>). The isolated lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ cells were then studied in colony assays and analyzed for the activity of the lacZ-β-gal reporter system using fluorescence-based detection of β-galactosidase activity. The colonies both from the VEGFR-2 promoter mice and from the Tie-2 promoter mice promptly expressed the β-gal reporter thus confirming the corresponding marker gene promoter activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g004">Figures 4E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001407.s004">S4C</xref>). Taken together, we conclude that all our data collectively indicate that the EC colonies we observed here originate from vessel wall lin−CD31+CD105+Sca1+CD117+ ECs and are not produced by possible contaminating hematopoietic stem or progenitor cells. These data are also in agreement with recent results by Weissman and coworkers, which by genetic fate mapping and clonal analysis of individual cells demonstrate that endothelial stem/progenitor cells involved in adult angiogenesis must be local, non-hematopoietic, and non-circulating tissue resident cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Rinkevich1">[8]</xref>.</p>

        <p>Self-renewal is a defining functional property of adult stem cells, which therefore have the ability to repeatedly respond to tissue injury or other growth stimulus by giving rise to substantial numbers of proliferative progenitors. To determine whether the endothelial CFCs would retain their capacity to generate functional blood vessels, we performed serial transplantations with GFP-tagged ECs. We first inoculated C57BL/6J mice with B16 melanoma tumors mixed with 15 CFUs of GFP-tagged CD31+CD105+ ECs, and performed repeated isolations and serial transplantations of lineage depleted single cell suspensions from the tumors every time after 2 wk of tumor growth. GFP+ blood vessels were observed in secondary, tertiary, and quaternary transplants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These findings provide direct evidence that the GFP-tagged ECs contained VESCs with self-renewal capacity.</p>
        <p>To study in vivo if the CD117+ EC subpopulation is enriched for endothelial stem and progenitor cells capable of creating blood vessels in adults, we transplanted CD117-depleted or CD117-enriched GFP-tagged lin−CD31+CD105+Sca-1+ ECs in matrigel (10,000 or 100,000 ECs per plug) into wt C57BL/6J mice, and analyzed the plugs 14 d later for the presence of GFP+ blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g006">Figure 6</xref>).

When B16 melanomas were later, after the reconstitution of the hematopoietic system from the BM transplant, implanted to mice, no differences in tumor growth were observed between the two groups, regardless of whether the hosts had received a wt (<italic>n</italic> = 14) or a kit deficient BM transplant (<italic>n</italic> = 13; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001407.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

      <p>While infrequent proliferative cells with endothelial characteristics have been observed circulating in the peripheral blood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Bompais1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Lin1">[26]</xref>, genetic fate mapping has suggested that the origin of endothelial stem/progenitor cells involved in adult angiogenesis must be local tissue resident cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Rinkevich1">[8]</xref>. Our present results provide evidence for adult endothelial stem cell hierarchy and the existence of a rare self-renewing CD117+ adult VESC that resides at the blood vessel wall endothelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In all the divergent assay types we utilized to estimate the frequency of CFCs in different adult EC populations, their occurrence was always only a few CFCs per a thousand total ECs. The CD117+ EC fraction is greatly enriched and the CD117− EC fraction is greatly depleted in colony-forming ECs. Similarly, only CD117+ ECs were able to form blood vessels when transplanted in vivo. In Kit<sup>W-sh</sup> mice where CD117 expression is deficient in a tissue specific manner, the number of CD117-expressing ECs and endothelial CFCs were significantly reduced, and EC proliferation and angiogenesis were impaired. This observed defective EC phenotype is not unlike the already reported deficiency in melanocyte and mast cell densities in these c-kit mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Cable1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Tono1">[46]</xref>. Taken together, our present results suggest that the ability to proliferate is not a stochastic property of ECs, and that the proliferative potential of ECs is hierarchically organized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Ingram1">[21]</xref>, with different EC subpopulations discriminated by their clonogenic potential. Our present results identify a population of EC progenitors with a high proliferative and clonogenic potential that is a small subset within CD117+ ECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>

      <p>While a subset of ECs had a high capacity to produce endothelial daughter cells in various experimental settings in vitro and in vitro, we observed no evidence of transdifferentiation of other cell types to ECs. The possibility that endothelial colony-forming activity might originate from hematopoietic cells was particularly carefully studied, but this was not observed in the experiments. The result is in agreement with earlier reports suggesting that adult stem/progenitor cells are lineage restricted, and that adult blood vessel endothelium does not originate from hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Rinkevich1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Desai1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Purhonen1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Timmermans1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Richardson1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Wagers1">[59]</xref>. However, the present results cannot directly exclude the possible existence of other cell populations capable of endothelial growth. Colony formation assays are admittedly artificial and do not always necessarily represent what actually occurs in vivo.</p>
      <p>Additionally, end differentiated mature vascular wall ECs that normally have very limited proliferative capacity might reversibly acquire more stem cell-like characteristics in vivo in angiogenic situations (including human cancer), maybe for example by turning on CD117 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001407-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). Indeed, it has been reported that c-kit expression occurs in a subset of angiosarcomas, probably representing oncofetal expression, i.e., reversion of the tumor cell phenotype to that of fetal ECs that may normally show c-kit expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Miettinen2">[60]</xref>. Thus, angiogenesis might in certain situations be driven also by abundant ECs that can reversibly acquire stem cell-like characteristics and proliferative potential.</p>
      <p>Discovery of additional cell-surface markers should allow more efficient identification and isolation of VESCs than we have currently achieved here. The daughter cells produced by VESCs could compensate for cell loss during normal lifelong cellular turnover, and be responsible for the generation of novel neoangiogenic ECs in angiogenic situations. Together, the present results suggest the possibility of cell-based therapies for cardiovascular repair using isolated, highly enriched VESCs to restore tissue vascularization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-GodierFurnemont1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Potente1">[62]</xref>. VESCs are also a cellular target for future—and also present— therapies that aim to restrain angiogenesis by inhibiting endothelial-cell proliferation. Therefore, stem and progenitor cells for vascular ECs and the molecular machinery governing their activation and functions are novel cellular and molecular targets for therapeutic approaches to inhibit excessive angiogenesis and to block cancer growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Hanahan1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Potente1">[62]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Isolation of Mouse EC Populations</title>
        <p>Mouse lung ECs were isolated from lungs and other indicated tissues dissected from adult wt C57BL/6J mice (Scanbur AB), GFP-tagged transgenic C57BL/6-Tg(ACTB-EGFP)1Osb/J mice, C57BL/6J-Kdrtm1Jrt; lacZ mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Shalaby1">[40]</xref>, FVB/N-Tg(TIE2-lacZ)182Sato/J mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Schlaeger1">[41]</xref>, or C57BL/6J-Kit<sup>W-sh</sup> mice (all from The Jackson Laboratory). Mouse lung ECs were isolated from lungs dissected from adult mice. Mice were anesthetized with Rompun vet (Bayer) and Ketaminol vet (Intervet). The chest was opened through a midline sternotomy. The left ventricle was identified and the ventricular cavity was entered through the apex with a 27-gauge needle. The right ventricle was identified and an incision was made in the free wall to exsanguinate the animal and to allow the excess perfusate to exit the vascular space. The animal was perfused with 20 ml of PBS at approximately 10 ml/min. After being killed, the lungs were collected, fat tissue was removed, and lung tissue was minced manually. The tissue fragments were then digested with DMEM medium containing Dispase II (0.8 U/ml, Roche), collagenase H (1 mg/ml, Roche), Pen/Strep (100 U/100 g/ml), 2% FCS, 2 mM glutamine at 37°C for 1 h after which the suspension was homogenized by pipetting. The homogenate was filtered through a 100-µm nylon mesh filcon (BD Biosciences) and subsequently through a 30-µm nylon mesh falcon (BD Biosciences) and pelleted by centrifugation (300<italic>g</italic> for 6 min). Erythrocytes were lysed in lysis buffer containing 10 mM KHCO3, 155 mM NH4Cl, 0.1 mM EDTA, (pH 7.5) at room temperature for 2 min. The cell pellets were resuspended in DMEM medium containing Pen/Strep (100 U/100 g/ml), 2% FCS, and 2 mM glutamine. For lineage depletion, Mouse Lineage Cell Depletion Kit (Miltenyi Biotec) was used according to manufacturer's instructions. Subsequently, the cells were incubated with anti-mouse CD16/CD32 blocker (BD Pharmingen) according to the manufacturer's instructions to reduce FcγII/III receptor-mediated antibody binding stained for FACS. The antibodies used included APC anti-mouse CD31 (BD Pharmingen) and PE anti-mouse CD105 (eBioscience), V450 Sca-1 (BD Biosciences), and PE-Cy7 CD117 (eBioscience). Cells were analyzed and sorted using BD FACSAria flow cytometer and cell sorting system (BD Biosciences). Compensation adjustments were performed with single color positive controls. Dead cells and cell debris were excluded by gating the population according to the forward and side light scatters. The positive cells were compared the cells positive in stainings with IgG isotype controls (BD Pharmingen). Before each sorting, laser compensations were adjusted automatically with FACSDiva software version 4.1.2 (BD Biosciences). For single cell sorting, automated cell deposition unit (ACDU) in FACSAria was used for single cell sorting of populations onto 96 multi-well plates. The presence of a single GFP+ cell per well was checked under fluorescence microscope after sorting. A carrier population of 2,500 freshly isolated wt (GFP−) lin−CD31+CD105+Sca-1+CD117+ cells per well was plated together with the GFP+ single cells. The carrier population was used because the single cells were not expected to be able to survive completely alone in the well. For some of the preliminary in vitro assays, CD31+CD105+ ECs were isolated using anti-fluorochrome multisort kit (Miltenyi Biotec) according to the instructions of the manufacturer. The Provincial State Office of Southern Finland approved all the animal experiments.</p>

Subsequently, the plates and the colonies were studied under Axiovert 200 inverted epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss) using both bright field and eGFP channels. The plates that contained a single clonal colony per plate after the expansion were utilized in cell transplantations. The colonies were under Olympus CKX31 inverted microscope and were manually collected from the dish bottom (where they grow adherent to the plastic) by scraping and carefully pipetting using a micropipette. The cells were then resuspended in PBS, and mixed with 200 µl of matrigel (Basement Membrane Matrix; BD Pharmingen) supplemented with VEGF (100 ng/ml; Invitrogen) and bFGF (10 ng/ml; Invitrogen), and injected subcutaneously into wt C57BL/6J mice.

Negative controls were performed by omitting the primary of secondary antibodies or by using irrelevant primary antibodies of the same isotype. A subsequent incubation for 30 min with biotinylated anti-rat IgG was followed by a 30-min incubation using ABC reagents of the Vectastain Elite Rat IgG ABC Kit (Vector Laboratories) and a 10-min incubation with Chromogen Immpact DAB (Vector Laboratories). The slides were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin (DAKO) and mounted using VectaMount AQ medium (Vector Laboratories), and studied and photographed with Leica DM LB microscope (Leica Microsystems GmbH) using C Plan 63× objective (NA = 0.75) and Olympus DP50 color camera (Olympus Corporation). Tumor vessel density was determined from the peri- and intratumoral area in four to six fields (×100) of CD31 stainings of the tissue sections in areas with the highest vascularity (hot spots) essentially as described by Folkman and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001407-Weidner1">[64]</xref>, and the results were recorded as the sum of all vessel counts per field. Only structures that morphologically appeared as vascular and stained with the immunomarker were taken into account. The scoring was performed blinded to avoid bias. The final score for each tumor was determined as a mean of the values determined from intra- and/or peritumoral vessel densities. For assessment of the proliferating fraction of tumor ECs in B16 tumors, proliferating (ki-67+) EC (CD31+) hotspots were identified by scanning the sections at low magnification by using 10× (NA = 0.3) plan-Neofluar objective and Axioplan2 epifluorescence microscope (Carl Zeiss). Micrographs were then taken using 40× (NA = 1.3) oil objective in four to 18 fields and Axiovision 4.3 software. Total CD31+ ECs and CD31+/ki–67+ ECs within the micrograph area (0.097 mm<sup>2</sup>) were manually calculated using Image J (NIH Image) via cell counter plug-in. The results were recorded as mean for each tumor. The scoring was performed blinded to avoid bias.</p>

        <p>Paraffin-embedded human tumor tissue samples from patients with histologically diagnosed malignant melanoma (<italic>n</italic> = 4) or malignant breast cancer (<italic>n</italic> = 10) were drawn from the archives of the Department of Pathology, University of Helsinki. Heat-induced epitope retrieval was performed by heating the deparaffinized tissue sections in a buffered citric acid solution (Dako) for 15 min. The sections were incubated for 30 min in 0.3% hydrogen peroxidase in methanol at room temperature and for 30 min in 5% normal horse serum at room RT. CD117 expression was determined using mouse anti-human CD117 Mab (MS-289-P; NeoMarkers) diluted 1∶100 incubated overnight at 4°C at a dilution of 1∶100. A subsequent incubation for 30 min in biotinylated anti-mouse serum was followed by a 30-min incubation using reagents of the Vectastain Elite ABC kit (Vector Laboratories). Peroxidase activity was developed using DAB (Vector) for 10 min. Finally, the sections were stained with hematoxylin for 30 sec and mounted with VectaMount AQ (Vector). Negative controls were performed by omitting the primary antibody or by using irrelevant primary antibodies.</p>

To normalize the data the Ct value of the housekeeping gene GAPDH was subtracted from the value of the gene of interest. The 2∧(−delta Ct) was used to calculate the normalized relative quantity in order to compare the relative quantification of the gene of interest. Four independent experiments with one mouse per group were performed. mRNA expression profile from the isolated ECs corresponds to what is expected from ECs.
