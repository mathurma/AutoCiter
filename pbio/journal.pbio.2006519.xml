<abstract>
<p>Copper (Cu) has emerged as an important modifier of body lipid metabolism. However, how Cu contributes to the physiology of fat cells remains largely unknown. We found that adipocytes require Cu to establish a balance between main metabolic fuels. Differentiating adipocytes increase their Cu uptake along with the ATP7A-dependent transport of Cu into the secretory pathway to activate a highly up-regulated amino-oxidase copper-containing 3 (AOC3)/semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO); in vivo, the activity of SSAO depends on the organism’s Cu status. Activated SSAO oppositely regulates uptake of glucose and long-chain fatty acids and remodels the cellular proteome to coordinate changes in fuel availability and related downstream processes, such as glycolysis, de novo lipogenesis, and sphingomyelin/ceramide synthesis. The loss of SSAO-dependent regulation due to Cu deficiency, limited Cu transport to the secretory pathway, or SSAO inactivation shifts metabolism towards lipid-dependent pathways and results in adipocyte hypertrophy and fat accumulation. The results establish a role for Cu homeostasis in adipocyte metabolism and identify SSAO as a regulator of energy utilization processes in adipocytes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cu is required for numerous cellular functions, and the loss of Cu homeostasis is incompatible with life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref002">2</xref>]. Cu-dependent enzymes critically contribute to mitochondria respiration, cellular defense against oxygen radicals, angiogenesis, wound healing, biosynthesis of neuromodulators, and many other processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref003">3</xref>]. Increasing evidence points to a tight functional link between Cu homeostasis and lipid metabolism. Cu accumulation in the liver alters the tissue levels of triglyceride and cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref005">5</xref>], and, reciprocally, excess fat decreases the hepatic Cu content [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref007">7</xref>]. Human patients with nonalcoholic fatty-liver disease (NAFLD) and dyslipidemia show Cu deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref009">9</xref>], whereas rats fed with a Cu-deficient diet develop insulin resistance and steatosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref010">10</xref>]. Recent studies also suggest that Cu modulates processing of chylomicrons in the intestine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref011">11</xref>] and have a signaling role in regulation of lipolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite this evidence, the role of Cu in adipocyte biology remains largely unknown. Like most cells, adipocytes need Cu for mitochondrial respiration and protection against oxygen radicals. Additionally, adipocyte-specific requirements for Cu are indicated by the presence at the adipocyte plasma membrane of an abundant Cu-dependent enzyme semicarbazide-sensitive amine oxidase (SSAO, also known as amino-oxidase copper-containing 3 [AOC3]/vascular adhesion protein 1 [VAP-1]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref014">14</xref>]. SSAO expression is highest in white fat tissue, and the levels of SSAO mRNA increase significantly during adipocyte maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref014">14</xref>]. The high expression of SSAO specifically in adipocytes may contribute to characteristic functions of these cells. However, neither the adipocyte-specific function(s) of SSAO nor the role of Cu homeostasis in regulation of SSAO-dependent processes is evident from the currently available data.</p>
<p>Inactivation of SSAO in mice alters leukocyte infiltration of adipose tissue and is associated with mild obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref016">16</xref>]. Studies in mice also found that administration of SSAO substrate benzylamine improves glucose tolerance and reduces body weight gain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref017">17</xref>]. Importantly, adipose SSAO is primarily responsible for these effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref018">18</xref>], but the associated mechanisms remain unclear. Furthermore, none of the studies so far has taken into consideration the fact that significant changes in SSAO levels require adjustments in the availability of Cu, which is essential for structural maturation and enzymatic activity of SSAO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref019">19</xref>]. We hypothesized that Cu handling in adipocyte is set to accommodate a SSAO function, which contributes to important adipocyte-specific processes. In testing this hypothesis, we discovered that SSAO controls the network of pathways involved in selection and utilization of metabolic fuels in adipocytes. We also found that this activity of SSAO depends on a cellular/body Cu status and is especially important during adipocyte differentiation into mature fat cells. These results pave the way to further mechanistic studies on the role of Cu and SSAO in normal adipocyte physiology and in metabolic diseases.</p>

<title>Cu metabolism is up-regulated during adipocytes differentiation</title>
<p>To understand the role of Cu homeostasis in fat-storing cells, we used 3T3-L1 adipocytes. We first examined whether cellular Cu homeostasis changes when 3T3-L1 preadipocytes differentiate into mature adipocytes. Radioactive Cu uptake was 2-fold higher in differentiated adipocytes compared to preadipocytes (146.1 ± 11.8 pmol/mg protein/h versus 63.78 ± 14.6 pmol/mg protein/h; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). To understand how this extra Cu is used, we measured the mRNA levels for main Cu-binding proteins before and after adipocyte differentiation; peroxisome proliferator–activated receptor gamma (PPARγ) was used as a differentiation marker and a control. The mRNA levels for the copper uptake transporters 1 and 2 (CTR1 and CTR2) were increased upon differentiation, consistent with a higher Cu uptake. The mRNA for superoxide dismutase 1 (SOD1; the main Cu-binding enzyme in the cytosol) was increased 3-fold in response to differentiation, whereas the transcripts of the cytosolic copper chaperone for superoxide dismutase (CCS) and antioxidant 1 copper chaperone (Atox1) were not significantly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The abundance of mRNAs for plasma membrane Cu-dependent enzymes, superoxide dismutase 3 (SOD3) and SSAO, also increased upon differentiation. The almost 70-fold up-regulation of SSAO mRNA was particularly striking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The SSAO activity was markedly elevated upon adipocyte differentiation in agreement with the strong up-regulation of mRNA levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Thus, adipocyte differentiation is associated with an increased utilization of Cu, especially by SSAO.</p>

<p>SSAO requires Cu for the formation of its characteristic topaquinone cofactor as well as catalytic activity per se (i.e., for the oxidation of primary amines). The Cu-dependent functional maturation of SSAO takes place within the secretory pathway and requires delivery of Cu from the cytosol. In all mammalian cells, this transfer of Cu into the secretory pathway is mediated by the Cu-transporting ATPases ATP7A and/or ATP7B; which of these 2 ATPases operates in adipocytes is not known. The marked increase in SSAO expression/activity upon adipocyte differentiation suggested that one or both Cu-transporting ATPases could be up-regulated in differentiated adipocytes. We found that the ATP7A mRNA levels increased 2.4-fold during adipogenesis, whereas ATP7B mRNA decreased approximately 10-fold, and the protein was not detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006519.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Therefore, ATP7A is the primary Cu transporter working in mature adipocytes and is significantly up-regulated upon adipocyte differentiation.</p>

<title>Cu deficiency is associated with adipocyte hypertrophy</title>
<p>To determine whether Cu is necessary for adipocyte differentiation and/or function, we used Cu chelators to limit Cu availability during adipogenesis. A membrane-impermeable chelator bathocuproine disulfonate (BCS), which limits Cu entry into cells, was used throughout the differentiation procedure. At the end of differentiation (day 9), the BCS-treated adipocytes were visibly larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). We measured all adipocytes within a 1-mm<sup>2</sup> area and found that the median size of Cu-deficient cells was significantly higher compared to the size of control cells that were differentiated in a regular medium. The analysis of size distribution showed a large increase in a number of cells in the upper quartile of values (3,004.3 μm<sup>2</sup> versus 1,609.1 μm<sup>2</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). We considered that adipocyte hypertrophy is usually associated with an elevated triglyceride content and compared triglyceride levels for control and BCS-treated (Cu-depleted) cells. In BCS-treated adipocytes, the triglyceride levels were significantly higher compared to cells differentiated without BCS addition; increase in triglycerides correlated with an increase in BCS concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Therefore, Cu limitation is associated with adipocyte hypertrophy and lipid accumulation.</p>

<title>Decrease in Cu transfer to the secretory pathway induces adipocyte hypertrophy</title>
<p>Cellular Cu is utilized primarily in the mitochondria, cytosol, and the secretory pathway. The 70-fold increase in SSAO levels during adipogenesis was much higher than the 3-fold increase in the cytosolic SOD1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and could exceed the increase in the abundance of mitochondria proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, SSAO is a very important “Cu user” in differentiated adipocytes. We hypothesized that the BCS-induced adipocyte hypertrophy and triglyceride accumulation reflect insufficient Cu availability to this enzyme within the secretory pathway. To test this hypothesis, we down-regulated the Cu-transporter ATP7A using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9)-mediated genome editing. Two single guide RNAs (sgRNAs) were designed to target the exon 8 and exon 9 of ATP7A gene, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Transfection of cells with these sgRNAs and subsequent selection yielded the 3T3-L1-ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> cell line. In these cells, one <italic>Atp7a</italic> allele had a 1,536-bp deletion generated by a simultaneous cutting directed by both sgRNAs; the second allele was not affected. Deletion within one allele of <italic>Atp7a</italic> gene is associated with a lower ATP7A protein levels compared to the wild-type (WT) 3T3-L1-cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).</p>

<p>To evaluate the functional consequences of ATP7A down-regulation, we characterized the intracellular distribution of Cu, adipocyte size, and triglyceride levels in control and ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> cells. In ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> preadipocytes, the total Cu content was similar to control 3T3-L1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), but the intracellular distribution of Cu was changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). The X-ray fluorescence microscopy (XFM) revealed the puncta-like Cu accumulations in the perinuclear region of ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), presumably due to a diminished transfer of Cu into the secretory pathway. The ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> preadipocytes were able to differentiate, but the median size of differentiated ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> adipocytes was 80% larger than the size of control adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2F</xref>)—i.e., 2,856.1 μm<sup>2</sup> versus 1,608.1 μm<sup>2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Furthermore, the triglyceride levels were elevated in ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> adipocytes compared to WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). The similarity between the phenotype of ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> cells and the effects of the BCS-induced Cu deficiency suggested that in both conditions, adipocyte hypertrophy was caused primarily by insufficient Cu levels within the secretory pathway.</p>

<title>Systemic Cu deficiency inhibits SSAO activity</title>
<p>In vitro, the dependence of SSAO activity on Cu cofactor has been firmly established. However, how changes in Cu levels in cells influence SSAO expression and activity is not known. We found that the chelation of intracellular Cu by a membrane-permeable tetrathiomolybdate (TTM) decreases the activity of SSAO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) without affecting SSAO or ATP7A expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006519.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To determine the impact of Cu homeostasis on SSAO under more physiological conditions, we characterized the effect of dietary Cu deficiency on the activity of SSAO in white adipose tissue. Male rats were fed a low-Cu diet for 3 mo. The Cu levels in the serum and the livers of the Cu-deficient rats were significantly reduced compared to control, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref021">21</xref>], indicative of systemic Cu deficiency. SSAO activity in the epididymal fat of Cu-deficient rats was significantly lower than in control rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Therefore, changes in the organismal Cu status have a direct effect on SSAO function.</p>

<title>SSAO activity depends on ATP7A-mediated transport of Cu into the secretory pathway</title>
<p>To verify that SSAO acquires its Cu within the secretory pathway from ATP7A, we compared the SSAO activity in differentiated 3T3-L1 cells (control) and ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> adipocytes. The SSAO-mediated oxidation of benzylamine was significantly lower in ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> adipocytes compared to control adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), even though the expression levels of SSAO were similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006519.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We also examined the intracellular localization of ATP7A and SSAO. ATP7A was targeted primarily to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN), as indicated by colocalization of ATP7A with the TGN marker syntaxin 6 (Syn6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). SSAO was found at the plasma membrane and also intracellularly, where it colocalized with ATP7A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). In ATP7A<sup>+/−</sup> adipocytes, the localization pattern of SSAO was similar to control cells, and the targeting of SSAO to the plasma membrane was not disrupted (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006519.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).

To further verify the role of SSAO in adipocyte expansion and lipid elevation, we tested whether the phenotype of SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells could be reversed using a recombinant soluble SSAO (sSSAO) (Pepro Tech, 150–16). Addition of 0.6 μg/ml sSSAO to the cell growth medium during differentiation inhibited enlargement of SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>).

The WT cells were not affected by extra sSSAO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006519.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results illustrate that the sSSAO limits adipocyte hypertrophy.

<title>Comparative proteomics reveals a regulatory role for SSAO in energy homeostasis</title>
<p>To identify the mechanism driving the SSAO effects on adipocytes, we utilized the isobaric labeling with the tandem mass tags (TMTs) mass spectrometry to assess proteomic changes in the presence and absence of SSAO. We characterized the proteomes of SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells (knockout [KO]), WT cells, and SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells treated with the sSSAO at 3 different time points during adipocyte differentiation. The expression of SSAO is up-regulated after day 4 during in vitro adipogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref022">22</xref>]. Therefore, we analyzed cell proteomes prior to adipocyte differentiation (day 0), at day 6 (after SSAO expression is induced), and at day 9, when adipocytes are fully differentiated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g005">Fig 5A</xref>).

<title>Glucose uptake and de novo fatty acid synthesis are inhibited in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells</title>
<p>In SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> adipocytes, every enzyme involved in glycolysis (from the synthesis of glucose-6-phosphate to the production of pyruvate) was less abundant compared to WT cells but was up-regulated upon SSAO treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). It was previously shown that treating cells with the SSAO substrate induces glucose uptake [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref023">23</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that the adipocytes lacking SSAO down-regulate glycolysis because they have a reduced glucose uptake. To test this hypothesis, we compared glucose uptake for the WT and SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells. After 2-h fasting in a serum-free low-glucose Dulbecco’s Modified Eagle Medium (DMEM), the basal glucose uptake and uptake in response to stimulation with insulin were evaluated. The basal glucose uptake was only slightly decreased in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> adipocytes compared to WT adipocytes. The insulin-dependent glucose uptake, measured under maximum insulin stimulation (i.e., with 100 nm insulin), was significantly lower in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Interestingly, without fasting, in the regular cell growth medium (DMEM with 10% fetal bovine serum [FBS]), the uptake of glucose by SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells was also decreased by almost 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). These results suggested that during differentiation, SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells were importing less glucose than the WT cells independently whether insulin was present in the growth medium or not.</p>

<p>In adipocytes, glucose uptake and glycolysis are important primarily for fat storage. Most of the acetyl-CoA, which is converted to fatty acids, is derived from glucose through glycolysis. Therefore, diminished glucose uptake/glycolysis would provide less metabolic fuel for lipid synthesis. To test this prediction, we analyzed the glucose-to-lipid conversion using <sup>14</sup>C-labeled glucose. Under basal growth conditions, the SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> adipocytes incorporated significantly less glucose-derived <sup>14</sup>C label into lipids compared to the WT adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). We also evaluated the de novo fatty acid synthesis using the <sup>3</sup>H-labeled acetate and found a significantly lower rate of fatty acid synthesis in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells compared to WT adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6D</xref>). The protein levels of fatty acid synthase, the key enzyme involved in de novo fatty acid synthesis, were 1.9-fold lower in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells (proteomics data, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006519.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Altogether, both glucose uptake and utilization are down-regulated in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> adipocytes; these changes are associated with adjustments in the levels of proteins involved in the corresponding pathways.</p>

<title>SSAO regulates fatty acid uptake and storage</title>
<p>Several proteins associated with the stearate biosynthesis, sphingomyelin metabolism, and long-chain fatty acid processing were up-regulated in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells (see example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). To test whether these changes affect cellular lipid balance, we measured levels of sphingomyelins and ceramides using TripleToF 5600 mass spectrometry. Changes were observed for several lipids, suggesting increased metabolic activity; for example, the levels of sphingomyelin and dihydrosphingomyelins were higher in the differentiated SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). Given the decreased de novo fatty acid synthesis but increased metabolic activity in the sphingolipid/ceramide pathways, we hypothesized that the fatty acid uptake in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> could be up-regulated to accommodate this metabolic activity. To test this hypothesis, we first measured fatty acid accumulation by treating cells with oleic acid (OA) for 6 days during differentiation (from day 3 to day 9). The SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells accumulated significantly more triglycerides (45% over the basal level) than WT cells (20% over the basal level) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). We then directly compared uptake of the fluorescently labeled fatty acid BODIPY-C12 by WT and SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells. The fatty acid uptake over a 1-h time interval was higher in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells compared to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). The initial rate of fatty acid uptake (first 10 min) was also higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006519.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). Lastly, we examined whether these functional changes are associated with changes in the cell proteome. Proteins involved in fatty acid uptake and intracellular compartmentalization—such as fatty acid translocase (CD36), long-chain fatty acid transport protein (FATP), long and very long fatty acid transporter ATP-binding cassette subfamily D member 1 (ABCD1), gamma-butyrobetaine dioxygenase (BBOX1), acyl-coenzyme A synthase (ACSL), and caveolin-1—were elevated in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells at day 6 and day 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006519.s007">S2 Table</xref>). Thus, fatty acid uptake, transfer to cell compartments, and metabolism are enhanced in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cells.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study establishes Cu homeostasis as an important component of adipocyte metabolism. Specifically, we show that Cu transfer to the secretory pathway and activation of SSAO is a prerequisite for establishing a balanced energy utilization in differentiating adipocytes. The relationship between Cu levels and lipid metabolism (especially Cu deficiency) has been repeatedly observed in humans, laboratory animals, poultry, finishing pigs, and cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref026">26</xref>], but the molecular mechanisms remained unclear. Our study demonstrates that Cu deficiency, in vitro and in vivo, directly translates to inhibition of SSAO activity, which triggers specific metabolic changes culminating in adipocyte hypertrophy and increased fat deposition. Significantly, SSAO inhibition is associated with long-lasting changes in specific pathways (glycolysis, de novo lipogenesis, and fatty acid transport/utilization) that cannot be easily reversed post differentiation. It remains to be determined whether the Cu-dependent SSAO activity causes epigenetic changes or modulates cell proteostasis. Nevertheless, it is clear that dramatic up-regulation of SSAO during adipocyte differentiation serves a very important purpose.</p>
<p>SSAO is a highly abundant membrane protein, which contributes up to 2.3% of the total plasma membrane proteins in differentiated adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref027">27</xref>]. This high abundance along with the increased levels of soluble SSAO in obesity attracted early attention; and SSAO has been extensively characterized biochemically and in animals. Our identification of the SSAO-dependent pathways in adipocytes adds mechanistic underpinnings to several previous observations. The insulin-like effect of SSAO substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref029">29</xref>] is in good agreement with our finding that SSAO activity stimulates glucose uptake/glycolysis by changing abundance of proteins involved in these processes. Similarly, the reported enlargement of white adipose tissue in SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref030">30</xref>] is consistent with our finding that SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> adipocytes are bigger and have increased fat content, especially following OA treatment. Up-regulation of fatty acid uptake, increased abundance of lipid trafficking proteins, and changes in signaling lipids, observed in our study, are likely to be responsible for the fat accumulation phenotype.</p>
<p>We have also found that the soluble SSAO is sufficient to reverse cell hypertrophy. This result suggests that the SSAO catalytic domain (activity) rather than the mere presence of the membrane protein is important for cell size. The SSAO-dependent change in the abundance of intermediate filament protein vimentin is likely a result of inhibited insulin signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref031">31</xref>] and, together with elevated collagen proteins—such as type I, III, IV, V, and VI collagens—may contribute to changes in the SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> cell size. Other potentially relevant SSAO-dependent changes include an altered abundance of anoctamin 10 (Ano10; a chloride channel that controls cell volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref032">32</xref>]) and thrombospondin 1 (THBS1; an adhesive glycoprotein that mediates cell-to-cell and cell-to-matrix interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref033">33</xref>]).</p>
<p>Adipose tissue buffers circulating free fatty acids through a fine-tuned cycle of uptake, esterification, and release. In the postprandial period, adipose tissue adsorbs fatty acids liberated by lipoprotein lipase from carriers of dietary fat, such as chylomicrons and very low-density lipoprotein (VLDL). Uptake of free fatty acid has also been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref034">34</xref>], although it is barely detectable in the fasting/postabsorptive state. SSAO-dependent changes in the abundance of proteins involved in the transport and processing of long-chain fatty acids suggest a potential role for SSAO in regulation of this free fatty acid uptake.</p>
<p>Our study does not provide an obvious answer to how SSAO regulates leukocyte recruitment and inflammatory response (a well-established function of SSAO), because the abundance of proteins directly involved in leukocytes extravasation is not affected by SSAO inactivation. However, inactivation of SSAO causes marked down-regulation of semaphorin 3G (a signaling molecule with a cell-repulsive function) and up-regulation of CD74 (a receptor for macrophage migration inhibitory factor, which promotes immune cell recruitment to the sites of inflammation) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref036">36</xref>]. These changes could be relevant to SSAO function in leukocyte recruitment. The SSAO-dependent changes in the oligosaccharyltransferase complex (OSTC; which catalyzes the transfer of high-mannose sugars) may significantly alter properties of cell surface receptors involved in cell–cell recognition/binding. Together, our data suggest that SSAO may act as a molecular link between the metabolic state of adipocytes and their signaling activity and thus be a key player in the obesity-induced inflammation.</p>
<p>Finally, the previously unrecognized function of mammalian SSAO in energy metabolism could be an evolutionally conserved function of this enzyme. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, a Cu-dependent amine oxidase (ECAO) encoded by the tynA gene is a structural homologue of the mammalian SSAO and has similar enzymatic activity. A recent study revealed the role for ECAO in cell energy metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref037">37</xref>]. Deletion of tynA/ECAO causes significant metabolic changes, especially in the pathways involved in the conversion of phenylethylamine to acetyl-CoA and oxidation of propionate to pyruvate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref037">37</xref>]. High conservation of the Cu transport machinery (the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> Cu transporter CopA is homologous to the mammalian ATP7A) further highlights an early evolutional coupling between Cu homeostasis and the processing of metabolic fuels.</p>
<p>In summary, we have established the role for Cu homeostasis in adipocyte morphology and function and identified SSAO as a regulator of adipocyte mass and metabolism. We show that adipocytes require proper Cu balance and compartmentalization to maintain their size and energy balance. In differentiated adipocytes, Cu transfer into the secretory pathway is regulated by the Cu transporter ATP7A; ATP7A supplies Cu to SSAO, which is highly up-regulated in differentiated adipocytes. Our data suggest a novel mechanistic role of SSAO in selection of metabolic fuels and fat storage. Understanding the role of Cu and SSAO in obesity will help to develop new tools and treatment strategies to reduce obesity and its complications, such as diabetes and fatty liver.</p>

<p>The 3T3-L1 cells were cultured in high-glucose DMEM (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS (Sigma Aldrich) and 1% Penstrep (Gibco) (basal medium). Differentiation protocol for 3T3-L1 cells included growing cells with the basal medium for 2 d after cells reached confluence (d-2); then, cell differentiation was induced by changing the medium to the basal medium with 0.5 mM 3-Isobutyl-1-methylxanthine (IBMX), 1 μM dexamethasone, 10 μg/ml insulin, and 2 μM rosiglitazone (differentiation medium I [DMI]) for 3 d (d0–d3), followed by the basal medium with 10 μg/ml insulin (differentiation medium II [DMII]) for 2 d (d3–d5).

Cells were incubated for 30 min at 37°C, and Cu uptake was terminated by addition of ice-cold stop buffer (150 mM NaCl, 5 mM KCl, 2.5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 25 mM HEPES, pH 7.4, and 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA), after which cells were washed 3 times with the ice-cold stop buffer. Cells were lysed with 1 ml of 1N NaOH, and 700 μl of lysates was taken for scintillation counting (Beckman-Coulter LS6500) with Eco-Lume scintillation liquid (ICN Biomedicals #882470). The remaining portion of cell lysates was left until radioactivity decayed, for the determination of total protein concentration in each sample, Bio-Rad Protein Assay (BioRad #500–0006). The <sup>64</sup>Cu transport measurements were carried out in triplicates.

Radioactive 2-deoxy-D-[2,6-3H]-glucose (MT1611) (1 <bold>μ</bold>Ci/well) was added, and cells were incubated for 10 min. Uptake was stopped by aspirating the medium, and cells were washed 3 times with the ice-cold PBS buffer. The cells were then lysed with the RiPA buffer, and aliquots were taken for protein content analysis using BCA assay (Pierce). Radioactivity of cell lysates was counted in Ecoscint scintillation mixture (National Diagnostics) using a Beckman LS-6000 liquid scintillation counter, and counts were normalized to protein content. The basal glucose uptake in the standard growth medium was evaluated using the same protocol, except cells were inculcated with 1 <bold>μ</bold>Ci/ml of 2-deoxy-D-[2,6-3H]-glucose for 10 min and 20 min without prior starvation.</p>

To enable cell growth, the SiN membranes were sterilized with UV radiation and incubated with 10 μL sterile 0.01% POLY-L-Lysine solution (Sigma-Aldrich, St Louis, MO, USA) at 37°C. After 30 min, POLY-L-Lysine was removed, and 10 μl of basal media with suspended cells was added to the membrane. Cells were allowed to adhere to the membrane O/N at 37°C, and then basal medium was added to cover the bottom of plate. After 1-d recovery, the membranes were rinsed with PBS, fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde for 30 min at 37°C, rinsed with PBS, and then rinsed with 100 mM isotonic ammonium acetate and water and were air-dried. XFM images were collected on beamline 2-ID-E at the Advanced Photon Source, Argonne National Laboratory, Argonne, IL, USA. SiN membranes were mounted onto kinematic sample holders, and target cells were selected using a light microscope (Leica, Buffolo Grove, IL, USA) equipped with a high precision, motorized x, y-stage (Ludl Electronic Products, Hawthorne, NY, USA). Coordinates of target cells were recorded before mounting the sample on the microprobe stage at the beamline. The microscope coordinates were translated into microprobe coordinates and the cell raster scanned in the x-y plane. The incident X-ray energy was tuned to 10 keV using a Si-monochromator, and the monochromatic beam was focused to 750 × 750 nm using a Fresnel zone plate. The sample was placed at 19° to the incident X-ray beam, and the resulting X-ray fluorescence was collected at 90° using an energy-dispersive 4-element detector (Vortex ME-4, SII Nanotechnology, Northridge, CA, USA). Elemental maps were created by extracting, background subtracting, and fitting the fluorescence counts for each element at each point using the program MAPS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref044">44</xref>].

<p>Tissue and 3T3-L1 cells were washed with PBS and then homogenized using RiPA buffer (with an EDTA-free protease inhibitor cocktail) on ice for 1 h, and nonsolubilized material was removed by centrifugation at 3,000 g for 15 min. Tissue homogenates were prepared on ice by homogenizing pieces of frozen rat fat tissue in 1 ml of homogenizing buffer (50 mM HEPEs, 1/1,000 Igepal, 150 mM NaCl, 0.25 M sucrose, 0.5 μM AEBSF, and 1:100 protease inhibitor solution). The samples received 30 strokes with each loose and tight-fitting piston in a Dounce homogenizer and were then centrifuged at 700 g for 15 min to remove the debris. The supernatant was collected (whole-cell lysate), and protein concentration in the lysate was determined by BCA assay.</p>
<p>SSAO activity was determined at 37°C by measuring production of hydrogen peroxide using Amplex Red Monoamine Oxidase Assay kit following the manufacturer’s (Molecular Probes, the Netherlands) protocol. Briefly, 25 μg cell lysates or 10 μg tissue homogenates were preincubated for 30 min at 37°C with 100 μM pargyline hydrochloride to inhibit monooxygenase B (MAO-B) activity. The SSAO reaction was then started by the addition of 100 μl reaction buffer (400 μM Amplex Red, 2 U/mL horseradish peroxidase, 2 mM benzylamine, 50 mM sodium phosphate, pH 7.4), and a change in fluorescence (excitation: 530 nm, emission: 590 nm) was monitored every 2 min for 60 min at 37°C in a microplate reader. To determine the background, the identical samples were incubated in parallel with the 1 mM of SSAO inhibitor semicarbazide. Resorufin was used to generate a standard curve for activity calibration.

<title>Mass spectrometry, peptide identification, and quantification</title>
<p>The cell lysates were prepared from the day 0, day 6, and day 9 WT and SSAO<sup>−/−</sup> 3T3-L1 cells. The samples containing 80 μg protein (pellet after TCA/acetone precipitation) were dissolved in 80 μL 100 mM triethyl ammonium bicarbonate (TEAB). Proteins were reduced by adding 2 μl of 50 mM TCEP at 60°C for 1 h and, after cooling to room temperature, alkylated using 1 μl 200 mM iodoacetamide for 15 min at room temperature. Reduced and alkylated proteins were digested overnight at 37°C by adding 100 μL of 83 ng/μl Trypsin/LysC mixture (V5071, Promega) in 100 mM TEAB. Additionally, the following day, 10 μl of a 20 ng/μl Trypsin/LysC mixture was added to each protein digest for 3 h. The protein digests were then dried and reconstituted in 100 μl 100 mM TEAB prior to labeling the peptides with a unique TMT 10-plex reagent according to the manufacturer’s protocol. The 10 TMT-labeled peptide samples were combined and dried before fractionating over a basic reverse phase (X-Bridge C18, 2.1 × 100-mm, Waters). Fractions were concatenated and combined into 24 fractions and dried.</p>
<p>Approximately 1 μg of each fraction was analyzed by liquid chromatography interfaced with tandem mass spectrometry (LCMSMS) using a Thermo Easy-LC interfaced with a Fusion. Peptides were loaded onto a C18 trap (S-10 μM, 120 Å, 75 μm × 2 cm, YMC, Japan) for 5 min at 5 mL/min in 2% acetonitrile/0.1% formic acid in-line with a 75 μm × 150 mm ProntoSIL-120-5-C18 H column (5 μm, 120 Å (BISCHOFF). Peptides eluting during the 2%–90% acetonitrile in 0.1% formic acid gradient over 100 min at 300 nl/min were directly sprayed into a Fusion mass spectrometer through a 1-μm emitter tip (New Objective, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.newobjective.com/" xlink:type="simple">www.newobjective.com</ext-link>) at 2.0 kV.

Precursor and fragment ions were analyzed at resolutions 120,000 and 60,000, respectively, and automatic gain control (AGC) target values at 4e5 with 50-ms maximum injection time (IT) and 1e5 with 118-ms maximum IT, respectively.</p>
<p>Isotopically resolved masses in precursor (MS) and fragmentation (MS/MS) spectra were extracted from raw MS data without deconvolution and with deconvolution using Xtract or MS2 Processor in Proteome Discoverer (PD) software (v1.4, Thermo Scientific). All extracted data were searched using Mascot (2.5.1; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.matrixscience.com/" xlink:type="simple">www.matrixscience.com</ext-link>) against the 2015RefSeq_complete protein database (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> taxonomy), using the following criteria: precursor mass tolerance of 8 ppm, fragment mass tolerance of 0.03 Da; trypsin as the enzyme, allowing 1 missed cleavage; carbamidomethylation and TMT 10-plex on N-terminus as fixed modifications; methionine oxidation, asparagine, and glutamine deamidation and TMT 6-plex on lysine as variable modifications. Peptide identifications from Mascot searches were filtered at 1% FDR confidence threshold, based on a concatenated decoy database search, using the PD. PD uses TMT reporter ions for quantification only from the peptide identifications with the highest Mascot score from the 3 different extraction methods of the same peptide-matched spectrum (PSM). Protein quantification is based on the normalized median ratio of all spectra of tagged peptides from the same protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref046">46</xref>].</p>

The chloroform layer containing a crude lipid extract was dried in a nitrogen evaporator (Organomation Associates, Berlin, MA, USA) and resuspended in pure methanol. Analyses of sphingomyelins were performed on a triple quadrupole mass spectrometer (API3000, AB Sciex Thornhill, Ontario, Canada) using instrument parameters similar to those described in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref051">51</xref>]. Samples were injected using an Agilent 1100 high-pressure liquid chromatography (HPLC) (Agilent Technologies, Santa Clara, CA, USA) equipped with a reverse phase C18 column (Phenomenex, Torrance, CA, USA). Sphingomyelin species were separated by gradient elution at the flow rate of 0.7 mL/min. Mobile phases consisted of (A) 60% methanol, 39% H<sub>2</sub>O, 1% formic acid with 5 mM ammonium formate and (B) 99% methanol, 1% formic acid, and 5 mM ammonium formate. Gradient conditions were as follows: 60% B for 0.01 min, a gradual increase to 100% B over the next 0.49 min, and hold at 100% B for 3 min; decline from 100% to 0% B during the next 0.01 min, hold at 0% B for 0.99 min, increase from 0% to 60% B for 0.5 min, and hold at 60% B for the final 0.5 min. The eluted sample was injected into the ion source, where the detection of each sphingomyelin species was conducted by multiple reaction monitoring in positive mode. The ion spray voltage (V) was 5,500 at a temperature of 80°C with a nebulizer gas of 9 psi and curtain gas of 8 psi, and the collision gas set at 10 psi. The declustering potential was 60 V, the focusing potential 300 V, the entrance potential 10 V, the collision energy 30 V, and the collision cell exit potential 10 V. MS/MS scanned from 300 to 1,000 atomic mass units (amu) per second with steps of 0.1 amu. Eight-point calibration curves (0.1 to 1,000 ng/ml) were constructed by plotting the area under the curve for sphingomyelin C16:0, C18:0, C20:0, C22:0, and C24:0 (Avanti polar lipids, Alabaster, AL, USA) prepared in pure methanol normalized to the C12:0 internal standard. Concentrations of sphingomyelins in each sample were determined by fitting the identified sphingomyelin and dihydrosphingomyelin species to these standard curves based on acyl-chain length. Intraday coefficients of variation (CVs) for each sphingomyelin species were less than 10% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006519.ref049">49</xref>].
