      <abstract>
        <p>Identifying drug-drug interactions (DDIs) is a major challenge in drug development. Previous attempts have established formal approaches for pharmacokinetic (PK) DDIs, but there is not a feasible solution for pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs because the endpoint is often a serious adverse event rather than a measurable change in drug concentration. Here, we developed a metric “S-score” that measures the strength of network connection between drug targets to predict PD DDIs. Utilizing known PD DDIs as golden standard positives (GSPs), we observed a significant correlation between S-score and the likelihood a PD DDI occurs. Our prediction was robust and surpassed existing methods as validated by two independent GSPs. Analysis of clinical side effect data suggested that the drugs having predicted DDIs have similar side effects. We further incorporated this clinical side effects evidence with S-score to increase the prediction specificity and sensitivity through a Bayesian probabilistic model. We have predicted 9,626 potential PD DDIs at the accuracy of 82% and the recall of 62%. Importantly, our algorithm provided opportunities for better understanding the potential molecular mechanisms or physiological effects underlying DDIs, as illustrated by the case studies.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is an important problem in clinical practice. In this study, we developed a novel algorithm for systematically predicting pharmacodynamic (PD) DDIs through protein-protein-interaction (PPI) networks. We calculated a score to predict potential PD DDIs by integrating the information from drug-target associations, PPI network topology and cross-tissue gene expression correlations. The scoring system was validated by known PD DDIs and agreed with similarities in drug clinical side effects, which we further integrated to increase the prediction performance. Our approach not only outperformed previously published methods in predicting DDIs, but also provided opportunities for better understanding the potential molecular mechanisms or physiological consequences underlying DDIs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Drug-drug interaction (DDI) is a significant cause of adverse drug reactions (ADRs), especially in patient populations on multiple medications. A recent study indicated that medications were commonly used together in older adults, with nearly 1 in 25 individuals potentially at risk of a major DDI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Qato1">[1]</xref>. Approximately 70% of interactions are clinically relevant and contribute to the majority of ADRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Kiran1">[2]</xref>. DDIs occur when the pharmacologic effect of a given drug is altered by the action of another drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Tatro1">[3]</xref>, leading to unpredictable clinical effects. DDIs can be categorized into three types: pharmaceutical, pharmacokinetic (PK), and pharmacodynamic (PD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Beijnen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Nemeroff1">[5]</xref>. Pharmaceutical interactions occur because of a physical or chemical incompatibility. A PK interaction occurs when one medication alters the absorption, distribution, metabolism, or excretion of another, changing the drug concentrations arriving at the target sites. PD interactions occur if one drug has an antagonistic, additive, synergistic or indirect pharmacologic effect on another.</p>
      <p>Current studies mainly focused on PK (especially Cytochrome P450 enzymes) DDIs and established experimental and simulation approaches to test for metabolic or transporter-based drug interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Huang1">[6]</xref>. However, a large number of DDIs cannot be explained at the PK or pharmaceutical levels and are supposed to be potential PD DDIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s001">Figure S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Many of these interactions are not easily discernible because the endpoint is often a potentially serious adverse event rather than a measurable change in the concentration of the drug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Nemeroff1">[5]</xref>. Typically, the potential PD DDIs were mainly based on sporadic cases reported during clinical trials. A number of severe PD DDIs are not identifiable in the early stage and result in great losses to human health. Thus far, the computational solutions to predict DDIs have used two distinct approaches. The first approach, termed similarity-based, predicted DDIs by measuring the similarity of drug information. As an example, Gottlieb <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Gottlieb1">[7]</xref> utilizes multiple drug-drug similarity measures to predict DDI. In this respect, many previous methods which were originally designed for inferring novel potential targets of drugs based on various types of data, such as structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Keiser1">[8]</xref>, targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Yildirim1">[9]</xref>, indications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Berger1">[10]</xref>, side-effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Campillos1">[11]</xref> and gene expression profiles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Lamb1">[12]</xref>, can also be used to infer drug interactions. The second approach is the knowledge-based approach that predicts DDI from scientific literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Kuhn1">[13]</xref>, an electronic medical record database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Jon1">[14]</xref> and the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Tatonetti1">[15]</xref>. However, both approaches suffer from several limitations, such as the necessity to distinguish drug classes and the inability to handle novel drugs for which limited reports exist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Gottlieb1">[7]</xref>. More importantly, they seldom consider drug actions and their clinical effects in the context of complex biological networks.</p>
      <p>To ameliorate this situation, we adopted a network pharmacology strategy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Hopkins1">[16]</xref>, which considers drug actions and their clinical effects in the context of molecular network systems, and proposed an algorithm to systematically predict PD DDIs. Using known PD DDIs as golden standard positives (GSPs), we demonstrated the superiority of our algorithm over previously published methods. The predictions also agreed with similar clinical side effects between the drugs, which was further incorporated with S-score to increase the prediction performance through a Bayesian probabilistic model. Importantly, our methods provided not only a comprehensive list of potential PD DDIs, but it also opportunities for further understanding of the molecular mechanism and physiological effect underlying DDIs.</p>

        <title>PD DDIs are reflected at the molecular network level</title>
        <p>To determine whether the network pharmacology strategy can be used to understand DDIs, specifically PD DDIs, we first investigated whether PD DDIs are reflected at the network level. We examined the distribution of the targets of drug pairs with known PD DDIs among the 1,249 FDA-approved drugs collected in DrugBank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Knox1">[17]</xref> in a protein-protein interaction (PPI) network from HPRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-KeshavaPrasad1">[18]</xref>. The connection for any possible drug pairs was measured by the minimum shortest path between their targets in the PPI network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Out of the 21,049 drug pairs that have minimum target distances of zero, 924 (4.4%) were known PD DDIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which represents a ∼6-fold enrichment compared with all possible drug pairs. This is expected because drug pairs with minimum distances of zero are those sharing at least one overlapping target, and these have been reported to have a high probability to form DDIs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Yildirim1">[9]</xref>. More importantly, we found that the smaller the minimum distance between two drugs' targets the more likely a PD DDI occurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting PD DDIs can be discerned at the PPI network level. In fact, the drug pairs with the minimum distance ≤3 already cover the majority (&gt;80%) of the known PD DDIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Overall, the average distance of known PD DDI targets is significantly shorter than the global average of possible drug pairs in the network (<italic>P-value&lt;2.2E-16</italic>, Wilcoxon rank sum test).</p>

        <title>An algorithm for predicting PD DDIs through PPI network</title>
        <p>Based on the above observation, we designed a metric for systematically predicting PD DDIs by considering drug actions in the context of the PPI networks. First, drugs were mapped onto a PPI network based on their drug-target associations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Second, many drugs exert their therapeutic or adverse effects by interfering with tissue-specific molecular targets that are usually located in the same tissue where a pathological process occurs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Berger2">[19]</xref>. Therefore, we weighed the PPI in the network by Pearson's correlation coefficient (PCC) of their encoding genes' expression profile across 79 human tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Su1">[20]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Then we defined a target-centered system for each drug, which includes drug targets and their first-step neighboring proteins in the PPI network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Finally, we defined a system connection score (S-score) to describe the connection between two target-centered systems in the PPI network as the following (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g002">Figure 2D</xref>):<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002998.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002998.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002998.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>,<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002998.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002998.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represent the mean, standard deviation and number of the cross-tissue expression PCC of edges connecting two drug-centered systems, respectively; <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002998.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the average PCC of all edges in the network as background. In addition, if two target-centered systems share a gene, an artificial edge with PCC of 1 is added between the two systems. Thus, S-score reflects the tightness of connection between two target-centered systems in the network, which not only depends on the number of edges connecting the genes in these two target-centered systems but also on the similarity in expression patterns across tissues.</p>

        <title>Performance evaluation and comparison with other methods</title>
        <p>To evaluate our scoring scheme, we calculated S-scores for all possible drug pairs among the list of FDA-approved drugs. Using known PD DDIs collected in DrugBank as GSPs, we first evaluated the correlation between S-score and the likelihood that a PD DDI occurs. Indeed, the occurrence of PD DDIs decreased with decreasing S-scores among all possible drug pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Additionally, there was a highly significant correlation between S-score and the hits enrichment of GSPs (<italic>R<sup>2</sup> = 0.66, P-value = 4.3E-52</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). It indicated that the likelihood of a PD DDI to occur is high if the two drugs' targets are highly connected in PPI network and co-expressed in the same tissues. Next, we used receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curves to examine the performance of our algorithm. We compared our prediction with previously published methods (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s005">Text S1</xref>): (1) target overlap, connecting two drugs if share at least one target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Yildirim1">[9]</xref>; (2) target distance, connecting two drugs by their minimum distance of shortest path between targets on PPI network (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>); (3) P-score, connecting two drugs by their side-effect similarities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Campillos1">[11]</xref>; (4) C-score, connecting two drugs by their gene-expression signatures connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Lamb1">[12]</xref>; (5) indication overlap, connecting two drugs if they share a similar indication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Berger1">[10]</xref>; (6) text mining, connecting two drugs based on a co-occurrence scheme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Kuhn1">[13]</xref>; (7) TWOSIDES, a database of polypharmacy side effects for pairs of drugs mined from FDA Adverse Event Reporting System <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Tatonetti1">[15]</xref>; (8) INDI, a method predicted DDIs utilizing multiple drug-drug similarity measures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Gottlieb1">[7]</xref>.

Importantly, S-score, by integrating the information from drug-target associations, PPI network topology and cross-tissue gene co-expression, has the best performance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, using different types of known DDIs as GSPs (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we found that S-score mainly predicted PD, but not PK or pharmaceutical DDIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Using the DDIs recorded in DrugBank as GSPs, we also observed that our method outperformed previous methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). By using the drug-drug associations with medium text mining confidence score from the STITCH database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Kuhn1">[13]</xref> as another evaluation criterion, we also confirmed the robustness of S-score in predicting potential DDIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), even for our novel predictions which excluded the known DDIs in DrugBank (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). These results excluded the possibility that the performance of S-score was associated with biases of our semi-automatic text-mining method of classifying known DDIs into three types, and demonstrated the good performance of S-score is independent of the GSPs used.

        <p>To further validate our predictions, we examined the phenotypic effects of our predictions using published drug clinical side effect data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Kuhn2">[21]</xref>. Based on the observation that similar disorder phenotypes indicate overlapping molecular mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Goh1">[22]</xref>, we asked whether two drugs have similar clinical outcomes if they are highly connected in their target-centered systems (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g002">Figure 2E and 2F</xref>). We measured the phenotypic connections between two drugs by their side-effect similarities (P-score) following a published algorithm, which was originally designed to infer novel potential targets of marketed drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Campillos1">[11]</xref>.

        <title>Integration by a Bayesian probabilistic model</title>
        <p>To further increase the prediction performance, we integrated the evidences from S-score and P-score as a likelihood ratio (LR) using a Bayesian probabilistic model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As a result, we observed a clear improvement of prediction specificity and sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). The area under the ROC curve (AUC) increased from 0.674 to 0.731. In particular, for drug pairs with both evidences, the AUC of LR (defined as LR(S-score and P-score)), approached 0.812 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We applied the algorithm to the FDA-approved drugs and generated a list of prioritized drug pairs where PD DDIs might likely occur. Overall, the list of 9,626 drug pairs with LR(S-score and P-score) &gt;2 were 7.5-fold enriched for known PD DDIs against all possible drug pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s004">Table S1</xref>), which represents an accuracy of 82% and a recall of 62% (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To further assess our novel predictions, we evaluated the potential side effects of our novel predictions against the TWOSIDES database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Tatonetti1">[15]</xref>, which collected polypharmacy side effects for pairs of drugs from the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). We observed a significant overlap between our novel predictions and TWOSIDES (<italic>P-value</italic>&lt;2.2E-16, Fisher's exact test), where 27% of the novel predictions overlapped the list of TWOSIDES. The percentage approached 60% for our top 100 novel predicted drug pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s004">Table S1</xref>). The prioritized list together with the available drug indication information, such as whether two drugs were likely co-used, can provide the rationale for which PD DDIs we should be mindful of during clinical trials or treatment.</p>

        <title>Case studies</title>
        <p>The most common drugs at the top of the prioritized list of potential PD DDIs were associated with tricyclic antidepressants (TCA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s004">Table S1</xref>), which are primarily used in the clinical treatment of mood disorders such as major depressive disorder (MDD) and dysthymia. It has been reported that patients taking antidepressants have more opportunities to experience DDIs, because antidepressants are often prescribed for months or years. In addition, patients with depressive disorders typically have comorbid symptoms that require administration of concomitant medications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Ereshefsky1">[23]</xref>. Although many of these drug interaction mechanisms remain unclear, it is recommended that concomitant therapy of TCAs should be used with caution considering the major clinical significance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Nieuwstraten1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Gillman1">[25]</xref>.

Such an interaction has been reported to increase the risk of additive QTc-prolongation and serious ventricular arrhythmias in DrugBank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Knox1">[17]</xref>. In our network model, the target-centered systems of these two drugs highly overlapped and connected with correlated cross-tissue gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), which is indicated by an S-score of 9.6 (Student's <italic>t</italic>-test <italic>P-value&lt;2.2E-16</italic>, compared to all possible drug pairs).

As an example, an interaction was predicted to exist between zonisamide and memantine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Zonisamide is a sulfonamide anticonvulsant approved for using as an adjunctive treatment of partial seizures in adults with epilepsy by blocking sodium and calcium channels, which leads to the suppression of neuronal hypersynchronization (i.e. convulsions) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Knox1">[17]</xref>. Memantine, an amantadine derivative used in the treatment of Alzheimer's disease, exerts its action through uncompetitive NMDA receptor antagonism, which protects against elevated concentrations of synaptically released glutamate in the brain of demented patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Knox1">[17]</xref>. The two drugs do not have common targets, but do have similar cross-tissue expressions between their drug-centered systems (S-score = 6.5, <italic>P-value</italic>&lt;2.2E-16) and similar side effects (P-score = 73.5, <italic>P-value</italic>&lt;2.2E-16). Although it has not been reported in DrugBank <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Knox1">[17]</xref>, TWOSIDES recently reported that this drug pair has an significant association with the adverse event thrombocytopenia (<italic>P-value</italic> = 1.36E-177) in the FDA Adverse Event Reporting System, which cannot be clearly attributed to the individual drugs alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Tatonetti1">[15]</xref>. Our analysis reveals that the genes in two drug target-centered systems are highly enriched in genes significantly highly expressed in the “Platelet” (UP_TISSUE) (<italic>P-value</italic> = 8.8E-3). Interestingly, such an interaction cannot be predicted based only on the knowledge of their drug targets as neither of the individual drug's target gene set is related to the thrombocytopenia symptom. Yet, consistent with their intended effects, emantine's targets are enriched for “N-methyl-D-aspartate selective glutamate receptor complex” (GO:0017146) (<italic>P-value</italic> = 1.4E-2), which is involved in Alzheimer's disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Selkoe1">[26]</xref>, while zonisamide's targets are enriched for “voltage-gated sodium channel complex” (GO:0001518) (<italic>P-value</italic> = 3.1E-4), which is involved in pathological alterations in epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Kohling1">[27]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Despite the many methods previously applied to identify potential drug interactions from different aspects, these approaches have various limitations. To our knowledge, we for the first time, present an algorithm for systematically predicting PD DDIs by considering drug actions and their clinical effects in the context of complex PPI networks. The integration of various sources of information such as drug targets, network topology, cross-tissue gene expression correlations and side effect similarity indeed give rise to a better performance in predicting DDIs than those obtained with individual data sources. Finally, our network model provides opportunities for better understanding the potential molecular mechanisms or physiological effects underlying DDIs.</p>
      <p>However, like other computational-based techniques in this field, there still exists a gap between our scientific predictions in theory and clinical application. First, limited by the current knowledge of the molecular network as well as the robustness of the biological system itself, our prediction only provides the relative likelihood of the occurrence of a PD DDI. Second, as currently only a few types of data were used for prediction, the prediction power is bound to improve when integrated with more clinical data, if available, and complemented with recently published DDI prediction methods from different aspects. Last, the predicted potential PD DDIs are not necessarily always harmful but sometimes can also be beneficial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Zhao1">[28]</xref>. Even though the current GSPs include only a small number of beneficial interactions, such interactions may occur through the same mechanism - overlapping network, in which case can be predicted by our method. With these further improvements, our method can be potentially applied in drug discovery and development, serving as an <italic>in silico</italic> systematic screen to provide a list of prioritized potential PD DDIs in a cost-effective manner or be applied to relabeling drug interaction warnings for marketed drugs. Our method can also reveal potential mechanisms or effects underlying DDIs and provide the necessary scientific evidence for further investigation of the drugs during clinical trials. These mechanisms could be valuable for rational poly-medication among existing drugs for new purposes to enhance beneficial drug combinations while avoiding harmful DDIs.</p>

          <p>To measure the performance of predicted drug interactions, 14,746 known DDIs from DrugBank which are defined as “interact, interfere or cause adverse reactions when taken with two drugs”, were used as GSPs. We separated these DDIs into three classes based on their clinical label descriptions using a semi-automatic text mining method: (1) pharmaceutical interactions, where the description label contains any of the keywords- “physicochemical”, “non-absorbable”, “solution”; (2) PK interactions, where the label contains any of the keywords- “CYP”, “absorption”, “distribution”, “metabolism”, “excretion”, “concentration”, “level”, “metabolite”, “metabolized”, “enzyme inducer”, “clearance”; (3) PD-like interactions - the rest. The classification has also been used in a paper recently published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Gottlieb1">[7]</xref>. In total, it resulted in 82 pharmaceutical DDIs, 3,259 PK DDIs and 11,405 PD-like DDIs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002998.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In our analysis, we used the PD-like DDIs as GSPs if not stated otherwise. Since the true negative set of DDIs is not available, similar to a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Gottlieb1">[7]</xref>, we randomly generated a set of drug pairs (not part of the GSPs) with five-times the size or an equal size as the GSPs, as the GSNs.

          <p>Instead of simply calculating the overlap between two drugs' targets, we measured the connection between drug targets by their minimum shortest distances in PPI network. Shortest path between any two targets was first searched using Dijkstra's algorithm. Then, we selected the minimum distance of the shortest path between their targets to describe the distance of two drugs on PPI network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002998-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

        <title>Bayesian probabilistic model</title>
        <p>To integrate the evidences from network system connectivity score (S-score) and drug phenotypic similarity score (P-score), we used a Bayesian probabilistic model described in Xia <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Xia1">[29]</xref>, where the Bayesian model has been proven to be particularly competent in predicting PPIs by integrating various evidences. The method has also been used to combine the different types of clues for predicting PPIs in a paper recently published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002998-Zhang1">[30]</xref>. Briefly, in the Bayesian probabilistic model, each score is automatically weighted according to its confidence level. The scoring schemes (<italic>S-score, P-score</italic>) were integrated as a likelihood ratio (LR) for drug pairs to be true positive DDIs versus true negative DDIs by multiplying from all the independent evidences as following:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002998.e010"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002998.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002998.e011"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002998.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>LR(i-score)</italic> represents the likelihood ratio of evidence <italic>i-score</italic>.
