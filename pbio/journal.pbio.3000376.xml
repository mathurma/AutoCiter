<abstract>
<p>Apicomplexan parasites possess a plastid organelle called the apicoplast. Inhibitors that selectively target apicoplast housekeeping functions, including DNA replication and protein translation, are lethal for the parasite, and several (doxycycline, clindamycin, and azithromycin) are in clinical use as antimalarials. A major limitation of such drugs is that treated parasites only arrest one intraerythrocytic development cycle (approximately 48 hours) after treatment commences, a phenotype known as the ‘delayed death’ effect. The molecular basis of delayed death is a long-standing mystery in parasitology, and establishing the mechanism would aid rational clinical implementation of apicoplast-targeted drugs. Parasites undergoing delayed death transmit defective apicoplasts to their daughter cells and cannot produce the sole, blood-stage essential metabolic product of the apicoplast: the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl-pyrophosphate. How the isoprenoid precursor depletion kills the parasite remains unknown. We investigated the requirements for the range of isoprenoids in the human malaria parasite <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> and characterised the molecular and morphological phenotype of parasites experiencing delayed death. Metabolomic profiling reveals disruption of digestive vacuole function in the absence of apicoplast derived isoprenoids. Three-dimensional electron microscopy reveals digestive vacuole fragmentation and the accumulation of cytostomal invaginations, characteristics common in digestive vacuole disruption. We show that digestive vacuole disruption results from a defect in the trafficking of vesicles to the digestive vacuole. The loss of prenylation of vesicular trafficking proteins abrogates their membrane attachment and function and prevents the parasite from feeding. Our data show that the proximate cause of delayed death is an interruption of protein prenylation and consequent cellular trafficking defects.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The apicoplast, the plastid of the malaria parasite (<italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp.), is an essential and druggable organelle. The apicoplast is found in most apicomplexan parasites, with <italic>Cryptosporidium</italic> spp. being a notable exception [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref001">1</xref>]. The apicoplast is believed to be homologous to the chloroplast of dinoflagellates, being acquired by the common ancestor of Apicomplexa and Dinozoa through the secondary endosymbiosis of an ancient photosynthetic red alga [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref003">3</xref>]. The algal plastid has been retained in Apicomplexa despite losing its capacity for photosynthesis, which was lost during the transition to obligate parasitism. The apicoplast retains a 35-kb genome, originally derived from the cyanobacterial ancestor of all plastids, and expresses a small repertoire of gene products essential for the upkeep and replication of the organelle. The majority of the endosymbiont’s genes, required for the anabolic productivity of the apicoplast, have been transferred to the nucleus. These nuclear-encoded apicoplast proteins require a bipartite signal peptide to correctly traffic back to and translocate through the organelle’s four membranes.</p>
<p>A consequence of acquiring the plastid is that <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp., as well as closely related human disease–causing Apicomplexans like <italic>Toxoplasma gondii</italic> maintain druggable prokaryotic-like mechanisms and pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref005">5</xref>]. The apicoplast’s prokaryotic-like translation apparatus has been an especially well-exploited antiparasitic drug target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref009">9</xref>]. Many antibiotics that chemically inhibit either the 30S or 50S bacterial ribosome, such as doxycycline and clindamycin, have been repurposed to treat both malaria and toxoplasmosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref011">11</xref>]. However, a defining characteristic for known inhibitors of apicoplast protein translation or genome replication is a curious chemotherapeutic effect referred to as delayed death.</p>
<p>Drugs targeting plastid maintenance cause no growth defect within the initial 48-hour intraerythrocytic development cycle (IDC). Rather, parasites continue to grow and complete schizogony. Daughter merozoites segment, egress, and invade a new host red blood cell (RBC), in which they continue to develop from ring-stage parasites to trophozoites. It is only later in this second IDC that the effect of the drug manifests and the treated parasites lethally arrest. Seemingly, parasites treated with drugs that target plastid maintenance acquire a defect in their apicoplast (first IDC) that becomes lethal when transmitted to their progeny (second IDC). This is readily observed as defective apicoplast protein import and organelle segmentation and a reduction in genome number in the second but not first IDC following treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref012">12</xref>]. An effect comparable to delayed death is also observed in liver-stage <italic>P</italic>. <italic>berghei</italic> parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref013">13</xref>]. Early liver-stage parasites treated with apicoplast-targeting antibiotics show no apparent defect during the intracellular expansion and division but fail to segregate the apicoplast properly and produce merosomes that do not subsequently establish a blood-stage infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref013">13</xref>]. A delayed-death phenotype is also observed for intracellular tachyzoites of <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, in which chemical or genetic inhibition of apicoplast function or division is lethal only in the progeny of treated parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref016">16</xref>]. Delayed death is an obstacle to development of some drugs targeting the apicoplast as stand-alone malaria treatments, although such compounds can be used in combination or as prophylactic drugs.</p>
<p>The apicoplast houses multiple anabolic pathways to synthesise metabolites for the growing parasite. Pathways include biosynthetic networks for type II fatty acid synthesis (FASII), iron–sulphur clusters (FE–S), lipoic acids, and haem, as well as a 2-C-methyl-D-erythritol 4-phosphate/1-deoxy-D-xylulose 5-phosphate (MEP/DOXP) pathway for isoprenoid biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref017">17</xref>]. Of these, Yeh and DeRisi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref018">18</xref>] showed that the exogenous supply of the isoprenoid precursor isopentenyl pyrophosphate (IPP) was sufficient to rescue inhibition of apicoplast protein translation and, indeed, even complete ablation of the apicoplast in intraerythrocytic culture of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. This indicates that isoprenoids are the sole essential metabolite supplied by the apicoplast to the rest of the cell during <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> blood stages. While IPP rescue is not experimentally possible in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>, recent data from Amberg-Johnson and Yeh [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref019">19</xref>] indicate that delayed death in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic> also depends on IPP availability. Curiously, whereas inhibition of apicoplast housekeeping leads to delayed death, chemical or genetic ablation of the MEP/DOXP pathway in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> or <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> parasites leads to immediate death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref023">23</xref>]. These data suggest that while depletion of isoprenoids is immediately deleterious, delayed-death parasites either harbour a finite isoprenoid reservoir or can only temporarily continue to synthesise isoprenoids, likely using residual enzymes of the MEP/DOXP that were imported into the apicoplast in the first IDC. For delayed death in <italic>T</italic>. <italic>gondii</italic>, parasites lacking an apicoplast are able to survive by sharing metabolites between multiple parasites within a single parasitophorous vacuole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref024">24</xref>], provided one individual retains an apicoplast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>We hypothesise that delayed death is the consequence of isoprenoid fatigue: parasites are eventually depleted of available isoprenoids but are unable to synthesise new precursors de novo. However, the individual essential isoprenoid products, the essential roles that these isoprenoids play, and how isoprenoid fatigue fatally perturbs molecular processes in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. remain to be determined. IPP produced by the apicoplast likely generates a diverse collection of higher isoprenoids, which in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> spp. include 1) prenyl groups for protein modification, 2) the isoprene side chain of ubiquinone, and 3) dolichols for glycosylphosphatidylinositol (GPI) biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref025">25</xref>]. In this study, we have investigated the essentiality of different isoprenoid products by uncoupling the contribution that prenyl groups, ubiquinone, and dolichols have on delayed death. We have also characterised the effects of delayed-death inhibitors on parasite metabolism and cellular processes for the first time. We determined that the proximate cause of delayed death is disruption of protein prenylation and consequent cellular trafficking defects that culminate in arrested parasite growth. We find that parasites undergoing delayed death exhibited disrupted prenylation of proteins required for haemoglobin uptake and the biogenesis of the digestive vacuole (DV). We further demonstrate defective localisation of prenylated trafficking mediators, defective uptake of haemoglobin, and a disrupted DV in these parasites. Lastly, delineating the temporal contribution of prenylation from ubiquinone and dolichol biosynthesis to parasite development strongly indicates that disruption of prenylation is the proximate cause of delayed death.</p>

<title>Metabolic perturbation of indolmycin-treated parasites during delayed death</title>
<p>We sought to investigate the metabolomic consequences of delayed death using specific inhibition of apicoplast translation.

During the first IDC, parasites develop over approximately 48 hours from the ring-stage into a metabolically active trophozoite, before dividing into multiple daughter merozoites by schizogony. Parasites treated with an apicoplast inhibitor during this first IDC successfully complete schizogony, but the daughter merozoites inherit a defective apicoplast. The lethal effect of the drug manifests only after invasion of a new host cell, in which parasites fail to complete a second IDC.

<p>The relative abundance (indolmycin treated/untreated) of the 159 metabolites detected in the time series is summarised in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g001">Fig 1B</xref>. Indolmycin treatment did not cause metabolic perturbation during the first IDC following treatment (30-hour time point). During the second IDC following drug treatment, the relative abundance of the isoprenoid biosynthetic intermediates 2-C-methyl-erythritol-2,4-cyclodiphosphate and DOXP, and the downstream isoprenoid species farnesyl pyrophosphate (FPP) and geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate (GGPP) progressively decreased in the indolmycin-treated parasites. The perturbation to isoprenoid biosynthesis is consistent with parasites possessing a defective apicoplast that cannot make new isoprenoids.</p>
<p>Few other metabolic changes were observed between indolmycin-treated and untreated parasites during the second IDC following drug treatment, with the exception of several haemoglobin-like peptides decreasing in abundance at 58 hours (equivalent to 14 hours post invasion [hpi] in the second IDC) and beyond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). This perturbation suggested that catabolism of RBC-derived haemoglobin may be compromised during indolmycin-induced delayed death. Diminished haemoglobin metabolism might be caused either by aberrant proteolysis in the parasite DV or by disrupted uptake/trafficking of haemoglobin to the DV. Given the essential role of prenylated proteins in vesicular trafficking and membrane fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref029">29</xref>], it follows that decreased abundance of the prenyl precursors FPP and GGPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) could disrupt the function of proteins involved in haemoglobin metabolism; below, we show that this is indeed the case.</p>

<title>Protein prenylation is disrupted during delayed death</title>
<p>To determine if the decreased abundance of the higher isoprenoid species and prenylation substrates FPP and GGPP detected in the metabolomics study corresponds to disruption of cellular protein prenylation, we used a commercial anti-farnesyl antibody, which is cross-reactive to proteins with a farnesyl or geranylgeranyl modification. iRBCs were treated with 50 μM indolmycin for 30 hours and, cell lysates were collected at 72–78 hours during their second IDC following treatment (equivalent to 28–34 hpi in the second IDC). In untreated (DMSO only) parasite lysates, two prominent bands were detected at approximately 50 kD and 25 kD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), consistent with previously published prenylated species recognised by anti-farnesyl antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref030">30</xref>] and (<sup>3</sup>H)prenyl/polyprenol labelling in malaria parasites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref032">32</xref>].

<p>To determine if the apparent failure to prenylate protein in delayed-death parasites is due to lack of isoprenoids used for protein prenylation (i.e., FPP/GGPP), we substituted the polyprenol analogue geranylgeraniol (GGOH) into the medium of indolmycin-treated parasites. GGOH has previously been reported to protect parasites from fosmidomycin treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref033">33</xref>]. We therefore hypothesised that GGOH substitution following indolmycin treatment would facilitate further protein prenylation by complementing the depletion of de novo prenyl groups. Consistent with this hypothesis, the indolmycin-treated parasites supplemented with 5 μM GGOH show bands at the same size as detected in the untreated sample (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>Polyprenol substitution rescues parasites from delayed death</title>
<p>Supplementing the medium of indolmycin-treated parasites with the isoprenoid precursor IPP (&gt;200 μM) is sufficient to rescue parasites from delayed death indefinitely (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref018">18</xref>].

With 200 μM IPP supplementation, iRBC are protected from the lethal effect of indolmycin up to the maximum concentration assayed (50 μM) at both 96 hours and 144 hours (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). Given that GGOH supplementation protects against the depletion of prenylated proteins, we tested whether polyprenol precursors have a dose-dependent protective effect against indolmycin treatment. We first performed growth inhibition assays using GGOH and farnesol (FOH; the alcohol analogue of the prenyl group FPP) and determined that concentrations of GGOH exceeding 20 μM or FOH exceeding 30 μM were antagonistic to parasite growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). To be used as productive substrates for protein prenylation, FOH and GGOH must first be phosphorylated (by unknown kinases) to FPP and GGPP; however, it is possible that FOH and GGOH compete directly as unproductive FPP and GGPP substrates and that this has a dose-dependent toxic effect on the parasite. Of these two polyprenol compounds, GGOH but not FOH showed protective effects when supplemented into the medium of indolmycin-treated parasites, with 5 μM GGOH being the lowest optimal protective concentration without antagonising parasite survival (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Likewise, supplementation of indolmycin-treated parasites with a combination of GGOH or FOH showed no synergistic protective effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), suggesting that GGOH but not FOH is readily used as a prenylation substrate, which is consistent with ex vivo studies where [<sup>3</sup>H]GGOH was used preferentially to [<sup>3</sup>H]FOH as a substrate to modify protein in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref032">32</xref>].</p>

<p>Supplementing the medium with 5 μM GGOH increased the 96-hour EC<sub>50</sub> of indolmycin to &gt;50 μM (<italic>n</italic> = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Importantly, GGOH was supplemented only after replacing the medium in the second IDC. However, unlike IPP, the protective effect of GGOH is only temporary, with no difference between the 144-hour EC<sub>50</sub> values for indolmycin-treated and GGOH rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This shows that provision of the polyprenol precursor GGOH rescues parasites during the second IDC following indolmycin treatment but that the rescued parasites still eventually succumb to the lethal effect of the drug precluding a third IDC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We confirmed that temporary rescue with GGOH was common to delayed death–causing drugs by repeating the analysis with clindamycin and chloramphenicol, antibiotics that target separate components of the apicoplast protein-translation apparatus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), and which have previously been shown to be completely rescuable using IPP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref034">34</xref>]. 5 μM GGOH supplementation protected parasites from delayed death up the maximum concentration of clindamycin assayed (&gt;10 μM, <italic>n</italic> = 3, approximately 1,000× 96-hour EC<sub>50</sub>), and chloramphenicol showed a significant fold reduction in its 96-hour EC<sub>50</sub> when treated parasites were supplemented with 5 μM GGOH from 27.3 μM, (<italic>n</italic> = 3, SD ± 6.6 μM) to 65.64 μM (<italic>n</italic> = 3, SD ± 10.8 μM) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). However, consistent with our findings using indolmycin, GGOH did not protect parasites from treatment with clindamycin or chloramphenicol in the third IDC after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g003">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Together, these data show that the failure to prenylate proteins during the parasite’s second IDC following indolmycin-treatment is the proximate cause of delayed death and that supplementing the polyprenol precursor GGOH is sufficient to alleviate the effects of isoprenoid fatigue in these parasites. However, restoring the capacity of delayed-death parasites to prenylate proteins alone is insufficient to indefinitely rescue parasites. As such, we hypothesise that disrupting protein prenylation is the immediate cause of parasite death in the second IDC but that even if this pathway is supplemented, another lethal insult ultimately arises, resulting in growth arrest that precludes a third IDC.</p>

<title>Aberrant uptake/trafficking of RBC cytoplasm to the DV during delayed death</title>
<p>Considering the observed disruption in haemoglobin metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), we sought to determine whether host haemoglobin uptake or trafficking is disrupted during delayed death. We investigated parasite-mediated RBC cytoplasm internalisation using a fluorescein-dextran (F-dextran) uptake assay modified from Frankland and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref035">35</xref>] and Baker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref036">36</xref>]. Uninfected RBCs were loaded with F-dextran such that their cytosolic contents are fluorescently labelled. Newly invaded, preloaded iRBCs were treated with 50 μM indolmycin for 30 hours and imaged by live-cell fluorescence microscopy 72–78 hours following drug treatment (equivalent to 28–34 hpi in the second IDC) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). In the untreated iRBCs (DMSO only), the F-dextran was internalised by the parasite and concentrated into one or sometimes two compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g004">Fig 4B</xref>), consistent with Baker and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref036">36</xref>]. In parasites with two F-dextran-labelled compartments, the larger compartment was typically adjacent to a smaller compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, untreated). This is consistent with a single parasite DV and transitory vesicles containing F-dextran internalised from the RBC cytoplasm. In the indolmycin-treated group, the F-dextran was more frequently concentrated into multiple compartments (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, one-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This suggests that although the initial internalisation of RBC cytoplasm by treated parasites is unaffected, the trafficking or fusion of the internalised vesicles to the DV is disrupted. This led to an accumulation of aberrant compartments that is consistent with a defective RBC cytoplasm uptake phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref037">37</xref>]. Parasites treated with indolmycin but then supplemented with GGOH after treatment internalised the F-dextran into one or two compartments, equivalent to untreated samples (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). This demonstrates that delayed death is linked to the aberrant uptake of RBC cytoplasm, but this is ameliorated by polyprenol substitution, which suggests that the vesicle trafficking defect is prenylation dependent.</p>

<p>As well as confirming the fragmentation of the DV in delayed-death parasites, analysis of the 3D reconstructions dramatically altered our understanding of the membrane-bound enclosures of iRBC cytoplasm in the delayed death parasites. Rather than representing numerous discrete compartments, these were revealed as dramatic extensions of the cytostomal invagination that twisted and wound throughout the cytoplasm of the parasite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s008">S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s010">S5 Movies</xref>).

We found that the total volume of DVs decreased while the volume of the cytostomal invaginations increased within the indolmycin-treated parasites compared to untreated and GGOH-rescued parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These data support a model whereby the trafficking of RBC cytoplasm (and thus haemoglobin) from cytostomes is perturbed such that the cytostomal invagination itself becomes distended, and the delivery of packages of RBC cytoplasm is severely impaired resulting in a fragmented DV.</p>

<title>Rab GTPase-mediated vesicular trafficking is disrupted during the second IDC following indolmycin treatment</title>
<p>As demonstrated above, delayed death diminishes protein prenylation during the second IDC following treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g002">Fig 2</xref>). We hypothesised that without prenyl modification of nascent protein, the protein substrates of prenyl-transferases that are dependent on their prenyl modification for localisation or function, such as Rab GTPases, will mislocalise during delayed death. We examined the prenylated Rab GTPase, Rab5a, which has previously been shown to be associated with haemoglobin-containing vesicles and has been hypothesised to play a role in at least one of the three or four semiredundant, but unique haemoglobin uptake pathways present in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref029">29</xref>]. More recent experiments in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> indicate a role for Rab5a in the vesicular trafficking to the secretory organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref038">38</xref>]. It remains unclear what role Rab5a has in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> vesicular trafficking; nevertheless, it is a useful representative vesicular trafficking determinant whose function relies on prenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>We detected green fluorescent protein (GFP)-fusions of Rab5a in untreated parasites as discrete foci dispersed throughout trophozoite-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g006">Fig 6</xref>), as previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref039">39</xref>]. During the second IDC following clindamycin treatment, GFP-Rab5a mislocalised and, instead of being concentrated in discrete foci, was dispersed in a diffuse cytoplasmic pattern. Prenylation of Rab5a mediates membrane association (possibly alongside cargo-binding), and the apparent cytosolic dispersal of Rab5a in delayed-death parasites is consistent with loss of prenylation-mediated membrane attachment. This effect was less pronounced in late-stage parasites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g006">Fig 6</xref>), suggesting that Rab5a’s localisation may be influenced by additional factors in that stage.</p>

<p>Another prenylated Rab, Rab11a, is localised to the inner membrane complex (IMC) of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> and is proposed to facilitate vesicle recycling and transport of IMC proteins such as glideosome-associated protein 45 (GAP45) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref040">40</xref>]. Consistent with previous observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref041">41</xref>], we observed GAP45 at the IMC in schizont stages of untreated parasites. However, following indolmycin treatment during the second IDC, GAP45 did not localise to structures that resemble IMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g007">Fig 7</xref>), suggesting that there is a defect in the assembly or trafficking of the IMC in delayed death parasites. The normal localisation of GAP45 was restored with GGOH recue treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Importantly, secretory trafficking pathways remain intact in the second IDC following indolmycin or clindamycin treatment, as demonstrated by normal export of ring-exported protein 1 (REX1) to the iRBC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). The prenylation-dependent mislocalisation of Rab5a to the cytosol and putative disruption of Rab11a cargo delivery suggests that these trafficking proteins lose their normal association with target biological membranes during delayed death, consistent with the inactive or unbound form of these Rab GTPase proteins.</p>

<title>Indolmycin-induced delayed death increases osmotic fragility of iRBC</title>
<p>Because indolmycin treatment produces severe disruption of the morphology of the DV and haemoglobin trafficking apparatuses, we examined potential physiological effects from disrupted feeding that may contribute to delayed death. Intraerythrocytic parasites progressively internalise and digest host-derived haemoglobin to 1) acquire amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref042">42</xref>], 2) increase the available space within the iRBC into which the parasite can grow into [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref043">43</xref>], and 3) catabolise and expel excess host protein to mitigate the increased colloid-osmotic pressure caused by parasite growth within the iRBC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref045">45</xref>]. Aberrant haemoglobin uptake induced by indolmycin treatment might kill parasites by disrupting these homeostatic mechanisms.</p>
<p>To determine whether the cellular homeostasis that maintains osmotic pressure is disrupted in indolmycin-treated parasites, we measured osmotic fragility. The propensity for iRBCs to haemolyse in varying hypotonic solutions was measured using a modified method described in Mauritz and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref045">45</xref>] and Dennis and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref046">46</xref>]. Indolmycin-treated parasites showed an increase in osmotic fragility relative to untreated iRBC at all tonicities assayed in the second IDC after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). The half-maximal lytic concentration for indolmycin treated parasites increased significantly by 22.3% (<italic>n</italic> = 4, SD ± 6.07) (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05, two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Like other experiments described above, restoration of prenylation by rescue with GGOH restored measurements of osmotic fragility to those of untreated iRBCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g008">Fig 8A and 8B</xref>). This supports the suggestion that disruption of protein prenylation by indolmycin treatment reduces the capacity of treated parasites to internalise and degrade host-derived haemoglobin and that this has a profound effect on the physiology of the parasite and its host cell, likely contributing to growth arrest and delayed death.</p>

<title>Uncoupling ubiquinone and dolichol contributions during third IDC arrest</title>
<p>Restoring protein prenylation in delayed death using GGOH rescue treatment demonstrates that the proximate cause of delayed death is a defect in protein prenylation. However, even when rescued by GGOH, these polyprenol-rescued parasites are still unable to survive a third IDC following treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000376.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) suggesting that additional causes of parasite death arise from disruption of another isoprenoid pathway. Ubiquinone (or Co-enzyme Q) is the principle and essential electron acceptor for electron transport in mitochondrion. Ubiquinone inserts into the inner membrane of the mitochondrion by its isoprene tail. In blood-stage <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, the mitochondrion’s primary function is to provide electrons for use by dihydroorotate dehydrogenase, an essential metabolic enzyme required for pyrimidine biosynthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref047">47</xref>]. To determine whether disruption of ubiquinone contributes to third IDC arrest in polyprenol-rescued parasites, we used a transgenic parasite expressing <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> (yeast) dihydroorotate dehydrogenase (yDHODH). The yDHODH enzyme uses fumarate as an electron acceptor and is independent of ubiquinone for pyrimidine biosynthesis and hence uncouples blood-stage <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>’s dependence on mitochondrial electron transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref047">47</xref>]. Although these transgenic yDHODH parasites are slow growing, in asexual blood stages, they are resistant to inhibition that results in mitochondrial perturbations.</p>
<p>Parasites expressing yDHODH were not innately protected from second IDC arrest after indolmycin treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g009">Fig 9</xref>). This suggests that isoprenoid disruption of parasite DHODH is not the cause of delayed death and indeed causes no further insult in the second IDC after indolmycin treatment even after the initial insult of disruption of protein prenylation. Furthermore, indolmycin-treated yDHODH parasites supplemented with GGOH were not protected in the third IDC after treatment. This result indicates that arrest in the third IDC after treatment cannot be attributed either to disruption of parasite DHODH or protein prenylation. The remaining known fate for isoprenoids in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> is in the synthesis of dolichols, so <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> survival during the third IDC following indolmycin treatment is likely co-contingent with dolichol biosynthesis from isoprenoid precursors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Apicoplast-located isoprenoid precursor biosynthesis is essential for parasite survival, but the downstream effects on parasite cellular processes brought about by loss of apicoplast function have not been elucidated. We hypothesised that second IDC arrest in delayed-death parasites arises from a defect in the apicoplast that ablates IPP biosynthesis, which lethally effects parasite cellular processes by depressing the turnover of essential isoprenoid products: prenyl groups, ubiquinone, or dolichol. We refer to the cessation of de novo isoprenoid biosynthesis and exhaustion of available products as an isoprenoid fatigue. Furthermore, we aimed to dissect the temporal contribution of disrupting each of these pathways in delayed death to define the hierarchy of causes for parasite growth arrest. Here, we argue that the proximate cause of delayed death is the depletion of prenyl substrates required for protein prenylation, precipitating functional disruptions to intracellular trafficking, IMC assembly, DV biogenesis, and perturbing cellular homeostasis.</p>
<p>Disruption of prenylation-dependent processes generates parasite abnormalities that are apparent by the trophozoite stage, with diminished haemoglobin turnover and aberrant DV morphology. However, treated parasites branch their mitochondrion as usual during the trophozoite stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref048">48</xref>] and transition to early schizont stages, completing multiple rounds of nuclear division (e.g., Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g007">7</xref>). This, combined with the finding from the metabolomic analyses of gradual depletion of isoprenoids during the second cycle, suggests that the effect of ablating protein prenylation by isoprenoid depletion is cumulative rather than immediate. This interpretation is consistent with the findings by Chakrabarti and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref032">32</xref>], who showed through labelling experiments that most prenlyation occurs during the trophozoite to schizont transition, and Nallan and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref049">49</xref>], who showed that prenyl-transferase inhibitors arrest parasites at the trophozoite stage. Our data suggest that delayed death overlaps with but is distinct from phenotypes induced by fosmidomycin-mediated inhibition of IPP biosynthesis during the terminal cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref030">30</xref>]. Fosmidomycin is an inhibitor of the MEP/DOXP pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref033">33</xref>], and fosmidomycin treatment leads to a sudden arrest in IPP biosynthesis and parasite death at a similar life stage, albeit in the first IDC with treatment, coincident with disruption of prenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref030">30</xref>]. If fosmidomycin were added early enough in the cycle, we anticipate that it would also produce comparable effects on haemoglobin turnover DV morphology in the same cycle. In contrast, delayed-death drugs have no noticeable effect on the abundance or function of the apicoplast MEP/DOXP biosynthetic enzymes. Instead, we propose that delayed-death drugs lead to a gradual expenditure of residual IPP in the second IDC—following the loss of the apicoplast—that eventually lead to the loss of prenylation.</p>
<p>A pair of recent labelling experiments reveals a limited number of prenylated proteins that are likely defective in delayed-death parasites. Fewer than 20 prenylated proteins have been identified, predominantly Rab GTPases, with canonical and putative roles in vesicular membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref028">28</xref>]. The restricted prenylome of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> compared to other higher eukaryotes indicates that prenylated proteins have relatively few roles in regulating parasite cellular processes. These restricted roles are consistent with our observation of only limited morphological and metabolic aberrations in parasites unable to synthesis new prenyl groups.</p>
<p>The temporary rescue of the prenyl-dependent delayed defects by GGOH (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g008">8</xref>) confirms the metabolomic finding that apicoplast-generated IPP is used for higher isoprenoid compounds, and their depletion is the proximate cause of delayed death. The short-chain length prenyl groups FPP and GGPP are the substrates for prenyl-transferases that covalently modify protein by attaching prenyl moieties to cysteine residues at the carboxyl terminus of target proteins. The successful rescue from delayed death by the polyprenol analogue GGOH but not FOH is consistent with delayed death being dependent on prenylation of the <italic>Plasmodium</italic>-Rab GTPases, which possess C-terminal prenylation motifs that predict attachment of geranylgeranyl rather than farnesyl moieties, which were identified as possessing GGPP tags in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> prenylomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref028">28</xref>].</p>
<p>Prenylated Rab GTPases are master coordinators of intracellular vesicular trafficking. Rabs act as molecular switches to regulate membrane rearrangements and facilitate vesicle budding, motility, and fusion by recruiting effector proteins in their GTP-bound state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref050">50</xref>]. The prenyl modifications of Rab proteins are predicted to mediate their anchoring to the lipid bilayer of endomembranes. Chemical or genetic ablation of the prenyl modification on Rab5a or FYVE-containing coiled–coil protein (FCP; localised to the DV) leads to the mislocalisation of these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref039">39</xref>], demonstrating that prenylation is necessary for correct protein function. We found that Rab5a mislocalised during delayed death and that this coincided with a haemoglobin trafficking defect. Previous conditional inactivation of Rab5a alone did not recapitulate this phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref039">39</xref>], suggesting that the disruption of multiple prenylated proteins in the delayed-death parasites are responsible for the perturbation of cytostomes and DV biogenesis. Consistent with our observation, blockade of isoprenoid biosynthesis by fosmidomycin specifically disrupts the ultrastructure of the DV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref030">30</xref>]. Our study suggests that multiple proteins in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, prenylated using apicoplast isoprenoids, are essential for normal DV development and by extension metabolism of host haemoglobin.</p>
<p>We also found that IMC assembly, previously shown to require vesicular trafficking by the prenylated Rab11a, was disrupted during early schizogony. The mature IMC marker GAP45 has been colocalised to Rab11a-positive vesicles, indicating a role for Rab11a in trafficking IMC proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref040">40</xref>]. Hence, we hypothesise that mislocalisation of Rab11a in delayed death could directly inhibit IMC assembly. Indeed GAP45, which associates with membranes via N-terminal myristylation and palmitoylation rather than prenylation, was also mislocalised in treated parasites, suggesting that overall assembly of the IMC is compromised in delayed death. This is supported by the failure of delayed-death parasites to segment into merozoites during second IDC arrest, as confirmed by light microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g002">Fig 2C</xref>).</p>
<p>Haemoglobin degradation is integral to parasite homeostasis, and disequilibrium of this metabolic pathway likely contributes to delayed death in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>. The parasite faces two physiological challenges as it grows within an iRBC: obtaining sufficient space and maintaining osmotic pressure. In human RBCs, haemoglobin comprises 95% of the total protein in the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref043">43</xref>]. As the parasite grows, its volume increases, but the average total volume of the enclosing iRBC remains largely unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref052">52</xref>]. To achieve this, the parasite must internalise RBC cytoplasm by endocytosis and reduce the RBC contents. One reason for mitigating total iRBC volume expansion could be to prevent the volume of an iRBC increasing such that it surpasses its lytic volume and prematurely haemolyses (or is cleared by the spleen).</p>
<p>Aside from spatial restrictions, the uptake and turnover of host haemoglobin is thought to play an important role in mitigating increasing osmotic stress on an iRBC as the parasite grows [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref045">45</xref>]. The metabolically active trophozoite stage of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> massively increases the permeability of the iRBC membrane, inducing the expression of the new permeation pathways (NPPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref053">53</xref>]. However, the net osmotic gain of this change should be sufficient to cause the iRBC to haemolyse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref054">54</xref>]. The parasite must therefore compensate by reducing the osmotic influx of water by decreasing the colloid–osmotic pressure exerted by proteins within the cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref045">45</xref>]. In effect, the parasite ingests and proteolyses host haemoglobin to amino acids that it can release across the iRBC membrane via the NPPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref055">55</xref>]. We therefore hypothesise that disruption of haemoglobin internalisation and metabolism in delayed-death parasites must increase the osmotic fragility of the iRBC. Consistent with this, iRBCs treated with indolmycin did haemolyse more readily in hypotonic solutions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g008">Fig 8</xref>), suggesting that prenylation-dependent trafficking defects do perturb osmolyte homeostasis. This may be even more pronounced during the turbulence experienced during an in vivo infection, but such haemolysis is difficult to measure. Our results would suggest that liver-stage–derived merozoites with defective apicoplasts will also lack appropriate prenylation and likely succumb in a similar manner to blood-stage delayed-death parasites.</p>
<p>The delayed-death effect observed in <italic>Plasmodium</italic> also has implications for understanding the similar phenotype in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. As in <italic>Plasmodium</italic>, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> relies on the apicoplast for isoprenoid synthesis, albeit with additional isoprenoid scavenging from the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref019">19</xref>]. We anticipate that prenyl-dependent defects brought about by apicoplast delayed death also impact endocytosis in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> and likely disrupt feeding. However, there is not a direct 1:1 orthologue match for all pairs of <italic>Plasmodium</italic> and <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> Rabs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref038">38</xref>], and the digestion of haemoglobin in the <italic>Plasmodium</italic> vacuole in particular has no obvious direct cognate in <italic>Toxoplasma</italic>. Unlike <italic>Plasmodium</italic> blood stages, <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> tachyzoites are also dependent on their apicoplast for fatty acid biosynthesis, and this probably creates additional differences in the mechanism of <italic>Toxoplasma</italic> delayed death.</p>
<p>Disrupting isoprenoid biosynthesis perturbs several downstream cellular processes, and we sought to dissect how perturbation to each pathway contributes to delayed death. Disruption of protein prenylation represents the proximate cause of delayed death during the second IDC after treatment with a plastid inhibitor. However, arrest in the third IDC following treatment implies that isoprenoid fatigue also lethally perturbs other isoprenoid pathways in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic>, i.e., synthesis of the ubiquinone isoprenoid-sidechain and dolichols. Using GGOH-rescued parasites, we uncoupled the essential role of protein prenylation from the contribution of isoprenoid products ubiquinone or dolichol. We determined that the yDHODH parasite line remained sensitive to second IDC arrest following indolmycin treatment and that cotreatment with GGOH was insufficient to protect parasites further. IPP provided by the apicoplast would normally be incorporated into dolichols required for GPI anchor biosynthesis, but this pathway is not rescued by GGOH. The essential contribution of dolichols and thus GPI-anchored proteins to establishment of a third IDC likely therefore explains the inability of GGOH to provide a longer-lasting rescue.</p>
<p>Taken together, we can now establish a timeline for cellular processes subject to isoprenoid fatigue that leads to parasite arrest in delayed death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000376.g010">Fig 10</xref>). The indolmycin-treated parasite completes its first IDC normally but transmits a defective apicoplast to its progeny. This apicoplast may be capable of producing some isoprenoid precursor at the start of the second IDC, but this capacity wanes over the early stages of the cycle, and the isoprenoid products necessary for generating prenyl groups become depleted. Without available prenyl groups, nascent trafficking proteins are no longer modified by prenylation and mislocalise, losing their functionality. Haemoglobin trafficking, inner membrane complex formation, and merozoite membrane biogenesis all require effective protein prenylation; during delayed death, these processes are perturbed, which leads to second IDC parasite arrest. If parasites are treated with the polyprenol substrate GGOH, protein prenylation is recovered and parasites survive and segment. However, even in the presence of GGOH, parasites are unable to progress through a complete third IDC, likely due to disruption of dolichol mediated GPI synthesis and/or ubiquinone electron transport, which are not chemically rescued by GGOH.</p>

<title>Multifaceted disruption of protein prenylation by isoprenoid fatigue during delayed death.</title>
<p>(1) IPP is synthesised by the apicoplast to produce the prenyl-group GGPP. Protein substrates are modified by prenylation through the covalent attachment of one or more prenyl groups to their C-terminal cysteine residues. Prenylated proteins in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> have canonical roles in endomembrane vesicle trafficking. (2) The early endosome marker Rab5a is a prenylated protein in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> putatively involved in haemoglobin-containing vesicle trafficking to the parasite DV. Depletion of IPP during delayed death disrupts protein prenylation and Rab5a mediated vesicle trafficking to the DV. (3) Prenylated Rab11a facilitates the assembly of the IMC by trafficking cargo, including the IMC protein GAP45 to the IMC during merozoites segmentation. Depletion of IPP during delayed death disrupts the formation of the IMC. DV, digestive vacuole; GAP45, glideosome-associated protein 45; GGPP, geranylgeranyl pyrophosphate; IMC, inner membrane complex; IPP, isopentyl pyrophosphate.</p>

<title><italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> culture</title>
<p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>falciparum</italic> 3D7 parasites were maintained in continuous culture with minor modifications to the method described by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref056">56</xref>]. Briefly, parasites were cultured in human O+ RBCs (leukocyte-depleted by filtration, provided by the Australian Red Cross Blood Service) at 2% haematocrit in RMPI-1640 supplemented with 25 mM sodium bicarbonate, 25 mM HEPES, 150 μM hypoxanthine, 20 μg/mL gentamicin, and 0.5% (w/v) Albumax II (Invitrogen) (complete medium). Cultures were maintained in flasks and petri dishes inside a sealed container filled with a low oxygen malaria-mix gas (1% O<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 94% N<sub>2</sub>) at 37°C with or without mechanical shaking.</p>
<p>Synchronised ring-stage cultures were obtained by double (14-hr interval) treatment with 5% (w/v) D-sorbitol during the parasite’s IDC prior to experimentation, and a single sorbitol treatment of ring-stage parasites immediately prior to experimentation. Alternatively, 0–4 hpi ring-stage parasites were generated by first enriching for schizonts using a custom magnetic separation apparatus described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref057">57</xref>], incubating the enriched parasites with fresh RBCs for 4 hrs, and then treating the newly invaded RBCs with 5% (w/v) D-sorbitol.</p>

Samples with equivalent parasitemia were collected and 1×10<sup>8</sup> RBCs per conditions were centrifuged at 14,000 g for 30 seconds (4°C), washed with 1 mL of ice-cold phosphate buffered saline (pH 7.4), centrifuged again and the cell pellet extracted with 200 μL of 80% (v/v) acetonitrile (in water containing 5 μM <sup>13</sup>C-aspartate as the internal standard). The cell extracts were rapidly resuspended, vortexed and then centrifuged at 14,000 g for 10 min at 4°C. The metabolite extract was transferred to an MS vial and LC-MS analysis was preformed using methods previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000376.ref058">58</xref>], with an Agilent Q-TOF mass spectrometer 6550 operating in negative ESI mode.

<title>Z-stack from serial block-face scanning electron microscopy of delayed death parasites.</title>
<p>Enriched trophozoite-stage parasites were collected for reduced osmium fixation 72–78 hrs post drug administration (equivalent to 28–32 hpi in the second IDC after treatment). Samples were imaged by SEM and subsequently trimmed 50 nM by automated diamond knife before reimaging. Imaging was repeated hundreds of times and parasite structures were manually traced for IMOD analysis. IDC, intraerythrocytic developmental cycle.</p>
