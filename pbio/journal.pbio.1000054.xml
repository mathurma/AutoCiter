        <p>Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells display two evolutionarily conserved features: an invariant T cell receptor (TCR)α (iTCRα) chain and restriction by the nonpolymorphic class Ib major histocompatibility complex (MHC) molecule, MHC-related molecule 1 (MR1). MR1 expression on thymus epithelial cells is not necessary for MAIT cell development but their accumulation in the gut requires MR1 expressing B cells and commensal flora. MAIT cell development is poorly known, as these cells have not been found in the thymus so far. Herein, complementary human and mouse experiments using an anti-humanVα7.2 antibody and MAIT cell-specific iTCRα and TCRβ transgenic mice in different genetic backgrounds show that MAIT cell development is a stepwise process, with an intra-thymic selection followed by peripheral expansion. Mouse MAIT cells are selected in an MR1-dependent manner both in fetal thymic organ culture and in double iTCRα and TCRβ transgenic RAG knockout mice. In the latter mice, MAIT cells do not expand in the periphery unless B cells are added back by adoptive transfer, showing that B cells are not required for the initial thymic selection step but for the peripheral accumulation. In humans, contrary to natural killer T (NKT) cells, MAIT cells display a naïve phenotype in the thymus as well as in cord blood where they are in low numbers. After birth, MAIT cells acquire a memory phenotype and expand dramatically, up to 1%–4% of blood T cells. Finally, in contrast with NKT cells, human MAIT cell development is independent of the molecular adaptor SAP. Interestingly, mouse MAIT cells display a naïve phenotype and do not express the ZBTB16 transcription factor, which, in contrast, is expressed by NKT cells and the memory human MAIT cells found in the periphery after birth. In conclusion, MAIT cells are selected by MR1 in the thymus on a non-B non-T hematopoietic cell, and acquire a memory phenotype and expand in the periphery in a process dependent both upon B cells and the bacterial flora. Thus, their development follows a unique pattern at the crossroad of NKT and γδ T cells.</p>

          <p>White blood cells, or lymphocytes, play an important role in defending the body from infection and disease. T lymphocytes come in many varieties with diverse functions. Mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells constitute a subset of unconventional T lymphocytes, characterized by their invariant T cell receptor (TCR)α chain and their requirement for the nonpolymorphic class Ib (MHC) molecule, MR1. MAIT cells are extremely abundant in human blood and mucosae. Contrary to mainstream T cells, their development requires B cells and commensal microbial flora. To shed light on the little-understood MAIT cells, we used new tools, including an antibody that we recently developed to detect human MAIT cells, and we were able to show that MAIT cell development is a stepwise process, with an intra-thymic selection followed by peripheral expansion. We show that thymic selection is MR1 dependent but requires neither B cells nor the commensal flora, which are both necessary for the expansion in the periphery. In contrast with the other evolutionarily conserved invariant subset, the natural killer T (NKT) cells, we found that MAIT cells exit the thymus as “naïve” cells before becoming antigen-experienced memory cells and expanding in number to represent a significant 1%–4% of peripheral T cells in human blood. In mice, we found that MAIT cells remain naïve and do not expand substantially. We conclude that MAIT cell development follows a unique scheme, where, unlike NKT cells, MAIT cell selection and expansion are uncoupled events that are mediated by distinct cell types in different compartments.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Unconventional T cells include several T cell receptor (TCR)αβ<sup>+</sup> major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class Ib restricted, as well as TCRγδ<sup>+</sup> subsets in both mice and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b002">2</xref>]. They usually display tissue-specific location and are endowed with “natural memory” phenotype and functions, such as the ability to mount rapid responses in the face of a pathogenic challenge. Several pathways of development have been described for these T cell subsets, which show various degree of dependency from the thymus as well as variable requirement for their restricting MHC molecule. At one end of the spectrum, natural killer T (NKT) cells are selected, expand, and acquire their innate-like phenotype and functions in the thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b004">4</xref>]. On the other hand, unconventional (type b) intra-epithelial lymphocytes (IEL) ontogeny can show minimal dependency upon the thymus, as they can escape the thymus at a very early stage and migrate into the gut mucosa where they achieve maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b005">5</xref>]. They may even develop directly from bone marrow-derived precursors in specific intestinal lymphoid aggregates called cryptopatches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b007">7</xref>]. Interestingly, both NKT and type b IEL development, phenotype, and functions are seemingly independent from any exogenous antigens such as those derived from the intestinal bacterial flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b010">10</xref>]. Finally, it has been recently demonstrated that mouse T10/T22-restricted γδ T cells are able to mature and exit the thymus in the absence of their selecting element, but that thymic selection endows them with a memory phenotype and new effector functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>Among unconventional T cells, only two subsets display both a TCR and selecting MHC class Ib molecules highly conserved between species, the NKT cells and the mucosal-associated invariant T (MAIT) cells (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b012">12</xref>]). Indeed, these two populations express highly restricted TCR repertoires consisting of an invariant TCRα chain (mouseVα14/humanVα24-Jα18 for NKT cells; and mVα19/hVα7.2-Jα33 for MAIT cells). Both subsets are selected by hematopoietic cells expressing evolutionarily conserved nonpolymorphic MHC class Ib molecules, encoded in humans in a MHC paralogous region on Chromosome 1: CD1d for NKT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b013">13</xref>] and MHC-related molecule 1 (MR1) for MAIT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]. NKT cells accumulate in the liver and the spleen, independently of the presence of any exogenous stimuli such as the normal bacterial flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b008">8</xref>], while MAIT cells accumulate primarily in the intestinal lamina propria (LP), in a process dependent on the commensal flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]. MAIT cell function is unknown, but the unusual features of these cells and their evolutionary conservation suggest an important role at the interface between innate and adaptive immunity, probably in the intestinal immune system.</p>
      <p>For NKT cells, the molecular basis of their specific development begins to be unraveled: contrary to mainstream T cells and γδ T cells, NKT cell development requires the integrity of the SLAM/SAP/fyn pathway with the involvement of homotypic interactions of SLAM receptor family members and CD1d expression on CD4<sup>+</sup>/CD8<sup>+</sup> (DP) thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b015">15</xref>]. Consequently, NKT cells are absent in mice and humans deficient in the molecular adaptor SAP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b019">19</xref>]. In addition, mouse and human NKT cells specifically express the ZBTB16 transcription factor very early on during their development and the absence of this factor in luxoid mice leads to a quasi-disappearance of the NKT cells as only a very few number of naive NKT remains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b021">21</xref>].</p>
      <p>Little is currently known about MAIT cell development. They are absent from <italic>nude</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b022">22</xref>], but MAIT cells are not in sufficiently large number in the thymus for detection by highly sensitive reverse transcription-(RT)-PCR methods in either humans or wild-type (wt) mice ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b022">22</xref>] and unpublished data). Previous studies on MAIT cell selection have been based on the measure of the number of these cells in the periphery (in the mesenteric lymph-node [MLN] and in the LP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]. MAIT cell development does not require expression of their selecting element on thymus epithelial cells, but the presence of MR1 on B cells is probably necessary for accumulation of MAIT cells in the gut LP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]. It is therefore unclear whether MR1-dependent selection of MAIT cells really occurs in the thymus, and if so, whether B cells and/or the bacterial flora are required for MAIT cell development in the thymus or peripheral accumulation in the gut.</p>
      <p>Herein, we investigated MAIT cell development in both humans and mice. In humans, we used an anti-Vα7.2 monoclonal antibody (mAb) generated in our laboratory to track normal unmanipulated MAIT cells. MAIT cells are rare and display a naïve phenotype both in human thymus and cord blood, while they are abundant and show a homogeneous memory/effector-like phenotype in the blood of all healthy subjects tested. In mice, the over-expression of one of the TCR chains was sufficient to increase the frequency of MAIT cells in central and peripheral lymphoid organs in an MR1-dependent manner. Fetal thymic organ culture (FTOC) and phenotypic studies of the thymus in these mice demonstrated that MAIT cells are selected in the thymus in the absence of B cells and bacterial products. However, most mouse MAIT cells remained naïve in the periphery. The complementary data obtained from humans and mice indicate that MAIT cells are exported from the thymus as naïve cells and subsequently become memory and expand, following interactions with B cells and the commensal flora, in an SAP-independent manner. Thus, MAIT cells use a developmental pathway distinct from both known unconventional T cell subsets and mainstream T cells, showing that they represent a unique subset with its own features.</p>

        <title>Frequency and Phenotype of Vα7.2 Expressing T Cells in Human Blood</title>
        <p>As MAIT cells are defined by the use of an invariant iVα7.2-Jα33 TCRα chain, we developed a monoclonal antibody (3C10) recognizing the TCRα Vα7.2 segment by immunizing Balb/c mice with a recombinant Vα7.2-Jα33/Vβ13 recombinant protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We then used this antibody to measure the number of cells expressing the Vα7.2 segment in blood T cells from healthy donors by assessing the proportion and phenotype of 3C10<sup>+</sup> cells in the CD4, CD8β and DN subsets of CD3<sup>+</sup>/TCRγδ<sup>neg</sup> lymphocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Most 3C10<sup>+</sup> DN (which also includes CD8αα cells) T cells were also found to display strong expression of the CD161 (NKRP1A) marker, and the percentage of 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> T cells in the DN + CD8αα subset (40.3 ± 21%, m ± SD; range = 1–98%) was very high. In CD8β T cells, the proportion of 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells was variable but significant (7.8 ± 5.5%; 0.2–26.3), while within CD4 T cells, the proportion of 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells was low (0.34 ± 0.34%; 0–1.4), with only a minority of 3C10<sup>+</sup> T cells also expressing CD161. Reverse transcription (RT)-PCR and polyclonal sequencing of Vα7.2-Cα amplicons obtained from the different FACS-sorted subsets showed that the canonical iVα7.2-Jα33 sequence segregated with the 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg001">Figure S1</xref> and unpublished data). The presence of 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>neg</sup> CD4 and CD8β T cells with no canonical sequence expression demonstrates that 3C10 monoclonal antibody (mAb) is not a clonotypic antibody, but is instead specific for the Vα7 segments, which can be used by mainstream T cells. We were surprised to observe that a significant proportion of CD8α<sup>+</sup>/3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>+</sup> T cells also expressed the CD8β molecule, in conflict with our previous findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b022">22</xref>]. However, a careful analysis showed that the MFI for CD8β in 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> T cells was only one-quarter to one-sixth that in 3C10<sup>−</sup>/CD161<sup>−</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that we missed this subset of cells in our previous FACS-sorting experiments. Interestingly, no such difference in MFI was seen for CD8α (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that at least some of the CD8αβ<sup>+</sup>/3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>+</sup> MAIT cells also express the CD8αα molecule. These results show that MAIT cells can be identified as 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> T cells, and confirm that they are abundant within the DN and CD8αα<sup>+</sup> subsets, and scarce in the CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell subset. However, a large number of these cells may also express an intermediate level of CD8αβ.</p>

        <title>MAIT Cells Are Present in the Human Thymus</title>
        <p>We used the aforementioned staining strategy to assess the presence of MAIT cells in the human thymus, and observed some 3C10<sup>+</sup> DN or single-positive CD8β and CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, upper panels). However, by contrast to what was observed with blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, lower panels), most of the 3C10<sup>+</sup> cells in the thymus did not express CD161. To assess the identity of these cells, we quantified Vα7.2-Jα33 amplicons in sorted CD161-positive and CD161-negative DN, CD4 and CD8β 3C10<sup>+</sup> thymocytes, using CD161<sup>neg</sup>/CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD161<sup>+</sup>/DN blood 3C10<sup>+</sup> T cells as negative and positive controls, respectively. In two of the three thymuses studied we found a small excess of Jα33 usage (8%–12%) in the CD161<sup>neg</sup> 3C10<sup>+</sup> thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). By contrast, Jα33 was used by 50% to 100 % of the few 3C10<sup>+</sup>/ CD161<sup>hi</sup> DN thymocytes in the two thymuses containing 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> T cells. Almost half of this small number of 3C10<sup>+</sup>/CD161<sup>hi</sup> cells had a naïve (CD45RO<sup>lo</sup>, CD45RA<sup>+</sup>, CD27<sup>+</sup>) phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) ruling out the possibility of blood contamination or recirculating cells.

        <p>MAIT Cells Ontogeny in Mice Transgenic for the iVα19 TCRα, MAIT Cell Vβ6 TCRβ Chains or Both</p>
        <p>Mice have very few MAIT cells and the lack of an antibody specific for the invariant mVα19 TCRα chain precludes the direct analysis of MAIT cells in vivo or ex vivo. We therefore generated mice expressing an invariant mVα19-Jα33 TCRα chain transgene (Tg). A detailed analysis of these mice and their phenotype are provided as supporting information (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg003">Figure S3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sd001">Text S1</xref>). As also shown by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b023">23</xref>], the transgenic over-expression of the invariant TCRα chain induces a clear MR1-dependent bias in Vβ chain segment usage towards Vβ6 and Vβ8, reproducing the MAIT cell repertoire of our iVα19 T-T hybridoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b022">22</xref>]. Comparison of Vβ6/Vβ8 bias in the presence or absence of MR1 provided us with an estimate of T cell selection by MR1: at least 50% of the T cells in these mice are MR1 restricted (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg003">Figure S3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg003">S3</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sd001">Text S1</xref>). As shown by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b023">23</xref>] and in the Supporting Information (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg003">Figure S3</xref>C) MR1-restricted T cells are found in the thymus of iVα19 Cα<sup>−/−</sup> Tg mice as indicated by a MR1 dependent Vβ6 and/or Vβ8 bias observed in all CD4/CD8/DN T cell subsets.</p>
        <p>The forced transgenic expression of a TCRα chain greatly modifies T cell ontogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b025">25</xref>]. We therefore used an alternative strategy based on the transgenic expression of a Vβ6<sup>+</sup> TCRβ chain from one of the iVα19 T-T hybridoma. As shown previously for mainstream T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b026">26</xref>] and NKT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b027">27</xref>], the frequency of the iVα19-Jα33 TCRα chain was increased in these mice in a MR1-dependent manner (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg003">Figure S3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sd001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>To further increase the proportion of MAIT cells and to decrease the unwanted TCR specificities due to the endogenous TCRβ chains, we crossed the TCRα Tg and TCRβ Tg mice together in the presence or absence of MR1. The thymuses of the resulting mice were a little smaller than those of wt, in both backgrounds (53 mean [M] ± 26, ± standard deviation [SD], <italic>n =</italic> 15). In the presence of MR1, the mature thymocytes (TCR<sup>hi</sup>/HSA<sup>lo</sup>) were in low numbers in comparison with B6 mice and were mostly DN and CD8 with a concomitant reduction in the CD4 T cell subset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In the absence of MR1, the frequency and number of mature (TCR<sup>hi</sup>/HSA<sup>lo</sup>) thymocytes decreased by a factor of six to eight, indicating that MR1-restricted MAIT cells are present in the thymus of the MR1<sup>+</sup> TCRαβ double Tg mice. Importantly, peripheral T cells from these mice strongly up-regulated CD69 expression when cocultured with murine MR1-transfected fibroblasts, confirming that these cells are indeed reactive towards MR1 (S. Huang, EM, S. Kim, L. Yu, CS, et al., unpublished data).</p>

Both DN and CD8 T cells displayed a Vβ6 and Vβ8 bias that was dependent on MR1 expression as shown by the significant decrease in Vβ6 (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.023 and 0.002 for DN and CD8, respectively) and Vβ8 (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.0001) expression in the absence of MR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

        <title>Monoclonal MR1-Dependent MAIT Cells Are Found in the Thymus in the Absence of B Cells</title>
        <p>We have previously shown that accumulation of MAIT cells in the periphery depends on the presence of B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]. In contrast with the presence of around 1% B cells in adult thymus, no CD19<sup>+</sup> cells were detected in the FTOC (unpublished data), suggesting that B cells may not be necessary for thymic MAIT cell selection. To further address the role of B cells in MAIT cell ontogeny, we crossed the iVα19 TCRα and Vβ6 TCRβ Tg lines onto a RAG<sup>−/−</sup> background, thereby generating mice producing monoclonal MAIT cells in the absence of B cells. In the presence of MR1, the thymus was extremely small (4–6 × 10<sup>5</sup> cells) with very few mature (TCRβ<sup>hi</sup>/HSA<sup>lo</sup>) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, left upper panel), which were either DN or CD8, and only a minimal number of CD4 T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, left lower panel).

        <p>The periphery of MR1<sup>−/−</sup> RAG<sup>−/−</sup> TCRαβ double Tg mice was almost completely devoid of mature T cells (1.5 ± 0.5 × 10<sup>3</sup>, m ± standard error [SE], <italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, upper left panel, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">4</xref>C), whereas in the presence of MR1 only a small subset of T cells was found in the MLN (1.3 ± 0.5 × 10<sup>5</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 7), blood or spleen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">Figure 4</xref>B upper right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">4</xref>C, and unpublished data).

The transfer of either MR1− or MR1<sup>+</sup> B cells into MR1 deficient hosts allowed a clear expansion of the T cells, which however remains in low numbers (5.5 ± 1.3 × 10<sup>4</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 3 and 5.4 ± 1.8 × 10<sup>4</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 5, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, lower middle and right panels, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This expansion, which was similar with MR1<sup>−</sup> and MR1<sup>+</sup> B cells, could either be related to some trophic effect of the B cells or to the modifications of the lymphoid organs they induced. By contrast, when MR1<sup>+</sup> B cells were transferred into MR1<sup>+</sup> RAG<sup>−/−</sup> αβTCR double Tg mice, we found much higher number of T cells (1 ± 0.26 10<sup>6</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 10) in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">Fig 4</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g004">4</xref>C, and unpublished data). However, MR1 deficient B cell transfer also induced some T cell expansion (3.4 ± 0.8 × 10<sup>5</sup>, <italic>n</italic> = 8) in the periphery of the MR1<sup>+</sup> TCRαβ double Tg mice. Thus, noncognate interactions (or MR1-independent cognate interactions with membrane molecules exclusively expressed by B cells) between MAIT and B cells might be sufficient to allow MAIT cell expansion. Alternatively, the MR1neg B cells may have captured some MR1 molecules from the MR1<sup>+</sup> hosts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b030">30</xref>] as they are in a “sea” of MR1<sup>+</sup> cells. However, the much larger number (8-fold with MR1<sup>+</sup> B cells versus 2.7-fold with MR1<sup>−</sup> B cells) of MAIT cells found after the transfer of B cells into MR1<sup>+</sup> RAG<sup>−/−</sup> αβTCR double Tg mice suggests that cognate interactions are likely involved.</p>
        <p>Therefore, in mice where MAIT cells are selected in the thymus but do not expand in the periphery, the adoptive transfer of MR1<sup>+</sup> B cells is sufficient to promote their accumulation. Interestingly, in all cases MAIT cells acquired a memory (CD44<sup>hi</sup>) phenotype after transfer of B cells (unpublished data). The acquisition of a memory phenotype might be related to a “homeostatic” expansion due to the sudden provision of selecting niches. In any cases, although it could be argued that the splenocyte mixture we injected contains both B cells and other cell types, such as dendritic cells or macrophages, the latter are already present in the host mice before transfer and are obviously not able to induce the peripheral accumulation of MAIT cells. We can therefore formally conclude that B cells are necessary to allow MAIT cells accumulation in the MLN of these monoclonal Tg mice, either through survival, expansion, and/or addressing of MAIT cells to the intestinal territory.</p>

        <title>Human Cord Blood Contains Naive MAIT Cells</title>
        <p>The accumulation of murine MAIT cells in the intestinal compartment also requires the presence of the commensal flora [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]. The generation of MAIT cells in FTOC in the absence of exogenous ligand suggests that the commensal flora is necessary not for thymic selection but for the migration and/or peripheral expansion of MAIT cells. We investigated this issue in humans by studying the presence and the phenotype of MAIT cells in immunologically naïve cord blood. The number of CD161<sup>hi</sup>/3C10<sup>+</sup> MAIT cells was small but measurable in cord blood DN and CD8β T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Polyclonal sequencing of sorted CD161<sup>hi</sup>/3C10<sup>+</sup> DN cord blood lymphocytes confirmed the presence of the canonical sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Strikingly, unlike their adult counterparts, these cord blood MAIT cells displayed a naïve (CD45RA<sup>hi</sup>/CD27<sup>hi</sup>/CD45RO<sup>lo</sup>) phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g005">Figure 5</xref>B), making the possibility of a materno-fetal transfusion highly unlikely and demonstrating the presence of naive MAIT cells in human cord blood. Altogether, these results suggest that MAIT cells acquire CD161 expression right before (or concomitantly to) their exit from the thymus, and remain naïve until birth. Colonization with commensal bacteria after birth induces the expansion and/or final maturation of MAIT cells in the periphery.</p>

        <title>Mouse MAIT Cells Display a Naïve Phenotype</title>
        <p>We next addressed the question of the naïve/memory status of mouse MAIT cells, which are in much lower number than human MAIT cells. Indeed, in the different Tg mice studied above, the DN and CD8 mature thymocytes are mostly naïve (CD44<sup>lo</sup>/CD122<sup>lo</sup>), while the low numbers of CD4 T cells are constantly CD44<sup>hi</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). As shown and discussed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg005">Figure S5</xref>, some of the Vβ6<sup>+</sup> CD4 T cells found in iVα19 Tg mice are not MR1 restricted but classical MHC class II dependent. To avoid this confounding variable and to increase the proportion of MR1 restricted T cells, we crossed our Tg mice to TAP<sup>−/−</sup>Ii<sup>−/−</sup> double KO mice, which, being devoid of classical MHC molecules, would select lower number of mainstream T cells. In the absence of classical MHC molecule (Cα<sup>−/−</sup>TAP<sup>−/−</sup> Ii<sup>−/−</sup>), the MLN T cells found in the iVα19/Vβ6 double Tg mice displayed a naive (CD44<sup>lo</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g005">Figure 5</xref>B) and CD122<sup>lo</sup> (unpublished data) phenotype. In the absence of MR1, the proportion and the number of CD8 T cells greatly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g005">Figures 5</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg008">S8</xref>A) and some increase in CD44 expression was observed with a concomitant increased usage of endogenous Vβ segments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000054-sg008">Figure S8</xref>B). These results suggest that, in the absence of MR1, pairing of the iVα19 TCRα chain with endogenous TCRβ chains allows selection and peripheral expansion. The proportion and the phenotype of the few CD4 T cells found in these mice remained unchanged in MR1<sup>+</sup> or MR1<sup>−</sup> mice indicating that many of these cells were not MR1 dependent.</p>
        <p>To further address the question of the naïve/memory phenotype of MAIT cells, we sorted CD44<sup>hi</sup> and CD44<sup>lo/int</sup> T cell subsets from the MLN of TAP<sup>−/−</sup>/Ii<sup>−/−</sup> (to enrich in MAIT cells) and Vβ6 Tg mice on a MR1<sup>+</sup> or MR1<sup>−/−</sup> background and quantified the amount of iVα19 transcripts. In both strain of mice, we found that the iVα19 transcripts largely segregated in the CD44<sup>lo/int</sup> fraction, confirming that wt polyclonal MAIT cells indeed display a naïve phenotype in mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g005">Figure 5</xref>D).</p>
        <p>Altogether, these results indicate that murine MAIT cells, like their human counterparts, are selected by MR1 in the thymus without acquiring a memory phenotype. However, they remain naïve in the periphery, even in the presence of B cells and the commensal flora. The difference in number and phenotype of MAIT cells between humans and mice might then be related to the absence of peripheral expansion in the latter.</p>

        <title>Molecular Basis of the Distinct Requirement for MAIT Cells and NKT Cells Development</title>
        <p>Contrary to mainstream T cells, NKT cells express the ZBTB16 transcription factor from the first stage of their differentiation in the thymus. In mice deficient for this transcription factor, NKT cells remain naïve, do not expand, and do not colonize the effector organs such as the liver but are found in small numbers in the LN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b021">21</xref>]. The transgenic forced expression of ZBTB16 controlled by a CD4 promoter induces an effector phenotype in conventional CD4 T cells, indicating that ZBTB16 expression is probably the result of the productive interaction of the iVα14 TCR with CD1d and is responsible for the effector/memory phenotype of NKT cells. The only T cell subset expressing the ZBTB16 transcription factor in addition to the NKT cells was the human MAIT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b021">21</xref>]. However, we found that mouse MAIT cells did not express ZBTB16 in the periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), in accordance with their naïve phenotype. Thus, in contrast with NKT cells, which express ZBTB16 at the early stages of their thymic selection/expansion, ZBTB16 expression in MAIT cells is not related to their selection process. The expression of this transcription factor in MAIT cells is probably linked to an activation step followed by the acquisition of a memory phenotype and peripheral expansion.</p>

        <p>Although both NKT cells and MAIT cells are selected on hematopoietic cells, the former subset expands and acquires a memory phenotype within the thymus, whereas MAIT cells seemingly show a more conventional selection process. We sought to investigate the molecular basis for this divergence by studying the SAP-dependency of MAIT cells development. Indeed, CD1d-restricted NKT cells ontogeny involves signaling through the SAP/Fyn/NF-κB signaling pathway, which is triggered by homotypic interactions between SLAM family molecules expressed both on developing NKT cells and selecting cortical thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b015">15</xref>]. We therefore measured the number of MAIT cells in five SAP-deficient patients: whereas no Vα24 NKT cells could be found in these patients, as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b031">31</xref>], MAIT cells were present in normal numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g006">Figure 6</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g006">6</xref>C), indicating a probable lack of involvement of the SLAM/SAP/Fyn pathway in MAIT cell development. Interestingly, ZBTB16 was normally expressed by MAIT cells from SAP-deficient patients, confirming that the SLAM/SAP/Fyn pathway is not involved in the induction of this transcription factor expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Thus, MAIT cell development clearly diverges from CD1d-restricted NKT cells, despite their common selection on hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>].</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>MAIT cells constitute a new subset of MHC class Ib-restricted T lymphocytes conserved among mammals. In this study, we provide for the first time, to our knowledge, phenotypic data on human MAIT cells. We show that they can be tracked by costaining with an anti-Vα7 antibody (3C10) and CD161, allowing us to assess their frequency in the peripheral blood of healthy subjects. Blood MAIT cells are numerous (at least one order of magnitude higher than NKT cells), in accordance with our previous estimates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b022">22</xref>]. As previously published, a majority of MAIT cells display a CD4<sup>−</sup>CD8<sup>−</sup> (DN) or CD8αα phenotype, but few of them are CD4<sup>+</sup>. We now show that MAIT cells can express intermediate levels of CD8αβ, which were missed in our first characterization. The low level of CD8αβ expression may allow developing CD8αβ<sup>+</sup> MAIT cells to escape negative selection. These data imply that selection of MAIT cells is independent of coreceptors, but that an Ag-driven process induces differential expansion of the different subsets, as also suggested by the differences in Vβ usage between DN/CD8 and CD4 T cells in the MLN and LP of iVα19 TCRα Tg mice.</p>
      <p>Two other groups have generated iVα19 TCRα Tg mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b033">33</xref>]: in only one of these studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b023">23</xref>], the comparison was made between MR1<sup>+</sup> and MR1-deficient backgrounds allowing the distinction between selection-driven features and those related to the transgenic artifact. Our results are similar in terms of organ cellularity, CD4/CD8/DN subset distribution, and Vβ6/8 bias. The careful study of the phenotype of our mice in the different background allowed us to show that MAIT cells are DN and CD8 and not much CD4. We also observed no significant expression of NK1.1, CD25, CD69, or ICOS on the T cells of iVα19 or Vβ6 single or double Tg mice (unpublished data). Moreover, we studied the phenotype of wt murine MAIT cells and found that NK1.1 is expressed on &lt;30%–50 % of MAIT cells from the LP of wt C57Bl/6 mice (unpublished data). Most significantly, unmanipulated human MAIT cells express none of these markers, given that CD161 (NKR-P1A) is not the human ortholog of NK1.1 (NKR-P1B/C in B6 mice). The differences observed between our mice and those studied in previous investigations are probably due to experimental procedures, such as differences in the transgenic vectors used or to differences in the commensal flora of different animal facilities as MAIT cells require commensal flora to expand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]. In any case, we believe that these markers, including NK1.1 in particular, cannot be used to reliably track MAIT cells in vivo.</p>
      <p>We have previously shown that MAIT cells accumulate in the MLN and the gut LP. However, MAIT do not accumulate in sufficient numbers in the thymus of wt mice to be detectable by sensitive reverse transcription (RT)-PCR methods, precluding the possibility to discriminate between intra-thymic selection per se and peripheral expansion. Moreover, it has been suggested recently that the development of some unconventional intra-epithelial lymphocyte (IEL) T cell populations requires a functional thymus but actually takes place in the gut mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b007">7</xref>], while T10/T22-restricted γδ T cells can mature and migrate in the periphery in the absence of thymic selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b011">11</xref>]. Herein, we demonstrate for the first time, to our knowledge, that MAIT cells are indeed selected in the thymus in an MR1-dependent manner, but that B cells and bacteria are not required for their initial intra-thymic generation, whereas both are necessary in the periphery for MAIT cell expansion. Therefore, MAIT use a unique stepwise developmental pathway that is distinct from both NKT and conventional T cells.</p>
      <p>Our data clearly demonstrate that B cells are not the selecting cells in the thymus, but are necessary for the accumulation of MAIT cells in the MLN and LP, by promoting either expansion, survival, and/or addressing to the gut compartment. We have previously shown that MAIT cells are selected on non-T hematopoietic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b014">14</xref>]; therefore our data implicate most probably myeloid cells such as macrophages or dendritic cells in intra-thymic MAIT cell selection.</p>
      <p>Recent data from Bendelac and coworkers and from our own lab show that MAIT cells and NKT cells exclusively share the expression of the transcription factor PZLF (ZBTB16) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b021">21</xref>], emphasizing a close lineage relationship between these two distinct subsets. However, the data presented in this paper nonetheless describe profound differences during the ontogeny of these two populations. We clearly show that MAIT cell selection is not accompanied by activation (as is the case with NKT cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b035">35</xref>]), since it does not lead to local expansion and acquisition of a memory phenotype. Accordingly, ZBTB16 was not expressed by mouse MAIT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g006">Figure 6</xref>A), which display a naïve phenotype while human MAIT cells acquired ZBTB16 together with a memory phenotype after birth. It has been also shown recently that the ontogeny of NKT cells is heavily dependent upon homotypic interactions between SLAM family members and the SAP signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b015">15</xref>]. We show here that MAIT cells development is apparently unaffected by SAP mutations in humans, and this might be related to the fact that postselection MAIT cells display a naïve phenotype in both humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) and mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). In agreement with the mouse data showing that SAP deficiency does not prevent the expression of the ZBTB16 molecule at the early stages of NKT ontogeny, ZBTB16 expression in MAIT cells was unaffected in SAP deficient patients.</p>
      <p>The absence of ZBTB16 expression by mouse MAIT cells could be related to the cleanness of the animal facilities, which would not provide the ligand or inflammatory context necessary for MAIT cell expansion. Alternatively, one key genetic component may be missing in mice because of the genetic bottleneck that laboratory mouse strains have been through without selection pressure by the putative function mediated by the MAIT cells. Finally, how ZBTB16 expression is acquired in the thymus by NKT cells and in the periphery by human MAIT cells is an open question. It is probably related to the context of the interactions between the iTCR and the selecting element.</p>
      <p>The acquisition of a memory phenotype by human MAIT cells after birth is most likely linked to the colonization of the gut (and other mucosae) with the commensal flora. We speculate that B cells provide the link between the gut bacterial flora and MAIT cells. Direct or indirect (via epithelial cells or dendritic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b037">37</xref>]) interactions between B cells and bacteria in the gut could either induce MR1 expression and/or endow B cells with specific costimulatory properties, akin to the SLAM-mediated costimulation of developing NKT cells. However, the absence of ZBTB16 expression, and the concomitant naïve phenotype of mouse MAIT cells implicate that some other signals are required for their full innate-like differentiation. The dependency upon bacteria of MAIT cell expansion provides another example of the strong mutualism between the commensal flora and the development of the mammalian immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b038">38</xref>].</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we show here that besides their similarities, MAIT cell ontogeny is clearly different from NKT cells. Postselection NKT thymocytes already display innate-like properties, with a high frequency and a memory phenotype, whereas postselection MAIT cells are still naïve and need contacts with both B cells and bacteria to expand, acquire a memory phenotype in human, and accumulate in the gut. In this respect, they may be compared to Vδ2<sup>+</sup> T cells, which appear in blood as naïve but become memory soon after birth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000054-b040">40</xref>]. The striking high frequency of MAIT cells in the blood of healthy subjects suggest that they play a prominent role in various diseases, either of infectious, tumoral, or auto-immune origin.</p>

Using this template, L. Teyton (SCRI) generated a recombinant heterodimeric protein, which was used to immunize Balb/c mice. After fusion with SP2/0, hybridoma specifically staining a high proportion of CD3<sup>+</sup> DN and a proportion of CD8α but few CD4 T cells were selected and cloned. The 3C10 hybridoma was chosen for further characterization because, according to quantitative PCR, the Vα7.2-Jα33 TCRα chain segregated with the 3C10 positive fraction in DN T cells. When transfectants expressing different mouse TCRα and TCRβ chains and a chimeric human iVα7.2-mouse Cα were stained with the 3C10 supernatant, only transfectants harboring the Vα7.2 segment displayed positive staining demonstrating that 3C10 was not an anti-TCRβ chain antibody (unpublished data). Quantitative PCR analysis of the 3C10<sup>+</sup> and 3C10<sup>−</sup> fractions using primers for all Vα segments, demonstrated the absence of significant cross-reactivity between the 3C10 mAb and other Vα segments (unpublished data). The 3C10 antibody was biotinylated and detected with streptavidin PE-Cy7 (BD Pharmingen).</p>

        <p>Flow cytometry was performed with directly conjugated antibodies (BD Pharmingen) according to standard techniques with analysis on FACS Aria and LSRII flow cytometers (Becton Dickinson). DAPI and a 405-nm excitation were used to exclude dead cells. The following antibodies, mostly from BD Pharmingen or eBiosciences, were used in mice: anti-CD45.2-Fitc (104), anti-CD3ε-PC7 (145–2C11), anti-CD5-APC (Ly-1), anti-Vβ6-PE (RR4–7), anti-CD44-PE or APC (IM-7), anti-CD45.1-PE (A20), anti-βTCR-PC5 (H57–597), anti-CD19-PE, Fitc or APC-Cy7 (1D3), anti-CD8α-APC-Cy7 (Ly-2), and anti-CD4-PE-Texas Red (L3T4).</p>
        <p>For human stainings, the following were used: anti-CD4-APC-Cy7 (RP4-T4), anti-CD3ε-Alexa 700 (UCHT1), anti-TCRγδ-PC5 (IMMU510), anti-CD8β-PE Texas Red (2ST8.5H7), anti-CD45RO-Fitc (UCHL1), anti-CD45RA-PE (HI100), anti-CD27-Fitc (M-T271), anti-CCR7-PE (150503), anti-CD62L-PE (Dreg 56), anti-CXCR6-PE (56811), anti-CD161-APC (DX12), and anti-CD8α-PE Alexa700 (RPA-T8).</p>
