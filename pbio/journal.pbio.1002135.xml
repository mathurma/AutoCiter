<article-title>Adenosine Signaling and the Energetic Costs of Induced Immunity</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Immune defense is energetically costly, and thus an effective response requires metabolic adaptation of the organism to reallocate energy from storage, growth, and development towards the immune system. We employ the natural infection of Drosophila with a parasitoid wasp to study energy regulation during immune response. To combat the invasion, the host must produce specialized immune cells (lamellocytes) that destroy the parasitoid egg. We show that a significant portion of nutrients are allocated to differentiating lamellocytes when they would otherwise be used for development. This systemic metabolic switch is mediated by extracellular adenosine released from immune cells. The switch is crucial for an effective immune response. Preventing adenosine transport from immune cells or blocking adenosine receptor precludes the metabolic switch and the deceleration of development, dramatically reducing host resistance. Adenosine thus serves as a signal that the “selfish” immune cells send during infection to secure more energy at the expense of other tissues.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The immune response is energetically costly and often requires adaption of the whole organism to ensure it receives enough energy. It is not well understood how distribution of energy resources within the organism is regulated during an immune response. To understand this better, we used parasitoid wasp infection of fruit fly larvae—the host larvae have 48 h before they pupate to destroy the infecting “alien” or face destruction by the parasitoid that will consume the developing pupa. Here we find a signal, generated by the host immune cells, which mediates a systemic energy switch. This signal—adenosine—suppresses processes driving larval to pupal development of the host, thereby freeing up energy for the immune system. We show that the resulting developmental delay in the fruit fly larvae is crucial for an efficient immune response; without the adenosine signal, resistance to the parasitoid drops drastically. Generation of this signal by immune cells demonstrates that in response to external stressors, the immune system can mobilize reallocation to itself of energy and nutrients from the rest of the organism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Immune response is energetically costly [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. Immune cells, upon activation, favor glycolysis over oxidative phosphorylation for fast, albeit inefficient, energy generation and macromolecule synthesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. This metabolic shift requires extra glucose as glycolysis produces much less ATP than does oxidative phosphorylation [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. Therefore, at the organismal level, the energy shifts from storage and nonimmune processes towards the needs of the immune system [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Regulation of energy during the immune response is critical—full response requires a significant amount of energy, and inability to provide it with nutrients can lead to immune system suppression and reduced resistance [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In mammalian systems, the inflammatory cytokines TNF-α, IFN-γ, IL-1, and IL-6 are released upon recognition of the pathogen and, besides modulating immune functions, they also stimulate energy release [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Immune cells must respond rapidly to the activating signals, and thus they change their metabolism, which involves, at least in mammalian systems, the preferential use of aerobic glycolysis, known as the Warburg effect [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. The increased demand for energy by the immune system requires, both in vertebrates and invertebrates, adaptation of the whole organism, which is associated with an overall metabolic suppression and a systemic insulin resistance in all tissues except the immune cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. The importance of the systemic regulation of energy is demonstrated by examples of certain infections leading to depletion of energy reserves (wasting) and eventually death of the organism [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Despite the importance of the systemic regulation of energy, we have only fragmentary knowledge about the molecular mechanisms involved in the regulation of energy during immune response at the organismal level and about the communication between different parts of the organism mediating the shift of energy from storage and growth towards immunity [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>].</p>
<p>Extracellular adenosine (e-Ado) is a signal originating from damaged or stressed tissues. Acting as an energy sensor, e-Ado is released from metabolically stressed cells with depleted ATP [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>] or made from extracellular ATP leaking from damaged tissues [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>]. e-Ado then works as a local or systemic hormone, adjusting metabolism by acting either via adenosine receptors or by the uptake into the cells and conversion to AMP activating AMP-activated protein kinase (AMPK) [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. These actions lead to a suppression of energy consuming processes [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] and to a release of energy from stores [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
<p>Damaged tissues and metabolically stressed cells are very likely to occur during immune response and thus it is not surprising that elevated levels of e-Ado are also detected, for example, during sepsis in humans [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The capacity of e-Ado to regulate energy metabolism, to “measure” the level of tissue and organismal stress, and to adapt the energy use to the actual situation all make e-Ado a perfect candidate for an energy regulator during immune response. However, the mode of e-Ado action under immune challenge is unclear, as the role of e-Ado in energy regulation has mainly been studied in relation to anoxia in anoxia-tolerant organisms such as turtles and hypoxia and ischemia in rodent models and human patients [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>], while e-Ado has thus far been associated with mammalian immune response only through its immunomodulatory and anti-inflammatory function [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>].</p>
<p>We, and others, have previously shown that adenosine regulatory and signaling network in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is similar to mammalian systems [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>]. In addition, we have shown that e-Ado regulates energy metabolism in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Increase of e-Ado levels caused by a deficiency of adenosine deaminase-related growth factor A (ADGF-A) leads to hyperglycemia and reduced energy storage [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. We have also found that the regulation of e-Ado by ADGF-A is particularly important during parasitoid wasp infection in <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae; ADGF-A is strongly expressed in immune cells that encapsulate the invading wasp egg [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. These findings further support a potential role of e-Ado in energy regulation during immune response.</p>
<p>Here, we use the parasitoid wasp infection as a model to study the energy regulation during immune reaction. Parasitoid wasps inject their eggs into <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, and if the fly larva does not destroy the egg in time, the hatched wasp larva will consume the host [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. The fly larva recognizes the egg and mounts a robust immune response that involves proliferation and differentiation of specialized immune cells, lamellocytes, which eventually encapsulate the parasitoid egg. Using this immune response as a model, we traced the dietary glucose destinations, measured selected metabolites and gene expressions, and analyzed host resistance and the impact of the immune response on its development.</p>
<p>We describe here the systemic changes in energy metabolism during the immune challenge and the role of e-Ado in the regulation of these changes. We have found that e-Ado, released from the immune cells, mediates a metabolic switch characterized by the suppression of nutrient storage and developmental growth in favor of the immune defense. This metabolic switch—a tradeoff between development and defense—is crucial for the resistance to infection. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae lacking adenosine signaling, development is not suppressed, and the resistance dramatically drops.</p>

<title>Immune Response to Parasitoid Wasp Egg</title>
<p>The endoparasitoid wasp <italic>Leptopilina boulardi</italic> injects its egg in early third-instar <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva. The egg, usually hiding in gut folds, is first recognized by the host-circulating hemocytes (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and the recognition triggers immune response [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. This involves production of specialized cells called lamellocytes (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g001" ref-type="fig">1B</xref>) within the first 24 h postinfection (hpi; 0 hpi is the time of infection and corresponds to 72 h after egg laying; the time in hpi is also used for the uninfected control). Lamellocytes are then released into circulation, and the egg gets encapsulated with subsequent melanization by 48 hpi (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>). Production of lamellocytes involves a transient proliferation of prohemocytes in the lymph gland and their terminal differentiation into lamellocytes [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. The efficiency of egg encapsulation depends on the ability to produce lamellocytes and thus varies among different genetic strains of <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>]. Our model was based on the Canton S strain of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> bearing the <italic>w</italic><sup><italic>1118</italic></sup> mutation (hereafter <italic>w</italic>), which served as a control genotype in all our experiments (the term “control” is reserved hereafter for uninfected situations, i.e., control <italic>w</italic> means uninfected <italic>w</italic> larvae). On average, 42% of these <italic>w</italic> host larvae succeeded to destroy the wasp egg and 38% survived to adulthood while 42% parasitoids developed to adult wasps (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>).</p>

<title>Immune Response to Parasitoid Egg Invasion Demands Energy</title>
<p>Parasitoid-infected third-instar larvae experienced a 15% developmental delay, pupating on average 7 h later than uninfected controls (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>). Such a delay might result from redistribution of energy from development towards immune defense. We therefore examined various energy aspects during infection.</p>
<p>Without infection, circulating glucose was kept below 0.04 μg per μg protein (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Both the glycogen and triacylglycerol (TAG) stores kept increasing, while circulating and tissue trehalose levels remained steady (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). Trehalose is a nonreducing disaccharide source of glucose, which is liberated by the action of trehalase [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. To trace the fate of glucose, we employed dietary radiolabeled D[U-<sup>14</sup>C]-glucose. The glucose-derived <sup>14</sup>C became evenly distributed in the larvae among saccharides, proteins, and lipids (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>). About 84% of <sup>14</sup>C was found in developing tissues (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). We divided the organism here in a simplified way into the immune system (represented by cellular immunity, the most important defense against parasitoids, including circulating hemocytes and lymph gland), the circulation (hemolymph), and the rest of the tissues representing mainly development, growth, and energy storage.</p>

<p>The above effects were associated with hyperglycemia as indicated by elevated hemolymph glucose and <sup>14</sup>C at the expense of developing tissues (Fig <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">2A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">2C</xref>). Incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C into lipids and proteins (at the whole organism level) was also suppressed during infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), which was accompanied by down-regulation of specific glycolytic enzyme genes in the fat body (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). The diversion of metabolism from building energy reserves and from fat body glycolysis was thus in agreement with extra <sup>14</sup>C in the carbohydrate form and with the increase of circulating glucose and trehalose. Circulating trehalose peaked at 6 hpi (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) concomitantly with increased expression of a trehalose transporter in the fat body, the organ where trehalose is produced (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>).</p>
<p>At the same time, the immune cells changed their behavior during infection in the opposite direction, leading to increased energy consumption. Around one-tenth of <sup>14</sup>C is normally allocated to immune cells, leaving almost 90% to the rest of the organism, but immune cells demanded up to one-third of nutrients during immune response (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>). Expression of several glycolytic genes including lactate dehydrogenase <italic>Impl3</italic> (CG10160; FlyBase ID: FBgn0001258) increased both in the circulating hemocytes and in the lymph gland (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g003" ref-type="fig">3B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>). This resembled the glucose-demanding aerobic glycolysis, the Warburg effect, in activated mammalian immune cells. Both the lymph gland and the circulating hemocytes expressed elevated amounts of glucose transporter Glut1 (CG43946; FlyBase ID: FBgn0264574) and trehalose transporter Tret1-1 (CG30035; FlyBase ID: FBgn0050035) mRNAs (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). Interestingly, later during infection (12–18 hpi), the circulating hemocytes together with already differentiated lamellocytes strongly increased expression of both Tret1-1 and trehalase (CG9364; FlyBase ID: FBgn0003748) (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>). This suggests that differentiated immune cells preferentially uptake energy in the form of trehalose, which may be linked to the decline of circulating trehalose after 6 hpi (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). These results demonstrate a shift of energy distribution away from storage and growth, first towards circulating glucose and trehalose, and then towards the immune cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>).</p>

<title>e-Ado Signaling via AdoR Is Required for Hyperglycemia and Effective Immune Response</title>
<p>We have previously shown that e-Ado increases circulating glucose via adenosine receptor (AdoR; CG9753; FlyBase ID: FBgn0039747) signaling [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Here, we tested if e-Ado was involved in the observed effects of infection on the metabolic shift. While the circulating glucose increased more than 2-fold during infection in <italic>w</italic> larvae, this increase was suppressed in <italic>adoR</italic> (FlyBase ID: FBal0191589) mutant larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), indicating that AdoR was indeed necessary for the energy redistribution during infection. Therefore, we compared the number of lamellocytes as a measure of immune response. While <italic>w</italic> larvae produced 5–6 thousand lamellocytes by 24 hpi, the <italic>adoR</italic> mutants contained less than a third of this amount (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Yet the <italic>adoR</italic> mutants were clearly capable of differentiating functional lamellocytes that displayed normal morphology, expressed a lamellocyte-specific MSNF9&gt;GFP marker (FlyBase ID:FBtp0064497), and were capable of encapsulating the wasp egg (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s017" ref-type="supplementary-material">S16 Fig</xref>). Therefore, <italic>adoR</italic> larvae were impaired in efficiency or speed of lamellocyte production, and this corresponded with their reduced resistance against the parasitoid invasion relative to <italic>w</italic> larvae. Indeed, the <italic>adoR</italic> mutants were three times less successful at neutralizing the wasp eggs and surviving to adult flies (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>). Thus, AdoR signaling is crucial for effective immune defense against the parasitoid.</p>

<p>The impaired defense in the <italic>adoR</italic> mutants was not due to affected recognition of the wasp egg, as the number of plasmatocytes attached to the egg surface within the first few hpi was similar in <italic>w</italic> and <italic>adoR</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>). Therefore, we tested if shortage of energy could be the problem as suggested by failure to increase circulating sugar levels in <italic>adoR</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). When we fed these larvae a high-glucose diet (12% instead of the regular 5%), the hemolymph glucose significantly increased even without infection in both <italic>w</italic> and <italic>adoR</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>). This dietary treatment significantly increased the number of lamellocytes in the infected <italic>adoR</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), suggesting that it was the lack of energy causing inefficient differentiation of lamellocytes in the absence of AdoR.</p>
<p>Interestingly, adding glucose to the diet did not further increase the level of circulating glucose during infection. In fact, the increase induced by infection was greater than that achieved with dietary glucose (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4D</xref>), and consistently the number of lamellocytes in infected <italic>w</italic> larvae was the same on both diets (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). Since the glucose increase induced by the dietary treatment was not as high as the one induced by the infection, the number of lamellocytes in <italic>adoR</italic> did not reach, even on the high-glucose diet, the levels observed in <italic>w</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>). This suggests that the glucose available in circulation is the limiting factor for the lamellocyte differentiation.</p>

<title>AdoR Signaling Mediates the Metabolic Switch</title>
<p>Upon infection, more glucose was retained in the saccharide fraction in the <italic>w</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>), indicating that this glucose was available for energy needs of the immune response and less used for storage and growth.

This notion was supported by the relative distribution of <sup>14</sup>C among individual tissues (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). The distribution was the same in uninfected <italic>w</italic> and <italic>adoR</italic> animals. The incorporation of <sup>14</sup>C did not change at 6 hpi in infected <italic>adoR</italic> (as opposed to <italic>w</italic>), and the shift from storage and growth (red part) towards immune cells (blue part) was much smaller in infected <italic>adoR</italic> compared to <italic>w</italic> at 18 hpi (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Importantly, the comparison of relative distribution of <sup>14</sup>C into tissues was allowed by equal total uptake of <sup>14</sup>C-glucose from diet in <italic>w</italic> and <italic>adoR</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8 Fig</xref>).

<p>Upon infection, only the brain and imaginal disc complex and fat body of <italic>w</italic> larvae contained significantly less <sup>14</sup>C while hemolymph contained significantly more <sup>14</sup>C at 6 hpi (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>).

This is supported by the measurement of the wing imaginal disc growth. While the growth of discs was significantly delayed in <italic>w</italic> control upon infection, the delay did not occur in the <italic>adoR</italic> mutant (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>).

<p>At 18 hpi, all tissues were affected by infection, significantly increasing <sup>14</sup>C in immune cells and hemolymph and decreasing in the rest (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>).

<p>The missing suppression of development in <italic>adoR</italic> larvae resulted in shortage of energy available for the immune system as documented first by almost no increase of <sup>14</sup>C in the hemolymph at 6 hpi and then by much lower <sup>14</sup>C incorporation into the immune cells at 18 hpi compared to infected <italic>w</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5B</xref>). Weak suppression of nonimmune processes in the absence of AdoR may also be linked to the missing peak of circulating trehalose at 6 hpi (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>).

The trehalose peak probably serves as a reservoir for fast glucose production, which will be increasingly needed for immune defense. The rapid lamellocyte differentiation is lagging in <italic>adoR</italic> larvae, likely reflecting lower consumption of trehalose relative to <italic>w</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>

Among the tested combinations, only <italic>ENT2</italic> knockdown driven by <italic>Srp-Gal4</italic> (FlyBase ID: FBtp0020112) in cells of the hematopoietic lineage achieved a reduction in the number of lamellocytes that resembled the effect of <italic>adoR</italic> deficiency (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">4B</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">6A</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12</xref>). <italic>Srp-Gal4</italic> was expressed in all hematopoietic cells, including the circulating hemocytes and all cells of the lymph gland that also contained precursors of lamellocytes (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13 Fig</xref>).

<p><italic>ENT2</italic> mRNA was abundant in the lymph gland and brain but weakly expressed in circulating hemocytes and virtually undetected in the fat body (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6B</xref>).

<p>The results above suggest that Ado transport from immune cells, including the differentiating ones, is important for efficient lamellocyte differentiation. As in the case of <italic>adoR</italic> mutation (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>), the loss of lamellocytes was rescued by increasing dietary glucose in the <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A</xref>). Similarly to <italic>adoR</italic> mutation, <italic>ENT2</italic> knockdown in immune cells also cancelled changes in nutrient distribution that normally take place in infected <italic>w</italic> larvae; there was no peak of circulating trehalose at 6 hpi and no increase in circulating glucose (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). The partition of <sup>14</sup>C into saccharides, proteins, and lipids also resembled the pattern seen in <italic>adoR</italic> mutant larvae (compare <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref> with <xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref> with <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S14 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Together, the above data indicate that deficiency in e-Ado release and in its receptor, AdoR, consistently lead to the same failure of energy reallocation during immune challenge. Indeed, like loss of AdoR, knocking down <italic>ENT2</italic> also reduced the host resistance against wasp invasion (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>), while the normal developmental delay observed in <italic>w</italic> controls upon infection did not occur in <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). Interestingly, pupation occurred earlier in <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> compared to <italic>w</italic> or <italic>adoR</italic> animals even without infection (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>); the size of pupae was unaffected implying faster growth instead of precocious pupation of <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic>.</p>
<p>While glycogen storage was suppressed similarly upon infection in <italic>adoR</italic> mutant and <italic>w</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5E</xref>), there was no significant difference in glycogen content between infected and uninfected <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Even more apparent was the effect on lipid storage where the accumulation of TAG in the fat body was suppressed both in <italic>w</italic> and <italic>adoR</italic> but not at all in <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> larvae (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6G</xref>). Blocking Ado transport thus led to continued nutrient storage even upon immune challenge, suggesting that energy storage during infection might be regulated by e-Ado independently of AdoR.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>An overall metabolic suppression is a common host response to infection [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. A likely purpose for the suppression is to conserve energy for the immune response that is energetically costly [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The defense of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> larva against the parasitoid wasp requires a rapid production of specialized immune cells (lamellocytes) that encapsulate the parasitoid egg. This has provided us with a unique in vivo model to study the metabolic changes and their regulation during immune response. We show here that the production of lamellocytes is an energetically demanding process, and that a systemic metabolic switch is required for their effective differentiation. This switch includes (1) suppression of energy storage and developmental growth, (2) retaining more energy in circulation, and (3) increased consumption of energy by the immune system (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<p>Suppression of energy storage (glycogen and lipids) and suppression of growth, as documented by slower growth of imaginal discs, lead to a developmental delay. We show here that e-Ado is a signal mediating this metabolic switch. Blocking this signal then demonstrates that the metabolic switch is crucial for an effective immune response. Without this signal, development and growth proceed at a normal speed, thus reducing energy available to the immune cells. Insufficiency of immune cells due to the shortage of energy then leads to a drastically reduced resistance against the parasitoid. Experimental interference with e-Ado or its receptor, AdoR, thus demonstrates the importance of tradeoff between development and immune response, and identifies e-Ado as a signal responsible for the switch.</p>
<p>Blocking Ado transport from immune cells by knocking down the equilibrative nucleoside transporter ENT2 identified the differentiating immune cells as an important source of the signal for the metabolic switch. This suggests that the immune cells could autonomously regulate energy influx based on their acute needs. Ado is a fine sensor of the cellular energy state, as it becomes produced when the ATP:AMP ratio decreases [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. This scenario is appealing mainly because immune cells dramatically change their metabolism upon activation, leading to increased aerobic glycolysis akin to the Warburg effect [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>]. Our expression analysis of glycolytic genes, glucose and trehalose transporters, and <sup>14</sup>C uptake by immune cells suggested a similar behavior for the differentiating immune cells upon wasp attack. The ability to rapidly react to a metabolic stress could be why ENT2 is strongly expressed in the lymph gland and the brain, both privileged organs from the energy point of view.</p>
<p>AdoR signaling is important for the suppression of developmental growth. Normally, infection leads to lower consumption of energy by the brain and imaginal discs (later also by other tissues), but the consumption continues in <italic>adoR</italic>-deficient larvae as if they were uninfected. At the same time, AdoR signaling seems to lower glucose transport and to increase trehalose transport in the fat body as inferred from expression levels of the respective transporter genes. The fat body is the site where trehalose is produced from glucose [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]; trehalose is then released back to the hemolymph, and more so during infection. The <italic>adoR</italic> mutation causes a misbalance of glucose and trehalose transport in the fat body, causing more nutrients to be retained there. The effect of AdoR signaling on the fat body combined with the suppression of developmental growth leads to hyperglycemia that in turn ensures enough energy to supply the immune cells. If the growth suppression fails to occur, as in the <italic>adoR</italic> mutant, the immune cells are unable to compete with developing tissues that consume the majority of energy. By analogy to the selfish brain theory [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>], “selfish” immune cells may usurp energy to themselves by way of AdoR-mediated silencing of nonimmune processes. Our work thus brings experimental evidence and explains the molecular mechanism for recently published theoretical concept of selfish immune system [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, the AdoR signaling does not mediate the suppression of energy storage (glycogen and TAG) during infection. However, increasing glycogen and TAG stores in infected <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> larvae with blocked Ado transport from immune cells indicates that the storage suppression is also under e-Ado control but through an AdoR-independent mechanism. Such a mechanism, which needs to be further studied, may involve e-Ado uptake, conversion to AMP by adenosine kinase, and activation of AMPK [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>]. The <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> larvae proceeded faster through development not only during infection but even without infection when compared to control larvae. This suggests that the regulation of energy storage by e-Ado may play a role even during normal development.</p>
<p>e-Ado signaling was previously associated with regulation of hemocyte differentiation, and blocking the AdoR signaling was suggested to lower the differentiation in the lymph gland under noninfectious conditions [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>]. The hallmark of lamellocyte differentiation upon parasitoid wasp infection is the turning off the Jak-Stat signaling in the medullary zone of the lymph gland containing the prohemocytes [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. Expression of cytokine Upd3 (CG33542; FlyBase ID: FBgn0053542) is down-regulated, and the ratio of Jak-Stat receptor Domeless (CG14226; FlyBase ID: FBgn0043903) and its negative coreceptor Latran (CG14225; FlyBase ID: FBgn0031055) is switched upon wasp infection leading to turning off the Jak-Stat and to induction of lamellocyte differentiation [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. The expression patterns of <italic>Upd3</italic>, <italic>Domeless</italic> and <italic>Latran</italic> mRNAs normally and during infection are unaffected both in <italic>adoR</italic> and <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> (<xref rid="pbio.1002135.s016" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>), indicating that the induction of lamellocyte differentiation is functional in these lines. In addition, the lymph glands develop normally in both <italic>adoR</italic> and <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> ([<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] and <xref rid="pbio.1002135.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S17 Fig</xref>). Our results demonstrate that the <italic>adoR</italic> and <italic>Srp&gt;ENT2-RNAi</italic> larvae are capable of lamellocyte differentiation; they are just less effective, and the reason is most likely the lack of energy as indicated by the rescue of this phenotype with extra dietary glucose.</p>
<p>An important part of the global energy switch observed upon parasitoid invasion is the AdoR-mediated suppression of developmental growth. Although AdoR is relatively strongly expressed in imaginal discs [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], we do not know if it is the tissue-autonomous signaling of AdoR, or whether AdoR acts systemically on metabolism as AdoR is also strongly expressed in the larval endocrine glands and brain; both scenarios may apply simultaneously. It is known that the activation of adenosine receptor leads to metabolic suppression—at the individual cell level, the activation can inhibit growth of tumor cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], but it can also cause a systemic suppression during anoxia [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>] or torpor [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. Our work demonstrates that the AdoR-mediated suppression plays an important role also during immune response. It will be important to identify the target cells and signaling cascades mediating the observed suppression in future studies.</p>
<p>We show here that the metabolic switch is mediated by e-Ado and that the switch is crucial for an effective immune response. It is of interest to see if this e-Ado role is common to other organisms including humans. e-Ado plays the same role in energy regulation in flies and mammalian systems [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. For example, sepsis is associated with hyperglycemia and insulin resistance as well as with increased e-Ado [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], suggesting that e-Ado could indeed mediate the systemic metabolic switch in higher organisms. However, analyzing this role of e-Ado in mammals will be complicated by the existence of multiple adenosine receptors with partly contradicting functions [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>] and by diverse roles of e-Ado in immunomodulation [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, our study demonstrates that extracellular adenosine, released from immune cells, mediates a systemic metabolic switch leading to suppression of energy storage and developmental growth, thus leaving more energy to the immune cells. This switch is crucial for the effective immune response and blocking adenosine signaling drastically reduces host resistance to the pathogen. This may resemble a selfish brain theory in a way that the immune system, like the brain, is a privileged part of the organism, capable of suppressing energy consumption by other tissues in its own interest. Such a selfish immune system [<xref rid="pbio.1002135.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>] would use e-Ado as a signal to appropriate extra energy resources during immune challenge.</p>
