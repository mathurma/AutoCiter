<p>Avian influenza viruses show high genetic diversity, but give rise to pandemic human influenza strains which are much less diverse; we show that these contrasting degrees of viral diversity can be explained by both host (demography) and viral (environmental durability and mutability) factors.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Avian influenza viruses (AIVs) have been pivotal to the origination of human pandemic strains. Despite their scientific and public health significance, however, there remains much to be understood about the ecology and evolution of AIVs in wild birds, where major pools of genetic diversity are generated and maintained. Here, we present comparative phylodynamic analyses of human and AIVs in North America, demonstrating (i) significantly higher standing genetic diversity and (ii) phylogenetic trees with a weaker signature of immune escape in AIVs than in human viruses. To explain these differences, we performed statistical analyses to quantify the relative contribution of several potential explanations. We found that HA genetic diversity in avian viruses is determined by a combination of factors, predominantly subtype-specific differences in host immune selective pressure and the ecology of transmission (in particular, the durability of subtypes in aquatic environments). Extending this analysis using a computational model demonstrated that virus durability may lead to long-term, indirect chains of transmission that, when coupled with a short host lifespan, can generate and maintain the observed high levels of genetic diversity. Further evidence in support of this novel finding was found by demonstrating an association between subtype-specific environmental durability and predicted phylogenetic signatures: genetic diversity, variation in phylogenetic tree branch lengths, and tree height. The conclusion that environmental transmission plays an important role in the evolutionary biology of avian influenza viruses—a manifestation of the “storage effect”—highlights the potentially unpredictable impact of wildlife reservoirs for future human pandemics and the need for improved understanding of the natural ecology of these viruses.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Human populations have experienced several pandemics involving new subtypes of influenza virus over the past century. All of these pandemic strains contained gene segments that originated in wild birds, a host pool that supports a very large and genetically diverse array of influenza viruses. However, once an avian strain establishes itself within the human population, the genetic diversity of the resulting human subtypes is typically quite low compared to that of their avian counterparts. Here we compare the evolutionary dynamics of human and avian influenza viruses in North America and test different hypotheses that might explain these two contrasting evolutionary patterns. Our analysis shows that a combination of characteristics of the host (especially demography) and virus (such as durability in water and mutability) explains the diversity observed. Using a theoretical model, we show that the combination of the short lifespan of wild birds, and greater durability of viruses in aquatic environments, is key to maintaining the high levels of influenza diversity observed in wild birds.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Seasonal epidemics of influenza viruses are responsible for significant human morbidity and mortality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Cox1">[1]</xref>. Owing to their RNA makeup, evolution of influenza A viruses occurs rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Rambaut1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Worobey1">[3]</xref> and is an important driver of their epidemiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1">[5]</xref>. Over the past decade, there has been an extensive effort to understand the concurrent epidemiology and evolutionary trajectory of human influenza viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Arinaminpathy1">[7]</xref>, an approach termed “phylodynamics” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Grenfell1">[8]</xref>. Surprisingly, parallel analyses in wild birds, the natural reservoir of influenza viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Webster1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Olsen1">[10]</xref>, are lacking. Such analysis is particularly timely because of the recent recognition of H5N1 and H7N9 avian influenza viruses (AIVs) as pandemic threats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Chen1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Yu1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>The epidemiological and evolutionary histories of human and AIVs in North America from 1976–2001 are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1</xref>. In humans, seasonal influenza outbreaks exhibit substantial annual variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which is also reflected in shifting dominance of co-circulating subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Human influenza viruses exhibit very limited subtype diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), as defined by the number of serologically distinct hemagglutinin (H or HA) glycoprotein types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Webster1">[9]</xref>, where only H1 and H3 subtypes of influenza A viruses have significantly circulated since 1968 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Palese1">[15]</xref>. In addition to this paucity of subtypes, genetic diversity is also limited within H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) subtypes, as reflected in the slender trunk of the consensus phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1I and 1J</xref>).</p>

<p>These patterns in human influenza are consistent with “immune escape,” a phenomenon that has been suggested to be common in directly transmitted, immunizing pathogens with a short infectious period, in which antigenic evolution results in partial cross-immunity between strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Grenfell1">[8]</xref>. In contrast, influenza A viruses in avian populations exhibit a rich array of subtypes, with fully 13 of the known 18 HA subtypes isolated from North American birds over this time span (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). This pattern of higher subtype diversity through time is further enriched by higher genetic diversity within subtypes, for instance in H1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) and H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). Indeed, AIVs typically exhibit a scaled effective population size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which measures the phylogenetic diversity of the virus population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford1">[16]</xref>) that is an order of magnitude greater than for their human counterparts: We estimated <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be 7.0 y and 1.5 y, respectively, for H1 and H3 in humans and 38.7 y and 77.5 y in birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1E and 1F</xref>; as we show below, other avian subtypes also exhibit higher diversity than commonly observed in H1 and H3 human subtypes). Thus, although phylogenetic trees of H1 and H3 AIVs show some evidence of selection (immune escape) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Dugan1">[17]</xref>, they also document broad viral coexistence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1K and 1L</xref>).</p>
<p>The mechanistic origins of these differences remain unclear. Here, we propose the following nonmutually exclusive hypotheses as possible explanations: (1) The <italic>immunological hypothesis</italic> holds that more rapid loss of immunity and/or weaker heterologous cross-protection in birds than humans reduces competition among strains, leading to higher diversity; (2) the <italic>ecological hypothesis</italic> suggests that associations between virus lineages and avian host species diversity allow contemporaneous evolution within multiple bird species, sustaining an enriched gene pool; (3) the <italic>geographic hypothesis</italic> supposes that greater geographic isolation in birds than in humans leads to allopatric evolution; (4) the <italic>genetic hypothesis</italic> posits that mutation rate differences between avian and human viruses explains the disparity in viral diversity; (5) the <italic>demographic hypothesis</italic> focuses on the higher fecundity and shorter lifespan of birds compared to humans, which may mitigate the selective pressure of herd immunity via substantial recruitment of immunologically naïve individuals propagating the pathogen; and finally, (6) the <italic>epidemiological hypothesis</italic> predicts that there exists a long-lived environmental reservoir for avian strains, but not for human strains, facilitating coexistence of a broad spectrum of genetically, immunologically, and ecologically similar viruses.</p>
<p>To date, there have been no attempts to synthesize the available evidence for or against these different explanations. In this study, we address these hypotheses through a combination of statistical analysis of empirical covariates and epidemiological modeling to identify the most parsimonious explanation for the observed differences of HA genetic diversity between human and AIVs.</p>

<title>Results and Discussion</title>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Empirical Covariates of HA Diversity</title>
<p>We analyzed available AIV sequence data from GenBank for 11 HA subtypes from 1976–2013 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> as well as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S2) and developed a set of covariates reflecting specific predictions of the competing hypotheses. We sought to place these covariates on an equal footing and simultaneously to assess the contribution of each to HA diversity using a statistical model. Ordinary linear regression with a large number of covariates (of the same order as the number of observations) results in variance inflation, low statistical power, and issues of statistical identifiability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Tibshirani1">[18]</xref>. We therefore adopted a regularized regression method, known as elastic-net regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Friedman1">[19]</xref>, that solves this problem using a shrinkage estimator to trade off a small amount of bias for substantial reductions in the variance of estimated parameters. As a side effect of this estimation scheme, the resulting coefficients may be interpreted as evidence for or against the inclusion of a covariate (if the coefficient shrinks either to nonzero or zero, respectively). Furthermore, by normalizing covariates we can straightforwardly quantify and compare the relative size of each effect.</p>
<p>This regression analysis yielded the following conclusions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, sections S4.1–S4.3). As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref>, among AIV subtypes, each hypothesis we considered made a contribution towards HA genetic diversity, though the magnitude of effects varied considerably (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s018">Table S2</xref> for covariates values). Indeed, the strongest covariates were immune selective pressure (Hypothesis 1, quantified via the amino acid substitution rate) and the environmental durability of virions (Hypothesis 6, inferred by experimental incubation data on viral persistence), whose respective impacts were at least twice as big as the effects of nucleotide mutation rate (Hypothesis 4, quantified by multiplication of nucleotide substitution rate by the substitution rate at third position sites), geographic structure (Hypothesis 3, inferred by <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> that measures population differentiation through space), and host diversity (Hypothesis 2, characterized by Shannon Index of host species sampled).</p>

<p>Some of these results are not surprising. For instance, our finding concerning the modest contribution of host species diversity to HA genetic variation had previously been observed by Chen and Holmes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2">[20]</xref> and probably arises from frequent interspecies transmission. Similary, the impact of geographic structuring on gene flow among North American AIVs has been elegantly demonstrated elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Bahl1">[21]</xref>. The important novel result to emerge from our statistical analyses is the substantial contribution of virus durability to HA genetic diversity. This is a component of virus biology not previously considered in the study of AIV evolution. Thus, to better dissect how the durability of AIVs in the environment affects transmission dynamics and subsequently HA diversity and simultaneously to explore Hypothesis 5 (host demography), we constructed a mechanistic phylodynamic model.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Computational Model of Influenza Evolution</title>
<p>Our model is stochastic, seasonally forced, and agent-based <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Roche1">[22]</xref> and incorporates a one-dimensional antigenic space, where nonneutral mutations change antigenic phenotype from neighbor to neighbor, thus decreasing cross-immunity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S3) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Gog1">[23]</xref>. Crucially, our model allows the tracking of virus antigenic diversity and hence reconstruction of within-subtype digital phylogenies from model output (algorithm detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S3.3, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s007">Figures S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s008">S8</xref>), as summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Virus diversity is quantified in our model by the number of different antigenic strains at a given time and provides an analog to the diversity inferred by the scaled effective population size on genetic data. This model also enables assessing the role played by host demography (Hypothesis 5) on the maintenance of virus diversity. If these factors are to explain the observed differences between human and avian strains described above, then we expect to observe rapid population turnover and an absence of genetic diversity in a host population parameterized for humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford2">[24]</xref>, whereas a model parameterized for birds should show broad coexistence of viral strains (parameters are detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s019">Table S3</xref>). Because the modeling framework we adopt may give rise to either restricted or expansive antigenic diversity depending on epidemiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Gog1">[23]</xref>, the inferences one draws are not a result of prejudicial selection of model parameters or functional forms.</p>

The framework can accommodate multiple host species, but results presented in this study are from a single species model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S3). <italic>Illustration by John Megahan.</italic></p>

<p>An innovative aspect to this model is our formulation of transmission. AIV transmission has been thought to be predominantly fecal-oral, which has been considered as essentially direct because of (i) the proximity between susceptible and infected birds needed for infection and (ii) the scaling of transmission with the duration of infectivity. Furthermore, recent research points to direct bird-to-bird transmission via the respiratory route <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Kleijn1">[25]</xref>. Evidence is accumulating, however, to suggest that an additional transmission route is possible via long-lived viruses in environmental reservoirs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Hinshaw1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Roche2">[30]</xref>, effectively giving rise to a second (longer) time scale over which transmission can occur. This hypothesis is based in part on the routine isolation of AIVs from mud samples, soil swabs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Hinshaw1">[26]</xref>, unconcentrated lake water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Vong1">[31]</xref>, feathers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Delogu1">[32]</xref>, and the observation of prolonged virus durability in water <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Webster1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Terregino1">[36]</xref> and other media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Nazir1">[37]</xref>. Virus durability is commonly quantified by Rt, which is the time required to reduce infectivity by 90%, and may vary from a couple of days to several months <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1">[33]</xref>. Rt is determined both by physical environmental conditions, notably temperature, pH, and salinity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Webster2">[34]</xref>, as well as by subtype identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Brown2">[38]</xref>. Consequently, Hypothesis 6 suggests that environmental transmission could act on a distinctly longer time scale than direct fecal-oral transmission, thereby significantly impacting virus diversity and phylogenetic structure through frequent re-seeding of the avian virus gene pool, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s001">Figure S1</xref>.</p>
<p>To quantify the influence of Hypothesis 5 (host demography) on influenza virus diversity, we first parameterized our model to mimic the within-subtype dynamics of human influenza, assuming only direct transmission. Seeding simulations with only a few antigenic variants, we observed the continual replacement of a dominant strain by new antigenic variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), driven by selective pressure to escape herd immunity in the host population, as empirically observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford2">[24]</xref>. The direct measure of antigenic diversity generated by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3D</xref>; six antigenic strains coexist on average) is consistent with our estimates of scaled effective population size of human influenza (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1E or 1F</xref>). The resulting inferred phylogenetic tree from our model output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3G</xref>) is also “ladder-like,” characteristic of the strong immune escape signature observed in data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g001">Figure 1I or 1J</xref>).</p>

<p>We then addressed demographic explanations by exploring the impact of host biology alone, reparameterizing the model to take into account the reduced lifespan, increased fecundity, and seasonal breeding of birds compared with humans. Model output remained qualitatively unaffected, demonstrating continuous antigenic evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), with low-standing antigenic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3E</xref>; five strains coexist on average) and a slender trunk in the phylogenetic tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). Thus, in this model, host demographic properties alone do not strongly influence levels of genetic variation. In contrast, we found that the inclusion of environmental transmission dramatically increased standing antigenic diversity of AIVs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3C and 3F</xref>; 60 strains coexist on average), resulting in both immune selection and virus diversification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). The phylogenetic tree contains lineages that would have gone extinct in the absence of environmental transmission, demonstrating the punctuation of antigenic evolution with reintroduction of past dominant variants, to which there is little immunity in the population (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we carried out sensitivity analyses spanning the parameter space of the most common influenza systems, including swine and equine influenza (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We found that the long natural lifespan (and low fecundity) of free living mammalian hosts sustain the selective pressure exerted by herd immunity in the population on dominant strains. Indeed, in the presence of long lifespan and associated long-lived immunity, even substantial levels of environmental transmission do not dramatically increase antigenic diversity. Reduced host lifespan, however, leads to a faster turnover of the population, reducing the selective impacts of herd immunity. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>, it is the combination of high lifetime fecundity and environmental transmission that produces dramatic increases in genetic diversity and the coexistence of distantly related viral lineages. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref> (section S5, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s011">Figures S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s012">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s014">S14</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s015">S15</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s020">Table S4</xref>), we present results of sensitivity analyses to demonstrate the robustness of this broad conclusion to changes in assumed duration of immunity, the strength of cross-protection, the infectious period, direct transmission rate, and the mutation rate. This result also shows very little variation in stochastic realizations of the model.</p>

<p>Simulations were run for 50 y, with the first 10 y discarded as transients. We assumed a population size of 10<sup>4</sup> individuals, with no seasonality in demography or environmental durability. The <italic>z</italic>-axis corresponds to the mean antigenic diversity over the 40-y period. A decrease in environmental uptake rate (<italic>x</italic>-axis) dramatically reduces mean antigenic diversity (average of the number of strains) and switches the phylogenetic pattern from one that depicts broad coexistence to an immune escape profile. This switch in phylogenetic pattern is most pronounced when host lifespan (<italic>y</italic>-axis) is short. To estimate digital phylogenies, 100 strains were sampled over the last 25 y of simulations. Other parameters are as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3</xref>.

<title>Phylogenetic Signatures of Environmental Transmission</title>
<p>Four testable predictions arise from our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>), three of which can be explored using our existing data set. First, viruses with greater environmental durability are predicted to exhibit greater genetic diversity when host lifespan is short (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Second, increasing viral durability in the environment is predicted to facilitate the reintroduction of past virus variants and hence to correlate with the estimated time to the most recent common ancestor (TMRCA). Third, the variable nature of indirect transmission chains via the environmental reservoir <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Rohani1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Breban1">[40]</xref> is predicted to generate greater variability in branch lengths. Fourth, and finally, environmental transmission should increase the frequency of co-infection events between antigenically distant viruses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3J–L</xref>) and therefore the number of co-circulating subtype combinations.</p>

<title>Magnitudes of environmental durability of influenza subtypes and their consequences for evolutionary patterns observed in sequence data.</title>
<p>(A) Under natural physical conditions (temperature, 20°C; salinity, 0; pH 7.2, no seasonality), increased environmental durability (captured by Rt) is associated with higher scaled effective population size (linear relationship with a coefficient of 0.07 and a correlation coefficient of <italic>r</italic> = 0.65, <italic>p</italic> = 0.029). As shown in S5.4, assuming a seasonally weighted value of Rt does not change this association. (B) Environmental durability is correlated with tree height (the sum of branch lengths from the tip to the root), which indicates an increase in antigenic diversity (linear regression with a slope at 0.043, correlation coefficient of <italic>r</italic> = 0.75, <italic>p</italic> = 6.83×10<sup>−3</sup>). (C) The variance in branch lengths increases with virus durability, indicating variability in transmission time scales (linear regression with a coefficient of 0.16 and correlation coefficient of <italic>r</italic> = 0.68, <italic>p</italic> = 0.019). Confidence intervals show the 75% quantile in every panel. HAs for humans (H3), equines (H3), and swines (H1) are the most prevalent Hemagglutinin subtypes for these hosts.</p>

<p>We tested for the presence of the first association using phylogenies inferred for 10 different avian influenza HA subtypes isolated from North American wild birds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s022">Text S1</xref>, section S2). For comparison, we performed a parallel analysis of the most prevalent subtype observed in human (H3), equine (H3), and swine (H1) influenza viruses. Recalling that HA durability correlates with HA genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s010">Figure S10</xref>), we further observed that scaled effective population size (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) increases with HA durability either estimated at a fixed temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or averaged over a season (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s016">Figure S16</xref> and Table S15). Here, <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> represents the size of an idealized population corresponding to observed levels of genetic diversity, and τ represents the generation time of the virus. Because long-term transmission chains resulting from environmental durability should directly increase AIV generation time (the average time between infections), a correlation between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and experimentally measured environmental durability is evidence for the environmental transmission hypothesis. An increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001931.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is expected to impact the time it takes for the sampled viruses to coalesce to a common ancestor. Consistent with the second model prediction, we observed that TMRCA, quantified by tree height here, increased with HA durability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Third, we found that variance in branch lengths correlated with HA durability across subtypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), as predicted.</p>
<p>One final model prediction, that co-infection frequency should increase with environmental durability, is of great evolutionary relevance, as co-infection is necessary for reassortment, which may be a prerequisite to the evolution of pandemic strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Dugan1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Holmes2">[41]</xref>. Although co-infections are expected to occur infrequently and mainly between related strains in humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3J</xref>), environmental transmission in avian communities allows for substantially more frequent co-infections, especially between antigenically distant variants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3L</xref>). This is due to effects of environmental transmission increasing the propensity for co-infection (an empirically supported phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Sharp1">[42]</xref>), together with the high antigenic diversity generated by environmental transmission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To test this prediction, a regression of subtype-specific HA diversity against the entropy of associated NA subtypes failed to detect any significant relationship (<italic>r</italic> = 0.15, <italic>p</italic> = 0.65).</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>Our study identified the mechanisms that act to determine hemagglutinin genetic diversity in avian influenza viruses. In particular, the analyses reveal that our hypotheses act in concert to shape the phylodynamics of AIVs. These results are consistent with prior studies that have examined each mechanism in isolation. For instance, it has been shown that strong spatial structuring is an important factor in the phylogeography of these viruses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Bahl1">[21]</xref>. Similarly, the modest association between genetic diversity and host species number is known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Chen2">[20]</xref>. Although it is widely hypothesized that increasing antigenic evolution decreases genetic diversity across human subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Bedford3">[43]</xref> and between human and swine H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-DeJong1">[44]</xref>, our research has also demonstrated that increasing avian immune selective pressure acts to reduce influenza virus diversity.</p>
<p>Our most surprising empirical finding is that HA genetic diversity increases with virus durability, as measured in experimental assays, across AIV subtypes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001931-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The corresponding theoretical result is that, in short-lived hosts, increasing the frequency of environmental transmission results in greater equilibrium levels of viral genetic diversity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g004">4</xref>). Thus, both empirical and theoretical results suggest that environmental transmission acts in wild bird populations to increase avian influenza genetic diversity. As emphasized throughout, our results do not exclude a role for additional mechanisms (e.g., Hypotheses 1–3), but establish statistically that the size of the effects of subtype-specific amino acid substitution rates and environmental durability are largest.</p>
<p>Two limitations of this study warrant further investigation. First, a detailed understanding of cross-immunity remains an important empirical limitation to any study of avian influenza evolution. Establishing the duration and extent of protective immunity against heterotypic viruses, particularly, remains a priority. At present, comparative data to test this idea directly are lacking, although work showing the absence of immunity conferred by DNA subtype-specific vaccines to challenge strains from other subtypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Lee1">[45]</xref> suggests that the effect of cross-immunity will be limited. Second, our model assumed a one-dimensional strain space for the practical purpose of numerical tractability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Gog1">[23]</xref>. Future work should investigate the effects of incorporating other structures of cross-immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Ferguson1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Koelle1">[5]</xref> into epidemiological models of across-species influenza. Similarly, our findings show the relative importance of environmental persistence on phylodynamics of AIVs. Crucially, viral persistence may also occur in nonaquatic environments, including lake sediment, feathers, and feces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Hinshaw1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Delogu1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Nazir1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Elsewhere, it has been shown that the environmental reservoir can be a crucial source for sparking off annual outbreaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Rohani1">[39]</xref> and may have an impact on interannual AIV durability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Breban2">[46]</xref>. As we have demonstrated here, another consequence of this feature of AIV transmission is broad strain coexistence that is similar to an ecological phenomenon called the “storage effect” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Chesson1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-KelIy1">[48]</xref>. This effect has been identified for soil bacteria, where dormancy is thought to generate a high level of microbial diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Lennon1">[49]</xref>. Dramatically, one of the main predictions of the storage effect theory is that large fluctuations in recruitment rates are expected of low-density species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-KelIy1">[48]</xref>. Indeed, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001931-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, at any given time, the dominant strain may have first appeared far in the past, and as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001931.s009">Figure S9</xref>, this pattern of dominance is not predictable. Within an epidemiological context, this suggests that unpredictable outbreaks of rare subtypes may occur due to the absence of herd immunity.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings have practical implications for the management of influenza in wild birds. Particularly, our results indicate that—in addition to movement restrictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Lam1">[50]</xref> and measures aimed at population size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Capua1">[51]</xref>—considering an environmental dimension to AIV control may be advisable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Vong1">[31]</xref>. Particularly, contaminated environments may remain infectious for an extended period following the cessation of transmission among hosts. If complete elimination of the virus is desired, then environmental decontamination may be required. Because of the outer lipid envelope associated with influenza viruses, chlorination has been proposed as a potentially effective method for decontamination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Rice1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Birnbaum1">[53]</xref>. Given the impossibility of large-scale field trials, simulation exercises using models such as we report here may be crucial for determining whether such methods are indeed practically feasible.</p>

<title>Estimation of Adaptive Evolution</title>
<p>We measured nucleotide substitution rate at third position sites as a proxy for nucleotide mutation, as evolution at third position sites should primarily represent synonymous change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Shapiro1">[60]</xref>. We also measured amino acid substitution rate, which is affected by both nucleotide mutation rate and selective effect of mutations.

<title>Experimental Protocol for Determining Environmental Durability</title>
<p>Data on environmental durability for each subtype come from experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Brown2">[38]</xref>. For each virus subtype, infective virions were diluted 1∶100 in water samples. The inoculated water samples were then divided into 3.0 ml aliquots in 5.0 ml polystyrene tubes and placed in incubators set to the appropriate treatment temperature. For each virus temperature trial, the viral inoculated water was sampled at the time of viral inoculation and at a second time point postinoculation. Titrations at all time points were performed in duplicate. The second postinoculation time point varied with each trial and was determined based on prior estimates of the time required for the titer of the virus in the water sample to be reduced by at least 1 log10 TCID50/ml <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Stallknecht1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Brown1">[35]</xref>. Duplicate 0.5 ml samples of AIV-inoculated water were diluted 1∶1 by addition of 0.5 ml of 2× serum-free MEM. Ten-fold dilutions (10<sup>−1</sup> to 10<sup>−8</sup>) were then made in 1× MEM supplemented with antibiotics. These titers were used to estimate Rt as the time required to reduce infectivity by 90%, assuming a linear association.</p>

<title>Regularized Regression Analyses</title>
<p>The goal of regression analysis was to estimate the size of statistical effect on AIV diversity of covariates corresponding to alternative causal hypotheses. As described above, a covariate corresponding to each hypothesis was developed and assessed for each antigenic subtype. These covariates were (i) <italic>F<sub>ST</sub></italic> (the proportion of genetic variance contained in a subpopulation relative to the total variance) of each subtype (geographic hypothesis), (ii) number of species where strains have been sampled (host diversity hypothesis), (iii) subtype-specific nucleotide mutation rate (genetic hypothesis), (iv) amino acid substitution rates characterizing an immune selective pressure (immunological hypothesis), and (v) environmental durability Rt under natural physical conditions (temperature, 20°C; salinity, 0; pH 7.2; epidemiological hypothesis). Due to correlations among these variables, univariate analysis was not considered to provide reliable estimates of covariate effects. But ordinary least squares multiple regression would be equally ill-advised, resulting in weakly identifiable parameters and variance inflation. A generic solution to this problem is provided by penalized least squares models, such as ridge regression and elastic-net regression. These methods introduce a new estimator, which differs from the maximum likelihood estimator by an additional penalty. In effect, the penalized estimator trades a small amount of bias for a large reduction in the variance of the estimated coefficients. We chose to use elastic-net regression, which takes the maximum likelihood and ridge regression estimators as limit cases and therefore can be fine-tuned to balance the bias-variance tradeoff. Fitting of an elastic-net regression model requires the estimation of an additional tuning parameter (the penalty coefficient), which was numerically selected using cross-validation following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001931-Friedman1">[19]</xref>. The outcome of this procedure is a statistical model with coefficients shrunk to minimize generalization error. Covariates for which shrunk coefficients are zero can be inferred to have no effect.</p>

<p>Conceptual summary of study findings. The figure depicts the contrasting transmission dynamics of human (top panels) and avian (bottom panels) influenza viruses. When host lifespan is long and transmission is only via direct contact (as is the case with human influenza viruses), herd immunity to a given antigenic variant produces strong selection pressure for immune evasion, as indicated by strain replacement events in the top panel. With AIVs, however, the long-term environmental reservoir leads to the episodic introduction of older lineages and facilitates viral coexistence.</p>
