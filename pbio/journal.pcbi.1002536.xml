        <p>Understanding how populations of neurons encode sensory information is a major goal of systems neuroscience. Attempts to answer this question have focused on responses measured over several hundred milliseconds, a duration much longer than that frequently used by animals to make decisions about the environment. How reliably sensory information is encoded on briefer time scales, and how best to extract this information, is unknown. Although it has been proposed that neuronal response latency provides a major cue for fast decisions in the visual system, this hypothesis has not been tested systematically and in a quantitative manner. Here we use a simple ‘race to threshold’ readout mechanism to quantify the information content of spike time latency of primary visual (V1) cortical cells to stimulus orientation. We find that many V1 cells show pronounced tuning of their spike latency to stimulus orientation and that almost as much information can be extracted from spike latencies as from firing rates measured over much longer durations. To extract this information, stimulus onset must be estimated accurately. We show that the responses of cells with weak tuning of spike latency can provide a reliable onset detector. We find that spike latency information can be pooled from a large neuronal population, provided that the decision threshold is scaled linearly with the population size, yielding a processing time of the order of a few tens of milliseconds. Our results provide a novel mechanism for extracting information from neuronal populations over the very brief time scales in which behavioral judgments must sometimes be made.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>How can humans and animals make complex decisions on time scales as short as 100 ms? The information required for such decisions is coded in neural activity and should be read out on a very brief time scale. Traditional approaches to coding of neural information rely on the number of electrical pulses, or spikes, that neurons fire in a certain time window. Although this type of code is likely to be used by the brain for higher cognitive tasks, it may be too slow for fast decisions. Here, we explore an alternative code which is based on the latency of spikes with respect to a reference signal. By analyzing the simultaneous responses of many cells in monkey visual cortex, we show that information about the orientation of visual stimuli can be extracted reliably from spike latencies on very short time scales.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Firing rates of many primary visual cortical cells are tuned to the orientation of visual stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Hubel1">[1]</xref>. This dependence of neuronal firing rates on the stimulus implies that information about the stimulus can be decoded from the spike count. The trial to trial variability of firing limits the accuracy with which a stimulus can be estimated from the neuronal spike count <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Zohary1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Averbeck1">[4]</xref>. To decrease this variability and increase the accuracy of the rate code, studies have typically used responses measured over several hundred milliseconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Hubel1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Zohary1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Georgopoulos1">[5]</xref>. However, increasing evidence indicates that the central nervous system can process complex information on very short time scales.</p>
      <p>Visual psychophysical and evoked potential studies have shown that human subjects can classify natural scenes or emotional facial expressions on the basis of 100–150 ms of processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Antal1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Kirchner1">[12]</xref>. Evidence for fast processing of visual stimuli also exists from behavioral and electrophysiological experiments in monkeys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-FabreThorpe1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Stanford1">[15]</xref>. A recent study by Stanford et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Stanford1">[15]</xref> shows that monkeys can make perceptual decisions regarding the color of stimuli after about 30 ms of processing time. Evidence for fast coding also exists for the auditory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Chait1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Murray1">[17]</xref> and the somatosensory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Johansson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-VanRullen1">[19]</xref>. The overall theme deriving from these studies is that sensory systems are able to process the gist of a scene rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Hochstein1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It has been suggested that the temporal structure of the neuronal response and in particular, response latency, is the source of fast decisions in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Johansson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-VanRullen1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-VanRullen2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Panzeri1">[33]</xref>. However, the accuracy of codes based on these responses has not been studied in the visual system systematically.</p>
      <p>A common approach to measuring response latency is to define it as the transition from spontaneous firing to <italic>stimulus-dependent</italic> firing, e.g., by detecting the time at the which the PSTH (Post Stimulus Time Histogram) reaches half of its maximal firing rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Gawne1">[26]</xref>. This attempts to estimate the ‘pure’ latency component of the response, but it involves defining that quantity by a different number of spikes for each condition. For instance, latency might be defined by the time to the first ten spikes at the preferred stimulus and to the first spike at a non-preferred stimulus. Thus, in this approach the criterion for neural response time depends on the stimulus, making it impractical for decoding: the readout parameters cannot scale in a stimulus dependent manner, as that requires the readout to know the stimulus in order to estimate it.</p>
      <p>Recently, we proposed a simple spike latency code readout <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Shamir1">[34]</xref>, the temporal Winner-take-all (tWTA). The tWTA determines the external stimulus by the label, e.g. preferred orientation, of the cell that fired the first spike in the population. It avoids attempting to estimate ‘pure’ onset latency and instead takes a pragmatic approach in which each cell's time to first spike will depend both on its latency and the strength of its response.</p>
      <p>Formally, consider a population of <italic>N</italic> neurons coding for the orientation of a visual stimulus, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Let us denote by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the time of the first spike of neuron <italic>i</italic>, with preferred orientation <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, following some reference signal <italic>t</italic><sub>ref</sub>. The tWTA algorithm estimates the orientation of the external stimulus as the preferred orientation of the neuron which fired <italic>first</italic> with respect to <italic>t</italic><sub>ref</sub>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>This definition can be generalized to estimate the stimulus by the preferred orientation of the cell that fired the <italic>n</italic>th spike first, or to incorporate a competition between groups, ‘columns’ of cells (see below). Here we investigate neural coding on brief time scales by applying the tWTA to simultaneously recorded populations of neurons in the primary visual cortex of macaque monkeys responding to the orientation of visual stimuli.</p>

      <p>Responses of multiple neurons were measured in primary visual cortex (V1) of anesthetized monkeys using electrode arrays. The stimuli were drifting sinusoidal gratings of varying orientations. The duration of each stimulus was 300–400 ms and each stimulus was repeated 200–400 times. Details about stimulus parameters and numbers of recorded units in each dataset appear in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002536-t001">Table 1</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The recorded cells consisted of well-isolated single units and small multiunit clusters.</p>

        <title>Tuning of spike latencies</title>
        <p>We first investigated the tuning of first spike times to stimulus orientation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g001">Figure 1A</xref> presents eight raster plots showing the response of the same V1 neuron to eight different orientations of the visual stimulus. Qualitatively, both response strength and response latency seem tuned to the stimulus. Measuring latency by simply calculating the mean time to the first spike is problematic because stimuli that evoke weak responses may result in no spikes on some trials. A more principled approach is to incorporate both response time and probability of firing by computing the probability density function and the corresponding cumulative distribution function of the first spike latency.</p>

It is convenient to think of the level curves of this function, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as tuning curves of the neuron. For instance, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g001">Figure 1C</xref> shows the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> level curve (red circles, fits shown by the solid red line and the dashed line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), which indicates the time at which there was a 50% chance that the neuron had fired its first spike, for each orientation. Typically, the level curves have unimodal orientation tuning, with a single minimum which we define as the latency-based preferred orientation of the cell. Note that although the choice of the 0.5 level curve is arbitrary, similar results were obtained for other criteria. For comparison, the conventional rate-tuning curve of the same neuron is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g001">Figure 1D</xref> (black circles represent mean firing rates over the entire response, solid curve represents fitted von-Mises function, stimulus duration was 400 ms; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The rate tuning is also characterized by a unimodal curve that peaks at the rate-based preferred orientation.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows three additional examples of V1 responses in each column. Eight raster plots for eight orientations are depicted at the top row for each cell. The stimulus dependence of the temporal structure of neural response can be seen from the PSTHs at the second row. The latency tuning curve, in terms of 0.5 level curve of first spike time cumulative distribution, is shown on the third row, and the conventional rate tuning curve appears on the fourth row for comparison. Examining the PSTHs of each cell, one can see that response strength has a considerable contribution to first spike latency, in our definition. For example, in cell B it is mainly the firing rate that is tuned to stimulus orientation. Nevertheless, due to the high firing rate near the preferred orientation, the first spike times tend to be shorter near that orientation. It is also evident that the temporal structure of the response is tuned to the stimulus as well. The modulation of the entire temporal structure (and not a simple temporal shift) limits the ability to extract the ‘pure’ latency tuning. However, as mentioned above, it is the distribution of the <italic>n</italic>th spike time that governs the tWTA readout accuracy; hence, the definition of spike latency used here.</p>

        <p>The middle and bottom panels of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g001">Figure 1B</xref> depict the cumulative distribution function for the second and third spike times, respectively; the green and blue traces in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g001">Figure 1C</xref> show the corresponding latency tuning curves (level curves at 0.5). The level curve for the cumulative distribution of the <italic>n</italic>th spike time indicates a tradeoff: the curves are delayed in time as <italic>n</italic> increases, but tuning becomes more pronounced. To quantify this behavior we characterized each tuning curve by a ‘DC’ component, denoted by <italic>A</italic>, which represents the mean latency across all orientations, and by the ‘modulation amplitude’, denoted by <italic>B</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g003">Figures 3A and B</xref> show the dependence of the mean (<italic>A</italic>) and the modulation amplitude (<italic>B</italic>) of the spike-time tuning curve as a function of <italic>n</italic>, averaged across the population (dataset 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002536-t001">Table 1</xref>). The delay is evident from the linear increase of <italic>A</italic> with the spike number, while the increase of tuning amplitude, <italic>B</italic>, indicates that the tuning becomes more pronounced as <italic>n</italic> increases. A scatter plot showing the mean latency of the first spike against the tuning modulation of the first spike indicates that they are correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g003">Figure 3C</xref>; correlation coefficient 0.85). This is a manifestation of an empirical result that the first spike latency at the preferred orientation (<italic>A</italic>–<italic>B</italic>) is approximately constant, and thus neurons with larger modulation amplitudes also have larger mean latencies. Note, that because (<italic>A–B</italic>) is the fitted latency at the preferred orientation and is expected to be positive, we would expect that in general <italic>A</italic> will be larger than <italic>B</italic>. We find that, typically, the rate-based preferred orientation is very close to the latency-based preferred orientation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows the distribution of the difference (in absolute value) between the rate and the latency preferred orientations of cells with a tuned first spike latency. In about 90% of the cells this difference is less than 20°.</p>

        <p>In summary, the latency to the first spike is stimulus dependent: it is shortest for the same orientation that evokes the highest firing rate in the cell. Defining response latency by the first two or three spikes, rather than the first single spike, results in tuning with the same preference but with deeper modulation. Thus, spike latency appears to contain useful information about stimulus orientation.</p>

        <title>Generating a reference signal to measure spike latencies</title>
        <p>Because the brain does not have direct access to information about when a stimulus was presented, a reference signal is required to extract information about stimulus orientation from the first spike latency. Such a reference signal can be reported by neurons which are sensitive to the mere onset of the stimulus. An ideal onset neuron is expected not only to have a uniform spike time latency for all orientations, but also a low spontaneous firing rate, to prevent false alarms. In fact, several neurons in the data showed weak orientation tuning of their first spike latency as well as a low spontaneous firing rate. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows a scatter plot of the spontaneous firing rate against the modulation amplitude, <italic>B</italic>, of the latency tuning curve for a single dataset (dataset 3 in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002536-t001">Table 1</xref>). We categorized neurons as onset detectors if their modulation amplitude was less than 15 ms and their spontaneous firing rate was less than 5 spks/sec (gray shading in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Typically, we had 10–25 onset detectors in a dataset (10–25% of the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Ringach1">[35]</xref>; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002536-t001">Table 1</xref>). Because the parameters <italic>A</italic> and <italic>B</italic> are correlated, these neurons also tend to have an earlier latency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, red dots).</p>

        <p>In a given trial, onset time was determined using a simple coincidence detection mechanism. Stimulus presence was detected if the group of onset cells fired at least <italic>m</italic> spikes during a time interval of <italic>T</italic> ms, and stimulus <italic>onset</italic> was estimated by the first crossing time of this threshold. A high value of the threshold <italic>m</italic> results in a very low false-alarm rate but compromises the probability of hit, whereas a low value of <italic>m</italic> increases the hit probability but also the false-alarm rate. By varying the <italic>m</italic> criterion we can quantify the Receiver-Operating Characteristic (ROC) curve of this onset detection mechanism; i.e., the dependence of the hit probability on the false alarm rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Note that, in contrast to standard two alternative forced choice tasks, in a detection task there are no well-defined trials of ‘no stimulus’, and the stimulus may be absent over a wide range of time intervals. The mean number of false alarms will scale linearly with the duration in which they are counted. Hence, in a detection task, false alarm is measured in rate of occurrence and not in probability. Unless otherwise stated, throughout this paper we use the following parameters for onset detection: a time window of <italic>T</italic> = 20 ms, with a criterion of 4 standard deviations above the mean number of spikes in this time interval during spontaneous firing. This choice takes into account the need for a fast detection of the onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) while maintaining a high hit probability and a low false-alarm rate. The distribution of estimated onset times (relative to stimulus onset) with this criterion is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g004">Figure 4D</xref>. Because the detection of stimulus onset involves a simple integration of spikes emitted by onset detectors, it can be realized in a straightforward way in an integrate-and-fire neuron, producing a similar distribution of onset times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

The complete definition of the method used to compute tWTA performance is provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p>
        <p>The performance of the tWTA is affected by the spontaneous firing rates of the neurons, since the mechanism can erroneously identify a spontaneous spike as an informative one. This effect is reduced by taking a more general readout, the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA, in which the identity of the stimulus is determined by the cell or group of cells that fired the first <italic>n</italic> spikes with respect to the reference signal. This may come at the expense of the time it takes to make a decision. However, if the number of spikes, <italic>n</italic>, is less than or equal to the group size, <italic>N</italic>, then the mean decision time of the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA will be less than the mean first spike time of a single cell, keeping the mechanism fast.</p>

        <title>Discrimination accuracy based on single cell responses</title>
        <p>As a first test of the tWTA accuracy we quantified how well it can discriminate between two orientations based on single cell responses. We consider the case where one of the orientations is the cell's preferred orientation θ<sub>0</sub> (as defined by its latency tuning curve) and the other orientation is θ<sub>0</sub>+Δθ. The tWTA decision rule is to associate the shorter latency with the stimulus at the preferred orientation of the cell and the longer latency with the other stimulus. The probability of correct discrimination, P<sub>C</sub>, using the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA was calculated from the probability density function, f<italic><sub>n</sub></italic>(θ,t), of the <italic>n</italic>'th spike latency, as estimated from the data with time relative to the external stimulus onset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Similar to psychometric curves in psychophysical experiments, the curve that describes the probability of a correct response as a function of the orientation difference Δθ is termed the <italic>neurometric curve</italic> of the cell.</p>

For comparison, we show the neurometric curve of the conventional rate code readout in black (the firing rate was estimated from the total number of spikes fired by the cell during the entire response).

        <title>Discrimination accuracy based on population responses</title>
        <p>Decisions in the central nervous system are expected to involve large numbers of cells. In large populations, the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA discrimination in a two alternative forced choice paradigm can be thought of as a competition between two ‘columns’ towards a threshold of firing <italic>n</italic> spikes. To study the dependence of <italic>n</italic>-tWTA accuracy on the population size we divided the tuned neurons (<italic>B</italic>&gt;15 ms) into artificial columns of equal orientation width according to the latency-based preferred orientation of the cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For each pair of columns, we measured the probability of correct discrimination as a function of the number of cells in the population (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Importantly, unless stated otherwise, the spike latencies in each trial were measured with respect to the onset detection mechanism described above. Thus, the analysis uses only information that is present in the brain, and, in principle, can be performed by an appropriate neuronal mechanism (see Discussion).</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g007">Figures 7A, B and C</xref> show the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA probability of correct discrimination for three representative pairs of columns as a function of the number of cells in each column, <italic>N</italic>. The pairs of columns differ in terms of the difference between the preferred orientations, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The blue curve depicts the performance of the naïve tWTA (<italic>n</italic> = 1) readout. Initially, for small <italic>N</italic>, tWTA performance increases with <italic>N</italic>. However, beyond a critical size of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, tWTA performance saturates. Theory has shown that two factors may limit tWTA performance. The first is correlations in the first spike latencies of different cells and the second is the spontaneous firing of the cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Shamir1">[34]</xref>. We find that although first spike latency is correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s003">Figure S3</xref>), its effect on tWTA accuracy is negligible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s004">Figure S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s007">Text S1</xref>). The dominant factor that limits accumulation of information from large populations is the spontaneous firing. Clearly, adding more cells also results in adding more spontaneous spikes which interfere with informative spikes (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Shamir1">[34]</xref> for a detailed analysis). This effect can be reduced by increasing the decision threshold criterion; i.e., by increasing <italic>n</italic>.</p>

        <p>We next analyzed the performance of the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA readout, which takes the winning group to be the first to fire <italic>n</italic> spikes. Different curves in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g007">Figure 7A, B and C</xref> correspond to different values of the decision threshold, <italic>n</italic>, in the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA readout.

As the population size, <italic>N</italic>, grows, it pays to consider more spikes in the readout. Moreover, for these values of population size we obtain that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is approximately linear in <italic>N</italic>.</p>

As expected, for a given decision threshold, <italic>n</italic>, increasing the number of neurons reduces the decision time significantly. The important point is that the average waiting time for the <italic>n</italic>th spike in a population of <italic>N∼n</italic> cells is around the average waiting time for the first spike of a single cell (black filled circles), which is typically in the range of 40–80 ms. Thus, considering both more spikes and more neurons (<italic>N∼n</italic>) can substantially improve reliability without compromising the decision time.</p>
        <p>In the preceding analysis we measured response timing relative to an internal stimulus onset detection mechanism. We wondered whether performance could be improved by making use of the absolute timing of stimulus onset. In principle, this could decrease the detrimental effect of spontaneous firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Shamir1">[34]</xref>. To evaluate this we used an artificial reference signal (i.e. not based on neural responses) which varied from 0 to 120 ms relative to the external stimulus onset. Spike times were then measured relative to this reference signal (spikes before the signal were ignored). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows the accuracy of the tWTA readout (<italic>n</italic> = 1) as a function of the onset time. Estimating the onset too early causes the readout mechanism to consider more spontaneous spikes which only contribute noise. Overestimating the onset time results in a loss of informative spikes. The performance is thus non-monotonic. Since most cells start responding about 60 to 90 ms following stimulus onset, tWTA accuracy peaks at about this time, at a performance level comparable to that achieved using the internal onset detection signal. For comparison, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g008">Figure 8</xref> also shows the mean time (±1 standard deviation) of our onset detection mechanism for the same dataset. As can be seen, the onset detection mechanism matches the range of times that produce optimal performance. We conclude that the speed and accuracy of our decoding is similar to that which would be achieved by making use of absolute information as to when the stimulus was presented.</p>

The error distribution is very broad and there are relatively many large errors. These large errors are related to spontaneous firing and reflect the fact that discrimination at fine resolutions involves a competition among many groups (180 in this case). In a substantial fraction of the trials the winning group is the first to fire a <italic>spontaneous</italic> spike, which carries no information about the stimulus; hence errors in these cases are distributed uniformly. Using the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA readout with <italic>n</italic> = 2 decreases this effect and makes the distribution narrower, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g009">Figure 9d</xref>. Nevertheless, the decision is still based on a competition between one “correct” group and many (<italic>M</italic>−1 = 179) “incorrect” groups. The chances that one of the “incorrect” groups will fire its first two spikes before the “correct” group are still high and the distribution of errors is still relatively wide. With larger groups of neurons in each bin (i.e. with more samples than that provided by our microelectrode arrays), the decision threshold, <italic>n</italic>, could be increased so as to improve performance for these more difficult discriminations.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We performed a quantitative analysis of spike latency coding of orientation in primary visual cortex. We found that spike time latency is tuned to the orientation of visual stimuli. Surprisingly, for many neurons, the performance of a WTA decoder based on spike latency was comparable to the performance based on the total spike count during the entire response. This decoding could be performed by measuring latency relative to a reference signal in cortex, namely the pooled responses of a subset of neurons with low spontaneous rates and poor latency-based selectivity for orientation. Performance of the decoder could in principle be improved by using larger populations of neurons. We found that spontaneous firing limits the ability to accumulate information from the spike time latencies of large cell populations, but this can be overcome by scaling the decision threshold linearly with the population size.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Tuning of spike latencies</title>
        <p>Coding of visual attributes by spike latencies was studied previously in the context of contrast processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Gawne1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Reich1">[31]</xref>, where it was demonstrated that higher stimulus contrast results in shorter response latency. However, some confusion exists in the literature as to the tuning of first spike latency to the orientation of visual stimuli. Whereas Celebrini et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Celebrini1">[32]</xref> reported tuning of spike latency of V1 neurons to orientation, Gawne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Gawne1">[26]</xref> claimed that stimulus orientation mainly modulates response strength and only weakly affects response latency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Gawne1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We have shown that first spike latencies of V1 neurons are tuned to the orientation of external stimuli. This tuning is typically unimodal and the minimal latency is close to the orientation that evokes the maximal firing in the cell. The apparent discrepancy with Gawne et al. is due to different definitions of response latency. In their study, Gawne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Gawne1">[26]</xref> defined response latency to be the time at which the PSTH reaches half of its peak. The utility of this measure is that it attempts to estimate changes in the ‘pure latency’ in a manner that is unaffected by the changes in the firing rate of the cell. However, since firing rate is modulated by orientation, this definition may measure the latency to a single spike at the null orientation and the latency to ten spikes at the preferred orientation. Hence, using this definition should result in flatter latency tuning curves. Indeed, when applying this definition to our data, we found little modulation of latency with orientation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Moreover, since response strength, the temporal structure of the PSTH, and response latency itself may all be modulated by the stimulus, it is very difficult to obtain a reliable estimate of ‘pure latency’ tuning based on finite amounts of data.</p>
        <p>Here we took a more pragmatic approach. Since we are interested in the issue of decoding neural responses on brief time scales, we studied latency tuning using the probability density function of first spike time, which is the quantity that governs tWTA accuracy. Our results thus hold regardless of whether differences in first spike latency arise entirely from differences in response strength, or whether there is some tendency for neurons' absolute latency to vary with stimulus conditions.</p>

        <title>Onset estimation</title>
        <p>To extract the information embedded in spike latencies, a reference signal is required. Note that a reference signal is also required for decisions based on spike count in order to determine the start of the counting window. In the general case of latency coding, the onset signal gives a natural reference for measuring latency. However, in our case we do not use the absolute response time, but instead only use relative timing, i.e., who fired first. In this case, an important feature of the onset signal is to filter out spontaneous spikes that are not stimulus dependent and hence carry no information (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g008">Figure 8</xref>).</p>
        <p>In the case of ‘active sensing’, the intrinsic signal of the motor command <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Crapse1">[36]</xref> can, in principle, serve as the onset signal. However, in the case of ‘passive sensing’; e.g., when a child suddenly jumps in front of your car, the onset signal must be estimated from the responses of sensory neurons. Here we suggested a principle by which stimulus onset is estimated by the group of cells that are not tuned to the information that must be processed rapidly. We showed that a simple summation of the responses of ‘onset’ neurons during short time intervals can provide a reliable reference signal, with sufficient accuracy to allow for accurate identification of stimulus orientation. The onset cells were characterized by weak first spike latency tuning, to limit stimulus dependent bias of the estimated onset time, and low spontaneous firing rates to reduce the false alarm rate. Because the tuning modulation and the mean latency are correlated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), these cells also tend to have an early response. However, even if the onset signal arrives slightly after the tuned neurons started to fire, the performance is only mildly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g008">Figure 8</xref>). In terms of the identity of the onset cells, one possibility is that these are inhibitory interneurons, which are known to be responsive but poorly tuned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Hirsch1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Kerlin1">[38]</xref>. Since these neurons do not project downstream, this would imply that onset detection is performed locally. A similar approach has been applied in the past for the estimation of the onset of auditory stimuli by Chase &amp; Young <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Chase1">[24]</xref>. The main differences are twofold. One, Chase &amp; Young used a ‘pseudo population’ signal whereas we use simultaneous recordings of real neural populations. Two, we used the responses of a distinguished subclass of cells with weakly tuned first spike latency for our onset signal, whereas Chase &amp; Young pooled the responses of all the cells.</p>

        <title>A fast and simple readout mechanism in the brain</title>
        <p>It remains an open question whether the brain employs a latency-based readout like the tWTA. Nevertheless, the utility of the tWTA in our study has been to enable us to investigate and quantify the information embedded in spike time latency. Let us consider, for example, the case of a two alternative forced choice discrimination task, based on a competition between two neurons. At the time of the first spike the tWTA decision is identical to that of the conventional rate-based readout. The advantage of a latency-based readout is clear when both neurons fired one spike in the counting window. In those cases the latency based readout can extract information from the temporal structure of the response, whereas there is no information in the total spike count. A rate code readout will perform better when more spikes were fired, but this results in a slower readout. A recent study reported that the minimal processing time required for visual perceptual decisions in the monkey is about 30 ms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Stanford1">[15]</xref>. This brief time scale is on par with the processing time of the latency readout, i.e the mean decision time following the internal onset signal (see e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g007">Figure 7I</xref>).</p>
        <p>To test more directly if a candidate readout mechanism is used by the brain one would need to correlate the behavior of animals with the relevant aspects of neural activity. In a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Lee1">[39]</xref>, activity of single neurons in monkey V1 was measured together with reaction times for visually guided saccades. It was shown that first spike latency was correlated with behavior whereas firing rate was not, suggesting that spike latency may indeed serve as a source of information for fast decisions in the brain.</p>

        <title>Implementation of the tWTA readout in the brain</title>
        <p>As noted above, the implementation of the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA readout requires an integration process and a threshold decision mechanism. In this sense, <italic>n</italic>-tWTA competition is very similar to the ‘race to threshold’ mechanism suggested by Mazurek et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Mazurek1">[40]</xref>, in which the decision in a two alternative task is determined by integrating ‘evidence’ (spikes) for the two competing alternatives to reach a decision threshold (<italic>n</italic> spikes). The decision mechanism involves a winner-take-all type competition, which is an algorithm that others have also used to decode neural response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Salzman1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Sheliga1">[43]</xref>. Winner-take-all competition can be implemented using reciprocal inhibition between the integrators that represent the different alternatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Amari1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Xie1">[45]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Each inhibitory neuron accumulates evidence for the corresponding alternative and fires when it crosses a threshold. Higher threshold values reflect a stricter decision criterion and correspond to higher values of <italic>n</italic> in the <italic>n</italic>-tWTA readout. The integration time constant of the neurons should be on the order of the relevant time scale for decisions (∼10–30 ms).</p>

            <p>The figure describes in a qualitative manner neuronal architectures that can implement the tWTA readout in the context of a two-alternative task. The inputs from population A and population B represent the two alternatives. Both architectures rely on reciprocal inhibition for implementing a ‘race to threshold’ competition but they differ in the implementation of the gating mechanism (see Discussion for details). (A) Implementation of the gating mechanism using NMDA synapses. (B) Implementation of the gating mechanism using disinhibition.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The circuit also requires a gating mechanism that triggers the integration process based on the reference signal. One qualitative way to implement such a gating mechanism is using NMDA synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Panzeri1">[33]</xref> for the tuned inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). The inputs from the onset cells are first integrated by a coincidence detector, which in turn excites the inhibitory cells through AMPA synapses (as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s001">Figure S1</xref>, such a coincidence detector can be implemented using a simple integrate-and-fire neuron). Only when this detector is active, the inhibitory cells become depolarized and the magnesium block of the NMDA synapses is removed, allowing for integration of the tuned inputs. When the onset cells are silent, the NMDA synapses do not allow inputs from the tuned populations to be integrated. The gating mechanism can also be implemented using a disinhibition pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). In this case the onset cells are assumed to be inhibitory. Their inputs are integrated by a neuron which inhibits the competing neurons. Thus, the competing neurons are released from inhibition only when the onset cells are active, allowing the ‘race to threshold’ to begin.</p>
        <p>Previous studies have proposed more sophisticated mechanisms to combine information from the first spikes of different neurons in a large population. These methods include rank order <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Thorpe2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Shahaf1">[46]</xref> and synfire chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Abeles1">[47]</xref>. The utility of tWTA is that its simplicity enables statistical analysis of its accuracy, whereas sophisticated readout mechanisms that rely on specific combinations of firing orders cannot be tested with finite data on the order of a few hundred repetitions per stimulus condition. Furthermore, these readouts may be more difficult to implement in biological circuits.</p>
        <p>Recently first spike latency code has been analyzed in the framework of fast discrimination of sound source location in the auditory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Zohar1">[48]</xref>. There are several interesting similarities and differences worth noting. In both systems, many cells exhibit tuning of their first spike latency to the stimulus. Tuned cells are typically characterized by a unimodal latency tuning curve that peaks close to the preferred stimulus of the cell, as defined by the rate tuning curve. In addition, the accuracy of first spike latency readout is typically comparable though somewhat inferior to the accuracy of the conventional rate code in single tuned cells in both systems. The main differences between the systems are the higher spontaneous firing rates in visual cortex and the poorer performance of V1 neurons for orientation discrimination. To overcome the detrimental effect of spontaneous spikes, we developed here a novel onset detection mechanism, based on pooling the responses from a set of simultaneously recorded neurons. The use of simultaneous data from array recordings rather than single units also enabled us to investigate the accuracy of latency coding at the population level without the use of artificial pseudo populations of neurons.</p>
        <p>In summary, our study demonstrates that the orientation tuning of first spike latencies enables accurate discrimination of orientations on brief time scales. Spontaneous firing limits the resolution of the decision. However, larger populations can afford better resolution. Furthermore, in many cases when fast decisions are essential, it is important that the probability of correct response will be high but coarse resolution may suffice. This may be a general principle used by the nervous system when fast decisions are essential. For example, when an object suddenly appears on the road while we are driving, all we need to know is its rough location. In most cases we react before we realize whether this object is a child, a dog or just a plastic bag. These finer details can be sorted out later as more spikes are accumulated using readout mechanisms that take into account the entire neural response.</p>

        <p>The methods we use to record from neural populations have been described in detail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Smith1">[49]</xref>. In short, we recorded from anesthetized (sufentanil citrate, typically 6–18 microg/kg/hr, adjusted as needed for each animal), paralyzed (vecuronium bromide, 0.1 mg/kg/h) macaque monkeys (macaca fascicularis). Vital signs were monitored continuously to assure adequate anesthesia and the well-being of the animal. The pupils were dilated with topical atropine and the corneas protected with gas-permeable hard contact lenses. Supplementary lenses were used to bring the retinal image into focus.</p>
        <p>Neural activity was recorded using the Cyberkinetics “Utah” Array (Cyberkinetics Neurotechnology Systems), using methods reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Smith1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Kelly1">[50]</xref>. The array consists of a 10×10 grid of silicon microelectrodes (1 mm in length) spaced 400 µm apart, thus covering 12.96 mm<sup>2</sup>. The array was inserted roughly 0.6 mm into cortex using a pneumatic insertion device <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Rousche1">[51]</xref>, resulting in recordings confined mostly to layers 2–3. Signals from each microelectrode were amplified and bandpass filtered (250 Hz to 7.5 kHz). Waveform segments that exceeded a threshold (periodically adjusted using a multiple of the rms noise on each channel) were digitized (30 kHz) and sorted off-line. Sorted units included both well-isolated single units and small multiunit clusters. Neuronal receptive fields were roughly 2–5° from the fovea.</p>
        <p>Visual stimuli were displayed at a resolution of 1024×768 pixels and a video frame rate of 100 Hz on a calibrated CRT monitor. Stimuli were oriented drifting gratings presented in a circular aperture surrounded by a gray field of average luminance (8 orientations in 4 datasets and 36 orientations in one dataset). Stimuli were presented binocularly, for 300–400 ms, and separated by 500–800 ms intervals during which we presented an isoluminant gray screen. Stimulus orientation was block randomized, and each stimulus was presented 200–400 times (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002536-t001">Table 1</xref> for details). In 4 datasets the initial phase of the drifting grating was identical across trials.

We obtained similar results from this dataset (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

        <title>Latency tuning</title>
        <p>To generate latency tuning curves for a neuron we first estimate the probability density function of the first spike latency of this neuron, f<sub>1</sub>(θ,t). This is done by computing the histogram of the first spike times over trials and then normalizing it. Note that because in some trials there may be no spikes, the integral of the probability density function may not be 1 but slightly below. The spike times are measured with respect to the external stimulus onset and the histogram is generated using bins of 10 ms from time 0 to 300 ms after stimulus termination. The corresponding cumulative distribution, <italic>F</italic><sub>1</sub>(θ,t), is generated by direct numerical integration of the density function. A similar procedure is applied to obtain the <italic>n</italic>th spike time probability density, <italic>f</italic><sub>n</sub>(θ,t), and cumulative distribution, <italic>F</italic><sub>n</sub>(θ,t), for general <italic>n</italic>.</p>
        <p>The latency tuning curve of the <italic>n</italic>'th spike is defined as the level curve at 0.5 of the corresponding cumulative distribution function. These level curves are fitted using a cosine function of the form:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>θ</italic> is the stimulus orientation and <italic>φ</italic> is termed the latency preferred orientation of the cell. Parameter <italic>A</italic> represents the mean latency and <italic>B</italic> represents the modulation of the tuning.</p>
        <p>Here, the reference time is chosen to be the onset of the external stimulus, but in principle other external reference times can be used, e.g. 20 ms after stimulus onset. We note that in the cosine fit, changing the reference time will change the value of <italic>A</italic> but not <italic>B</italic>. The arbitrary choice of the reference is also why a simple cosine function is more appropriate here than the von-Mises function. Choosing the reference such that at some orientations the latency is zero requires parameter <italic>k</italic> at the von-Mises function to diverge to infinity. In addition, if the latency is negative with respect to the reference at some orientations, the von-Mises function will not fit at all, as it is purely positive.</p>
        <p>Because in some trials there may be no spikes, error bars for the latency tuning curves cannot be simply calculated from the standard error of the mean associated with the spike times. In order to generate error bars, we first calculated the standard errors of the mean for the cumulative distribution, <italic>F</italic>. This can be done by noting that <italic>F</italic> is the mean of a Bernoulli variable and thus its variance is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The standard error of the mean is therefore: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <italic>K</italic> is the number of trials. We then calculated the level curves at 0.5 for <italic>F</italic>+SEM<italic>(F)</italic> and for <italic>F</italic>-SEM<italic>(F)</italic>, and used them to generate lower and upper error bars, respectively. These error bars are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and in subsequent plots of spike latency tuning.</p>

        <title>Onset detection</title>
        <p>In each dataset we identify a group of cells that can serve for the detection of stimulus onset. These cells are characterized by poor tuning and low spontaneous firing rates. The spontaneous firing rates are estimated from the recordings during the inter-stimulus interval (ISI) after each stimulus. From each ISI we remove the first 300 ms, assuming that after this period the cell returned to its spontaneous rate (i.e. any post-response adaptation of spontaneous rate would have dissipated). The tuning is characterized by the modulation amplitude, <italic>B</italic>, of the cosine fit to the first spike latency tuning curve. In each dataset, the cells with a spontaneous rate lower than 5 spks/sec and with a modulation lower than 15 ms, were labeled as onset detectors. Using this definition, the number of onset detectors in a dataset is roughly 10–25% of the population (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002536-t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The onset signal in each trial is generated using coincidence detection.

        <title>Discrimination accuracy based on single cell responses</title>
        <p>The discrimination accuracy of single cells is computed in the context of a Two-Interval 2-Alternative-Forced-Choice paradigm. We assume that the cell is presented with two stimuli, one at orientation θ<sub>1</sub> and the other at orientation θ<sub>2</sub>, where θ<sub>1</sub> is the preferred orientation of the cell. The probability that the tWTA will yield the correct response is the probability that the latency of the response to θ<sub>1</sub> will be shorter than the latency of the response to θ<sub>2</sub>. To find this probability, we multiply the probability that the neuron first fired at time <italic>t</italic> in response to θ<sub>1</sub> by the probability that it did not fire before <italic>t</italic> in response to θ<sub>2</sub>, and then we sum over all possible times, <italic>t</italic> (the time is measured with respect to the onset of the external stimulus).

In practice we assume that after time <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>, that contains the stimulus presence time and the initial 300 ms of the following inter stimulus period, the neuron returns to its spontaneous firing rate. Assuming Poisson firing with mean rate λ after time <italic>T</italic><sub>0</sub>, we obtain:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002536.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>It is also important to note that <italic>f</italic> and <italic>F</italic> are estimated from the data using time bins of Δ<italic>t</italic>.

The error in the trial was the (signed) difference between the orientation of the winning group and the stimulus orientation. The probability of correct response was calculated as the average number of times in which the correct group was the winner.</p>

          <p><bold>Onset detection using an integrate-and-fire neuron.</bold> In addition to the onset detection mechanism described in the main text, we investigated an implementation of onset detection in a more biologically plausible architecture, namely by performing the coincidence detection using a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. The neuron integrates the spikes from the onset neurons with equal synaptic weights until a threshold is reached. For simplicity, the integration process was set such that each spike increases the membrane potential by one unit. The voltage then decays exponentially with a time constant of 20 ms. (A) Illustration of the integration process by a leaky integrate-and-fire neuron. The top trace shows a series of spikes from all onset neurons relative to stimulus onset and the bottom trace show the membrane potential of the integrate-fire-neuron (in arbitrary units) as it integrates these spike. The accumulation of spikes around 45–65 ms after stimulus onset causes the neuron to first cross the specified threshold and an onset is detected. (B) Mean onset time as a function of threshold. The mean is calculated over all trials in one dataset. The gray stripe represents ±one standard deviation. The horizontal line represents the mean onset time using the running window approach which was used in the main text (the time window was 20 ms and the threshold was set to 4 standard deviations above spontaneous firing, which corresponds here to m = 6 spikes). The vertical line represents the required threshold for the integrate-and-fire neuron (3.3) to achieve the same mean onset time. (C) Distribution of the difference in onset times between the two mechanisms across all trials. The threshold for the integrate-and-fire neuron is the one which achieves the same mean onset time as the running window method (3.3).</p>

          <p><bold>Pairwise correlations of response latencies among neurons.</bold> (A) Trial to trial fluctuations of first spike latencies for a pair of cells. For each neuron we calculated a normalized measure of its first spike latency by subtracting the mean latency and dividing by the standard deviation. These cells had similar latency preferred orientations, 139° and 136°, and their normalized first spike latencies are shown for the first 25 trials in which the stimulus orientation was 135°. The first spike latency of the two cells fluctuates from trial to trial around its mean. However, typically, when one cell fires sooner than its mean latency the other does as well, and similarly when the response is delayed, resulting in a positive correlation coefficient of 0.45. (B) Distribution of first spike latency correlation coefficients. For each pair of cells with latency tuning (<italic>B</italic>&gt;15 ms) a correlation coefficient is calculated separately for each stimulus orientation. The mean of this distribution is 0.07 and its standard deviation is 0.04. (C) Dependence of correlations on the difference in preferred orientations (POs). The cell pairs were divided into six groups according to the difference between their preferred orientations, ΔPO. Each point represents the mean correlation coefficient for all pairs of neurons at a given range of ΔPO and the error bars represent the corresponding standard errors. The solid line represents the linear regression and its slope is −10<sup>−4</sup>±2•10<sup>−5</sup> (deg-1). These results indicate that there is a very weak dependence of the first spike latency correlation on the difference between the latency preferred orientations of the cells.</p>

          <p><bold>Effect of pairwise correlations on tWTA accuracy.</bold> Correlations in the trial to trial fluctuations of spike latencies can affect the utility of pooling information from groups of cells. To quantify the effect of correlations we compared the discrimination performance using the original simultaneous data to the performance using shuffled data with no correlations. In the shuffled data, the responses of different cells on a given trial were taken from different trials in the original data. The onset signal from the onset neurons was also shuffled among trials. For each shuffled version of the data we found the corresponding neurometric curve, and then averaged the result from 50 shuffles. (A–C) Probability of correct discrimination (Pc) as a function of population size (N) for two populations that differ in preferred orientation by 45° (A), 67.5° (B) and 80° (C) (same pairs of populations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002536-g007">Figure 7</xref>). (D) Probability of correct discrimination in a model of two columns (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s007">Text S1</xref>). (E–H) The effect of shuffling the responses of neurons in different trials. The curves show the difference in Pc between the original and the shuffled data (Pc(original)-Pc(shuffled)) for each pair of columns on the left. Although the performance is typically better in the original correlated data, the overall size of the effect is relatively small, on the order of 1%. For small populations, the correlations increase tWTA accuracy. However, as the population size increases, this difference decays to zero. The simplified model (H) captures the behavior of the data (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002536.s007">Text S1</xref>).</p>

          <p><bold>Effect of different definitions of response latency.</bold> Gawne et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002536-Gawne1">[26]</xref> recorded responses to oriented bars in V1 of behaving monkeys and reported that the effect of stimulus orientation on response latency is relatively weak. The difference with our results can be attributed to different definitions of response latency. Gawne et al. defined response latency to be the time at which the PSTH reaches its half peak (in cases where the peak was less than twice the spontaneous activity, latency was left undefined). We used the cumulative distribution function of first spike times and defined the first spike latency tuning curve as a level curve of this distribution. (A–C) First-spike latency tuning curves as computed by first spike (cumulative) distribution level curves (red) and the corresponding latency tuning curves for the same cells using the time at which the PSTH reaches half of its peak (black). (Lower and upper error bars for the halfmax definition were calculated using the times at which the PSTH reaches half the peak of the PSTH minus and plus its standard error of the mean). <italic>B</italic> denotes the modulation amplitude using our latency definition and <italic>B</italic>′ using the half max definition. For the cells in (A) and (B), the latency tuning curve using the half max definition (black) is relatively flat, whereas the first spike latency tuning curve using our definition (red) shows a strong modulation. For the cell in (C) both definitions show pronounced tuning. (D) Scatter plot of the modulation amplitudes, <italic>B</italic> and <italic>B</italic>′, for each cell. Notably, the tuning amplitudes using the halfmax definition are relatively small, whereas our definition results in many cells with significant modulation.</p>

The two datasets were recorded in the same animal using the same electrode array. (A–B) PSTHs of two single cells. The stimuli were near the preferred orientation of the cells and the PSTH was constructed from 300 repetitions. For fixed initial phase, the PSTH is characterized by a periodic modulation whereas for random phases there is no such modulation. (C–D) First spike latency tuning curves of the neurons in (A) and (B). (E–F) Distribution of latency tuning modulation amplitude, <italic>B</italic>, in the two datasets. The substantial tuning of the response latency in the random phase dataset cannot be attributed to the stimulus initial phase. The inset in (F) shows the two cumulative distribution functions (black for the fixed phase dataset and blue for the random phase dataset). The similarity of the two distributions indicates that there is no significant difference between the orientation tuning levels of first spike latencies in the two datasets. (G–H) Mean neurometric curves using the first spike latency (red), second spike latency (green), third spike latency (blue) and the firing rate (black). Error bars represent the standard deviation and are shown only for the rate and the first spike latency neurometric curves. The fact that performance is similar indicates that our results reflect the tuning of the first spike latency to stimulus orientation and not the initial phase of the stimulus.</p>
