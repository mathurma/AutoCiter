<p>T-Cell antigen Receptor (TR) repertoire is generated through rearrangements of V and J genes encoding α and β chains. The quantification and frequency for every V-J combination during ontogeny and development of the immune system remain to be precisely established. We have addressed this issue by building a model able to account for Vα-Jα gene rearrangements during thymus development of mice. So we developed a numerical model on the whole TRA/TRD locus, based on experimental data, to estimate how Vα and Jα genes become accessible to rearrangements. The progressive opening of the locus to V-J gene recombinations is modeled through windows of accessibility of different sizes and with different speeds of progression. Furthermore, the possibility of successive secondary V-J rearrangements was included in the modelling. The model points out some unbalanced V-J associations resulting from a preferential access to gene rearrangements and from a non-uniform partition of the accessibility of the J genes, depending on their location in the locus. The model shows that 3 to 4 successive rearrangements are sufficient to explain the use of all the V and J genes of the locus. Finally, the model provides information on both the kinetics of rearrangements and frequencies of each V-J associations. The model accounts for the essential features of the observed rearrangements on the TRA/TRD locus and may provide a reference for the repertoire of the V-J combinatorial diversity.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Lymphocytes of the immune system ensure the body defense by the expression of receptors which are specific of targets, termed antigens. Each lymphocyte, deriving from the same original clone, expresses the same unique receptor. To achieve the production of receptors covering the wide variety of antigens, lymphocytes use a specialized genetic mechanism consisting of gene rearrangements. For instance, the genes encoding the receptor of the alpha chain of the T lymphocyte receptor (TRA) spread over a 1500 Kb genetic region which includes around 100 V genes, 60 J genes, and a single C gene. To constitute a functional alpha chain, one of the V and one of the J genes rearrange together to form a single exon. The precise definition of these V-J combinations is essential to understand the repertoire of TRA. We have developed a numerical model simulating all of the V-J combinations of TRA, fitting the available experimental observations obtained from the analysis of TRA in T lymphocytes of the thymus and the blood. Our model gives new insights on the rules controlling the use of V and J genes in providing a dynamic estimation of the total V-J combinations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Functional antigen receptors expressed by T lymphocytes (TR) are generated during ontogeny by somatic recombination of gene segments coding for the variable (V), the joining (J), and the constant (C) segments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Cobb1">[1]</xref>. The recombination mechanism is largely dependent on both the accessibility of the loci and the RAG enzymatic complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-JouvinMarche1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1">[5]</xref>. The murine TRA/TRD locus is composite, encoding TR α and δ chains and encompassed of more than 100 functional V genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Baum1">[6]</xref>. In theory, each of the V genes may target one of the 49 functional J genes. The use of V and J genes during the process of recombination has been widely debated, and the studies support the consensus that V-J combinations are not random, with a use of J segments starting at the 5′ end (proximal to the V segments) and proceeding to the 3′ end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Thompson1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Davodeau1">[13]</xref>. The accessibility of the J region is controlled by the TR α enhancer (Eα), located at the 3′ end of the C gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Sleckman1">[14]</xref> and by two promoters: i) T early α (TEA), located at the 5′ end of the Jα region and ii) J49 located 15 Kb downstream of TEA. Both of the promoters are activated by Eα <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Abarrategui1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Hawwari1">[15]</xref>. Eα controls all the V to J associations whereas the two promoters are required for the rearrangements of the J genes situated at the 5′ end of the Jα region. However, the analyses of TEA-deleted alleles and those of blockade of TEA transcription showed significant alterations in J use and support the hypothesis that the TEA promoter can regulate both positively the promoters located in the first 12 Kb of J genes and negatively the downstream promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Abarrategui1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Hawwari1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Mauvieux1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>A particularity of the TRA locus is an absence of allelic exclusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Marche1">[18]</xref> and its ability to undergo multiple cycles of secondary rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Krangel2">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Petrie1">[20]</xref>. The process of successive rearrangements is stopped by either positive selection, which downregulates recombinase expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Wang1">[21]</xref> or by cell death. Therefore, the impact of secondary rearrangements on the TRα gene assembly regulation remains to be defined.</p>
<p>Regarding the V and J gene use, it is suggested that the first V-J association targets the secondary one into a set of J segments located near the J segment involved in the primary rearrangement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Hawwari2">[16]</xref>. The rules governing the use of the V genes have not been clearly elucidated. Nevertheless, observations converge to a consensus: the use of V segments would progress from proximal V genes, located near the J region, towards the V genes located in the distal region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Pasqual1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-AudeGarcia1">[10]</xref>. At this point in time, the mechanism involved in the control of accessibility of V genes remains to debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Krangel2">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>The current state of the technology permits the analysis of some V-J combinations, essentially those at the extremities of the locus but still fails to establish a complete estimation of the V-J combinations. The main obstacle comes from the fact that some V genes are duplicated in similar copies in the V region central part, making problematic their unambiguous identification by molecular methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Lefranc1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>Consequently, numerical modelling of the V-J recombination process may offer valuable support to overcome the difficulty for accessing to a global view of TRA repertoire. For instance, if the J genes are chosen in a sequential way in the model, their use results unimodal, whereas it is known from experimental data that TRA/TRD locus displays two Hot Spots of recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-JouvinMarche1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Villey1">[5]</xref>. This discrepancy led us to build a mathematical model, parameterized from experimental data, on all V and J genes, including those in distal, proximal, and central positions. Confrontation between the data obtained from experiments and from modelling makes possible an estimation of dynamical parameters, such as the accessibility to rearrangements and the frequencies of the V-J associations, giving a more accurate estimation of the TRA combinatorial diversity.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The goal of building a model representative of the Vα-Jα associations was to reproduce the global biological features of T lymphocyte VαJα rearrangements occurring in the TRA/TRD locus with a software algorithm. This algorithm must be parameterized to find the conditions that reproduce the experimental data. Adequacy between biological and simulated results tells that all the essential aspects of the studied process were included in the model. This modelling approach led us to gather and search for some biological data about the parameters controlling the Vα-Jα rearrangement process in the mouse TRA/TRD locus.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Update of the parameters controlling the mouse TRA/TRD locus utilization during rearrangements by an experimental approach</title>
<p>In order to build the model, we firstly required information about the physical position of the V and J genes in the TRA/TRD locus. These data were provided by IMGT (ImMunoGeneTics database; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imgt.cines.fr/" xlink:type="simple">http://imgt.cines.fr/</ext-link>) and summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t001">Table 1</xref>. In addition, we needed to define parameters such as the opening location (the position where the opening mechanism begins), the opening speed for the access to V and J genes and the opening duration. Two more parameters were added, a first maturation step in order to eliminate the TRD genes and an opening offset as we supposed a certain rigidity of the DNA chain, thus two genes placed very close from each other cannot rearrange together.</p>

<title>Determination of the opening speeds for the V and J regions in the thymus</title>
<p>The data given in the first column of the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t002">Table 2</xref> were obtained from rearrangements at the genomic level in BALB/c mice during thymic ontogeny and resume results presented in a previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Pasqual1">[9]</xref>. These data gave us the ontogeny days where V and J genes were first seen rearranged. In conjunction with physical gene positions, we calculated opening speeds that describe the progression of the accessibility to rearrangements over the Vα and Jα regions. Concerning the Jα region opening speed, in Fetal Fay 18th (F18), rearrangements of V19 with J61 to J48 corresponded to an opening of the J locus of 14773 bp in 24 h, thus the opening speed associated to these 24 h period is estimated to 615 bp/h. The same analysis was applied on F19, F20, and D0 (Day of birth). These data, fully presented in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t002">Table 2</xref>, showed that during ontogeny the opening speed of the J locus varies slightly, between 375 bp/h and 1150 bp/h, corresponding to an average opening speed of about 713 bp/h±3×396 bp/h with a 99.9% confidence interval.</p>

<p>For determining the Vα region opening speed, there were used single member V families at each V region extremity of the TRA/TRD locus. For instance, V1 and V2, the most distal from the J region, as well as V19, V20, and V21, located at the nearest extremity to the J region, were analyzed. We found rearranged proximal V genes from F18, while rearrangements of distal V1 and V2 genes (1300 Kb distant from the proximal V genes) were only detected from D0. Hence, the entire V region takes about 3 days to get wide opened, allowing us to estimate the overall “opening V-speed” as broadly 18 Kb/h (1300 Kb/(3×24 h)) with a 99.9% confidence interval of about 18±3×5 Kb/h.</p>

<title>V-J rearrangements in peripheral T lymphocytes</title>
<p>In order to complete the study of thymus repertoire, we extended the analysis of V-J rearrangements in peripheral T lymphocytes from spleen and lymph nodes of adult mice. We reported the J use of 254 sequences extracted from peripheral T lymphocytes that express V14 on their surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-AudeGarcia1">[10]</xref>. The V14 family is composed of 6 members spread from 1145 Kb to 492 Kb in the V region. The <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g001">Figure 1</xref> A shows the J use by the whole V14 family. This distribution is in accordance with the two Hot Spots reported by Rytkonen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Rytkonen1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Rytkonen2">[23]</xref>, which are indicated by two arrows over the histogram. Indeed, according to Rytkonen <italic>et al.</italic>, the J use distribution presents a preference for the J genes located over two regions named Hot Spots. The first Hot Spot (HSI) is located between J59 and J48 which corresponds to the region controlled by TEA; the second Hot Spot (HSII) is situated between J31 and J22. In addition, the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g001">Figure 1</xref> presents the profiles of J used by the proximal V genes (V14-1, V14-2, and V14-3 on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g001">Fig. 1 B</xref>) and by the distal V genes (V14D-1, V14D-2, and V14D-3 on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g001">Fig. 1 C</xref>). These two histograms show that the proximal V to proximal J associations appear more frequent than the distal to distal associations and that the two Hot Spots are observed.

<p>Simulations were performed using two opening speeds chosen within intervals closed to the experimental 99.9% confidence intervals. For V speed, SV ∈ [0.35 Kb/h, 34 Kb/h] and for J speed, SJ ∈ [0.4 Kb/h, 1.55 Kb/h] with a mean opening speed of about 18 Kb/h for the V region and 1 Kb/h for the J region. The opening location of the simulation was fixed between the V and J genes in order to access directly to the TRAV and TRAJ genes after the first maturation, which was set to allow the elimination of the genes coding for TRD genes (region encompassing TRDV1 to TRDV5). Issues obtained from the modelling which best fit experimental data indicated that firstly, the duration of the first maturation step has a mean value of 5 hours, secondly, the number of successive rearrangements is 3 or 4, and thirdly, the opening duration before each rearrangement is 24 hours. The entire duration for the process of successive rearrangements is then 72 h or 96 h, which is in accordance with our data from ontogeny analyses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t002">Table 2</xref>). When rearrangements were simulated by pairs, in order to account for the synchronization between the two alleles of individual cells, identical results were obtained.</p>

<p>The results of the model simulations and its comparison with the thymic experimental data are presented on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Firstly, we present the global V and J uses in the simulated population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g002">Fig. 2, A and B</xref>). The simulation program provides frequencies of every V to J genes associations in a matrix form. The columns display the J genes and the rows the V genes. Every intersection column/row indicates the frequency of the considered V to J association. It is then possible to sum all the V-J frequencies where a single V gene is implicated by adding the corresponding entire row. By doing this with all of the V genes, the global V region utilization is calculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g002">Fig. 2 A</xref>), and the sums of every matrix columns result in the global J gene utilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g002">Fig. 2 B</xref>). Overall, the uses of the V genes decrease from proximal to distal V genes, and the J region uses decrease from proximal to distal J genes.

<p>Afterwards, we proceeded to quantify V1 and V21 rearrangements with a set of 9 J genes scattered along the J region in the thymus and compared these data with simulated outputs. Both experimental and modelling data show firstly that V1, which is the most distal V, has a low utilization rate of the proximal J genes and rearranges essentially the middle and distal J genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g002">Fig. 2, C, E, and G</xref>) and secondly that V21, which is the most proximal V, is mainly rearranged with the proximal J genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g002">Fig. 2, D, F, and H</xref>), following a Poisson distribution. The global utilization of J by V1 is similar in both experimental and simulated data.

<title>Stimulation model for peripheral T cell repertoire</title>
<p>In order to verify if the simulation model can be applied as a tool to determine the use of the different J by given V, we further quantified the use of 9 J by the 6 members of the V14 family in peripheral T lymphocytes. The resulting 54 V-J combinations, well spread along both the V and J regions, were plotted over the global V-J association 3-D graphic given by the simulated results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). For more precision, we plotted these frequencies of experimentally determined rearrangements over a fitted by 3-cubic spline fitting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g005">Fig. 5 A</xref>) and a not fitted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g005">Fig. 5 B</xref>) surfaces that interpolate the simulated frequencies. The experimental points over the surface appear in red, the ones under the surface appear in green. Beyond this visual adequacy, we demonstrated the accordance between simulated and experimental data by a numerical approach. We distinguished proximal, central and distal parts on the J region. For each of these parts, we compared the percentage of V14 rearrangements from experimental versus simulated data (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t003">Table 3</xref>). The V14 combinations with J61 to J48 represent 37% of the experimental data, and 35% of the simulated data, those with J47 to J24 stands for 46% and 50%, and combinations with J23 to J1 represent 17% and 15% of experimental and simulated data respectively. Noticeably, when the sums of simulated rearrangements are extended to all V, the uses of the J localized in the proximal, central and distal parts of the locus are in the same range than those found with V14 genes (last column of the <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t003">Table 3</xref>).

<title>New insights in the VJ repertoire given by the model simulations</title>
<p>Based on our modelling study, four features concerning the V-J rearrangement process emerge. First of all, concerning the frequencies of the associations, the main information supplied by the model is that 96% (4704 out of 4900) of the V-J associations are probable. Hence, two areas where V-J combinations rarely occur could be defined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>): the “A” area as associations between proximal V and distal J and the “B” area as associations between distal V and proximal J. These occasional associations are a consequence of a non-synchronized availability for rearrangements of the concerned V and J genes, as already documented in experimental data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Thompson1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Davodeau1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Krangel2">[19]</xref>. Secondly, the model gives estimation for the frequencies of each V-J combination building the whole combinatorial repertoire shape. In the third place, the model states the influence of the Recombination Signal Sequence (RSS) on the V-J association distribution, which remains until now debated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Glusman1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Livak1">[26]</xref>. For that purpose, we ran simulations with and without taking into account the RSS scores (available in IMGT). The 2D graphs of the V14 family repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g004">Fig. 4, A and B</xref>) show that introducing variations accordingly to the RSS scores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g004">Fig. 4 B</xref>) does not drastically affect the shape of the global repertoire distribution but leads to a local effect on certain J genes. The algorithm for choosing the J genes regarding their RSS score values has been favorably tested by using the Monte Carlo method. In the fourth place, the model provides information on the contribution of each wave of successive rearrangements to account for the total of V-J associations. Therefore, we tested the occurrence of 1 to 6 successive rearrangements in simulations. With 1 or 2 rearrangements, only the proximal V to proximal J associations are observed. With 5 or more rearrangements, the repertoire presents a distal border effect, corresponding to numerous rearrangements of the distal V and distal J regions, which are incoherent with experimental data. In conclusion, the overall repertoire generated by the simulation is in accordance with experimental data only by allowing 3 to 4 rearrangements, with a delay of 24 hours per rearrangement. Moreover, the contribution of each wave of successive rearrangements appears to decrease accordingly to their rank; 40% of the overall V-J associations is produced by the first wave of rearrangements, 33%, 19% and 8% come from the subsequent rearrangement waves respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Robustness of the model</title>
<p>To assure that the sampling size used in simulations was sufficient, we checked the representativeness of the repertoire by making sets of simulations ranging from 10<sup>2</sup> to 1.5×10<sup>6</sup> rearrangements. We found that diversity became relevant when the population size was higher than 5×10<sup>5</sup> rearrangements. This showed the pertinence of a repertoire calculation based on a 10<sup>6</sup> alpha chains population. A combinatorial diversity graph is plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g006">Figure 6</xref>. Variations of about 5 to 10% in the values of the parameters (such as the intervals of the opening speeds Sv and Sj, opening duration, and offset) provided simulation results in concordance with the experimental data. However, larger variations in the values of the parameters induced major deviations (not shown) on the modelling simulation results compared to experimental data.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This article focuses on a new approach to account for the features of the V to J rearrangement process in the TRA/TRD locus as well as to give a first estimation of the combinational repertoire in a 3-dimension representation. To accomplish this purpose, we have defined a mathematical model fitting experimental observations obtained from T lymphocytes rearrangements in the thymus. Jointly, the experimental data and the mathematical model made possible the interpretation of the mouse T-cell alpha chain repertoire characteristics. The evolution of the shapes for the V-J rearrangement frequencies in the simulations, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g007">Figure 7</xref>, showed a transient bi-modal shape corresponding to the Hot Spots of V-J recombinations as observed in our experimental data and literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Rytkonen1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-AudeGarcia1">[10]</xref>. Furthermore, the model results also fit with V-J rearrangements obtained from T lymphocytes of the periphery. Therefore, our model provides a major improvement to previous attempts of simulation of the TRA combinatorial repertoire building <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Warmflash1">[27]</xref>.</p>

<p>The scheme shows the rearrangement distribution of 4 V genes with all J genes. The dashed red arrow indicates the decreasing frequency of rearrangements which correlates with the associations of distal V and J genes. A distal V gene is very rarely rearranged with proximal J genes because of the high recombination frequency between proximal V and J genes, leading to the proximal J genes deletion. 1) the first step governing the TRA/TRD locus utilization is defined by the opening of the most proximal V-J region, 2) According that T cells can undergo 1 to 3 secondary rearrangements, the second step giving the V and J accessible windows, is defined by the opening speeds of V and J regions. V speed is about 18 Kb/h whereas J speed is about 1 Kb/h, 3) J region has two Hot Spots of rearrangement. HSI is centred on J48 and HSII is centred on J30.</p>

<title>Opening velocities and gene density</title>
<p>Our model is based on the fact that V and J regions are used in a progressive and decreasing manner from 3′ to 5′ for the V region and from 5′ to 3′ for the J region. Our quantitative approach points out that the physical position of the genes is the main structural parameter governing the uses of V and J genes. The J and V regions become accessible from proximal to distal genes according to an average “opening speed” of approximately 1 Kb/h for the J region and around 18 Kb/h for the V region. Interestingly, this difference between the V and J region opening speed values can be related to the gene density. In fact, the number of genes and the size of the V and J regions differ significantly. As a matter of fact, the V region length is 20 times larger than the J one (∼1300 Kb versus ∼60 Kb), but the density of J genes is about 10 times higher than the density of the V genes (1 J by Kb versus 0.13 V by Kb). Consequently, the opening speeds calculated in terms of genes per hour is 1.4 for the V region and 0.83 for the J region (calculated as follows: the number of genes in the locus times the speed in Kb per hour, then divided by the length of the locus). Finally, taking into account the gene density of each region, the opening speeds of the V and J regions are almost identical. Our observations reinforce two putative scenarios being previously proposed to explain the opening of the J and V regions respectively. The first one, the J local service scenario was proposed for the J region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Guo1">[28]</xref>. It consists in a J use that follows small steps during the successive rearrangements. This local service is controlled by promoter activities associated to some of the other J genes. The second one, the V region express service proposes a large window for the gene accessibility to rearrangements controlled by enhancer activity. It reflects the larger utilization of a V region, whose genes are more scattered than those in the J one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Pasqual1">[9]</xref>. In addition, the speed calculations also take into consideration the regulatory elements controlling the gene accessibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Osipovich1">[29]</xref>. As a remark, a parametric study with different speed values indicates that the proposed speeds are the only ones allowing a use of V and J regions correlating precisely with the experimental results.</p>

<title>Combinatorial repertoire distribution</title>
<p>Given that the totality of the V-J combination frequencies is computable in the framework of our model, we can visualize the whole simulated TRA combinatorial repertoire and thus estimate each V-J association frequency. Indeed, the probability of any combination is given by selecting a specific V-J combination on the 3D graph (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>). <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000682-t005">Table 5</xref> displays the probability of nine V-J combinations selected along the locus. Regarding the positions of the V and J genes over the locus, the probability of association varies between 0.01 for any V to distal J and 0.198 for any V to proximal J, highlighting the fact that a V to proximal J combination is about 20 times more probable than a V to distal J association.</p>

<p>Moreover, this 3D graphic points out that one central area in the V-J association plane contains the most represented combinations of the repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>). Furthermore, two areas (A and B in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>) reveal rarely represented V-J combinations, due to the fact that the V and J genes involved in these combinations are not accessible to get rearranged simultaneously. Concerning the A area, when the proximal J genes are recombining, the distal V genes are still inaccessible, and when they become accessible, the proximal J genes are deleted because of previous rearrangements. Similarly, on the B area, the non-synchronized accessibility of the proximal V genes and the distal J genes explains that their associations are not observed in the simulation.</p>

<title>The J region use confirms the existence of two Hot Spots</title>
<p>The progressive opening mechanism over the TRA locus provides V-J combinations that show a specific pattern; each given V gene is rearranged with a contiguous set of J genes. The distribution of these J genes presents a Poissonian distribution for the proximal V genes or a Gaussian shape for the distal V genes. The changes in the J use are progressive, depending on the V position: the more distal is a V gene, the more distal and larger is the set of J genes used, and the less represented are these V-J associations in the whole V-J repertoire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g003">Fig. 3 C</xref>). There are two main probabilistic bases for the occurrence of the Hot Spots in the J region observed in the simulation results. The successive rearrangements are achieved by consecutive random choices of J genes, considering the progression of their access to recombination and optionally their RSS score values. The first J gene choice, corresponding to the first rearrangement, follows a Poissonian law whereas individually the two other J gene choices follow a Gaussian law (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Altogether, the consecutive random choices of J genes build a multimodal curve of occurrence, which allows the appearance of two Hot Spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g008">Fig. 8, solid line</xref>). The first Hot Spot results from the Poisson's distribution of the first J choice and the second one from the Gaussian distributions of the subsequent J choices. Moreover, it is important to remark that the density of J genes in the TRA locus is not uniform: J genes are less dense between J58-J47, J39-J28, and J14-J4, whereas they have a higher density between J45-J40 and J24-J15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g009">Fig. 9</xref>). The J gene density reaches its maximum in the area around J21-J22, corresponding to the place of the second Hot Spot. Interestingly, we observed the Hot Spots when the model parameter values were in the range where the opening dynamics allowed more frequent rearrangements within the areas of maximal gene density.</p>

<title>Number of secondary rearrangements</title>
<p>Secondary V-J rearrangements of the TRA/TRD locus are widely accepted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Petrie1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Wang1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Guo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Huang1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-RytkonenNissinen1">[31]</xref>. However, the number of plausible secondary rearrangements remains unknown. Our model predicts that after the first maturation step of the TRA/TRD locus, consisting in the elimination of the TRD genes, the first V-J rearrangement of TRA is followed by a maximum of three secondary rearrangements. Nevertheless, each round of rearrangement contributes differently in the building of the whole repertoire, decreasing after each wave, and consequently, the fourth rearrangements have a weak contribution of 8%. This estimation of 4 total rearrangements is based on a realistic model including opening speeds from ontogenic experiments and may be more precise than Warmflash theoretical model's results that proposes a higher number of successive rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Warmflash1">[27]</xref>. It is important to consider that the number of secondary rearrangements can be affected by the lifespan of the rearranging T lymphocytes. For instance, the RORγ-deficient mice, presenting a shorter lifespan of DP thymocytes, show essentially proximal J genes rearranged, while Bcl-xL–transgenic mice, having DP with a longer lifespan, present a higher rate of distal J genes rearranged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Guo1">[28]</xref>.</p>

<title>RSS influence</title>
<p>Regarding the Recombination Signal Sequence (RSS) influence, our model is able to incorporate the RSS diversity information through scores. The simulations using these RSS scores show a local quantitative influence but do not change the global profile of the frequency curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g005">Fig. 5, A and B</xref>). In conclusion, the RSSs may only influence local specificities within the accessibility windows moving across the TRA/TRD locus in a bi-directional way. This is in good accordance with mouse TRB locus observations showing that V gene RSSs neither correlate with any particular restriction of J genes nor with any high V-J rearrangement frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Wilson1">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>The sequential windowing model: a tool to determine the peripheral V-J association frequencies</title>
<p>We previously observed experimentally and tested statistically that the thymic and the peripheral repertoires showed similar profiles of J uses by the V14 family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-AudeGarcia1">[10]</xref>. When we compared the experimental data of the uses of J genes by the V14 family members we found that the J use profiles fitted our model results. It is acknowledged that the V14 is a multimember family and may be representative of the J use by different V genes. Finally, our data suggest that the model would be used as a tool to determine the V-J association frequencies in the peripheral T lymphocytes.</p>
<p>All these remarks support the realistic character of our model, which includes the essential features of the V-J rearrangement process in the TRA/TRD locus. In conclusion, the combination of experimental and mathematical approaches gives new insights on combinatorial repertoire biases due to non-equiprobable V-J combinations in TRA/TRD rearrangements, and allows defining more accurately the TRA/TRD primary combinatorial repertoire. In the future, the model could be adapted to other loci and other species, to propose accurate estimations of the V-J combinatorial diversity, giving a dynamical vision of the immune diversity generation during differentiation of T cells and B lymphocytes.</p>

<title>Description of the computational model</title>
<p>Our <bold>sequential windowing model</bold> is a specific model of successive windows, each step corresponding to a differential motion of the window extremities, with opening velocity faster on the V side than on the J one. The simulation of the V-J rearrangements in the TRA/TRD locus is based on a computational occurrence discrete model using parameters determined from experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000682-g010">Fig. 10</xref>). The model consists in dynamical rules depending on constant (structural) and experimental parameters. The constant parameters are the physical positions of the 100 V and 49 J functional genes and the first TRA/TRD locus opening points. The varying parameters (whose sensitivity will be studied by simulation) are the opening speed intervals of the V and J regions, the opening duration before each rearrangement, and the opening offset.</p>

<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p><bold>The physical positions of V and J genes in the TRA/TRD locus</bold> are calculated by measuring the genomic distance from the TRAC chain.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold>The first maturation step</bold> is fixed before the first rearrangement allowing the deletion of the region encompassing TRDV1 to TRDV5 including the TRD locus. Its duration value is a constant parameter, which was determined by simulation varying values between 0 hours and 10 hours.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold>The opening location</bold> describes the site where the opening mechanism begins. This site is fixed at the TEA location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-deChasseval1">[35]</xref>.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold>The opening speeds</bold> of the V and J genes calculated above are denoted respectively by S<sub>V</sub> and S<sub>J</sub>. They are random variables between a minimum and a maximum. Each TCRA locus is simulated independently to be consistent with the absence of allelic exclusion. Furthermore, rearrangements were also simulated by pairs using the same V and J opening speeds, in order to account for the synchronization between the two alleles of individual cells.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold>The Opening duration before each rearrangement</bold> is a constant parameter whose value was determined through simulations, by varying values between 2 hours and 50 hours.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>N denotes the number of authorized <bold>secondary rearrangements</bold> during the simulation. It is a varying parameter as well, values between N = 0 to N = 6 were studied by simulations.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The <bold>probability to perform an in-frame rearrangement</bold> at any step k (1≤k≤N) is fixed to 1/3 that is the maximal possible value. If the rearrangement is randomly determined in-frame, the procedure is stopped for this locus and the V-J association generated is stored. If the simulation gives an out-of frame rearrangement at the step k, a new secondary rearrangement is randomly executed at the step k+1 on the available part of the locus. The new window of accessibility is calculated in base of the “<bold>opening speeds</bold>” and the <bold>“opening duration before each rearrangement”</bold> parameters. This successive rearrangement procedure remains until either an in-frame rearrangement occurs or k equals the maximum number of rearrangements N.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>We refer to the length of the window of accessible DNA over the V region at a step k as LV<sub>k</sub> (and LJ<sub>k</sub> for the J window length), These windows progress from the proximal to distal extremities of the TRA/TRD locus V and J regions. The LVs and LJs verify the equations:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000682.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where the opening offset time t<sub>0</sub> denotes a minimal time of opening and τ<sub>k</sub> (k≥1) are random variables uniformly distributed between t<sub>0</sub> and the end of the opening process.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>For every rearrangement occurrence, we define for each gene V<sub>i</sub> (J<sub>j</sub> respectively) a Boolean variable BV<sub>ik</sub> (resp. BJ<sub>jk</sub>) equal at the k<sup>th</sup> rearrangement to 1 if the gene is open (“accessible”), and to 0 if it is closed (“non-accessible”) or if it has been deleted during a previous rearrangement of order i (i&lt;k).</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>The RSS score KV<sub>i</sub> (resp. KJ<sub>j</sub>) represents for each gene V<sub>i</sub> (J<sub>j</sub> respectively) the homology percentage compared to a consensus sequence. This score basically takes value p, 0≤p≤1, if there is p % of identity between the RSS and the consensus proposed by Glusman <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000682-Glusman1">[25]</xref>, allowing us to estimate a RSS identity score ranging from 0.3 to 1, where 1 corresponds to a fully consensus RSS (see additional data). Our RSS score is in agreement with the status of functional versus pseudo V or J gene (0.3&lt; pseudo rearrangement score &lt;0.65; 0.65&lt; functional score &lt;1). According to its non-functional status, a J-pseudo recombination is never found rearranged and consequently the corresponding J-RSS score is assimilated to zero in simulations. RSS score is equal to 1 when simulation is done without taking account the RSS. We call FV<sub>k</sub> (resp. FJ<sub>k</sub>) the distribution function (i.e., the relative length) obtained after the k<sup>th</sup> rearrangement by adding the BV (resp. BJ) variables:<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000682.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula></p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>At step k, we choose the distribution functions FV<sub>k</sub> and FJ<sub>k</sub> corresponding to the random variables RV<sub>k</sub> (resp. RJ<sub>k</sub>) uniform on [0,1] and we calculate a number NVk (resp.NJk) equal to inf(FV<sub>k</sub><sup>−1</sup>(RV<sub>k</sub>)) (resp. inf(FJ<sub>k</sub><sup>−1</sup>(RJ<sub>k</sub>))). NVk and NJk corresponding to the V and J genes to rearrange.</p>

<p>The <bold>number of simulated TRAD loci</bold> gives the size of the simulated population. In the figures shown in this paper, 1 million of V-J rearrangements have been simulated.</p>
<p>The <bold>simulation Output</bold> is presented in a matrix form incremented by the successive V-J in-frame rearrangements. Final results show the total number of V-J combinations available at the end of the whole simulation. These results can be plotted in different 3D representations using the interface.
