<abstract>
<p>Translation of hundreds of small ORFs (smORFs) of less than 100 amino acids has recently been revealed in vertebrates and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Some of these peptides have essential and conserved cellular functions. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have predicted a particular smORF class encoding ~80 aa hydrophobic peptides, which may function in membranes and cell organelles. Here, we characterise <italic>hemotin</italic>, a gene encoding an 88aa transmembrane smORF peptide localised to early endosomes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages. <italic>hemotin</italic> regulates endosomal maturation during phagocytosis by repressing the cooperation of 14-3-3Œ∂ with specific phosphatidylinositol (PI) enzymes. <italic>hemotin</italic> mutants accumulate undigested phagocytic material inside enlarged endo-lysosomes and as a result, <italic>hemotin</italic> mutants have reduced ability to fight bacteria, and hence, have severely reduced life span and resistance to infections. We identify Stannin, a peptide involved in organometallic toxicity, as the Hemotin functional homologue in vertebrates, showing that this novel regulator of phagocytic processing is widely conserved, emphasizing the significance of smORF peptides in cell biology and disease.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In our genomes there are millions of short open reading frames that could produce small peptides of less than 100 amino-acids if translated. These sequences have been so far disregarded, but increasing evidence supports the notion that a subset of these‚Äìtermed smORFs‚Äìare translated; however the function of most of the resulting peptides remains unclear. Here we characterise <italic>hemotin</italic>, a smORF gene that encodes a transmembrane peptide of 88 amino-acids expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages, and we show that Hemotin localizes to early endosomes‚Äìvesicles involved in the traffic of material between the cell membrane and the cytoplasm. Macrophages found in <italic>hemotin</italic> mutants have enlarged and abnormal endosomes that delay digestion of phagocytosed bacteria. Accordingly, these mutant flies fight bacterial infections poorly, and die early. In humans we identify Stannin‚Äìa peptide previously involved in heavy metal toxicity‚Äìas the Hemotin homologue, and show that it shares Hemotin function in macrophages. These results identify the Hemotin-Stannin smORF peptides as regulators of phagocytosis, and suggest that they could have contributed to the ancestral origin of macrophage-like cells. This provides a strong example of a smORF conserved for hundreds of millions of years.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Multicellular organisms contain specialised cells in appropriate parts of the body, performing tasks that allow the formation and maintenance of a fully functional organism. This specialisation relies upon the modification of basic cellular processes, for example enhanced cytoskeletal mechanics in muscle cells, or enhanced endocytic activity in phagocytic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref001">1</xref>]. At the molecular level, such modifications rely on tissue-specific gene products that regulate specific cell biology and physiology pathways. These regulators offer great promise as specific therapeutic targets, yet for many tissues we still ignore their identity and mechanism of action. Some unidentified cell regulators might be proteins whose functions have not been investigated yet; alternatively, some might be encoded by noncanonical gene products, such as peptides encoded by small Open Reading Frames (smORFs) of less than 100 amino acids.</p>
<p>smORFs have been largely disregarded by genome annotations and considered nonfunctional, but recently a number of ribosomal profiling and peptidomics studies have highlighted the apparent translation of hundreds of smORFs in the genomes of animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref002">2</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref004">4</xref>]. However, the functionality of these smORFs remains an open question, although a few smORFs have been studied and characterised functionally [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref005">5</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref008">8</xref>]; reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref010">10</xref>]. Recently, we described a class of smORFs of about 80 codons long with a propensity to encode hydrophobic peptides with predicted alpha helix domains that localise to membranes and cell organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref003">3</xref>]. The few examples of these smORFs with annotated function are widely expressed and involved in housekeeping processes, such as oxidative phosphorylation in mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref003">3</xref>], but in principle these hydrophobic smORFs have the capacity to act as regulators in other membrane-based cellular processes, as the <italic>sarcolamban/sarcolipin</italic> smORF family of calcium signalling regulators illustrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we characterize <italic>hemotin</italic> (<italic>hemo</italic>), a tissue-specific smORF gene, which belongs to this class of smORFs, encoding an 88aa peptide with alpha-helical domains. <italic>hemo</italic> is expressed in hemocytes (<italic>Drosophila</italic> macrophages), where it regulates endosomal maturation during phagocytosis, the specific function of this histotype.</p>
<p>Hemocytes are the main component of the cellular branch of the insect immune system, and like vertebrate macrophages, they are professional phagocytes tasked with removing dying cells and microorganisms invading the body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref012">12</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref015">15</xref>]. Although phagocytosis is a basic and ancestral cellular function that predates multicellularity, this function is greatly enhanced in these ‚Äúprofessional‚Äù phagocytes. The molecular mechanisms underlying this cellular specialisation are actively studied, and have shown a surprising degree of conservation between insects and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref017">17</xref>]. Central to phagocytosis seems to be the formation of the phagosome, a specialised endocytic vesicle containing the phagocytosed material [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref016">16</xref>], and its subsequent maturation and degradation through the endolysosomal pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref018">18</xref>]. This processing requires basic endocytic components but also specific proteins and regulators, whose identity and functions are not yet fully clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref016">16</xref>]. Furthermore, pathogenic microorganisms are often able to override this cellular defence of phagocytes by interfering with the processing and maturation of the endo-phagolysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref019">19</xref>]. Here, we show that regulation of endocytic maturation by Hemotin is essential for hemocytes to digest phagocytosed bacteria effectively. Removal of <italic>hemo</italic> compromises the ability of the animal to clear bacteria from the body and severely reduces lifespan.</p>
<p>Molecularly, endosomal maturation requires ‚Äúmolecular labels‚Äù for the sorting of membrane vesicles into their appropriate endocytic compartments and their processing by fusion with appropriate organelles such as lysosomes. Some of these labels are provided by distinct phosphorylated states of Phosphatidylinositol (PI). In early endosomes, PI is phosphorylated to form PI(3)P (phosphatidylinositol-3-phosphate), which is required for endosomes to progress through the maturation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref020">20</xref>]. This phosphorylation step is mediated by PI(3) kinases such as class II PI3K68D (Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase 68D) and class III Vps34 (Phosphatidylinositol 3 kinase Vps34), whereas the reverse dephosphorylation of PI(3)P is mediated by phosphatases such as Myotubularin (Mtm) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref021">21</xref>]. Here, we show that Hemotin peptides bind and repress the adaptor protein 14-3-3Œ∂, and that in turn, 14-3-3Œ∂ binds and promotes the function of PI3K68D. Thus, the <italic>hemo</italic> gene indirectly represses the PI3K68D-mediated labelling of early endosomes and this regulates subsequent steps of phagocytic processing.</p>
<p>We also observe that this regulatory mechanism is conserved across evolution. We have identified Stannin (Snn), encoded by a smORF of 88 codons, as the vertebrate homologue of Hemotin. The <italic>snn</italic> gene had been previously characterised as a mediator of cytotoxicity by organometallic compounds such as tri-methyl-tin (TMT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref022">22</xref>]. Our results show that Stannin is a functional homologue of Hemotin in fly hemocytes and mouse macrophages. Thus, we postulate that the previously unknown, nontoxic, and endogenous role of Stannin is also to modulate endosomal maturation by inhibiting the 14-3-3Œ∂-mediated stimulation of PI kinase function. Our results add to the body of evidence revealing the homology between the innate immune system of vertebrates and invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref017">17</xref>], by identifying a new conserved member of this system with an essential pathogen-fighting activity. Hemotin/Stannin is, thus, a new example of a smORF conserved across vast evolutionary distances and fulfilling an important cellular regulatory function, suggesting that the structure-function conservation of the <italic>sarcolamban-sarcolipin</italic> smORF family from invertebrates to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref007">7</xref>] is likely not to be an exception, but an example of a wider trend.</p>

Bottom: schematic representation of other constructs used in this manuscript. <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF is a minigene consisting of an mRNA fragment truncated immediately after the <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF stop codon, ORF2 consists of a mini-gene construct carrying the ORF2 sequence only, including 6 nt upstream of its start codon (to conserve its endogenous Kozak sequence). <italic>hemo</italic>-GFP (green fluorescent protein) is a <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF-GFP fusion construct in which the GFP sequence (devoid of a start codon) was cloned into the <italic>hemoFL</italic> construct, immediately downstream and in frame with <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF (devoid of a stop codon) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>).

<p>We assayed expression of <italic>hemo</italic> throughout development by reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) and found that transcription of <italic>hemo</italic> is temporally regulated, showing higher expression from prepupal to adult stages, in agreement with modEncode RNAseq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s008">S1 File;Flybase</xref>). However, <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation also showed that <italic>hemo</italic> is specifically expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos in a pattern similar to <italic>crq</italic>, a hemocyte-specific marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1C‚Äì1F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref026">26</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref028">28</xref>]. Accordingly, <italic>hemo</italic> was detected by RT-PCR from prepupal hemocyte RNA extractions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Hemocytes are fly macrophages involved in the engulfment of cellular corpses throughout development, and they are the cellular branch of the fly innate immune system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>To elucidate the function of <italic>hemo</italic>, we generated a deletion of the locus by FRT-mediated recombination using the <italic>P(RS3)fray CB-0706-3</italic> and <italic>PBac(WH)fru f02684</italic> P-element insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref029">29</xref>]. This deletion (<italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup>) removes the entire <italic>hemo</italic> locus, <italic>CG7691</italic>, and also one 5‚Äô noncoding exon of each of the <italic>frayed (fray)</italic> and <italic>fruitless</italic> (<italic>fru</italic>) genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s002">S1C Fig</xref>). Homozygous <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutants reached adulthood and did not show overt morphological defects; however, their hemocytes exhibited a more vacuolated morphology in comparison to wild-type controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s002">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>). The vacuolated phenotype in <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocytes was reflected in the microtubule cytoskeleton, and the volume of the vacuoles was significantly larger than those present in wild-type hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1I, 1J and 1O</xref>).</p>
<p>Further genetic analysis corroborates that this hemocyte phenotype in <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> is specific to loss of the Hemotin peptide. The <italic>fru</italic> and <italic>fray</italic> genes have functions in dimorphic sexual behaviour and nerve fasciculation, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref030">30</xref>]. We discarded them as candidates for providing the requirement for hemocyte vacuolation since <italic>fru</italic> was not expressed in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s008">S1 File</xref>), and the function of <italic>fray</italic> is provided by a shorter transcript containing the coding exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), whose expression was not affected in the <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s008">S1 File</xref>). In agreement with this, the <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> and <italic>fray</italic><sup><italic>PZ07551</italic></sup> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref025">25</xref>] complemented each other giving rise to hemocytes with normal vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1O</xref>) and larvae with normally fasciculated nerves (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s009">S2 File</xref>). For the <italic>CG7691</italic> gene, we generated a 12 Kb genomic construct containing its coding and upstream regulatory regions. Hemocytes carrying this <italic>CG7691</italic> genomic fragment (GF) in a <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant background expressed <italic>CG7691</italic> at wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s008">S1 File</xref>) but still possessed large vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1O</xref>), indicating that deletion of <italic>CG7691</italic> in <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> is not the cause of hemocyte vacuolation. In contrast, loss of function and rescue experiments pinpoint the <italic>hemo</italic> transcript as responsible for these vacuolation phenotypes. First, reduction of <italic>hemo</italic> RNA expression with a ds-RNA construct (<italic>UAS-hemo-RNAi</italic>) in hemocytes produced enlarged vacuoles mimicking the <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1K and 1O</xref>). Second, expression of the <italic>hemo</italic> full-length transcript rescued <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1L and 1O</xref>), whereas expression of the same construct carrying a frame-shift in each ORF, which produces scrambled peptides, did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1O</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, we assessed the contribution of each ORF to <italic>hemo</italic> function. Expression of UAS-minigenes containing <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1M and 1O</xref>) or <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF-GFP (green fluorescent protein-tagged peptides (<italic>hemo</italic>-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1O</xref>) rescued the vacuolated <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> phenotype, whereas <italic>UAS-ORF2</italic> did not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1B, 1N and 1O</xref>), indicating that the peptide encoded by <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF represents the functional unit of the gene in this context. Poly-Ribo-Seq data from <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref003">3</xref>] indicated high translation of <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF but a lower, or non-productive, rate of ORF2 translation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Finally, carboxyl terminal-tagged GFP fusions of each peptide in a full-length transcript only showed expression of Hemo-GFP, which localized to intracellular membrane structures in S2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s009">S2 File</xref>) and Kc167 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s002">S1F‚ÄìS1F‚Äù Fig</xref>). We could only detect ORF2-GFP peptides from an ORF2-GFP fusion in a short transcript minigene that excludes <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s009">S2 File</xref>). Thus, although ORF2 does show potential for translation, altogether our results support that the 88aa transmembrane peptide encoded by <italic>hemo</italic>-ORF alone provides the requirement for normal vacuolation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes.</p>

<p>We have used further endocytic markers to ascertain the nature and integrity of the acidic compartments in <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> null hemocytes. The <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> enlarged acidic intracellular organelles show an extensive overlap of early and late endocytic markers: FYVE (a PI(3)P-binding zinc finger domain, early endosomal marker, named after being found in Fab1, YOTP, Vac1, EEA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref031">31</xref>]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2B and 2B‚Äô and 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2E and S2E‚Äô Fig</xref>), Rab7 (late endosomal marker) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2C‚ÄìS2C‚Äô, S2E‚ÄìS2E‚Äô Fig</xref>), and Lysotracker (acidic organelle marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2B, 2B‚Äù and 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2C and S2C‚Äù Fig</xref>) in comparison with wild-type hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2C‚Äì2C‚Äù and 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2B‚ÄìS2B‚Äù and S2D‚ÄìS2D‚Äù Fig</xref>). This combination of early and late markers identifies the enlarged compartments as aberrant endolysosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref021">21</xref>]. We quantified the occupied FYVE area index (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) and the average diameter of FYVE vesicles (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocytes showed larger FYVE compartments containing larger vesicles than wild-type. Expression of <italic>UAS-hemo</italic> full-length transcript, <italic>UAS-hemo-ORF</italic>, and <italic>UAS-hemo-GFP</italic> constructs rescued these phenotypes, whereas expression of a <italic>UAS-hemo frame-shift</italic>, <italic>UAS-ORF2</italic> and a <italic>CG7691 GF</italic> constructs failed to do so (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The simplest interpretation of our results is that Hemotin peptides are required for completing the maturation of at least some early-to-late endosomes, and hence for their subsequent endolysosomal degradation.</p>
<p>Other disruptions of this traffic could also perturb endosomal maturation, since endolysosomal homeostasis depends on the balance between trafficking of membrane from the endocytic pathway (influx) and exit of membrane (efflux) into early recycling compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref018">18</xref>]. We explored whether the membrane efflux to early recycling compartments was disrupted in <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutants by visualizing Rab11, a marker of recycling endosomes. In <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocytes, the size of Rab11-positive compartments seemed normal in comparison with wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2F‚ÄìS2F‚Äô and S2G‚ÄìS2G‚Äô Fig</xref>), suggesting that membrane efflux to early recycling compartments is not grossly affected. Thus, the role of Hemotin peptides seems to focus at promoting early to late endosomal maturation.</p>
<p>To corroborate this hypothesis, we ascertained the precise subcellular localisation of Hemotin peptides in hemocytes. The Hemo-GFP peptides, which are functional and able to rescue <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g001">Fig 1B and 1O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), localised to early endosomes, as shown by their colocalization with the FYVE marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2F and 2G‚Äì2G‚Äù</xref>) and HRS proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2H‚ÄìS2H‚Äù Fig</xref>) but only limited colocalization with the late endocytic marker Lysotracker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2F and 2H‚Äì2H‚Äù</xref>). Thus, the <italic>in vivo</italic> Hemotin peptide localization correlates with their inferred role in promoting endosomal maturation.</p>
<p>Hemotin‚Äôs requirement in endolysosomal maturation could be related to the digestion of phagocytic materials and hence have an effect on immune defence and individual survival. We analysed <italic>ex vivo</italic> the ability of hemocytes to phagocytise and digest bacteria by monitoring uptake of pHrodo-<italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> bacterial particles, which fluoresce in acidic compartments such as endolysosomes, while simultaneously revealing early endosomes with the FYVE marker (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g003">Fig 3A‚Äì3E</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s012">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s013">S2 Videos</xref>). <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocytes internalised pHrodo particles at similar rate to wild-type hemocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s004">S3A Fig</xref>), indicating that the initial phagocytic uptake is not affected. However, in the <italic>hemo</italic> mutants, the internalised particles acidified at a slower rate and to a lesser degree, and remained for longer in FYVE-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g003">Fig 3A‚Äì3E</xref>), suggesting a reduced ability of <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocytes to digest phagocytosed material. Such impairment could compromise the mutant fly‚Äôs ability to deal with invading and commensal microorganisms, especially for those usually cleared through phagocytosis by hemocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref034">34</xref>].

(t0) represents the time when the particle docks into the cell membrane, displaying a relatively faint intensity. By t = 6 minutes (min), the pHrodo particles are in FYVE-positive early endocytic vesicles in both wild-type (A) and <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocytes (B). By t = 22 min in the wild-type hemocyte (A), the FYVE signal around the particle is dramatically reduced, while the intensity of the pHrodo signal increases, suggesting that the vesicle has progressed into a PI3P-depeleted and acidified endolysosome. In the <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocyte (B), the FYVE signal around the particle is still visible at t = 44 min, showing an increased prevalence of PI(3)P in this vesicle, and therefore an extended early endocytic phase. However, the intensity of the pHrodo signal is lower than in wild-type, indicating a delay in the acidification of the endocytic vesicles (See also C and D). The insets show a magnification of the specific particles. Scale bars = 5 Œºm.

A two-way ANOVA analysis with Bonferroni post test indicates that the difference between these curves is significantly different from t = 16.5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001). (E) Quantification of FYVE prevalence on pHrodo particles undergoing phagocytosis in wild-type (blue) or <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant (red) hemocytes.

Wild-type and mutant flies exhibit a similar number of bacterial cells per hemocyte after 20 min; however, this number increases in mutant flies after 120 min, whereas it remains constant in wild-type flies, suggesting that mutant hemocytes accumulate undigested bacterial cells. Yellow dashed lines represent the cell body outline. (J) Quantification of bacterial uptake. <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant hemocytes contain a similar number of bacterial cells as wild-type after 20 min but significantly more bacterial cells after 120 min.

<p>These results suggest that <italic>hemo</italic> mutants have a reduced cellular immunity. However, their humoral immunity (driven by antibacterial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref013">13</xref>]) does not seem affected. <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> median life span after infection with pathogenic bacteria such as <italic>Micrococcus luteus</italic> and <italic>Enterobacter cloacae</italic>, which overcome hemocytes but fully engage the humoral production of antibacterial peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref034">34</xref>], was not significantly affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s004">S3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s004">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>), and accordingly the production of antibacterial peptides in <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutants was not impaired (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s008">S1 File</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, our results suggest that Hemotin peptides in the early endosomes of fly macrophages are required for normal phagocytic processing and that absence of these peptides results in abnormal and slower maturation and degradation of phagocytic materials. In turn, this abnormal phagocytic processing reduces the ability of the organism to fight off bacteria and has a direct impact on fly immunity and viability.</p>

<title>3‚ÄîHemotin and Vertebrate Stannin Belong to a Conserved Family</title>
<p>To elucidate the molecular function of the Hemotin peptide, we searched for similarity to known structural domains using the Phyre2 engine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref035">35</xref>]. The human Stannin peptide is encoded by an 88aa smORF-like Hemotin and appeared as a possible match (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Structural analyses of the Stannin peptide suggest a transmembrane peptide containing two alpha helices, an N-terminal one that spans the lipid bilayer and a C-terminal helix at the cytosolic side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref036">36</xref>], and our independent analysis of the Hemotin sequence using a transmembrane topology prediction program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref037">37</xref>] also revealed a very similar potential transmembrane alpha-helical domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s002">S1B Fig</xref>).

The ‚ÄúConservation‚Äù lane at the bottom reflects the conservation of physical‚Äìchemical properties in the amino acids, while the ‚ÄúQuality‚Äù lane scores the likelihood of observing the mutations displayed in each particular position of the alignment. Note that there exists high conservation in the transmembrane domain (blue) motif among these peptides. The N-terminal transmembrane and C-terminal alpha-helix domains are indicated below the alignment. Sequences studied in C) (see below) are highlighted with stars. (B) Cladistic guide tree showing the relationships between insect Hemotin and vertebrate Stannin peptides shown in (A). The Hemotin and Stannin sequences cluster with their respective counterparts from related species. Insect Hemotin sequences are branched into two main clusters, one represented by flies and the other by hymenopterans, with other dipterans such as mosquitoes being between these two. New Stannin homologues identified by us cluster with annotated Stannin sequences (prefixed by snn_) and show an overall correct phylogenetic position, with agnathans Lamprey and Hagfish basal to other vertebrates and closer to insect sequences (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). Sequences studied in C) (see below) are highlighted with stars. (C) Threading of the peptide sequences (shown in red) from a basal vertebrate (hagfish), a basal hymenopteran (the wasp <italic>Microplitis)</italic>, and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> onto the human Stannin structure (shown in grey) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>). It has been proposed that the N-terminal Œ±-helix of the Stannin peptide transverses the membrane at an 80<sup>o</sup> angle, whereas the C-terminal Œ±-helix lies upon the lipid bilayer at the cytoplasmic side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref036">36</xref>]. Note that the three peptides can adopt similar tertiary structures.

As expected, the Hagfish peptide, more closely related to human Stannin, obtains a lower distance, but insect peptides display values in the same range despite their lower sequence similarity (see A) above and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s005">S4C Fig</xref>).

We identified homologues of Hemotin peptides in other dipterans (mosquitoes) and in other insects such as hymenopterans (bees, ants, and wasps), plus new homologues of Stannin in ancestral vertebrates, such as hagfish, lamprey, and cartilaginous fishes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s005">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>), and these sequences also show structural compatibility with Stannin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s005">S4C Fig</xref>). Despite considerable amino acid sequence variation, comparison of Hemotin and Stannin sequences reveals conservation in the alpha-helices and in the intervening sequence, which have been implicated in Stannin function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The resulting tree of Stannin and Hemotin sequences shows a good correlation with the animal phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and correctly locates the 88aa mitochondrial ribosomal protein S21 as an outgroup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s005">S4B Fig</xref>).

<title>4‚ÄîHemotin and Stannin Are Functional Homologues That Interact with 14-3-3Œ∂</title>
<p>Stannin is a peptide involved in organometallic toxicity, but its endogenous physiological and cellular functions have remained elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref022">22</xref>].

<p>Stannin peptides bind to the 14-3-3Œ∂ adaptor protein, although the molecular and cellular implications of this binding have not been fully clarified [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref044">44</xref>]. 14-3-3Œ∂ proteins form dimers that bind to phosphorylated amino acid residues of target proteins and modulate their functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref045">45</xref>]. We investigated whether a similar interaction exists between Hemotin and 14-3-3Œ∂ during endosomal maturation in hemocytes. We observed that Hemo-GFP peptides (which localize to early endosomes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2G‚Äì2G‚Äù</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2H‚ÄìS2H‚Äù Fig</xref>) colocalised with 14-3-3Œ∂ in hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5E‚Äì5E‚Äù‚Äò</xref>). In addition, Hemo-GFP peptides coimmunoprecipitated with Nt-tagged 14-3-3Œ∂ proteins expressed in <italic>Drosophila</italic> Kc167 culture cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s006">S5C Fig</xref>) and hemocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s008">S1 File</xref>). The coimmunoprecipitation appears moderate but reproducible and specific, perhaps reflecting a moderate affinity, or a limited amount of the multifunctional 14-3-3Œ∂ protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref045">45</xref>] being engaged by Hemotin peptides.</p>
<p>Our genetic analysis reveals a negative functional relationship between <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> and <italic>hemo/snn</italic> during endosomal maturation in hemocytes. Thus, excess of <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> function (in <italic>He-Gal4;UAS-14-3-3Œ∂</italic> hemocytes) resembled loss of <italic>hemo</italic> function (as in <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup>) by producing large vacuoles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5G</xref>) and FYVE vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5H, 5I, 5J and 5M</xref>), thus suggesting that <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> and <italic>hemo</italic> work in opposite directions. An antagonistic, yet closely related, function is further suggested by gene dosage interactions. First, the <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> gain of function phenotypes were corrected by simultaneous gain of either <italic>hemo</italic> or <italic>snn</italic>: both <italic>UAS-hemo</italic> and <italic>UAS-snn</italic> corrected the extra vacuolation of <italic>UAS-14-3-3Œ∂</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5G</xref>), while <italic>UAS-hemo</italic> corrected the large FYVE vesicles produced by <italic>UAS-14-3-3Œ∂</italic>. Second, reducing <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> function rescued the <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> phenotype to near wild-type, as indicated by vacuolation (after removing a copy of <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> in a <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> homozygous background, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5G</xref>) and the size of FYVE vesicles (by expressing <italic>14-3-3Œ∂ RNAi</italic> in a <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> homozygous background, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5J and 5N</xref>). These negative dosage interactions suggest that <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> works in a common pathway, yet antagonistically, with <italic>hemo</italic> and <italic>snn</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref047">47</xref>]. Because <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> dosage is able to modify <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> null phenotypes, the formal interpretation is that 14-3-3Œ∂ acts downstream of <italic>hemo</italic>, or in other words, that Hemotin regulates 14-3-3Œ∂. Altogether, these genetic results suggest that Hemotin function represses or down-regulates 14-3-3Œ∂ activity.</p>
<p>Thus, our results suggest that Hemotin and Stannin are functional homologues that are required at the cellular level for endosomal maturation; and at the molecular level, to bind and antagonize 14-3-3Œ∂.</p>

<p>The similarities of the cellular phenotypes between <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutants and overproduction of PI(3)P by PI(3)P enzymes prompted us to carry out a genetic analysis of their functional interactions during endosomal maturation in hemocytes. The <italic>PI3K68D</italic> gain of function phenotype of enlarged FYVE organelles and vesicles was suppressed by coexpression of either a <italic>hemo</italic> full-length transcript (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s007">S6 Fig</xref>) or a <italic>14-3-3Œ∂-RNAi</italic> construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6H and 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). Similarly, reduction of <italic>mtm</italic> function by expressing an <italic>mtm</italic>-<italic>RNAi</italic> construct produced aberrant enlarged FYVE compartments with larger-sized vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6F and 6J</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s007">S6 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref021">21</xref>]. Codepletion of <italic>mtm</italic> and <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> with RNAi constructs corrected the size of these abnormal FYVE compartments and vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6I and 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). Formally, these results indicate that 14-3-3Œ∂ cooperates with PI3K68D, whereas Hemotin and Mtm antagonize their action.</p>
<p>Three further results suggest that <italic>mtm</italic> and <italic>PI3K68D</italic> act downstream of Hemotin and 14-3-3Œ∂. Either overexpression of <italic>mtm</italic> or removing a copy of the <italic>PI3K68D</italic> corrected the abnormally large FYVE vesicles of <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> null hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6A‚Äì6C and 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). Similarly, reducing <italic>PI3K68D</italic> function with a RNAi construct produces little or no phenotype on its own (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6J</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref021">21</xref>] but is also able to rescue the enlarged size of FYVE vesicles produced by overexpression of 14-3-3Œ∂ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). Thus, in three different genetic conditions, a reduction of PI(3)P synthesis was able to suppress the enlarged and abnormal early-endosome-like vesicles produced by total loss of <italic>hemo</italic> or gain of function of <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic>. These epistatic results strongly suggest that <italic>mtm</italic> and <italic>PI3K68D</italic> act downstream of Hemotin and 14-3-3Œ∂ during endosomal maturation; in other words, that Hemotin and 14-3-3Œ∂ fulfil their roles through regulation of the PI(3)P enzymes.</p>
<p>Two independent lines of evidence corroborate this hypothesis. First, Hemo-GFP peptides colocalize with PI3K68D kinase at early endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6K‚Äì6K‚Äù‚Äò</xref>). Second, PI3K68D is able to pull down 14-3-3Œ∂ from hemocyte protein extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g006">Fig 6L</xref>), suggesting that 14-3-3Œ∂ directly binds PI3K68D. Altogether, the genetic, cellular, and biochemical results support a model where Hemotin peptides indirectly affect the PI(3)P labelling of early endosomes by binding 14-3-3Œ∂, and hence repressing the positive effect of 14-3-3Œ∂ on PI3K68D kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Model for the role of Hemotin in phagocytic processing.</title>
<p>Simplified models of endosomal maturation, modified from [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref018">18</xref>] depicting the role of the proteins and markers analysed in this work. A) Wild-type endosomal trafficking is regulated by different phosphorylation states of PI. Phosphorylation of PI into PI(3)P is achieved in early endosomes by the class II or class III PI3 kinases PI3k68D and Vps34, respectively. In late endosomes PI(3)P is again phosphorylated to produce PI(3,5)P2. This phosphorylation step allows late endosomes to progress into degradation allowing lysosomes to fuse to late endosomes to produce multivesicular bodies. This trafficking progression can be reversed by dephosphorylation of PI(3)P or PI(3,5)P2 by myotubulurin phosphatases. Hemotin and Stannin are functional homologues that localise to early endosomes, where they bind and repress 14-3-3Œ∂. Our genetic and biochemical data indicates that 14-3-3Œ∂ binds the PI3K68D kinase and promotes its function, perhaps by directly increasing its enzymatic activity, or indirectly by promoting its correct localisation in early endosomes. Since Hemotin antagonises 14-3-3Œ∂, it indirectly reduces the development of early endosomes through PI3K68D. B) The absence of Hemotin produces an excess of 14-3-3Œ∂ function, which results in an excess of PI3K68D function and leads to an increase in endocytic vesicles containing PI(3)P, as detected by expansion of the area occupied by the FYVE marker. These abnormal vesicles display an abnormal maturation during phagocytosis, with excessive co-expression of early lysosomal markers (such as FYVE) and late ones (Lysotracker and Rab7), and a slower and less intense acidification of their contents, as revealed by the pHrodo pH marker.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Hemocytes are part of the innate immune surveillance system in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and are involved in the uptake of cell corpses during development and in overriding bacterial infections throughout the life cycle of the fly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref049">49</xref>]. Their ease of detection and observation, coupled with the arsenal of <italic>Drosophila</italic> genetic techniques, makes hemocytes an excellent model system in which to characterize at molecular level basic cellular processes shared by other metazoan cells. For example, insect hemocytes display functions similar to vertebrate macrophages, such as directed migration and phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref012">12</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref015">15</xref>]. Similarities in the molecular mechanisms controlling these processes have been noted before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref050">50</xref>], but the question of whether hemocytes are truly homologous to vertebrate white blood cells, representing a kind of ancestral macrophage-like cell, is not settled. Homology is supported by the clear similarities in the recognition of exogenous microorganisms through pattern recognition receptors of the Toll and Imd signalling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref052">52</xref>]. Our work further supports such homology through the identification of a modulator of endosomal maturation that is specifically expressed in hemocytes and vertebrate white blood cells and is essential for their phagocytic activity. This modulator is the Hemotin-Stannin peptide.</p>
<p>During endosomal maturation, turnover of PI(3)P pools at endocytic compartments is essential for PI(3)P-mediated recruiting of effectors involved in sorting specific cargo proteins and endosomal vesicles to specific trafficking routes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref020">20</xref>]. In hemocytes, PI(3)P synthesis at early endosomes depends on a scaffold complex comprising both PI(3)P-turnover enzymes, PI3K68D kinase, and Mtm phosphatase bridged by Sbf (an Mtm-pseudophosphatase), indicating that PI(3)P synthesis must be tightly regulated and spatially linked to the traffic of membrane vesicles through the endosomal pathway towards degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref050">50</xref>]. It makes sense that the function of these complexes must be tightly controlled in cell types involved in intense phagocytosis, such as hemocytes, in order to regulate PI(3)P-turnover and maintain endosomal homeostasis under the stress of enhanced membrane influx. Our results show that Hemotin peptides are specifically expressed in hemocytes and locate to early endosomes, where they bind and repress 14-3-3Œ∂ activity. In turn, the genetic and biochemical results suggest that Hemotin-Stannin peptides prevent 14-3-3Œ∂ from assisting the class II PI3K68D kinase at these endocytic vesicles. While the genetic suppression of the <italic>hemo</italic> phenotype by 14-3-3Œ∂ and PI3K68D indicate the functional link with these proteins, this could be based on direct or indirect effects. Our ability to co-IP the two proteins is consistent with a direct effect. However, further studies are needed to confirm this and to determine how Hemotin and 14-3-3Œ∂ can together regulate PI3Kinase activity. Thus, our results indicate that 14-3-3Œ∂ binds PI3K68D, but do not reveal the molecular function of this binding, nor the nature of its positive impact. 14-3-3Œ∂ could either directly stimulate the enzymatic activity of PI3K68D or promote the recruitment or retention of PI3K68D at the Sbf complex. In any case, removal of Hemotin or Mtm, or excess of either 14-3-3Œ∂ or PI3K68D result in large PI(3)P-labelled vesicles (as revealed by the PI(3)P sensor FYVE-GFP, Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">5</xref>), as observed in other systems when PI(3)P kinase function is deregulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref021">21</xref>]. These enlarged PI(3)P vesicles display mixed endosomal-lysosomal characteristics, and thus the normal transitory overlap of endosomal and lysosomal markers in the cell appears increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s003">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). These enlarged intermediate vesicles could occur when the increase in early endosomal vesicle formation overpowers the ability of the subsequent endosomal machinery to complete their maturation into proper endolysosomes. These mutant endosomal vesicles seem to have an impaired ability to process phagocytic material, which displays slower and less acute acidification and longer trafficking times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The PI(3)P-rich nature of the mutant vesicles might preclude the formation of proper endo-lysosomes, but the process of endolysosomal acidification and maturation is still not completely understood [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref053">53</xref>]. We propose that the cellular role of Hemotin is to reduce the endosomal PI(3)P labelling produced by the 14-3-3Œ∂-PI3K68D-Sbf-Mtm complex, and hence to reduce production of vesicles with early endosome characteristics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This modulation by Hemotin would allow for the subsequent maturation and degradation part of the endophagocytic cycle to keep up with the intake of phagocytic material, which is unaffected in <italic>hemo</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>This ‚Äúendocytic modulation‚Äù appears essential in cells with high phagocytic activity such as hemocytes and macrophages to ensure proper digestion of phagocytised bacteria. In the absence of <italic>hemo</italic>, commensal and invading bacteria are less efficiently cleared from the body, and this ultimately compromises the viability of the organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, much of this effect can be attributed to bacteria that are commensal or else not normally pathogenic, which are normally kept in check by the hemocytes, but that when this cellular defence is compromised, they overgrow in the body and lead to death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref033">33</xref>]. This has interesting parallels with the severe effects of infection by normally mildly pathogenic bacteria in human patients with immunodeficiencies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref054">54</xref>].</p>
<p>Regulation of endosomal maturation by Hemotin-Stannin appears to be a conserved mechanism. We have identified Hemotin homologues in other insects, and our phylogenetic analyses indicates that Hemotin is a member of a conserved peptide family, including the vertebrate Stannin, encoding peptides with similar tertiary structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g004">Fig 4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). In addition, we have demonstrated that Hemotin and Stannin are functional homologues in hemocytes during endosomal maturation, a role that appears to be conserved in vertebrates, as <italic>hemo</italic> mutant-like endosomal abnormalities are produced by reduction of <italic>snn</italic> function in mouse macrophage-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Finally, we have shown that both <italic>hemo</italic> and <italic>snn</italic> display antagonistic genetic relationships with <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> during endosomal maturation. The binding of Hemotin to 14-3-3Œ∂ offers a direct molecular basis for these interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This seems a conserved regulatory mechanism as Stannin peptides have been shown to bind 14-3-3Œ∂ proteins in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref044">44</xref>] and physical interactions between 14-3-3Œ∂ and the vertebrate PI(3)P enzyme homologues, Mtmr1 phosphatase and class II PI(3)P kinase have been reported by proteomics of 14-3-3Œ∂ pull-down protein extracts from human HeLa cells and mouse neural cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref056">56</xref>]. Given 14-3-3Œ∂ multiple functions and near-ubiquitous expression, we surmise that cooperation of 14-3-3Œ∂ with the PI3K68D kinase might be a general cellular mechanism that is modulated by Hemotin/Stannin in specific cell types, although further experiments must test this point.</p>
<p>Interestingly, results relating to the role of Stannin as a promoting factor for organometallic-mediated cytotoxicity may be relevant to our model. Organotins such as TMT are used in industry as plastic stabilisers, but they are acutely toxic, producing cytotoxicity in specific tissues and eventually death of the affected individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref022">22</xref>]. <italic>snn</italic> was originally identified as a cDNA specifically expressed in TMT-sensitive tissues such as hematopoietic organs and immune system lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref057">57</xref>]. Subsequent studies showed binding of TMT to Stannin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref058">58</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref060">60</xref>] and of Stannin to 14-3-3Œ∂ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref044">44</xref>]. Although the molecular and cellular consequences of such binding and the roles of Stannin in TMT toxicity and under normal physiology have not been fully elucidated, several results might suggest a relationship with PI metabolism. The first cellular symptom of exposure to organometallic compounds is an increase of endolysosomal-like vacuoles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref062">62</xref>], which resembles both the <italic>hemo</italic> mutant phenotype and the <italic>snn</italic> siRNA phenocopies in mouse macrophage-like cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s002">S1G and S1H Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002395.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). Lithium treatment, which inhibits PI synthesis, has a protective effect on TMT cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref062">62</xref>], but addition of exogenous PI(3)P (myophosphatidylinositol) to such TMT+Lithium-treated cells reverts this Lithium protective effect, altogether suggesting that PI promotes TMT-mediated cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref062">62</xref>]. Thus, TMT could alter Stannin and cause a toxic excess of 14-3-3Œ∂-related PI(3)Kinase function, leading to an increase of endocytic PI(3)P labelling, and hence to enlarged endolysosomal compartments and eventual apoptosis in <italic>snn</italic>-expressing tissues.</p>
<p>We have not been able to identify Hemotin-Stannin homologues in diblastic animals or unicellular eukaryotes, so a compatible hypothesis is that Hemotin-Stannin appeared as an adaptation to enhanced levels of endocytic activity in specific phagocytic cells during the evolution of complex body plans. Interestingly, this is also the point when the Sarcolamban family appears in the animal tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref007">7</xref>]. The <italic>sarcolamban</italic>-<italic>sarcolipin</italic> smORF family also encodes peptides regulating a basic cellular process (Calcium homeostasis) fundamental to a specific cell type (muscle cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref063">63</xref>]. smORFs are widespread, having been identified in bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref064">64</xref>], yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref065">65</xref>], and plants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref066">66</xref>]. In eukaryotes, translated smORFs have been recently identified in putative long noncoding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref003">3</xref>], and interestingly, expression of long noncoding RNAs can be highly tissue-specific ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref067">67</xref>], unp. obs.). We have shown that hydrophobic smORF peptides have a propensity to encode transmembrane alpha-helices and to localise to cell membranes and organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref003">3</xref>]. Finally, it has been proposed that smORFs are a source of evolutionary new peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref068">68</xref>]. Altogether, it is tempting to speculate that hydrophobic smORFs could provide a source of emerging tissue-specific modulators of organelle-based cellular processes. Regardless of this speculation, the accumulating evidence points to the potential of smORF peptides to fill gaps in our understanding of cell biology and physiology, and its associated diseased states.</p>

<title>Primary Hemocyte Culture, Live Cell Stainings, Immunocytochemisty and Microscopy</title>
<p>Primary <italic>Drosophila</italic> hemocytes were isolated from postembryonic life stages as indicated in Sampson et al., 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref015">15</xref>]. Extraction of free-flowing hemocytes was achieved by bleeding individual specimens using a 25-gauge dissecting needle in a culture medium (80% Schneider‚Äôs <italic>Drosophila</italic> medium [Pan-Biotech, Dorset, UK] and 20% fetal bovine serum [Invitrogen/Life Technologies] with no antibiotics).</p>
<p>For measuring vacuolation primary hemocytes from white prepupae (&gt;100 h AEL) were cultured into a glass-bottom dish containing collagen extracellular matrix (MatTek Corp., MA, US) and stained with anti-beta tubulin and phalloidin (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) following the procedures described in Sampson et al., 2013. Similar procedures were followed to identify lysosomes using lysotracker (Invitrogen/Life Technologies) or by detecting the LAMP1-GFP marker.</p>
<p>Detection of GFP and Cherry‚Äì2XFYVE, Hrs, Cherry-PI3K68D, Cherry-Mtm, HA-14-3-3Œ∂, and hemo-ORF1-GFP was achieved by culturing primary hemocytes from wandering late third instar larvae and white prepupa stages in glass multisport microscope slides (Hendley-Essex, Essex, UK) and immunostaining was performed as described in Sampson et al., 2013.</p>
<p>Antibodies used in this study are: mouse anti-GFP (Roche) 1:500; rabbit anti-cherry (Invitrogen) 1:5000; mouse anti-HA (Roche) 1:500; anti-Hrs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref070">70</xref>], mouse anti-FLAG M2 (SIGMA) 1:1000. Actin cytoskeleton was labelled with fluorophore-conjugated phalloidin (Molecular-Probes. Invitrogen) 1:50.</p>
<p>For measuring lysosomal aggregation, live primary hemocytes were stained with 50 nM Red-lysotracker (Invitrogen) in culture medium for 15 min and then washed several times and finally replaced with normal culture medium for live imaging for 20‚Äì30 min.</p>
<p>For embryonic hemocyte <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, adult flies were allowed to lay eggs on apple juice agar plate. Embryos collected at stage 15, dechorionated and mounted on double-sided tape stuck to a standard glass slide. Voltalef oil was applied to the embryos to prevent dehydration, and a coverslip fixed with nail polish applied on top. For pupal hemocyte <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging, pupae at stage P6 (50 h APF) were mounted ventral side down on double-sided tape applied to a glass slide and dissected to remove a window in the pupal case over the thorax as described in Sampson et al., 2013. After application of 10S Voltalef Oil on the ROI, a ring of petroleum jelly was made around the samples, a coverslip was rested on this ring, and then it was pressed down on the sample.</p>
<p>Confocal laser microscopy was used to image fluorescence in live and fixed cells. An inverted Zeiss Axiovert 200M series microscope with a LSM-510 confocal laser attachment was used. Images were captured using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER C4742-95 camera. Most cells were observed at 63x using the Zeiss Apochromat 63x oil objective NA = 1.4, but in some cases 100x magnification was required, using a Zeiss Epiplan‚ÄîNeoFluar 100x oil objective with NA = 1.3. Fluorescent imaging utilised the automated prior stage for Z-stacking throughout the cells imaged. Live cells were imaged at 0.5‚Äì1 Œºm path length between each imaging slice. Fixed cells were also imaged within the same range of path length for nondetailed images, whilst detailed images, particularly for 3-D reconstruction, were imaged at a path length of 0.2‚Äì03 Œºm between each imaging slice.

<p>A 1:1 dilution of pHrodo-conjugated bacterial particles (0.5 mg/mL) with HEPES+HBSS pH 7.4 buffer was sonicated for 5 min to break apart large conglomerates.

<p>The integrated pHrodo intensity over time was measured for each particle from the moment the particles docked into the cell membrane and for each time point, using an identical ROI of 0.9 Œºm<sup>2</sup> for every series on single confocal z-stack plane across on the middle of the pHrodo particle. To quantify FYVE prevalence, the number of frames for which individual pHrodo particles were surrounded by FYVE, using a single z-stack plane across on the middle of the pHrodo particle, were counted and converted into time according to the frame rate of each time lapse.</p>

<title>Statistical Analyses of Cell-Based Assays</title>
<p>To measure the size of the vacuoles of <italic>in vivo</italic> embryonic and pupal thoracic hemocytes, we calculated the OAI, which is the accumulative area of intracellular vacuoles divided by the cellular area (&gt;30 cells for most of the genotypes randomly selected as described above) in hemocytes in the wild-type and <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant. Z-stack images were processed in the ImageJ software, and the outlines of the vacuole and cell were highlighted using the draw tool and the areas were measured. Student <italic>t</italic> test was used for statistical analysis.</p>
<p>For measuring vacuolation in <italic>ex vivo</italic> hemocytes, we determined the OVI, which corresponds to the addition of the volume of intracellular vacuoles (voids that disrupt the tubulin cytoskeleton)/total cytoplasmic volume of the cell. The Z-stack images were loaded onto the ImageJ software. To calculate the total cytoplasmic volume, we used the oblate ellipsoid volume formula: 4/3œÄab<sup>2</sup> (a = radius, b = height). The radius of the cytoplasm was measured at widest Z-slice of the cell and the height at the highest point at the orthogonal projection. The average wild-type cytoplasmic volume of <italic>ex vivo</italic> hemocytes (&gt;30 cells for most of samples were selected at random across &gt;3 separate imaging foci and 3 experimental repeats) was 311.06 Œºm<sup>3</sup>, which diverged only slightly from A4 mutants (375.57 Œºm<sup>3</sup>), therefore the wild-type cytoplasmic volume was used for our analysis. To calculate the volume of intracellular vacuoles, we used the sphere volume formula: = 4/3œÄr<sup>3</sup>, the radius was calculated by measuring the diameter of the widest point of the vacuole, only the vacuoles with a radius equal to or larger than 1.5 Œºm were considered for OVI analysis, with cells lacking vacuoles of at least 1.5 Œºm giving an OVI of 0.</p>
<p>To measure early endosome cellular compartments (FYVE-positive) in <italic>ex vivo</italic> hemocytes, we calculated the OAI, meaning the addition of FYVE particle area/total cytoplasmic cell area (volume inside of cortical actin ring). ImageJ software was used to calculate the OAI. A maximum projection of the Z-stacks was made and both FYVE and Phalloidin channels were separated. FYVE image was transformed into a binary image and particle analyses (size pixel Œº<sup>2</sup>: 20-infinity and circularity: 0‚Äì1) were used to calculate the area of particles. Addition of FYVE particle areas was done in Excel. Measurement of the cytoplasmic area was performed manually by using the free hand selection tool. OAI of endosomes of 20‚Äì60 cells selected at random as described above were calculated per genotype. In addition, we measured FYVE diameter ratio consisting of the average of three FYVE vesicle diameters per cell (randomly selected 20‚Äì60 cells from &gt;3 imaging foci and 3 experimental repeats per genotype) divided by the averaged FYVE diameter of the <italic>He-Gal4 UAS-hemo</italic> full-length transcript in an A4 mutant background to diminish the genetic background effects possibly caused by the <italic>Gal4</italic>, <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> and <italic>UAS</italic>-docking chromosomes.</p>
<p>Lysosome aggregates in <italic>ex vivo</italic> hemocytes were measured by calculating the area of lysosome particles as described above (visualized with lysotracker)/number of lysosomal particles. For each genotype &gt;30 cells were selected randomly as described above and were measured.</p>
<p>We calculated the OAI as described above as a measure of the lysosome occupied area in the siRNAs experiments in mouse RAW264.7 cells. 80‚Äì110 cells were measured per sample in each of the three repeats.</p>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed with one-way ANOVA to assess whether the means of the groups were significantly different (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001), and a post hoc Bonferroni‚Äôs test was carried out to compare multiple groups with <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 considered as significant using the Prism suite (Graph Pad).</p>
<p>As a measure of the colocalisation of endocytic markers and hemotin-GFP peptides, we used the Pearson‚Äôs correlation coefficient (ImageJ WCIF colocalisation plugins) that evaluates the amount of signal intensity from one channel that occurs in the same location in the other colour channel. Pearson‚Äôs coefficients range between ‚àí1 to 1, with values closer to 1 indicating reliable colocalisation. Pearson‚Äôs coefficients of hemocyte cells (<italic>n</italic> = 17‚Äì32 per genotype) were analysed with two-tailed Mann-Whitney test (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001).</p>

<title>Search for Sequence and Structure Homologues Using Bioinformatics</title>
<p>The Phyre2 online search engine was used to find structural homologues using the Hemo-ORF peptide sequence as an input. To find Hemotin sequence homologues, we used the pipeline described in Magny et al., 2013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref007">7</xref>] that is based on the identification of closest homologues, followed by expanded searches using consensus sequences weighted by the phylogeny from the alignment of such close homologues. In addition, we introduced an extra corroboration step of reciprocal best Blast hit in doubtful cases.</p>
<p>Alignments and trees of peptide sequences were generated using MAFFT and Clustal programs, with MAFFT parameters set at 5 iterations and global pair alignment. The alignments were visualized with Jalview.</p>
<p>To evaluate the ability of hemo peptides to adopt the tertiary peptide structure of human Stannin, we threaded the sequence of insect Hemotin peptides (<italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Microplitis demolitor</italic>) and the basal vertebrate Stannin peptide (hagfish) onto the human Stannin peptide structure (1zzA; RCSB protein data bank) using the Phyre2 server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref035">35</xref>] on one-to-one threading mode. These preliminary structures were then refined, and Global distances test values were obtained with respect to the original human 1zzA Snn structure using the KobaMIN server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002395.ref038">38</xref>].</p>

Previously annotated Stannin sequences are prefixed by (snn_). (B) Phylogenetic guide tree showing average distances between the insect Hemotin and vertebrate Stannin peptides. The length of the branching lines is proportional to the distance between sequences. The Hemotin and Stannin sequences cluster with their respective counterparts from related species in their own taxa (Hymenopteran and Dipteran insects, and Vertebrates). The location of the sequences in the tree follows the phylogenetic relationships among these animals, i.e., within each taxon cluster, the sequences from more ancestral species locate to more basal positions in the tree, except occasional and highly-divergent sequences. The tree also correctly shows the 88aa mitochondrial ribosomal protein S21 (mRpS21) (which is conserved across these taxa) and an unrelated outgroup.

Over-expression of <italic>hemo</italic> full length transcript rescues the large FYVE vesicles induced by excessive <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic>. Removing a single copy of the <italic>PI3k68D</italic> gene (<italic>Df(3)PI3K68D</italic>/+) reduces the size of <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> FYVE vesicles. On the contrary, over-expression of <italic>PI3K68D</italic> (<italic>UAS-PI3K68D</italic>) produces larger FYVE vesicles. Over-expression of <italic>hemo</italic> full length transcript rescues the enlarged FYVE vesicles produced by over-expression of <italic>PI3K68D</italic>. Loss of function of <italic>mtm</italic> (<italic>mtm-RNAi</italic>) causes an enlargement of FYVE vesicles. Over-expression of <italic>mtm</italic> (<italic>UAS-mtm</italic>) rescues the enlarged <italic>hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> mutant FYVE vesicle size. Knocking down the expression of <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic> (<italic>14-3-3Œ∂-RNAi</italic>) suppresses the <italic>mtm</italic> loss of function and <italic>PI3K68</italic> gain of function phenotypes. Finally, reduction of <italic>PI3k68D</italic> function (<italic>UAS-PI3k68D-RNAi</italic>) rescues the enlarged FYVE vesicles produced by over-expression of <italic>14-3-3Œ∂</italic>. One-way ANOVA test showed that means of samples are significantly different [F(15,700) = 64.62, p&lt;0.0001]. A post hoc Newmann-Kleuss Multiple comparison test indicate the significance between genotypes shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s001">S1 Data</xref> (n‚â•19*, p&lt;0.05). * The number of cells in <italic>UAS-mtm;hemo</italic><sup><italic>A4</italic></sup> was lower due to lack of cells having vesicles with the minimum size required for this analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and Methods</xref>). Error bars represent S.E.M. Supplemental data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002395.s001">S1 Data</xref>.</p>
