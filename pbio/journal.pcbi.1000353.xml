                <p>The use of networks to integrate different genetic, proteomic, and metabolic
                    datasets has been proposed as a viable path toward elucidating the origins of
                    specific diseases. Here we introduce a new phenotypic database summarizing
                    correlations obtained from the disease history of more than 30 million patients
                    in a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN). We present evidence that the structure of
                    the PDN is relevant to the understanding of illness progression by showing that
                    (1) patients develop diseases close in the network to those they already have;
                    (2) the progression of disease along the links of the network is different for
                    patients of different genders and ethnicities; (3) patients diagnosed with
                    diseases which are more highly connected in the PDN tend to die sooner than
                    those affected by less connected diseases; and (4) diseases that tend to be
                    preceded by others in the PDN tend to be more connected than diseases that
                    precede other illnesses, and are associated with higher degrees of mortality.
                    Our findings show that disease progression can be represented and studied using
                    network methods, offering the potential to enhance our understanding of the
                    origin and evolution of human diseases. The dataset introduced here, released
                    concurrently with this publication, represents the largest relational phenotypic
                    resource publicly available to the research community.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>To help the understanding of physiological failures, diseases are defined as
                    specific sets of phenotypes affecting one or several physiological systems. Yet,
                    the complexity of biological systems implies that our working definitions of
                    diseases are careful discretizations of a complex phenotypic space. To reconcile
                    the discrete nature of diseases with the complexity of biological organisms, we
                    need to understand how diseases are connected, as connections between these
                    different discrete categories can be informative about the mechanisms causing
                    physiological failures. Here we introduce the Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN)
                    as a map summarizing phenotypic connections between diseases and show that
                    diseases progress preferentially along the links of this map. Furthermore, we
                    show that this progression is different for patients with different genders and
                    racial backgrounds and that patients affected by diseases that are connected to
                    many other diseases in the PDN tend to die sooner than those affected by less
                    connected diseases. Additionally, we have created a queryable online database
                        (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hudine.neu.edu/" xlink:type="simple">http://hudine.neu.edu/</ext-link>) of the 18 different datasets generated
                    from the more than 31 million patients in this study. The disease associations
                    can be explored online or downloaded in bulk.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>There are no clear boundaries between many diseases, as diseases can have multiple
                causes and can be related through several dimensions. From a genetic perspective, a
                pair of diseases can be related because they have both been associated with the same
                gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Goh1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Feldman1">[2]</xref>, whereas from a proteomic perspective diseases can
                be related because disease associated proteins act on the same pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Rual1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Oldham1">[9]</xref>.</p>
            <p>During the past half-decade, several resources have been constructed to help
                understand the entangled origins of many diseases. Many of these resources have been
                presented as networks in which interactions between disease-associated genes,
                proteins, and expression patterns have been summarized. For example, Goh et al.
                created a network of Mendelian gene-disease associations by connecting diseases that
                have been associated with the same genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Goh1">[1]</xref> (see also Feldman et al.
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Feldman1">[2]</xref>),
                whereas Lee et al. constructed a network in which two diseases are linked if mutated
                enzymes associated with them catalyze adjacent metabolic reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Lee1">[10]</xref>. Network
                studies in the proteomic front have studied large protein interaction networks, like
                the ones created by Rual et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Rual1">[3]</xref> and Stelzl et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Stelzl1">[4]</xref>, in an attempt to
                understand diseases like inherited ataxias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Lim1">[5]</xref> or Huntington's
                disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Goehler1">[6]</xref>. Moreover, in the gene expression front, microarray
                expression profiles and other cellular level information have been used to explore
                networks in inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Calvano1">[7]</xref>, breast cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Pujana1">[8]</xref>, and brain disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Oldham1">[9]</xref>.</p>
            <p>While progress on the genetic and proteomic fronts has been impressive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Goh1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Lee1">[10]</xref>, much of
                the available resources overlook the fact that we have extensive and continually
                updated phenotypic information for humans – namely, patient clinical
                histories. Indeed, hospitals and insurance programs constantly collect detailed
                records for millions of patients. These datasets contain information on disease
                associations and progression. For example, such population-based disease
                associations could be used in conjunction with molecular and genetic data to help us
                uncover the molecular origins of diseases. Despite the potential utility of
                population based disease associations, extensive datasets linking diseases based on
                comorbidity associations do not exist, partly because access to extensive medical
                records is limited.</p>
            <p>Typically, we say that a comorbidity relationship exists between two diseases
                whenever they affect the same individual substantially more than chance alone. One
                of our primary goals here is to make available pairwise comorbidity correlations for
                more than 10 thousand diseases reconstructed from over 30 million medical records.
                For completeness and utility, we organize the results in 18 different datasets. Each
                summarizes phenotypic associations extracted from four years worth of ICD9-CM claims
                data at the 5 and 3 digit level. Results are grouped into subsets of race, gender,
                and both race and gender (see SM). To facilitate their use, the datasets are
                available as a bulk download (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hudine.neu.edu/resource/data/data.html" xlink:type="simple">http://hudine.neu.edu/resource/data/data.html</ext-link>) or through a
                searchable web interface (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hudine.neu.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://hudine.neu.edu</ext-link>) that allows
                researchers, doctors and patients to explore these disease networks graphically,
                through an interactive Flash application, and numerically, by allowing them to
                generate tables summarizing the associations between a particular disease and all
                other diseases.</p>
            <p>In the past, comorbidities have been used extensively to construct synthetic scales
                for mortality prediction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Iezzoni1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Schneeweiss1">[12]</xref>, yet their utility
                could exceed their current use. Studying the structure defined by entire sets of
                comorbidities might help the understanding of many biological and medical questions
                from a perspective that is complementary to other approaches. For example, a recent
                study built a comorbidity network in an attempt to elucidate neurological diseases
                common genetic origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Rzhetsky1">[13]</xref>. Heretofore, however, neither this data nor the
                data necessary to explore relationships between all diseases is currently available
                to the research community. Hence, here we decide to provide this data in the form of
                a Phenotypic Disease Network (PDN) capturing all diseases as recorded through
                medical claims. Additionally, we illustrate how a PDN can be used to study illness
                progression from a dynamic network perspective by interpreting the PDN as the
                landscape where illness progression occurs and show how the network can be used to
                study phenotypic differences between patients with different demographic
                backgrounds. Furthermore, we show that the local structure of a disease in the
                network, as characterized by its degree or number of connections, is associated with
                disease mortality. Finally, we study the directionality of disease progression, as
                observed in our dataset, and find that more central diseases in the PDN are more
                likely to occur after other diseases and that more peripheral diseases tend to
                precede other illnesses. We also find that patients diagnosed with diseases that
                tend to be preceded by other conditions tend to die sooner than those diagnosed with
                conditions that tend to precede other diseases. Together, these results and
                resources open new opportunities for biomolecular, bioinformatic and public health
                approaches to disease.</p>

                <p>The medical claims were made available to us is in the ICD-9-CM format,
                    representing a controlled nomenclature constructed mainly for insurance claim
                    purposes. Therefore, in some cases, more than one code corresponds to a
                    particular disease, whereas in other cases codes are not specific enough for
                    research purposes. For example, at the 5-digit level there are 33 diagnoses
                    associated with hypertension, which reduce to five at the 3-digit level. Other
                    times, the code is for a symptom such as “dehydration” which
                    cannot be assigned to any one diagnosis. The vast majority of diseases, however,
                    do map reliably to ICD9 codes.</p>

                    capture a complete cross section of the population. Our dataset consists of
                    medical claims associated with hospitalizations of elderly citizens in the
                    United States; thus, it contains limited information about diseases that are not
                    common among elders from an industrialized country, such as many infectious
                    diseases or pregnancy-related conditions. Nor does it contain information on
                    patients who were not hospitalized and who instead seek solely outpatient care.
                    Hence, it is important to interpret our results in the context of a population

                <title>Quantifying the Strength of Comorbidity Relationships</title>
                <p>To measure relatedness starting from disease co-occurrence, we need to quantify
                    the strength of comorbidities by introducing a notion of
                    “distance” between two diseases (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000353.s001">Text S1</xref>). A
                    difficulty of this approach is that different statistical distance measures have
                    biases that over- or under-estimate the relationships between rare or prevalent
                    diseases. These biases are important given that the number of times a particular
                    disease is diagnosed –its prevalence- follows a heavy tailed
                    distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g001">Fig 1 C</xref>),
                    meaning that while most diseases are rarely diagnosed, a few diseases have been
                    diagnosed in a large fraction of the population. Hence, quantifying comorbidity
                    often requires us to compare diseases affecting a few dozen patients with
                    diseases affecting millions.</p>
                <p>We will use two comorbidity measures to quantify the distance between two
                    diseases: The Relative Risk (<italic>RR</italic>) and
                    <italic>φ</italic>-correlation (<italic>φ</italic>). The
                        <italic>RR</italic> of observing a pair of diseases <italic>i</italic> and
                        <italic>j</italic> affecting the same patient is given by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>C<sub>ij</sub></italic> is the number of patients
                    affected by both diseases, <italic>N</italic> is the total number of patients in
                    the population and <italic>P<sub>i</sub></italic> and
                    <italic>P<sub>j</sub></italic> are the prevalences of diseases
                    <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. The distribution of

                        <italic>φ</italic>-correlation, which is Pearson's
                    correlation for binary variables, can be expressed mathematically as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>The distribution of <italic>φ</italic> values representing all disease
                    pairs where <italic>C<sub>ij</sub></italic>&gt;0 is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g001">Fig 1 E</xref>. A discussion on the
                    confidence interval and statistical significance of these measures can be found
                    in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000353.s001">Text
                    S1</xref>.</p>
                <p>These two comorbidity measures are not completely independent of each other
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g001">Fig 1 F</xref>), as they both
                    increase with the number of patients affected by both diseases, yet both
                    measures have their intrinsic biases. For example, <italic>RR</italic>
                    overestimates relationships involving rare diseases and underestimates the
                    comorbidity between highly prevalent illnesses, whereas
                    <italic>φ</italic> accurately discriminates comorbidities between
                    pairs of diseases of similar prevalence but underestimates the comorbidity
                    between rare and common diseases (see SM Box 1). Given the complementary biases
                    of the two measures, we construct a PDN separately for each measure and discuss
                    their respective relevance to specific disease groups.</p>
                <p>One important question is how the predictive power of comorbidity based
                    relationships compares with that of heredity and known genetic markers. Of the
                    two measures discussed above, the Relative Risk <italic>(RR)</italic> enjoys the
                    most widespread use in the medical literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Kobberling1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Both1">[29]</xref>,
                    making it the most suitable for such comparison. We find that the relative risk
                    of being diagnosed with one disease given another disease affecting a patient in
                    our data varies in the range <italic>RR</italic>∼0.25–16
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g001">Fig 1 D</xref>). Sibling
                    studies have found that the relative risk of having a disease given that a
                    sibling has the same disease typically ranges from
                        <italic>RR</italic>∼<italic>3</italic> for type 2 diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Kobberling1">[20]</xref>
                    to <italic>RR∼2–7</italic> for early myocardial infarction
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Lusis1">[21]</xref>, <italic>∼7–10</italic> for
                    bipolar disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Craddock1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-McGuffin1">[23]</xref> and rheumatoid
                    arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Wordsworth1">[24]</xref> and ∼<italic>17–35</italic>
                    for Crohn's Disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-The1">[25]</xref>. Most of these values fall in the range of
                    relative risks associated with our observed comorbidities. Hence, statistically
                    speaking, the magnitude of the disease risk predicted by comorbidity
                    relationships is comparable to that of family history. Furthermore, we can
                    compare comorbidity statistics with typical relative risk values found in
                    genetic susceptibility studies. For example, the relative risk of type 2
                    diabetes for carriers of the at-risk allele TCF7L2 ranges between
                        <italic>RR∼1.45</italic> and <italic>2.41</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Grant1">[26]</xref>,
                    whereas the rs2476601 SNP in the PTPN22 gene confers a genetic relative risk for
                    rheumatoid arthritis of <italic>RR∼1.8</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Begovich1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Hinks1">[28]</xref>. In contrast, the
                        <italic>RR</italic> for a type 2 diabetes of a patient diagnosed with
                    Ischemic Heart Disease is <italic>RR∼1.61</italic>, whereas a rheumatoid
                    arthritis patient is at <italic>RR</italic>∼3.64 for the disease if he
                    or she is diagnosed with osteoporosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Both1">[29]</xref>. The statistical
                    strength of the observed comorbidities is therefore comparable to that found in
                    siblings and genetic susceptibility studies, a favorable comparison that
                    provides further motivation to use comorbidity data to explore disease risk.</p>

                <p>We can summarize the set of all comorbidity associations between all diseases
                    expressed in the study population by constructing a Phenotypic Disease Network
                    (PDN). In the PDN, nodes are disease phenotypes identified by unique ICD9 codes,
                    and links connect phenotypes that show significant comorbidity according to the
                    measures introduced above.</p>
                <p>In principle, the number of disease-disease associations in the PDN is

                        <italic>φ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g002">Fig 2 B</xref>) is populated by highly prevalent diseases with many
                    connections across different ICD9 categories. Despite these differences between
                    the two networks, we do not argue in favor of one particular representation;
                    they both capture statistically significant associations at different prevalence
                    scales. Together, each offers a complementary representation of the phenotypic
                    disease network.</p>

                <title>Disease Network Dynamics</title>
                <p>While a network representation of diseases has many potential applications, here
                    we concentrate on three examples illustrating the use of the PDN to study the
                    illness progression from a network dynamics perspective <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Hidalgo1">[30]</xref>. The PDN can be
                    seen as a “map” of the phenotypic space. This map allows us
                    to study illness progression as a dynamic network process in which patients
                    “jump” from one disease to another along the links of the
                    PDN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Hidalgo1">[30]</xref>. Our ability to fully develop such a view of
                    diseases is limited, however, by our data. While we can order diseases according
                    to the date they were diagnosed, we cannot exclude the possibility that the
                    observed progression is a result of our limited observation window. For example,
                    a patient in our data set can be diagnosed with type II diabetes on the first
                    visit and hypertension on the second visit. Yet, lacking information on previous
                    disease history, we cannot conclude that diabetes precedes hypertension, as
                    hypertension could have been diagnosed at any earlier time point not recorded in
                    our data. Hence we begin our analysis using a conservative approach in which we
                    study possible consequences of disease progression in a static network picture
                    and continue, by the end of the paper, to study the observed directionality of
                    disease progression, limiting any conclusions due to the aforementioned biases.</p>
                <p>These limitations require us to adopt a more conservative approach in our
                    analysis. Here we explore disease network dynamics by asking three questions
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g003">Fig 3 A</xref>).
                    Q<sub>1</sub>: Does illness significantly progress along the links of the PDN?
                        Q<sub>2</sub>: Is illness progression different for patients of different
                    races and genders? Q<sub>3</sub>: Does the connectivity of a disease, as
                    measured in the PDN, correlates with higher lethality?</p>

                <p>To answer the first question (Q<sub>1</sub>) we use a recently introduced method

                    (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000353.s001">Text
                    S1</xref>). We measure the average correlation between diseases diagnosed in the
                    first two visits and those diagnosed in the 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup>
                    visits for all patients with four visits
                        (<italic>N = 946,580</italic>). We
                    controlled for the correlations inherent to the dataset by repeating the
                    procedure using a randomized set of diseases for the first two visits extracted
                    in such a way that the prevalence of each disease in the randomized sets matches
                    the one observed in the original data. We find that diseases diagnosed in the
                    first two visits are more correlated with those diagnosed in the last two visits
                    than what we observe on our control case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g003">Fig 3 B &amp; C</xref>). In a case-by-case
                    basis, we can compare the correlations between the real and randomized measures
                    by calculating the ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average correlation between the diagnoses received by a
                    patient in his first two and last two visits and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average correlation found in the control case. The
                    distribution of <italic>H</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g003">Fig 3 D &amp; E</xref>) reveals that inter-visit correlations are
                    larger than would be expected by chance for 95.6% of the patients on
                    the <italic>φ</italic>-PDN and for 81.5% of the patients in
                    the <italic>RR</italic>-PDN (by a factor of 10 on average for the
                        <italic>φ</italic>-PDN and of 1.5 for the
                    <italic>RR</italic>-PDN). Therefore, it is a valid approximation to think of the
                    development of patients' illnesses as a spreading process over a PDN.
                    We note that while the effect discussed above is present for both the
                        <italic>φ</italic> and <italic>RR</italic>-based networks, it is
                    more pronounced in the <italic>φ</italic>-PDN, suggesting a superior
                    potential predictive power for the <italic>φ</italic>-representation.
                    We find that this result is not affected by including the individuals with four
                    visits or not in the PDN (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000353.s001">Text S1</xref>). This is because of the large number
                    of observations and the regularity of the observed disease correlations.</p>
                <p>While our data does not allow us to be conclusive about the directionality of
                    disease progression, differences in the strength of comorbidity relationships
                    can still indicate differences in the dynamics of illness progression. The
                    reason is that patients affected by a pair of diseases had traversed the link
                    between them at some point in time and in one of the two possible directions.
                    Here, we explore Q<sub>2</sub> by looking at differences in the strength of the
                    observed comorbidities for patients from different ethnic background and
                    genders. For this we calculate the odds ratio for the difference in comorbidity
                    between diseases <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> as expressed in
                    populations <italic>α</italic> and <italic>β</italic>.
                    Mathematically, the odds ratio is defined as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where
                            <italic>p<sub>ij</sub>(α) = C<sub>ij</sub>(α)/N<sub>α</sub></italic>
                    is the probability that diseases <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> are
                    observed in a patient of population <italic>α</italic>.</p>
                <p>We discuss as an example a network showing differences in the strength of
                    comorbidities between white and black males. We illustrate this on the subset of
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g002">Figure 2 B</xref> in which all
                    diseases connected to Hypertension or Ischemic Heart Disease are shown. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g003">Figure 3 F</xref>, blue links connect
                    diseases that are significantly more comorbid for black males, whereas red links
                    connect diseases that are more comorbid for white males. This picture suggest
                    that ischemic heart disease, infarctions, hypercholesterolemia, and pulmonary
                    complications, among other diseases, tend to be more comorbid in white males
                    than in black males; whereas hypertension, diabetes, and renal and other
                    disorders tend to be more comorbid in black males than in white males. The
                    structure presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g003">Figure 3
                    F</xref> summarizes well known disease associations, validating the ability of
                    the PDN to explore gender and race variations on comorbidity, which could help
                    discern disease etiology. Figure
                    5S shows a similar example for males and females. Comparative studies
                    like this one can be performed for any disease using the project's
                    website (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hudine.neu.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://hudine.neu.edu</ext-link>).</p>
                <p>Finally, we explore our third question (Q<sub>3</sub>) by showing that the
                    lethality of a disease is associated with its connectivity in the PDN. We can
                    quantify the connectivity of a particular disease by adding the correlations
                    between a disease and all other diseases to which it is connected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Barrat1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Ahnert1">[32]</xref>.

                        <italic>RR</italic>-networks.

                    high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicate that disease <italic>i</italic> is strongly connected
                    to many other diseases in the PDN. To measure the lethality of a disease, we
                    calculated the percentage of people deceased within the 8 years following the
                    first diagnosis recorded in our database. We find that disease connectivity and
                    lethality are correlated for the <italic>φ</italic>-PDN and the
                        <italic>RR</italic>-PDN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g004">Fig 4
                        A &amp; B</xref>). A simpler and contrasting hypothesis is to test
                    whether the lethality of a disease correlates with its prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g004">Fig 4 C</xref>); we find that
                    prevalence shows only a weak correlation with lethality and cannot explain the
                    effect seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g004">Fig 4 A &amp;
                    B</xref>. We also find that the strength of the relationship between disease
                    connectivity and lethality is greater for some groups of diseases than others
                    (Table S3). For example, this relationship is strong for neoplasms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g004">Fig 4 D &amp; E</xref>) whereas
                    for mental disorders the correlation is week (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g004">Fig 4 F</xref>) or even negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g004">Fig 4 G</xref>).</p>

                <p>A possible explanation for the observed correlation between connectivity and
                    lethality is that sicker patients accrue more diagnoses and hence the observed
                    correlation is just a restatement of this trivial fact. We can rule this out by
                    looking at the correlation between the average connectivity of diseases
                    diagnosed to patients with a given number of hospital visits, diagnoses, and
                    number of years they remained alive after the last diagnosis was observed. We
                    performed this analysis by looking at data on the 7,878,255 patients for which
                    we know the exact year of death; the remaining patients were reported as either
                    alive or unknown in our data set. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g005">Figures 5 A and 5 B</xref> show the histogram for the number of visits and
                    diagnoses assigned to this set of 7,878,255 patients. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g005">Figures 5 C and 5 D</xref> show that there is a
                    significant negative correlation between the average connectivity of diseases
                    observed in patients with the same number of visits or diagnoses or the number
                    of years they survived after the last diagnosis was observed. Hence the observed
                    correlation between connectivity and lethality does not come from a simple
                    accumulation of diagnoses by sicker patients. Our results indicate that the
                    severity of a disease can be approximated by its connectivity in the PDN for
                    patients with the same number of diagnoses, hence the structure of the PDN
                    matters as the location of a patient in the PDN is a predictor of the number of
                    years he is expected to remain alive. We also notice that in this example the
                    PDN created using <italic>φ</italic> correlates more strongly with the
                    number of years a person survived than the RR-PDN. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000353.s001">Text S1</xref>, we
                    show that the observed correlation between the connectivity in the PDN of
                    diseases affecting a patient and the number of years survived are robust to
                    simultaneous control for age, gender, number of diagnoses, and number of visits.</p>

                <p>Finally, we briefly analyze the directionality of disease progression, as
                    observed in our data, keeping in mind that the limited observation period of our
                    study limits our ability to be conclusive about disease directionality because
                    of the aforementioned reasons. Hence, we interpret the following results as
                    suggestive evidence of directionality rather than as a proof. To reduce the
                    noise levels of our analysis we concentrate on links between diseases affecting
                    at least 1 in 500 patients (0.2%), which from the size of our data
                    set, are expected to co-occur in at least 50 patients. At the 5 digit level our
                    comorbidity data contains 133,858 links connecting the 518 diseases affecting at
                    least 1 out of 500 patients.</p>
                <p>Consider the link connecting diseases <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>.
                    To assign a direction to this link we begin counting the number of times disease
                        <italic>i</italic> was diagnosed before disease <italic>j</italic> and
                    represent this number as <italic>L<sub>i→j</sub></italic>. When
                    computing <italic>L<sub>i→j</sub></italic> we disregard those cases in
                    which both diseases were diagnosed for the first time in the same visit, as our
                    data does not allow us to study precedence within the same hospitalization;
                    hence
                            <italic>L<sub>i→j</sub>+L<sub>j→i</sub>≤C<sub>ij</sub></italic>.
                    Most links connect diseases with large differences in prevalence; hence we
                    normalize <italic>L<sub>i→j</sub></italic> by the prevalence of the
                    disease <italic>i</italic> using the formula
                            <italic>l<sub>i→j</sub></italic> = (<italic>L<sub>i→j</sub></italic>+1)/P<italic>
                        <sub>i</sub>
                    </italic>, where the factor of one is added to include, when taking ratios,
                    those cases in which <italic>L<sub>i→j</sub></italic> is equal to zero.
                    In such cases <italic>l<sub>i→j</sub></italic> = 1/P<italic>
                        <sub>i</sub>
                    </italic>. We introduce this normalization because the probability that a
                    disease is diagnosed before another disease is proportional to its prevalence.
                    Finally, we can assign a direction to a link by creating a variable that, after
                    controlling for the prevalence of a disease, is positive if a disease tends to
                    precede another disease (outgoing link) and negative if a disease tends to come
                    after the disease at the other end of that link (incoming link). We define the
                        <italic>directionality λ<sub>i→j</sub></italic> of the link
                    connecting disease <italic>i</italic> to disease <italic>j</italic> as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e013" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>A value of
                    <italic>λ</italic><sub>i→j</sub> = 1
                    indicates that, after controlling for prevalence, the probability a patient is
                    diagnosed with disease <italic>i</italic> before it is diagnosed with disease
                        <italic>j</italic> is 10 times higher than the probability a patient is
                    diagnosed with disease <italic>j</italic> before being diagnosed with disease
                        <italic>i</italic>. Whereas a value of
                        <italic>λ</italic><sub>i→j</sub> = 2
                    indicates that the ratio between this probabilities is equal to 100. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g006">Fig 6 A</xref> shows the distribution
                    of <italic>λ<sub>i→j</sub></italic> calculated for the 133,858
                    links connecting diseases affecting at least 1 out of 500 patients. We find that
                    this distribution has a well defined peak close to
                        <italic>λ</italic><sub>i→j</sub> = 0,
                    indicating that the most common type of link is that without a preferred
                    direction. Despite this, there are a substantial number of links that do appear
                    to show a preferred direction. We find that, out of the 133,858 links
                    considered, 15,625 (11.7%) of them lie outside the

                <p>The directionality analysis allows us to extend our study of disease connectivity
                    and lethality to include the directionality of the links connecting a disease to
                    other diseases in the PDN. By assigning a direction to the links connecting a
                    disease with other diseases in the PDN we can classify diseases into
                        <italic>source</italic> and <italic>sink</italic> diseases;
                    <italic>source</italic> diseases being those whose links are more likely to
                    point away from them and <italic>sink</italic> diseases being those whose links
                    are more likely to point towards them. To capture this effect we define the
                        <italic>precedence</italic> of disease <italic>i</italic> as the sum of the
                    directionality of the links connecting a disease to all of its neighboring
                    diseases in the PDN:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000353.e014" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula></p>
                <p>Λ<sub>i</sub> is positive for diseases that tend to come before other
                    diseases and is negative for diseases that tend to come after other diseases. We
                    find that Λ<sub>i</sub> is not independent of disease prevalence, as it
                    exhibits a slow, logarithmic, dependence on it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g006">Figure 6 B</xref>). We can remove the dependence of
                        Λ<sub>i</sub> in the prevalence of a disease by subtracting the
                    trend directly from it. This allows us to obtain a detrended measure of disease
                    precedence (Λ<sub>i</sub>*, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g006">Figure 6 B</xref> inset) which is independent of
                    prevalence and can be used to explore the information on lethality contained in
                    the structure of the PDN.</p>
                <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000353-g006">Figure 6 C</xref> shows that
                        Λ<sub>i</sub>* is negatively correlated with the
                    connectivity of a disease, indicating that highly connected diseases in the PDN
                    tend to come after other diseases, rather than before, suggesting that highly
                    connected diseases more likely represent advanced stages of illness. Finally, we
                    study the relationship between disease precedence and lethality, finding that
                    patients diagnosed with sink diseases tend to die sooner than those diagnosed
                    with source diseases, as measured from our directionality analysis in the PDN.
                    We checked whether this result was just a restatement of our previous finding,
                    indicating that patients diagnosed with highly connected diseases tend to die
                    sooner than those diagnosed with sparsely connected diseases, and found that
                    both effects are simultaneously significant (see SM). Furthermore, our
                    statistical analysis shows that for relatively short terms (2 years) disease
                    precedence is a better predictor of lethality than disease connectivity, whereas
                    disease connectivity appears to be a better predictor of lethality than disease
                    precedence for longer terms (8 years). Hence both, the connectivity and
                    precedence of a disease, carry important information on the burden that a given
                    disease signifies for patients affected by it.</p>

            <p>While there is a great deal of expectation that disease associations are of enormous
                potential value to the research community, the lack of phenotypic data available to
                complement genotypic and proteomic datasets has limited scientific progress towards
                elucidating the origins of human disease. Here we take a step toward rectifying this
                situation by introducing an extensive, publicly available data set quantifying
                comorbidity associations expressed in a large population.</p>
            <p>An important issue raised by calls for phenotypic network information is the
                potential integration of phenotypic data with genetic and proteomic data to better
                elucidate disease etiology. There are, however, other potential applications of a
                network-based approach to diseases. Phenotypic “maps” like the
                ones presented here could be used to study the disease evolution of patients and
                represent an ideal way to visualize and represent medical health records in a future
                in which digital medical records will need to be accessed by health care workers in
                a delocalized manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000353-Hidalgo2">[33]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Here we have shown suggestive evidence that patients develop diseases close in the
                PDN to those already affecting them. We also showed that the PDN has a heterogeneous
                structure where some diseases are highly connected while others are barely connected
                at all. While not conclusive, these observations can explain the observation that
                more connected diseases are seen to be more lethal, as patients developing highly
                connected diseases are more likely those at an advanced stage of disease, which can
                be reached through multiple paths in the PDN.</p>
            <p>Exploring comorbidities from a network perspective could help determine whether
                differences in the comorbidity patterns expressed in different populations indicate
                differences in biological processes, environmental factors, or health care quality
                provided for each population. Here we show as a first step that there are
                differences in the strength of co-morbidities measured for patients of different
                races and gender. The PDN could be the starting point of studies exploring these and
                related questions. This is why we make our data available to the research community
