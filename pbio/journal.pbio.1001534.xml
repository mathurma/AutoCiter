        <p>Vascular calcification is an advanced feature of atherosclerosis for which no effective therapy is available. To investigate the modulation or reversal of calcification, we identified calcifying progenitor cells and investigated their calcifying/decalcifying potentials. Cells from the aortas of mice were sorted into four groups using Sca-1 and PDGFRα markers. Sca-1<sup>+</sup> (Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup>) progenitor cells exhibited greater osteoblastic differentiation potentials than Sca-1<sup>−</sup> (Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup>) progenitor cells. Among Sca-1<sup>+</sup> progenitor populations, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells possessed bidirectional differentiation potentials towards both osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineages, whereas Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells differentiated into an osteoblastic lineage unidirectionally. When treated with a peroxisome proliferator activated receptor γ (PPARγ) agonist, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells preferentially differentiated into osteoclast-like cells. Sca-1<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells in the artery originated from the bone marrow (BM) and could be clonally expanded. Vessel-resident BM-derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup> calcifying progenitor cells displayed nonhematopoietic, mesenchymal characteristics. To evaluate the modulation of in vivo calcification, we established models of ectopic and atherosclerotic calcification. Computed tomography indicated that Sca-1<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells increased the volume and calcium scores of ectopic calcification. However, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells treated with a PPARγ agonist decreased bone formation 2-fold compared with untreated cells. Systemic infusion of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells into Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> mice increased the severity of calcified atherosclerotic plaques. However, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells in which PPARγ was activated displayed markedly decreased plaque severity. Immunofluorescent staining indicated that Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells mainly expressed osteocalcin; however, activation of PPARγ triggered receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB (RANK) expression, indicating their bidirectional fate in vivo. These findings suggest that a subtype of BM-derived and vessel-resident progenitor cells offer a therapeutic target for the prevention of vascular calcification and that PPARγ activation may be an option to reverse calcification.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Atherosclerosis involves hardening of the arteries and can lead to heart disease. Calcium accumulation in blood vessels contributes to this process, and this process is regulated by cells that promote calcium accumulation (osteoblasts) and cells that reverse the accumulation (osteoclasts). In this study, we show that vascular calcifying progenitor cells in the blood vessel have the potential to become either osteoblasts or osteoclasts, and that a drug can push these cells towards becoming osteoclasts instead of osteoblasts. Progenitor cells that express both Sca-1 and PDGFRα cell surface proteins were more committed to differentiate into osteoblasts, while cells that only expressed Sca-1 could differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts in a bidirectional manner. Moreover, treatment with a PPARγ agonist could shift the direction of differentiation of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> progenitor cells toward osteoclast-like cells, whereas it cannot influence the fates of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> progenitors. These results offer new therapeutic targets for reversing calcium accumulation in blood vessels.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Vascular calcification (VC) is a feature of progressive and advanced atherosclerosis that is regarded as a prognostic marker of adverse cardiovascular events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Vattikuti1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Johnson1">[2]</xref>. No therapies are available to ameliorate VC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Doherty1">[3]</xref>. The pathophysiology of VC involves a strict and active regulatory process that resembles bone formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Cho1">[4]</xref> and functions to maintain a balance between osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Sage1">[5]</xref>. The origin of osteoblastic cells in the vasculature remains an issue of active debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Fadini1">[6]</xref>. Resident vascular smooth muscle cells (VSMCs) and calcifying vascular cells have been examined to elucidate the cellular origins of VC. Pericytes, mesenchymal stem cells (MSCs), myofibroblasts, and circulating osteoprogenitor cells have been isolated from the vasculature and shown to have osteoblastic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Abedin1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Collett1">[10]</xref>. However, few studies have addressed the origins, features, and roles of osteoclastic and decalcifying cells in the vasculature or the balance between osteoblastic and osteoclastic cells during VC.</p>
      <p>In this study, we aimed to identify vascular calcifying progenitor cells and to modulate or reverse VC. We first isolated vessel-resident calcifying progenitor cells using stem cell antigen-1 (Sca-1) and platelet-derived growth factor receptor alpha (PDGFRα) antibodies in the vasculature. We then identified a population of nonhematopoietic mesenchymal Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells (Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells) that originated from the bone marrow (BM) and could be clonally expanded. Among the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> populations, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells possessed unidirectional osteoblastic potential. In contrast, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells possessed bidirectional osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation potentials. Both calcifying progenitor Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells induced ectopic mineralization and atherosclerotic calcification in vivo. When PPARγ was activated in bidirectional Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells, calcium accumulation was reduced, and plaque severity was decreased. This cell population may offer new therapeutic targets and modalities for ameliorating VC.</p>

        <p>Our double-immunostaining enabled us to categorize cells into the following four groups: Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup>, Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>, and Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/PDGFR<sup>−</sup>. We subsequently isolated and propagated aortic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s002">Figure S2</xref>) and performed fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). No difference in sorting was detected between cells sorted immediately (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s003">Figure S3</xref>) or after 2 wk of cell expansion. We confirmed the purities of the sorted cell populations by immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next assessed the osteoblastic differentiation potentials of the four cell groups over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Under three osteoblastic differentiation conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Tintut1">[15]</xref>, Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells (Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup>) showed significantly higher numbers and activities of alkaline phosphatase (ALP)–positive cells than Sca-1<sup>−</sup> cells (Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>, Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/PDGFR<sup>−</sup>). We also confirmed the level of mRNA expression of several osteoblast-related genes in the four groups of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s004">Figure S4A,B</xref>). Our results indicate that Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells are superior to Sca-1<sup>−</sup> cells in terms of osteoblastic differentiation potentials and osteoblastic fate adaptation capacities.</p>
        <p>We also determined the osteoclastic potentials of the four cell groups. The cells were cultured in osteoclast differentiation media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Osteoclastic differentiation potentials were then assessed by tartrate-resistant acidic phosphatase (TRAP) staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wan1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Shinohara1">[17]</xref>. The Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cell population was comprised of significantly more TRAP-positive cells than the other three cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Under moderate osteoblastic differentiation conditions, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells highly expressed the osteoclast-related gene, receptor activator for nuclear factor-κB (RANK), and the osteoblast-related genes, osteoprotegerin (OPG), and RANK ligand (RANKL). However, in serum containing tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α), RANK expression was suppressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We detected the expression of other osteoclast-related genes in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells, but not in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1G</xref> and ).</p>
        <p>To examine whether differentiated Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells function as osteoclast-like cells, we measured calcium resorption ability. Cells were cultured on a calcium phosphate-coated disc treated with RANKL and macrophage-colony stimulating factor (M-CSF). Observation of the discs by scanning electronic microscopy (SEM) indicated that Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells generated wider areas of calcium resorption and greater pore sizes than Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). We assayed for the formation of dual actin ring sealing zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Novack1">[18]</xref>. Under osteoclastic differentiation conditions, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells cultured on dentine slices formed actin ring of the sealing zones characteristic of active osteoclasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). These structures were absent in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells cultured under the same conditions. These results confirm that Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells have the potential to differentiate into functioning osteoclast-like cells. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells possess bidirectional differentiation potentials toward both the osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineages, whereas Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells have a unidirectional differentiation potential toward the osteoblastic lineage.</p>
        <p>We tested the fates of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells in mixed medium containing FBS and TNF-α (osteoblastic differentiation stimulators) with RANKL and M-CSF (osteoclastic differentiation stimulators). We examined differentiation potentials by immunofluorescent staining of osteocalcin and cathepsin K. Seven days after incubation in mixed medium, both Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells dominantly expressed osteocalcin. Interestingly, a few Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells expressed cathepsin K but did not form multinucleated cells. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells did not express cathepsin K. These data suggest that the fates of bidirectional Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells could be primarily osteoblastic in the mixed in vivo environment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Because Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells do not possess bidirectional differentiation capacities, we examined whether PDGFRα directly influences the differentiation phenotypes of these cells. We treated Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells with PDGF-BB (10 ng/ml or 25 ng/ml) and 10% charcoal-stripped FBS for 0, 3, 7, or 14 d. TNF-α treatment was used as a positive stimulation control in flow cytometry. We analyzed osteoblast-related gene expression by real-time PCR and ALP expression by flow cytometry. The mRNA expression levels of osteoblast-related genes were mildly increased in the PDGF-BB treatment group compared with the FBS only treatment group. Similarly, FACS indicated that PDGF-BB treatment marginally increased ALP expression compared with FBS only. suggesting that PDGFRα is not a functional receptor for osteoblastic differentiation. In contrast, TNF-α treatment markedly increased ALP expression. In PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells, PDGF-BB mildly stimulated osteoblast differentiation and promoted cells to migrate into artificial bone structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Yoshida1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wildemann1">[20]</xref>. These researchers as well as we concluded that PDGFRα was a marker but not a functional receptor for osteoblastogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

        <title>Ex Vivo Osteoblastic and Osteoclastic Differentiation of BM-Derived Vascular Calcifying Progenitor Cells and the Modulation of Differentiation by a PPARγ Agonist</title>
        <p>To confirm the ex vivo osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation abilities of BM-derived calcifying progenitor cells, we harvested and cultured cells from the aortas of C57 mice that had undergone GFP–BMT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). Cultured aortic cells were divided into four groups of GFP<sup>+</sup> cells with respect to their Sca-1/PDGFRα statuses and were used in osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation experiments.</p>
        <p>Under osteoblastic differentiation conditions, GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells differentiated more readily into osteoblasts than GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>−</sup> cells. Under osteoclastic differentiation conditions, GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells exclusively differentiated into osteoclasts. These findings suggest that BM-derived vessel-resident Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells possess osteoblastic/osteoclastic differentiation potentials. In contrast, GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells displayed only osteoblastic differentiation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>PPARγ activation has been suggested to repress osteoblastogenesis and to activate osteoclastogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wan1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Akune1">[23]</xref>. These observations led us to hypothesize that PPARγ activation in calcifying progenitor cells might reverse the process of VC. We first confirmed endogenous PPARγ expression in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> calcifying progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). BM-derived vessel-resident GFP<sup>+</sup> cells then were cultured in FBS and TNF-α to strongly induce osteoblast differentiation and the influence of an added PPARγ agonist was assessed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In the absence of PPARγ activation, osteoblastic differentiation was markedly induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Under the same conditions, PPARγ activation of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells suppressed osteoblastogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) and promoted osteoclastic differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). PPARγ activation suppressed the expression of osteoblast-related genes and enhanced the expression of osteoclast-related genes, facilitating the emergence of TRAP-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>) as confirmed by real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s008">Figure S8B,C</xref>).

        <p>To verify the in vivo calcifying ability of progenitor cells and the efficacy of PPARγ activation, we isolated GFP<sup>+</sup> calcifying progenitor cells from the arteries of C57 mice that underwent GFP–BMT. GFP<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells were combined with bone matrix, implanted subcutaneously into WT C57 mice, and a PPARγ agonist was injected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). After 8 wk of PPARγ agonist treatment, X-ray and three-dimensional computed tomography (CT) of the implanted mice indicated a higher mineralization density of a bone-like structure in the Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cell groups compared with mice administered phosphate-buffered saline (PBS). This mineralization of mass was remarkably inhibited in Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells treated with a PPARγ agonist compared with cells without PPARγ activation. Specifically, the bone-like structure of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells was dramatically reduced by PPARγ activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g006">Figure 6B,C</xref>). The volume and calcium scores of Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells were higher than those of either PBS-treated or Sca-1<sup>−</sup> cells quantified using the Agatston method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Park1">[24]</xref>. These scores were significantly increased in Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells treated with a PPARγ agonist. However, no difference was detected between mice injected with PBS or PBS and a PPARγ agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Masson's trichrome (MT) staining indicated that Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cell injection enhanced blue staining, indicating bone-like tissues, whereas PPARγ treatment decreased blue staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g006">Figure 6F</xref>).</p>

        <p>Therefore, we sought to determine the effect of PPARγ activation in Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells by double-staining with osteocalcin and cathepsin K. Injected GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells were osteocalcin-positive and cathepsin K-negative. Injected GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells were primarily osteocalcin-positive, but some GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells were doubly positive for osteocalcin and cathepsin K. Exclusively cathepsin K-positive cells were observed only in the mass of GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells treated with a PPARγ agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g006">Figure 6G–I</xref>). These results demonstrate that BM-derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells are bidirectional, and PPARγ may act as a regulator of VC in these cells.</p>

        <p>The calcium accumulation levels of each cell group were measured from harvested arteries. The groups injected with BM-GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells, especially BM-GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells, showed greater calcium accumulation in tissues than animals injected with PBS. This calcium accumulation was significantly avoided by concurrent treatment with a PPARγ agonist. However, no difference in calcium accumulation was measured between mice injected with PBS versus PBS and a PPARγ agonist. Therefore, the preventative effects of the GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> + PPARγ condition should be mainly attributed to the BM-GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells, not the PPARγ agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Mice injected with GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells showed significantly more severe atherosclerotic calcified plaques identified by MT and von Kossa staining. These plaques were prevented by the addition of GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells and a PPARγ agonist (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g007">Figure 7D,E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Additional studies were conducted to determine the characteristics of the injected GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells that infiltrated the calcified atherosclerotic plaques. GFP<sup>+</sup> cells were double-stained with osteocalcin and RANK. In the calcified atherosclerotic plaques of PBS injected mice, osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts and a few RANK<sup>+</sup> osteoclasts were observed. Mice injected with GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells harbored plaques infiltrated primarily by osteocalcin-positive cells. Mice injected with GFP<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells contained plaques that were infiltrated with both osteocalcin and RANK double-positive cells as well as osteocalcin-positive osteoblasts. These data suggest that the Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells we observed in calcified atherosclerotic plaques possessed both osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation potentials. PPARγ agonist treatment significantly decreased the infiltration of osteoblasts and increased the infiltration of osteoclast or double-positive cells into the plaques (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g007">Figure 7F–H</xref>). We conclude that PPARγ activation can decrease atherosclerotic calcification by modulating the fate of bidirectional Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells.</p>

      <p>VC occurs by an actively regulated process, but the origin of vascular calcifying cells has not been established. In this study, we demonstrated the origin, in vitro and ex vivo characteristics, and differentiation potentials of a population of vascular calcifying progenitor cells. These cells were confirmed to modulate calcification/decalcification through a series of in vivo experiments. A schematic illustration of calcifying/decalcifying progenitor cells and their proposed actions is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001534-g008">Figure 8</xref>.</p>

          <p>Illustration of calcifying/decalcifying progenitor cells and their proposed roles in noncalcified conditions (A) and atherosclerotic plaques (B). Sca-1<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells do not express hematopoietic lineage markers but express MSC-like markers. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> progenitor cells differentiate into osteoblasts/osteoclasts bidirectionally, whereas Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> progenitor cells are committed to osteoblastic fates. PPARγ activation can shift the direction of differentiation of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> progenitor cells toward osteoclasts, but it cannot change the differentiation of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> progenitors. (A) Under homeostatic noncalcified conditions, circulating BM-derived calcifying cells (Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells) infiltrated the adventitia through the vasa vasorum. (B) Under pathologic atherosclerotic calcification or therapeutic intravascular cell delivery, these cells might infiltrate into the intima directly from the blood.</p>

      <p>Recent studies have shown that circulating BM-derived cells could infiltrate via the vasa vasorum (micro vessel) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Moulton1">[25]</xref>. However, it remained unclear how cells could infiltrate the intima. Others have suggested that the vasa vasorum is increased in the adventitia during inflammation. The vasa vasorum may function as a hallway for cell migration into the adventitia toward atherosclerotic plaques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Gossl1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Maiellaro1">[27]</xref>. However, circulating BM-derived cells could directly infiltrate the atherosclerotic plaques. Shimizu et al. demonstrated that cells infiltrating the intima originated as circulating BM-derived cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Shimizu1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Saiura1">[29]</xref>. Cho et al. reported that cells infiltrating the adventitia did not migrate into the intima and only circulating cells infiltrated the plaque lesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Cho2">[30]</xref>. Our results suggest that under homeostatic noncalcified conditions, circulating BM-derived calcifying cells (Sca-1<sup>+</sup> cells) infiltrated the adventitia through the vasa vasorum. However, under pathologic atherosclerotic calcification or therapeutic intravascular cell delivery, these cells might infiltrate into the intima directly from the blood.</p>
      <p>Osteoblasts originate from MSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Fadini1">[6]</xref>, whereas osteoclasts are cell–cell fused multinucleated cells derived from granulocyte/macrophage hematopoietic progenitor cells in the bone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Roodman1">[31]</xref>. Recently, Eghbali-Fatourechi et al. reported that circulating osteoblastic cells are elevated in adolescents and in patients with fractures, reflecting increased bone formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-EghbaliFatourechi1">[32]</xref>. However, the roles of circulating osteoblastic cells during VC have not been elucidated. Osteoclast-like cells in the vasculature may originate from circulating hematopoietic cells that were recruited to blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Doherty2">[33]</xref>, but this possibility has not been confirmed. Here, we demonstrate that a subtype of calcifying progenitor cells, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells, originate in BM and infiltrate arteries. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells are mesenchymal and possess bidirectional osteoblastic/osteoclastic potentials. The bidirectionality of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells was supported by Masuda et al. (2001), who identified ALP and TRAP double-positive cells in tissues during endochondral ossification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Masuda1">[34]</xref>. Others have described the mesenchymal characteristics of CD45<sup>−</sup>TER119<sup>−</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells, and injected Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells primarily differentiate into osteoblasts in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Morikawa1">[35]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We examined the in vivo modulation of calcifying progenitor cell differentiation by PPARγ activation using an ectopic model and an atherosclerotic calcification model. When tissue was double-stained with osteoblast (osteocalcin) and osteoclast (cathepsin K or RANK) markers, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells mainly differentiated into osteocalcin-positive cells. However, when cells were cultured with a PPARγ agonist, their differentiation shifted from osteoblastic to osteoclastic or double-positive cells in tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wan1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Soroceanu1">[36]</xref>. These results suggest that PPARγ activation shifts Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells from osteoblastic to osteoclastic differentiation in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Halade1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wan2">[38]</xref>. The concentration of the PPARγ agonist, rosiglitazone (5 mg/kg/d), used in the mice study was higher than the human AUC (area under curve) of the FDA-recommended clinical daily dose. Thus, additional study is warranted to find an efficacious novel PPARγ agonist. We also investigated the mechanism by which PPARγ facilitates osteoblastic differentiation. PPARγ activation suppresses osteoblastogenesis by favoring adipogenesis and improving osteoclastogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Akune1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Ali1">[39]</xref>. Wei et al. reported that the transcriptional co-activators of PPARγ, PGC1β and ERRα, enable cell differentiation into osteoclasts and adipocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wei1">[40]</xref>. These researchers demonstrated that PPARγ activation upregulated osteoclast differentiation by inducing GATA2, which is required to generate osteoclast progenitors, and by activating PPARγ ligand via c-fos induction, thereby stimulating osteoclast differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wei1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Wei2">[41]</xref>. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells cultured in TNF-α with PPARγ activation suppressed osteoblastogenesis and enhanced the expression levels of osteoclast-related genes, especially c-fos expression, compared with cells in the absence of PPARγ stimulation.</p>
      <p>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells displayed both osteoblastic and osteoclastic differentiation potentials in this study. However, the hierarchy between Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells remains unclear. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> likely are hierarchically above Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells because the former are capable of differentiating into osteoblasts or osteoclast-like cells, whereas the latter differentiate into osteoblasts only. Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells have multi-potentiality with relatively weak MSC marker expression and scanty hematopoietic marker expression. These cells can differentiate into osteoclast-like cells that usually are derived from hematopoietic stem cells, implying that they might be positioned hierarchically between hematopoietic stem cells and MSCs. When they are committed into a more specific lineage, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells probably lose their bidirectional potential, becoming unidirectional Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells. Notably, calcifying progenitor cells in the artery and BM are not abundant.</p>
      <p>The present study has several limitations. We have characterized calcifying progenitor cells in C57 wild-type mice, but not in C57 background Apoe<sup>−/−</sup> mice. Thus, those cells may be different or behave differently when added to atherosclerotic environment. The numbers of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells in the BM were less than 1% of the total BM cells. However, the infiltration of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells into the vessels was associated with marked aggravation of atherosclerotic calcification. Based on the percentage of cells measured by flow cytometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Naik1">[42]</xref>, BM-derived Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> osteocalcin-positive cells comprised 2% of the total cells infiltrating the artery, and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> osteocalcin<sup>+</sup> RANK<sup>+</sup> (or cathepsin K<sup>+</sup>) cells comprised 1%. Under PPARγ-activated conditions, the number of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> osteocalcin<sup>+</sup> RANK<sup>+</sup> (or cathepsin K<sup>+</sup>) cells increased by 2%, and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> RANK<sup>+</sup> cells increased by 0.5%. These cells are expected to substantially impact VC homeostasis even if their absolute numbers are low. It is obvious that VSMCs play an important role in calcification of the vasculature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Tintut2">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Speer1">[44]</xref>. An analysis of calcification induction in these cells (Sca-1<sup>−</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup>) is beyond the scope of the present study. Our focus is on the characteristics and significance of Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>+</sup> cells and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that BM-derived, MSC-like Sca-1<sup>+</sup>/PDGFRα<sup>−</sup> cells reside in the arterial adventitia and possess differentiation potentials toward both osteoblastic and osteoclastic lineages. Even under calcifying conditions, PPARγ activation promoted osteoclastic differentiation of bidirectional cells, both in vitro and ex vivo. Finally, we confirmed the in vivo relevance of bidirectional progenitor cells that are modulated by PPARγ activation. This subtype of BM-derived circulating and vessel-resident calcifying progenitor cells offers a new therapeutic target for VC. PPARγ activation in these cells has the potential for VC management.</p>

To detect single clonal expansion, sorted arterial cells from C57 mice were seeded into 6-well plates (1×10<sup>4</sup> cells/well) or into 96-well plates (1 cell/well). After 14 d of culture, colonies were Giemsa-stained (Sigma). To examine whether calcifying progenitor cells were derived from single cells that could differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts, cells were seeded into 12-well plates (200 cells/well) and were cultured for 7 d. Cells then were induced to differentiate into osteoblasts or osteoclasts during the following 14 d. Differentiated cells were stained with Alizarin Red S or TRAP and measured the mRNA expression of the following Adipocyte and chondrocyte differentiation markers: C/EBP (CCAAT-enhancer-binding proteins) α and β, PPARγ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Boucher1">[53]</xref>, collagen 1a1, 2a1, aggrecan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001534-Hiramatsu1">[54]</xref>, and GAPDH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001534.s012">Table S3</xref>).</p>
