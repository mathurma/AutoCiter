        <p>Nodal and BMP signals are important for establishing left-right (LR) asymmetry in vertebrates. In sea urchins, Nodal signaling prevents the formation of the rudiment on the right side. However, the opposing pathway to Nodal signaling during LR axis establishment is not clear. Here, we revealed that BMP signaling is activated in the left coelomic pouch, specifically in the <italic>veg2</italic> lineage, but not in the small micromeres. By perturbing BMP activities, we demonstrated that BMP signaling is required for activating the expression of the left-sided genes and the formation of the left-sided structures. On the other hand, Nodal signals on the right side inhibit BMP signaling and control LR asymmetric separation and apoptosis of the small micromeres. Our findings show that BMP signaling is the positive signal for left-sided development in sea urchins, suggesting that the opposing roles of Nodal and BMP signals in establishing LR asymmetry are conserved in deuterostomes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Bilateral animals that are externally symmetric in appearance often have internal organs that are asymmetric with respect to the left and right sides of their bodies. Two signals, Nodal and BMP, have been shown to establish this asymmetry during vertebrate embryogenesis. We investigate here whether the same mechanisms that establish left-right patterning in vertebrates are conserved in invertebrate animals, specifically in the California purple sea urchin. This sea urchin passes through various stages in its lifecycle before developing to adulthood, including a feeding larva stage in which the tissue that goes on to form the adult, the so-called adult rudiment, forms on the left side. Previous studies have shown that right-sided Nodal signaling in sea urchins prevents the formation of the adult rudiment. In this study, we show that BMP signaling is activated on the left side and is required for the development of this left-sided structure. We also demonstrate that Nodal signaling blocks BMP activity and induces apoptosis of the tissue that forms the adult rudiment on the right side. We propose that the roles of  Nodal and BMP signals in establishing left-right asymmetry are evolutionarily conserved.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the most fascinating features of bilaterian development is the consistent left-right (LR) asymmetry of their internal organs. In the past two decades, studies of molecular pathways controlling LR asymmetry have broadened our knowledge regarding the dissimilar and conserved mechanisms among different animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Speder1">[1]</xref>. It has been suggested that the mechanisms of initial symmetry breaking are not conserved across different vertebrate classes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Vandenberg1">[2]</xref>. For example, a leftward fluid flow generated by the posteriorly tilted nodal cilia initiates left-sided gene expression in the mouse embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Hashimoto1">[3]</xref>. On the other hand, differential activities of ion pumps in early stage embryos are important for establishing LR asymmetry in the chick, frog, and zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Raya1">[4]</xref>. Although detailed symmetry-breaking mechanisms vary among different vertebrate species, the common outcome is the expression of <italic>nodal</italic>, which encodes a transforming growth factor β (TGFβ) ligand, in the left lateral plate mesoderm (LPM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Levin1">[5]</xref>. The Nodal pathway not only regulates LR asymmetry in vertebrates but also controls the formation of the left-sided adult rudiment in sea urchins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Duboc1">[6]</xref> and body chirality in snails <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Grande1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Bone morphogenic protein (BMP), another TGFβ family member, is also involved in LR patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Kishigami1">[8]</xref>. In opposition to conserved <italic>nodal</italic> expression on the left side, BMP transcripts or activities are observed on the right side of the node or LPM. For example, <italic>bmp4</italic> is expressed on the right side of Hensen's node in the chick embryo and initiates a right-sided signaling cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-MonsoroBurq1">[9]</xref>. Although <italic>bmp</italic> genes are expressed symmetrically in the LPM of the mouse and chick embryos, BMP activity is greater on the right side due to the presence of BMP antagonists on the left side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Mine1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Katsu1">[13]</xref>. A BMP/ALK2/Smad-mediated signaling pathway is also proposed to be active on the right side of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Ramsdell1">[14]</xref>. Therefore, right-sided BMP opposing left-sided Nodal seems to be a conserved feature. The role of BMP in LR patterning is largely unknown in invertebrates, even though right-sided expressed <italic>dpp-bmp2/4</italic> plays important roles in shell formation and coiling in gastropods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Iijima1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Shimizu1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Sea urchins belong to the phylum Echinodermata, which is characterized by a pentaradiate adult body plan. In indirect developing sea urchins, the adults are derived from bilaterally symmetric larvae. The transition from a bilaterally symmetric to pentasymmetric body plan relies on a LR asymmetrical control that results in the formation of an adult rudiment on the left side of the larva (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s001">Figure S1</xref>). During gastrulation, a coelomic pouch (CP) composed of <italic>veg2</italic> mesoderm and small micromeres (Smm) forms at the archenteron tip and later separates into left and right pouches in the bilateral gastrula <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Cameron1">[17]</xref>. The first morphological signature of LR asymmetry in the pluteus larva is the extension of a duct-like structure, the hydroporic canal (HC), from the left CP to the aboral ectoderm where the hydropore forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Gustafson1">[18]</xref>. The ciliated HC is thought to be an excretory organ that contributes to normal body width maintenance in the larva <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Hara1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Ruppert1">[20]</xref> and later differentiates into a portion of the adult water vascular system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Hyman1">[21]</xref>. The differentiated left coelom together with the invaginated left oral ectoderm, called the primary vestibule, develop into an adult rudiment with pentaradial symmetry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Eaves1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Smith1">[23]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our knowledge of the molecular mechanisms concerning LR patterning in sea urchins is relatively limited. It has been shown that sea urchin LR axis specification depends on cell interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-McCain1">[24]</xref>. A series of microsurgery experiments revealed that the positioning of the adult rudiment on the left side is directed by signals from the right side <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Aihara1">[25]</xref>. Duboc et al. further demonstrated that <italic>nodal</italic> expression on the right side, which is reversed when compared to vertebrates, prevents the formation of the adult rudiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Duboc1">[6]</xref>. In addition, signals emitted from the micromeres also regulate LR asymmetry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Kitazawa1">[26]</xref>, although the identity of the micromere-derived signal remains unknown. It is also not known whether positive signals or a default pathway are required for the left-sided structure development.</p>
      <p>In this study, we focused on the role of the BMP pathway and examined the molecular basis of LR asymmetry in the sea urchin embryo. We found that <italic>bmp</italic> genes are symmetrically expressed in skeletogenic micromeres, but BMP signaling is asymmetrically activated in the left CP-derived HC. Through cell lineage analysis, we detected active BMP signaling in <italic>veg2</italic> descendants but not in the Smm. We further provided evidence that BMP signaling is required for left-sided structure development and the expression of several left-sided marker genes. We also demonstrate that right-sided Nodal signaling restricts BMP activity and is involved in the asymmetrical separation and apoptosis of the Smm. We discuss these findings in the context of Nodal and BMP signaling in patterning LR asymmetry in the sea urchin embryo.</p>

        <title>pSmad1/5/8 Was Detected on the Left Side of the Larva</title>
        <p>To study the role of BMP signaling in LR asymmetry in sea urchins, we first examined the expression patterns of genes related to the BMP signaling pathway. The sea urchin genome contains three <italic>bmp</italic> ligand genes: <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>bmp3</italic>, and <italic>bmp5–8</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Lapraz1">[27]</xref>. <italic>Bmp2/4</italic> is initially transcribed in the oral ectoderm at the blastula stage, but the Bmp2/4 ligand translocates to the aboral side and plays key roles in the aboral ectoderm gene regulatory network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Angerer1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Su1">[33]</xref>. The expression patterns of sea urchin <italic>bmp3</italic> and <italic>bmp5–8</italic> have not been elucidated. Therefore, we performed quantitative PCR and discovered that the <italic>bmp3</italic> transcripts are not detectable during the first 3 d of development, whereas <italic>bmp5–8</italic> was expressed in the egg and during this period (unpublished data). In situ hybridization demonstrated that <italic>bmp2/4</italic> expression shifted from the oral ectoderm to the aboral skeletogenic mesenchyme cells during gastrulation and remained in a few cells at the apex of the pluteus larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This expression pattern is similar to <italic>Pl-bmp2/4</italic> from sea urchin <italic>Paracentrotus lividus</italic>; however, the timing for the expression domain shift occurs later in this species because its oral ectodermal expression can still be observed in the gastrula stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Lapraz1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Lapraz2">[31]</xref>. The <italic>bmp5–8</italic> transcripts were ubiquitously detected in the egg and later in the whole ectoderm at the blastula and early gastrula stages. Similar to <italic>bmp2/4</italic>, <italic>bmp5–8</italic> expression also shifted to the aboral skeletogenic cells at the late gastrula and pluteus stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Both the <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>bmp5–8</italic> genes were bilaterally expressed during all analyzed stages. We further examined the expression patterns of BMP receptors (<italic>alk1/2</italic>, <italic>alk3/6</italic>, <italic>bmpr2</italic>, and <italic>acvr2</italic>) and did not observe asymmetrical LR expression (unpublished data). We then investigated BMP signaling activity by monitoring the phosphorylation and nuclear translocation of its downstream mediator Smad1/5/8 (pSmad). Immunostaining with a pSmad antibody showed that BMP signaling was activated in the aboral ectoderm at the blastula stage, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Chen1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Lapraz2">[31]</xref>. During gastrulation, pSmad was bilaterally detected in the skeletogenic, ectodermal, and archenteron cells on the aboral side of the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>). In addition, we observed an LR asymmetric pSmad pattern with a stronger signal on the left CP of the pluteus larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g001">Figure 1D–G</xref>). Detailed observation revealed that the staining was restricted to the HC but was absent at the base of the left CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g001">Figure 1H,I</xref>). These results suggest that although <italic>bmp2/4</italic> and <italic>bmp5–8</italic> are symmetrically expressed, BMP signaling is activated on the left side in the pluteus larva and may play a role in controlling left-sided development in sea urchins.</p>

Comparable expression patterns were observed for the left-sided markers <italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>six1/2</italic>, and genes encoding Six1/2 cofactors <italic>eya</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Yankura1">[38]</xref> and <italic>dach</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figure 2F–I</xref>). However, <italic>dach</italic> was also expressed on the oral side of the archenteron tip at the late gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">Figure S2B</xref>,C).</p>
        <p>We also reexamined germ-line-associated genes known to be expressed in the Smm, such as <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>seawi</italic>, and <italic>nanos2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Juliano1">[37]</xref>. Indeed, these genes were expressed in Vasa protein-positive Smm located in the archenteron roof at the gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figure 2J,K</xref>). <italic>Vasa</italic> and <italic>seawi</italic> transcripts were also detected on the aboral side of the archenteron tip (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">Figure S2D</xref>, arrows). At the pluteus stage, <italic>vasa</italic> and <italic>seawi</italic> continued to be expressed in the Smm in both CPs, although <italic>nanos2</italic> expression quickly disappeared on the right side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figure 2L–N</xref>). We also noted that <italic>vasa</italic> and <italic>seawi</italic> mRNA signals were stronger on the left side.</p>
        <p>Three forkhead genes, <italic>foxC</italic>, <italic>foxF</italic>, and <italic>foxY</italic>, were reported to be expressed in the archenteron tip during gastrulation and later in the CPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Hibino1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Tu1">[41]</xref>. We detected <italic>foxC</italic> transcripts on the oral side of the archenteron tip at the gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figures 2O</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">S2E</xref>). This expression pattern marked a novel domain (oral tip) that is not derived from the Smm that contain Vasa protein and <italic>nanos2</italic> transcript and does not express <italic>soxE</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figures 2P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">S2F</xref>). As the CP budded out from the archenteron tip and separated into the left and right CP, <italic>foxC</italic> expression decreased in the oral tip and was detected in the Smm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figures 2Q,R</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">S2F</xref>). The <italic>foxF</italic> expression pattern was broader than that of <italic>foxC</italic> at the gastrula stage. In addition to the expression in the oral tip, <italic>foxF</italic> was also weakly expressed in the aboral tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figure 2S,T</xref>). At the pluteus stage, <italic>foxF</italic> transcripts remained in the oral tip cells that constitute part of the CPs adjacent to the esophagus (esophageal domain) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figures 2U,V</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">S2F</xref>). The third forkhead gene, <italic>foxY</italic>, was expressed in the Smm from the blastula stage to the gastrula stage; however, transcripts were not detected at the pluteus stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">Figure S2G</xref>).</p>
        <p>Collectively, there are at least three domains on the archenteron tip at the gastrula stage: the <italic>veg2</italic>-derived oral and aboral tips and the Smm located on the roof (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figure 2W</xref>). Each of these three domains expressed a set of genes. <italic>FoxC</italic>, <italic>foxF</italic>, and <italic>dach</italic> were expressed in the oral tip; the aboral tip contained pSmad signal and expressed <italic>soxE</italic>, <italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>six1/2</italic>, <italic>eya</italic>, <italic>dach</italic>, <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>seawi</italic>, and <italic>foxF</italic>; and the roof contained Vasa protein and expressed <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>seawi</italic>, <italic>nanos2</italic>, and <italic>foxY</italic>. During CP formation, the pSmad signal on the right side disappeared. After the two CPs separated, the left CP was distinguishable from the right CP based on the pSmad signal and the larger expression domains of <italic>vasa</italic> and seawi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figure 2X</xref>). At the pluteus stage, the left CP could also be distinguished into three domains based on gene expression patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g002">Figure 2Y</xref>). The HC was derived from the left aboral tip of the archenteron and was marked with pSmad and expressed the same set of genes, except <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>seawi</italic>, and <italic>foxF</italic>. The cells at the oral tip of the archenteron moved to a position that lay next to the esophagus and continued to express <italic>foxF</italic>. These cells were at the same location as the myoblasts that were labeled with an anti-actin antibody, and they may have later extended processes and differentiated into esophageal muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Burke1">[42]</xref>. The Smm located in the roof of the archenteron at the gastrula stage moved to the base of the CP in the pluteus larva, which represented the third domain that expressed <italic>foxC</italic> and germline markers <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>seawi</italic>, and <italic>nanos2</italic>.</p>

        <title>BMP Signaling Is Required for Left-Sided Structure Formation and Gene Expression in <italic>veg2</italic> Descendants</title>
        <p>Given that pSmad was detected in the HC, we next examined whether BMP signaling is required for HC and rudiment formation. To bypass the early function of BMP signaling in oral-aboral (OA) axial patterning, we used pharmacological treatments to perturb BMP signaling prior to LR axis establishment. A small molecule, dorsomorphin (DM), which selectively inhibits BMP type I receptors and blocks Smad phosphorylation, was previously identified in a screen for compounds that perturb dorsoventral (DV) axis formation in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Yu1">[43]</xref>. To test whether DM inhibited BMP signaling in the sea urchin, we treated the embryos from fertilization to the mesenchyme stage and performed immunoblot analysis using the pSmad antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s006">Text S1</xref>). We observed a dose-dependent reduction of pSmad (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). DM also reduced the expression level of <italic>hox7</italic>, a downstream target gene of BMP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Su1">[33]</xref>, as well as pSmad staining intensity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Therefore, DM inhibits BMP signaling in the sea urchin. Conversely, treating embryos with recombinant mouse BMP4 protein (mBMP4) as an exogenous source of BMP ligand expanded <italic>hox7</italic> expression and pSmad signal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). When the embryos were treated with DM or mBMP4 after the OA axis was established (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3H</xref>), we observed defects in CP and HC formation. In DM-treated embryos, the levels of <italic>bmp2/4</italic> transcript and pSmad signal were attenuated in the aboral skeletogenic cells at the late gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), indicating that <italic>bmp2/4</italic> expression is controlled by its own signaling. The hydropore was not observed in treated pluteus larva, and these embryos also lacked left-sided pSmad staining and ciliated HC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed that the pSmad signal persisted in the aboral skeletogenic and ectodermal cells, indicating that DM did not completely abolish BMP signaling. After the inhibitor was washed out from the culture, 79% of the DM-treated embryos recovered to form rudiments on the left side at the advanced rudiment (AR) stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). This was significantly lower than that of the controlled embryos (98%). Eighteen percent of the treated embryos formed rudiments on both sides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, bottom panels), and 4% had right-sided rudiments. Ectopic mBMP4 treatment resulted in random positioning of a single undivided CP with <italic>soxE</italic> expression in 89% of the embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, open arrowheads). In 11% of mBMP4-treated embryos, two HCs with bilateral <italic>soxE</italic> expression formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, solid arrowheads, and 3E). These results indicate that BMP signaling is required for proper CP differentiation and left-side HC formation.</p>

        <p>We further analyzed LR marker gene expression patterns after BMP signaling was perturbed. The expressions of all examined genes that were normally expressed in the aboral <italic>veg2</italic> descendants, including <italic>soxE</italic>, <italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>six1/2</italic>, <italic>eya</italic>, and <italic>dach</italic>, were diminished in DM-treated embryos but remained in the single CP when BMP signaling was elevated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Smm genes, such as <italic>vasa, seawi</italic>, <italic>nanos2</italic>, and <italic>foxC</italic>, continued to be expressed at the tip of the archenteron in DM-treated and in the single CP in mBMP4-treated embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). These results are in agreement with the lineage analysis demonstrating that BMP signaling acts on aboral <italic>veg2</italic> descendants but not on Smm. Surprisingly, we also discovered that inhibiting and elevating BMP signals both resulted in the loss of right-sided gene expression, including <italic>nodal</italic> and its downstream targets <italic>lefty</italic>, <italic>pitx2</italic>, and <italic>not</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3H</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Duboc1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Hibino1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Hibino2">[44]</xref>. The requirement of BMP signals for <italic>nodal</italic> expression is likely indirect because pSmad was not detected in the right lateral ectoderm where <italic>nodal</italic> is expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). We further examined <italic>nodal</italic> expression at the late gastrula stage when its right-sided expression began to distinguish whether BMP signals are required for initiation or maintenance of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. The results showed that all embryos lost their right-sided <italic>nodal</italic> expression when BMP signaling was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). The expression of <italic>nodal</italic> either disappeared (84%) or was retained in the oral ectoderm (16%). These results indicate that BMP is required for <italic>nodal</italic> expression initiation, although the mechanism remains unknown.</p>
        <p>Although DM has been used as a selective BMP signaling inhibitor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Yu1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Hao1">[45]</xref>, it also inhibits a panel of kinases in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Vogt1">[46]</xref>. Therefore, to specifically inhibit BMP signaling and bypass its early function, we treated the embryos with vivo-morpholinos (vMOs), which are antisense morpholino oligonucleotides linked to eight guanidinium head groups for effective cellular membrane penetration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Morcos1">[47]</xref>. vMOs have been shown to be effective in a variety of systems, including mice, chick embryo, adult zebrafish, and cultured cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Morcos1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Kowalik1">[49]</xref>. We first tested the efficacy and specificity of BMP2/4 vMO in sea urchin embryos. We observed that BMP2/4 vMO effectively blocked green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression in a dose-dependent manner when the embryos were injected with mRNA containing the vMO binding site fused to the GFP sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3D</xref>–F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s006">Text S1</xref>). The effect was specific because GFP fluorescence was not attenuated by the control or non-specific vMO. When embryos were treated at the 1-cell stage, BMP2/4 vMO also blocked expression of the downstream target <italic>hox7</italic> but had little effect on the non-target <italic>chordin</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3G</xref>, MB). When the vMO was added later at the mesenchyme blastula stage, similar effects were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s003">Figure S3G</xref>, LG). Therefore, vMOs are effective in the sea urchin embryos and can be used at various developmental stages. When embryos were treated with BMP2/4 vMO from the mesenchyme blastula stage to the late gastrula stage, pSmad staining at the HC disappeared, but <italic>vasa</italic> expression remained in the Smm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3J</xref>). In addition, the expression of <italic>nodal</italic> and the left-sided genes <italic>soxE</italic>, <italic>pax6</italic>, <italic>six1/2</italic>, and <italic>eya</italic> disappeared, which was similar to the effects induced by DM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3I,J</xref>). However, the effects of DM and BMP2/4 vMO on <italic>dach</italic> expression were different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3F,J</xref>). <italic>Dach</italic> expression was absent in DM-treated embryos, but its transcripts remained on the archenteron tip in BMP2/4 vMO-treated embryos. Given that <italic>dach</italic> is expressed in both the oral and aboral archenteron tip at the late gastrula stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), we suspected that its oral tip expression domain was not affected by BMP2/4 vMO, and the complete disappearance following DM treatment might be due to a non-specific drug effect. We also examined the effects of BMP2/4 vMO on adult rudiment formation. Similar to the effects of DM, most embryos treated with BMP2/4 vMO recovered and formed rudiments on the left side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g003">Figure 3K</xref>). A small but significant portion of the treated embryos developed bilateral rudiments, presumably due to the requirement of <italic>nodal</italic> expression by BMP signaling. Taken together, these results supported the hypothesis that BMP signaling is required for proper LR patterning and the expression of the left-sided genes that are normally expressed in aboral <italic>veg2</italic> descendants.</p>

        <title>Nodal Signaling Inhibits BMP Signaling and Its Downstream Target Gene Expression</title>
        <p>Because Nodal is known to function on the right side to prevent the rudiment formation in sea urchins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Duboc1">[6]</xref>, we further examined the relationship between Nodal and BMP signaling during LR axis establishment. At 42 h post-fertilization (hpf), <italic>nodal</italic> expression was in the oral ectoderm and pSmad staining and <italic>soxE</italic> expression were bilateral at the tip of archenteron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). At 48 hpf (late gastrula stage), <italic>nodal</italic> expression shifted to the right lateral ectoderm and pSmad staining and <italic>soxE</italic> transcripts started to restrict on the left side. By 54 hpf, <italic>nodal</italic> expression remained in the right lateral ectoderm, whereas pSmad and <italic>soxE</italic> expression were detected in the differentiating left CP. Therefore, the appearance of <italic>nodal</italic> transcripts on the right side seems to correlate with decreased BMP signaling on the right side. We then examined whether the disappearance of BMP signaling on the right side was regulated by Nodal signals. When Nodal signaling was inhibited with small molecule compounds SB-431542 and SB-505124, pSmad staining became bilateral, and two ciliated HCs also formed, which resulted in two hydropores on the aboral ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s004">S4A</xref>, arrows). In addition, elevating Nodal signaling with recombinant human Activin (hActivin) prevented HC formation.

        <p>We further analyzed the effects of Nodal signaling on LR-related genes. When Nodal signaling was blocked, <italic>nodal</italic>, <italic>lefty</italic>, <italic>pitx2</italic>, and <italic>not</italic> were downregulated, confirming that Nodal signaling is upstream of the right-sided genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). However, enhancing Nodal signaling with hActivin did not lead to bilateral expression of right-sided genes. This result is different from the previous study in <italic>P. lividus</italic> sea urchin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Duboc1">[6]</xref>, suggesting that the transcriptional regulation of the <italic>nodal</italic> gene might differ in the two species. Consistent with the idea that Nodal signals block BMP signaling, we observed that all left-sided BMP signaling downstream target genes were expressed bilaterally in both CPs when Nodal signaling was blocked, whereas hActivin inhibited their expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g004">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001402.s004">S4C</xref>, arrowheads). Interestingly, Nodal signaling had different effects on genes that are expressed in the Smm. The expression of <italic>nanos2</italic> became bilateral when Nodal signaling was blocked. In the hActivin-treated embryos, <italic>nanos2</italic> expression was diminished, and <italic>foxC</italic> and <italic>foxF</italic> transcripts were reduced.

        <title>Nodal Signaling Regulates Asymmetrical Separation and Induces Small Micromere Apoptosis</title>
        <p>Although we showed that Nodal signaling prevented left-sided development by inhibiting BMP signaling in <italic>veg2</italic> descendants, the effects of Nodal signaling on the Smm are unclear. A detailed analysis of <italic>nodal</italic> and <italic>pitx2</italic> transcripts revealed that in addition to the expression in the right lateral ectoderm, both genes were expressed in the Vasa-positive Smm in the right CP at the late gastrula and the pluteus stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Another Nodal downstream gene, <italic>not</italic>, exhibited a similar expression pattern, except that it was not detected in the ectoderm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). These data suggest that Nodal signaling is received by the Smm on the right side. At the early pluteus stage, we frequently observed that BrdU- or Vasa-positive Smm were asymmetrically partitioned into the left and right CPs and eventually disappeared from the right side. Of the eight Smm at this stage, in most cases, five and three cells were partitioned into the left and right CP, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This 5∶3 ratio was also observed when Smm were labeled with histone H1cs antiserum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Pehrson1">[50]</xref>. Because the right-sided Smm receive Nodal signals, we next determined whether Nodal signaling controls their asymmetrical separation. We classified the separation as asymmetrical (L≥5; R≤3) or symmetrical (L = 4; R = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5Ea</xref>). Inhibiting Nodal signaling significantly increased the rate of symmetrical separation from 8% to 56% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5Eb</xref>), indicating that Nodal signaling regulates asymmetrical Smm separation. These results are consistent with the observation that the asymmetric expression patterns of Smm-expressed genes, such as <italic>vasa</italic> and <italic>seawi</italic>, became symmetric after Nodal signaling was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g004">Figure 4D,E</xref>).</p>

        <p>When labeling Smm with the Vasa antibody, we observed that the number of the Vasa-positive Smm on the right side decreased to two or even one in some of the pluteus larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This observation suggests that the disappearance of the Smm on the right side is a gradual process. It was proposed that <italic>nanos</italic>-depleted Smm undergo apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Fujii1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Juliano2">[52]</xref>. Because <italic>nanos2</italic> expression was blocked by Nodal signaling in the right-sided Smm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), we wondered whether Nodal signaling induces Smm to undergo apoptosis. When the larvae were stained with TUNEL, we observed that one to three cells in the right CP were apoptotic, whereas no apoptotic cells were detected in the left CP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Furthermore, inhibition of Nodal signaling prevented apoptosis in the CPs, and hActivin treatment resulted in apoptotic cells in both CPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5G</xref>, arrows). These effects correlate well with <italic>nanos2</italic> expression following Nodal signaling perturbation. These data suggest that Nodal signaling induces apoptosis in the right-sided Smm, possibly by controlling <italic>nanos2</italic> expression. In addition to apoptotic cells in the right CP, we also observed TUNEL-positive cells in the aboral ectoderm of pluteus larva (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001402-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). These signals were attenuated and increased when Nodal signaling was blocked and elevated, respectively, suggesting that Nodal signaling is also involved in aboral ectodermal cell apoptosis.</p>

        <title>The Molecular Pathways in LR Patterning</title>

The esophageal domain of the left CP expresses <italic>foxF</italic>. The initial bilateral pSmad signal at the tip of the archenteron in the late gastrula stage becomes restricted to the left side due to the inhibition by right-sided Nodal signaling, which also regulates its downstream genes in the right CP. Moreover, the initiation of <italic>nodal</italic> expression on the right side indirectly depends on BMP signaling, and a right lateral ectoderm (RLE) input may also be involved in the spatial regulation of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. Taken together, these data suggest that BMP signaling is both upstream and downstream of Nodal signaling.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Most sea urchin adult tissues derive from the rudiment developed from the left CP. Although it is known that both Smm and the <italic>veg2</italic> mesoderm contribute to the CPs, past studies were unable to clearly identify genes that are specifically expressed in either lineage. It was also unknown which of the two lineages contributed to the left CP-derived HC. In addition to identifying several lineage-specific genes in the CP and the HC, we also provided evidence to demonstrate that BMP signals act in the left CP together with Nodal signaling to regulate LR patterning. Given that left-sided <italic>nodal</italic> expression is a conserved feature in chordates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Boorman1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Yu2">[54]</xref> and right-sided BMP signaling is observed in several vertebrate species, the opposing Nodal and BMP signals regulating LR asymmetry is likely a conserved mechanism in deuterostomes. However, the mechanisms controlling LR asymmetry in the sea urchin are reversed compared to chordates, using the convention that the mouth is located on ventral sides of embryos. Thus, our study reinforces the possibility that DV inversion occurred in the chordate lineage. Below, we discuss other important findings from this study.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Opposing Nodal and BMP Signals Control LR Axis Patterning</title>
        <p>We demonstrated that elevating either Nodal or BMP signaling resulted in the loss of the other signal. This mutual antagonism between Nodal and BMP signaling has been observed during LR patterning in vertebrates. Nodal signaling inhibits BMP signals in the left LPM of mouse embryos by activating the expression of <italic>chordin</italic> and <italic>noggin</italic> genes, which encode BMP antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Mine1">[10]</xref>. BMP signaling also has been shown to block Nodal signals in the right LPM of mouse, chick, and zebrafish embryos by activating the expression of <italic>lefty</italic> genes that encode Nodal antagonists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Kishigami1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Monteiro1">[55]</xref>. The inhibition of BMP signals by Nodal signaling has also been observed in sea urchin embryos during DV (aboral-oral) axis establishment. Nodal signaling in the oral ectoderm is required for the expression of <italic>chordin</italic>, which restricts BMP signals in the aboral ectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Lapraz2">[31]</xref>. However, we could not detect any asymmetrical LR expression of genes encoding BMP antagonists, such as <italic>chordin</italic>, <italic>noggin</italic>, <italic>follistatin</italic>, <italic>dan</italic>, or <italic>gremlin</italic> in the sea urchin embryo (unpublished data). The second molecular mechanism to explain the mutual antagonism between Nodal and BMP signaling is the direct competition between the two signals for the limited amount of the common effector Smad4. In the mouse embryo, BMP signaling has been shown to set a repressive threshold for Nodal signaling in the LPM by limiting Smad4 availability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Furtado1">[56]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Micromere-Derived Signals Control LR Asymmetry in Sea Urchin Embryos</title>
        <p>The repressive role of Nodal signaling on BMP in the sea urchin embryo is evident given that increasing or blocking Nodal signaling results in the loss of or bilateral pSmad staining in CPs, respectively. However, the effects of BMP signaling on Nodal are complicated because increasing and blocking BMP signaling both result in the loss of <italic>nodal</italic> expression. These results suggest that BMP signaling is required for right-sided <italic>nodal</italic> expression in the sea urchin embryo. This positive role of BMP signaling on <italic>nodal</italic> gene expression has also been observed in vertebrates. In the absence of mouse embryonic BMP4, <italic>nodal</italic> expression is lost in the left LPM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Fujiwara1">[57]</xref>. In chick embryos, implanting either <italic>bmp2</italic>-expressing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Schlange1">[58]</xref> or BMP-soaked beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Piedra1">[59]</xref> in the LPM increases <italic>nodal</italic> expression. During the late segmentation stages of zebrafish embryos, BMP4 signaling is required to activate the expression of the <italic>nodal</italic>-related gene <italic>cyclops</italic> in the left LPM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Chocron1">[60]</xref>. Therefore, BMP signaling can be a positive or negative regulator of Nodal signaling depending on the developmental stages and tissue layers during LR patterning in vertebrates.</p>
        <p>Although we observed LR asymmetrical BMP signaling with pSmad staining in the CPs in the sea urchin, <italic>bmp</italic> genes are transcribed in the skeletogenic mesenchyme cells near the aboral apex of the larva. These observations suggest that BMP ligands are secreted from these micromere-derived skeletogenic cells to control LR asymmetry. It was previously shown that when the micromere lineage was removed from embryos of sea urchin <italic>Hemicentrotus pulcherrimus</italic>, the LR placement of the rudiment was randomized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Kitazawa1">[26]</xref>. BMP could be the micromere-derived signal that regulates larval LR polarity, although other signaling molecules may also be involved in this process.</p>

        <title>Nodal, Nanos, and Apoptosis in Small Micromeres</title>
        <p>In sea urchin embryos, Smm form during the fifth cleavage and are regulated by a set of conserved germline lineage genes, including <italic>vasa</italic>, <italic>nanos2</italic>, and <italic>seawi</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Juliano1">[37]</xref>. Adults from Smm-deleted embryos formed small gonads without gametes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Yajima1">[61]</xref>. Therefore, Smm are required for germline specification in sea urchins. Smm lineage fate is maintained by Nanos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Juliano2">[52]</xref>, which is also required for Smm descendant survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Fujii1">[51]</xref>. Studies in fly and vertebrates have also shown that Nanos has a conserved role in maintaining germline identity by preventing apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Sato1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Lai1">[64]</xref>. In this study, we showed that Nodal signaling acts on the Smm partitioned in the right CP. Nodal signaling perturbation affected both <italic>nanos2</italic> expression and cell death. These results suggest that Nodal signaling in the right CP represses <italic>nanos2</italic> expression in the Smm, which leads to cell death. To our knowledge, the role of Nodal signaling in repressing the expression of germline lineage genes such as <italic>nanos</italic> has not been reported in other systems. Intriguingly, Nodal is capable of inducing apoptosis in adult ovary during follicular degeneration and human trophoblast cells during normal placentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Wang1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Munir1">[66]</xref>. Therefore, there may be a conserved role for Nodal to induce apoptosis in extraembryonic tissues. In the case of sea urchins, Nodal signaling-induced apoptosis in the right Smm is essential for normal development, and a lack of Nodal results in bilateral rudiments that give rise to a juvenile composed of two conjoined urchins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001402-Duboc1">[6]</xref>.</p>

At the end of gastrulation, two coelomic pouches (CPs) form on each side of the archenteron tip. A distinct LR asymmetry occurs when the hydroporic canal (HC) evaginates from the left CP. The CPs then divide into the axocoel (ax), hydrocoel (hy), and somatocoel (so). The invaginated left oral ectoderm forms the primary vestibule (pv), which makes contact with the enlarged left hydrocoel to form an adult rudiment (ru) on the left side of the larva. A secondary vestibule (sv) also invaginates from the right oral ectoderm. (B–M) LR asymmetry in the sea urchin.
