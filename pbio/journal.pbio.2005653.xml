<abstract>
<p>Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is an essential exonuclease in mammalian cells, and numerous in vivo and in vitro data evidenced its participation in immunity regulation and in genotoxicity remediation. In these very complicated cellular functions, the molecular mechanisms by which duplex DNA substrates are processed are mostly elusive because of the lack of structure information. Here, we report multiple crystal structures of TREX1 complexed with various substrates to provide the structure basis for overhang excision and terminal unwinding of DNA duplexes. The substrates were designed to mimic the intermediate structural DNAs involved in various repair pathways. The results showed that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of TREX1 served to cap the nonscissile 5′-end of the DNA for precise removal of the short 3′-overhang in L- and Y-structural DNA or to wedge into the double-stranded region for further digestion along the duplex. Biochemical assays were also conducted to demonstrate that TREX1 can indeed degrade double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) to a full extent. Overall, this study provided unprecedented knowledge at the molecular level on the enzymatic substrate processing involved in prevention of immune activation and in responses to genotoxic stresses. For example, Arg128, whose mutation in TREX1 was linked to a disease state, were shown to exhibit consistent interaction patterns with the nonscissile strand in all of the structures we solved. Such structure basis is expected to play an indispensable role in elucidating the functional activities of TREX1 at the cellular level and in vivo.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) was shown to participate in various cellular events such as DNA repair, immunity regulation, and viral infection. In addition to relating to autoimmune diseases, this exonuclease also acts as a potential protein target for anticancer or antiviral therapies. A key for such broad attendance of TREX1 is the activities of precise trimming of the 3′-overhang in a double-stranded (dsDNA) and breaking of the terminal base pairing of the duplex. Here, we designed a series of structural DNA substrates and activity assays to delineate the underlying mechanisms. The structures newly resolved in this work indicated that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of TREX1 is essential for the enzyme to carry out the aforementioned activities. Together, our results established an integrated structure view into the versatile exonuclease functions of TREX1 and illuminated the molecular origin for the unique catalytic properties of TREX1 in processing various DNA intermediates in DNA repair and in cytosolic immunity regulation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Three prime repair exonuclease 1 (TREX1) is a member of the DEDDh family of exonucleases and accounts for most of the 3′–5′ exonuclease activity in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref002">2</xref>]. Anchored in the plasma membrane of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER) through the C-terminal domain, TREX1 degrades a variety of substrates to prevent initiation of autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref008">8</xref>]. The targeted nucleic acids in this activity include single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref005">5</xref>] and double-stranded DNA (dsDNA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref011">11</xref>]. It was also suggested that DNA/RNA hybrids are potential targets of TREX1, since the deficiencies of TREX1 demonstrate similar features of autoimmune diseases as those of RNase H2 that was known for processing the hybrid substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref015">15</xref>]. Such genetic materials in the cytoplasm are mostly originated from replication of aberrant DNA intermediates and possibly also due to unrestrained endogenous retroelements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Malfunctioning of TREX1 has thus been shown to lead to inflammation and autoimmune diseases such as inflammatory myocarditis in <italic>Trex1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref018">18</xref>] and systemic lupus erythematosus (SLE), Aicardi-Goutières syndrome (AGS), retinal vasculopathy, cerebral leukodystrophy, and familial chilblain lupus (FCL) in TREX1-deficient humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref020">20</xref>]. The ability of TREX1 in modulating immune responses is also exploited by type 1 human immunodeficiency retrovirus (HIV-1) that enslaves cytosolic TREX1 to degrade its cDNA, thereby escaping detection by the nucleic acid sensors of the infected host and hence the concomitant antiviral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref021">21</xref>]. Recent studies indeed showed that TREX1 knockdown in human tissues and humanized mice delayed HIV infection and suppressed local viral replication with increased production of type 1 interferons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>Moreover, TREX1 was shown to respond to the events of DNA damage or Granzyme A (GzmA)-mediated apoptosis with concomitant translocation to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>]. TREX1 was indeed characterized as an exonuclease that involves in DNA repair and in DNA proofreading via working with other nuclear enzymes such as Poly [ADP-ribose] polymerase 1 (PARP-1) and DNA polymerase β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref025">25</xref>]. Additionally, TREX1 was established to play a role in GzmA-mediated cytotoxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref023">23</xref>]. Cytotoxic T lymphocytes and natural killer cells secrete GzmA proteases to induce cell death of the targeted cancer cells or virus-infected cells by releasing TREX1 and nonmetastatic protein 23 homolog 1 (NM23-H1) from ER-bound patient SE translocation protein (SET) complex, and their translocation to the nucleus promoted chromosomal DNA fragmentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref023">23</xref>]. With such diverse activities toward a variety of nucleic acid substrates—including ssDNA, dsDNA, DNA/RNA duplexes, structural DNAs, and DNA hybrids with an interject nick—the linkage of TREX1 to apoptotic DNA degradation in dying cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref026">26</xref>] and in chromosomal fragmentation during telomere crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref027">27</xref>] was hence not unexpected. Regulation of the exonuclease activity of TREX1 was indeed recognized as an influential factor in cancer therapy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref030">30</xref>].</p>
<p>The broad attendance of TREX1 in the activities of immune silencing and responding to genotoxic stresses highlights the elementary role of properly processing the nucleic acids that are involved in these vital yet very complicated cellular functions. Mechanistic understanding of substrate handling is hence key to comprehending the connections between different enzymes in the pathways. However, such knowledge is mostly elusive as informative molecular details are lacking. For example, precise excision of short 3′-overhangs in generation of blunt-end dsDNAs and the terminal unwinding of these duplexes for further degradation are two events in urgent need of structure basis. Although X-ray structures of TREX1 with ssDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref031">31</xref>] and Y-structural DNA are available [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref010">10</xref>], the 3′- and 5′-overhang of the substrates therein were rather long (&gt;4 nt). Therefore, the structure information is currently insufficient to deduce the mechanism by which double-stranded substrates are processed (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec008">Discussion</xref>).</p>
<p>TREX1 is, in fact, unique in the DEDDh family for the activity of dsDNA degradation, which enables its participation in preventing autoimmune responses and in restricting retrotransposons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref011">11</xref>]. The DEDDh family, also named DnaQ-like exonuclease family, or RNase T superfamily in the protein families (Pfam) database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://pfam.xfam.org/" xlink:type="simple">https://pfam.xfam.org/</ext-link>), contains over 17,000 members across more than 3,000 species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>]. Toward ssDNA substrates, the catalytic properties of TREX1 are similar to those of the <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> homolog, RNase T. When first reported, both enzymes were shown to exhibit activities involved in DNA repair, namely trimming the single-stranded segments of the mispaired ends in a DNA duplex, such as the single-stranded 3′-overhangs in duplex, Y-, or flap structural DNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref035">35</xref>]. The analogy in this activity is in line with the in vivo and in vitro experiments that concluded that the two nucleases likely play similar roles in various pathways of DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, TREX1 can digest single-stranded RNA (ssRNA) as RNase T does, and this RNase activity of TREX1 is potentially responsible for degrading DNA/RNA hybrids in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref014">14</xref>] and/or during tRNA maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref036">36</xref>]. The main difference between TREX1 and RNase T, though, is the catalytic ability of TREX1 in degrading dsDNA, for which RNase T lacks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref037">37</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we solved 4 X-ray structures of TREX1 with representative DNA substrates to delineate the molecular details of the multifaceted catalytic properties of TREX1. On one hand, TREX1 allows precise trimming of structural DNAs to generate blunt-end products in preparation for specific pathways of DNA repair. On the other hand, the enzyme enables digestion of dsDNA for immunity regulation. The 4 new structures we presented here reveal how TREX1 removes the single-stranded 3′-overhang in producing DNA duplexes with blunt ends and, for the first time, illustrate how the enzyme overcomes the resistance of the double-strand structure for degradation of dsDNA. The structural DNA substrates in our analysis were also specifically designed to mimic the DNA intermediates in various DNA repair pathways. Therefore, the new structures presented in this work provide unprecedented insights into the functional roles of TREX1 at the molecular level. Together with measurements of nuclease activities, the structure-based mechanism was also employed to discuss the cellular functions of TREX1 in DNA repair and in immune silencing.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We determined the structures of TREX1 complexed with 4 different substrates: (i) the TREX1-deoxyinosine (dI)-ssDNA structure at the 2.3 Å resolution is with a ssDNA containing a dI (dI-ssDNA); (ii) the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA structure at the 3.4 Å resolution is with a dsDNA with a scissile strand containing a dI (dI-T-dsDNA); (iii) the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA structure is with a duplex DNA that the two termini of 1-nt- and 4-nt-long 3′-overhang form an S-Tetromino shape (referred to as L-structural dsDNA based on the shape of terminals); and (iv) the TREX1-Y-structural dsDNA structure is with a Y-structural dsDNA that the 3′- and 5′-ends of noncomplementary sequences form a Y-shape structure (Y-structural dsDNA). The crystallization conditions and the diffraction and refinement statistics of these structures are listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s001">S1 Table</xref>.

<p>Nuclease activity assays showed that the exonuclease activity of TREX1 in the crystallization conditions of TREX1-dI-ssDNA, TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA, and TREX1-Y-structural dsDNA was inhibited, and the nucleic acid substrate in these structures was thus intact. The dsDNA of the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA structure was further labeled with γ-<sup>32</sup>P and analyzed using 20% denaturing polyacrylamide gels to confirm that dI-T-dsDNA was indeed intact in the crystal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s003">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). The nuclease activity of TREX1 was enhanced in the crystallization conditions of the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA structure. In this case, the input DNA substrate was digested by TREX1 into 2 small ssDNA fragments, including 6-nt- and 9-nt-long ssDNA (6-nt-long ssDNA: 5′-GGCCCT-3′ and 9-nt-long ssDNA: 5′-GGCCCTCTT-3′). The 2 ssDNA strands then hybridized to form a duplex DNA with 1-nt- and 4-nt-long 3′-overhang in the crystal. Two magnesium ions (Mg<sup>2+</sup>) were observed at the TREX1 active site in all of these structures, even though that magnesium was not additionally added in preparing the crystallization conditions. These Mg<sup>2+</sup> were likely from the expression hosts as similar phenomena had been observed in other structures of DEDDh exonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref037">37</xref>]. In the following, we first present the results of activity assays to characterize the catalytic properties of TREX1 against various substrates. Next, we discuss the 4 structures that collectively reveal the molecular principles for handling such diverse substrates.</p>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>TREX1 can digest ssDNAs and dsDNAs containing a damaged base</title>
<p>Two members of DEDDh exonucleases, <italic>Thermus thermophiles</italic> TTHB178 and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RNase T, were identified as DNA repair–related exonucleases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref038">38</xref>]. Both enzymes can remove deaminated bases like dI (also named hypoxanthine) and uracil in ssDNA with similar efficiencies as in digesting regular nitrogenous bases in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref038">38</xref>]. In addition, in vivo studies showed that TTHB178 and RNase T exhibited similar responses to the genotoxic stresses of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV irradiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref038">38</xref>].</p>
<p>Since TREX1 was shown to respond to such genotoxic stress by translocating to the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>], it would be of interest to characterize whether TREX1 can digest DNA substrates damaged by H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> and UV irradiation as TTHB178 and RNase T do. Therefore, we incubated TREX1 with ssDNA substrates that each contain a methylated base, a deaminated base, an oxidized base, or an abasic site at the 3′-terminal end (5′-GAGTCCTATA<underline>X</underline>-3′) and measured the activities of TREX1 in ssDNA degradation. The results presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s004">S2A Fig</xref> clearly showed that TREX1 exhibited similar activities in digesting ssDNAs containing a methylated base (O<sup>4</sup>-methylthymine [O<sup>4</sup>-mT] and O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine [O<sup>6</sup>-mG]) or a deaminated base (uracil and hypoxanthine) as in digesting ssDNAs with regular bases (adenine). The ssDNA with an abasic site or an oxidized base (8-oxoguanine [8-oxoG]), though, was more resistant to TREX1. Therefore, the base preference of TREX1 to ssDNA substrates is similar to that of TTHB178 and RNase T in the DEDDh family.</p>
<p>RNase T showed in in vitro experiments that it can serve as a downstream exonuclease of Endonuclease V (Endo V)–mediated alternative base excision repair (AER) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>]. Endo V–mediated AER repairs DNA lesions originated from deamination of the adenine base (hypoxanthine), frame shift mutations, or replication errors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref041">41</xref>]. The initiation step is making a nick at the 3′ side 1 base away from the damaged site. Expression of eukaryotic Endo V in DNA repair–deficient <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells reduced the mutation frequency in the host, suggesting that the DNA repair function of Endo V may commonly display in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref041">41</xref>]. Therefore, TREX1 may also serve as a downstream exonuclease of Endo V, as RNase T does. In addition to DNA substrates, recent studies showed that both Endo V and TREX1 are also ribonucleases, as they exhibited considerable activities in digesting RNA substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref032">32</xref>]. Despite the common ground at the level of enzyme activity, the involvement of TREX1 in this DNA repair pathway and its specific roles would require further investigation to establish.</p>
<p>A prominent question, therefore, is whether TREX1 can process the structural DNAs generated by Endo V. In this regard, we designed and synthesized a bubbled dsDNA containing a dI with or without the 5′-overhang to mimic the end product of the enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). This double-stranded substrate is referred to as dI-dsDNA. The Tris-borate-EDTA (TBE) gel electrophoresis was used to check the structure property of dI-dsDNA. With identical numbers of bases, the moving speed of dI-dsDNA in the gel was in between that of a Y-structural dsDNA and that of a regular dsDNA, indicating an intermediate, bubbled structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s004">S2B Fig</xref>). The results of our nuclease activity assay showed that TREX1 indeed broke the terminal base pairing and removed the last base pair near the penultimate hypoxanthine base at the 3′-end of dI-dsDNA (the 2 site labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). In addition, TREX1 also removed the penultimate hypoxanthine base and antepenultimate adenine base (the 1 and 0 sites labeled in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). For the dI-dsDNA substrate with 5′-overhang, similar results were observed, indicating that the dangling 5′-ends did not affect TREX1 in processing the dsDNA.</p>

<p>In summary, our activity measurements established that TREX1 not only digested the dI in ssDNA; the enzyme can also extend into the duplex region and removed the last 3 bases at the 3′-end of a bubbled dI-dsDNA that mimics the product of Endo V. These results also highlighted that TREX1 is able to unwind the terminal base pairs in a DNA duplex to conduct digestion.</p>

<title>TREX1 exhibits structure similarity in binding with dI-ssDNA and ssDNA</title>
<p>To provide the structural basis for TREX1 in complexing an ssDNA substrate containing dI, we determined the TREX1-dI-ssDNA structure. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2C</xref> showed that the 3′-end of dI-ssDNA is inserted into the active site of TREX1 in each of the dimer in the asymmetric unit. The last nucleotide at the 3′-end is stacked by Leu24 and Ile84 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Each active site contained 2 Mg<sup>2+</sup>, MgA and MgB. MgA coordinates with Asp18, Glu20, and Asp200 of TREX1 and was in contact with the phosphate oxygens of the scissile DNA strand. The His195 general base in the active site lacked the nucleophilic water that would bind MgA, a commonly observed configuration among the structures of DEDDh members [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref037">37</xref>]. MgB in the structure coordinated with 6 partners in the octahedral geometry, including Asp18, 2 phosphate oxygens in the scissile DNA stand, and 3 water molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Both active sites of TREX1 in the asymmetric unit showed an active conformation as in the structures of other classical DEDDh exonucleases (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s005">S3A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>In the TREX1-dI-ssDNA structure, the hypoxanthine base was designed to locate in the penultimate position at the 3′-end of dI-ssDNA as the products generated by Endo V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2A and 2C</xref>). The omitted electron density map of the hypoxanthine base in ssDNA fits very well to the three-dimensional structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Superposition of the structure of the TREX1-dI-ssDNA structure with that of TREX1 bound with a regular ssDNA showed that TREX1 bound both substrates with high structure similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s005">S3B Fig</xref>). Therefore, the chemical modification into a hypoxanthine base at the penultimate position of the 3′-end did not affect the binding mode of TREX1 with ssDNA and its active site structure.</p>

Both active sites of the enzyme dimer displayed the same active conformation as in the TREX1-dI-ssDNA structure. The omitted electron density maps in the double-strand region of both dI-dsDNA strands, though, were well defined for structure determination. In contrast, the electron densities of the 2 short 5′-overhang were not as continuous and weak, suggesting that the 3-nt-long 5′-overhangs were disordered (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s006">S4A Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The structure of the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA complex vividly illustrated the mode by which TREX1 broke the last base pairing in the duplex region. In particular, the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster acted as a wedge to chisel the duplex end formed by the last G-C pair and the dI-T wobble pair, and the DNA adopted a Y-like structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). The complex of TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA hence provided a first structural basis for the ability of TREX1 in unwinding the duplex region of dsDNA. In addition to the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster, the structure indicated that the narrow pocket of the TREX1 active site was also involved in breaking the double-stranded structure as Leu24 and Ile84 stacked with the last nucleotide at the 3′-end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Furthermore, the last nucleotide at the 3′-end of the substrate formed several hydrogen bonds with Glu20, Ala21, and Tyr129 in the narrow pocket (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s006">S4B Fig</xref>). These couplings to the 3′-end would thus facilitate unwinding of the terminal base pair. In summary, TREX1 exhibited the delicate machinery that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster partnering with the narrow active site pocket to unwind the duplex end for digestion of dsDNA.</p>
<p>The mechanistic insights provided by the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA complex structure were in line with the biochemical assay measurements presented earlier that TREX1 removed the 2 to −1 bases at the 3′-end of the bubbled dI-dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Our results thus illustrated that the unique catalytic properties of TREX1 in digesting dsDNA and in processing the hypoxanthine base can serve to digest the product generated by Endo V. This finding represented an evidence that a DEDDh member like TREX1 and RNase T may act as a downstream exonuclease for Endo V–mediated AER in DNA repair.</p>

<title>The structural basis for precise excision of 3′-overhang in structural DNAs by TREX1</title>
<p>Our activity measurements showed that TREX1 can remove the single-stranded regions in structural DNAs, and blunt-end duplexes are a main form of product of TREX1 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">5A</xref>). To uncover the molecular origin of such precise removal of the 3′-overhang, we determined the structures of TREX1 complexed with the substrates that we devised to mimic the intermediates in UV-induced DNA repair. The structures of TREX1-L-structural dsDNA and TREX1-Y-structural dsDNA were solved at 1.7 Å and 2.0 Å resolution, respectively. The protein residues interacting with the DNA substrates in these two structures are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s007">S5 Fig</xref>.

<p>In the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA structure, 1 asymmetric unit contained 2 TREX1 monomers and 2 ssDNAs of 6 and 9 nt in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The 2 strands paired to their symmetric ssDNA in the crystal via GC-rich regions. The annealed DNA strands formed 2 duplexes of 1-nt- and 4-nt-long 3′-overhang, respectively. Each 3′-terminus of the DNAs displayed an L-like conformation, and for both duplexes, the 3′-overhang was inserted into the narrow active site of a TREX1 monomer. We designate molecule A as the TREX1 monomer that bound with the duplex DNA with a 1-nt-long 3′-overhang, 1-nt-L-DNA and molecule B as the TREX1 monomer that bound with the DNA duplex with a 4-nt-long 3′-overhang, 4-nt-L-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>Superposition of 1-nt-L-DNA and 4-nt-L-DNA revealed 2 distinct modes of binding duplex DNA for molecule A and molecule B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s008">S6A Fig</xref>). It can be seen clearly that the duplex segments of 1-nt-L-DNA and 4-nt-L-DNA sit at 2 different loci with respect to the protein. The Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of molecule A capped the 5′-end of 1-nt-L-DNA via contact with the last base of the nonscissile strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Leu24 and Ile84 in the narrow pocket of the active site in molecule A also stacked with the last nucleotide at the 3′-end of the scissile strand as in the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA structure, indicating joint actions of the two structure motifs for removal of the 3′-overhang. Molecule A also formed 4 hydrogen bonds with the nonscissile strand of 1-nt-L-DNA and via Ser26, Arg128, and Lys160. In molecule B, however, it was a groove composed of Ala161, Leu162, Ala214, Gln217, and Trp218 on the other side of the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster that contacted with the 5′-end of 4-nt-L-DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s008">S6B Fig</xref>). Moreover, molecule B did not form any hydrogen bonds or stacking interactions with the nonscissile strand of 4-nt-L-DNA.</p>
<p>Therefore, the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA structure showed that, in trimming a duplex DNA to generate duplexes with blunt ends, TREX1 can cap the nonscissile 5′-end via the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster and form hydrogen bonds and stacking interactions with the nonscissile strand. Such binding mode was neither observed in the case of molecule B bound with 4-nt-L-DNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s008">S6B Fig</xref>) nor in earlier structures of TREX1 with substrates that contain a longer 3′-overhang [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>The binding mode of Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 capping the nonscissile 5′-end was also observed in the TREX1-Y-structural dsDNA structure. In this case, the crystal also contained 2 TREX1 molecules in the asymmetry unit, and both bound with a Y-structural DNA of 2-nt-long 3′- and 5′-overhang. The sequence and structure of the substrate are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">Fig 5B</xref>. The scissile strand of the Y-structural DNA was trapped by TREX1 via more than 10 amino acids, and the last nucleotide of the 3′-end was inserted into the active site and stacked by Leu24 and Ile84 in the narrow active site pocket, as observed in the structures of TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA and TREX1-L-structural dsDNA. The last base (G1) at the 5′-overhang of the substrate sits in the gap between TREX1 and the last base at the duplex region of Y-structural DNA and was flanked by the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster of TREX1 and the T3 base on the nonscissile strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). With the nonpairing T2 base of the nonscissile strand flipped out, this binding mode is similar to that of molecule A bound with 1-nt-L-DNA in the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Therefore, both structures that contain duplex DNAs with a short 3′-overhang revealed the binding mode of Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster in TREX1 capping the nonscissile 5′-end. Signature of this mode also highlighted the joint actions of the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster and the active site pocket in coupling to the 3′-end of the scissile strand, and specific interactions with the nonscissile strand were observed as well. These results provide the structural basis for duplex DNAs without a 3′-overhang being a major product form of TREX1 in activity assays (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">5A</xref>).</p>

<title>The molecular basis and regulation mechanisms of TREX1 in dsDNA degradation</title>
<p>The Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster that wedged the nonscissile 5′-end in the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA complex structure located at the N-terminal of a short helix of Pro25 to Ser27, and the helix was linked to the β strands of β1 and β2 by 2 loops. Although β1 and β2 are highly conserved, bioinformatics analysis indicated that the sequence and structure of the region in between exhibits significant variation in the DEDDh exonuclease family (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g006">Fig 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s009">S7A Fig</xref>).

The PDB structures used in the structural alignment are mouse TREX1 (PDB accession code: 5YWU), human TREX2 (PDB accession code: 1Y97), <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> CRN-4 (PDB accession code: 3CG7), <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RNase T (PDB accession code: 4KA0), <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> ExoX (PDB accession code: 4FZX), human ISG20 (PDB accession code: 31WLJ), and human 3′Hexo (PDB accession code: 4QOZ). In this region, only TREX1 and TREX2 contain a small helix that starts the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster. (B) The nuclease activities of TREX2 and RNase T in digesting duplex DNAs with 3′-overhang. The concentration of duplex DNA was 0.5 μM. TREX2 exhibited activities in digesting the duplex regions of DNA. RNase T at 500 nM only removed the 3′-overhang in duplex DNA and produced a duplex DNA with 1- or 0-nucleotide 3′-overhang. When the concentration of RNase T was increased by 20-fold to 10,000 nM, the double-strand structure of the substrates still persisted.

<p>In TREX1, the helical form of the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster in between β1 and β2 shaped a wedge-like structure, which can cap the 5′-end for producing blunt-end duplexes (the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA structure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and the TREX1-Y-structural dsDNA structure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and even overcome the hindrance of duplex regions for processing dsDNAs (the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA structure, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Such unique catalytic powers compared to other members in the DEDDh family echoed the distinct helical structure form of the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster in TREX1 and the concomitant higher mechanical strength. With a loop form of structure in the corresponding region, the nuclease assay of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RNase T did not reveal any activity toward dsDNA, even at an enzyme concentration as high as 10 μM under the same reaction conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s009">S7B Fig</xref>). The capability of digesting duplex structures was only observed for the closely related homolog TREX2 that also contained a wedge helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g006">Fig 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s009">S7B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Indeed, over the incubation time of our nuclease activity assays, TREX1 was shown to fully consume ssDNA as well as dsDNA, albeit the enzyme concentration for the double-stranded substrate was higher (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). To further examine the roles of Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster in the activity of TREX1, we generated 4 single-site mutants (L24G, L24A, L24W and S26W) and 2 triple mutants (L24G/P25G/S26G and L24W/P25W/S26W) of the enzyme and measured the activities of these TREX1 mutants against ssDNA and dsDNA substrates. In comparison to the wild type, all mutants showed reduced activities toward both dsDNA and ssDNA substrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g006">Fig 6D, 6E and 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s009">S7C, S7D and S7E Fig</xref>). Therefore, it can be inferred that perturbations to the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster due to these mutations affected not only the ability of stacking the last base at the 3′-end (with Ile84) to properly position the substrate in the active site for catalysis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g003">3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">5B</xref>); they also eliminated the power of breaking the terminal base pairing. Our mutagenesis and activity characterizations highlighted the importance of the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster in both terminal unwinding of dsDNA and 3′-ended nucleotide stacking for TREX1.</p>
<p>As the enzyme concentration was further raised to 500 nM, the measured activity for digesting the duplex regions was also augmented to accomplish full digestion of dsDNA as long as 708 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). At an enzyme concentration of 50 nM, on the other hand, TREX1 processed the ssDNA region of 3′-overhang in double-stranded substrates, leaving a blunt-end dsDNA (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">5A</xref>); the enzyme also trimmed the weaker pairing of a damaged base at a duplex terminal, as in the case of a nicked DNA generated by Endo V (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). These results showed that the dsDNA degradation activity is concentration dependent, and under the in vivo scenario, other factors could also come to modulate the activity. For example, it is highly likely that the activity of TREX1 is coupled with partner proteins such as high mobility group box 2 (HMGB-2). HMGB-2 is also a component of ER-associated SET complex and is related to cytosolic nucleic acid–mediated innate immune responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref044">44</xref>]. The activity of HMGB-2 in bending the dsDNA structure potentially would generate distorted structures to facilitate dsDNA degradation by TREX1. Our preliminary results of activity measurements showed raised ability of TREX1 in digesting PCR products in the presence of mouse HMGB-2 (mHMGB-2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s011">S9 Fig</xref>). With mHMGB-2, TREX1 can fully digest PCR product at a lower enzyme concentration of 0.2 μM, evidencing the interplay between mHMGB-2 and TREX1 in modulating DNase activities.</p>

<title>Structures of TREX1 with dsDNA that contained a short 3′-overhang revealed key mechanistic information of terminal excision and unwinding</title>

As a result, consensus features in such structures of binding were only observed for the last 2 nucleotides at the end of the 3′-overhang, while the farther-away regions of the scissile and nonscissile strands exhibited different directions and orientations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s010">S8A Fig</xref>).

The colors and schematic diagrams of 3 duplex DNAs are displayed in the bottom panel. The right panel shows a close look for the difference between the scissile strands in the 3 duplex DNAs. The relative positions of the scissile strand of the duplex DNA in these 3 structures are different, only the positions of the last 2 nucleotides at the 3′-end of the scissile strand can fit well with each other. (B) Superposition of the three structures of TREX1 in complexing with a duplex DNA with a short 3′-overhang (&lt;4-nt), including 1-nt-long 3′-overhang in the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA structure (1-nt-L-DNA), Y-structural DNA with 2-nt-long 3′-overhang in the TREX1-Y-structural dsDNA structure, and dI-containing dsDNA in the TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA structure. Comparison of these structures indicates the similarity of the binding regions between TREX1 and the 3′-end and 5′-end of the three types of dsDNA substrates.

<p>On the contrary, a consistent mode of binding was observed in the structures resolved in this work that TREX1 complexed a dsDNA with a short 3′-overhang. The 3′-end of the scissile strand and the 5′-end of the nonscissile strand (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) exhibited reproducible patterns in the TREX1-L-structural dsDNA, TREX1-Y-structural dsDNA, and TREX1-dI-T-dsDNA structures. For example, stacking between the nonscissile strand and the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster as well as the hydrogen bonding between Arg128 and the nonscissile strand (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s006">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s007">S5</xref> Figs) are both prominent features that were commonly observed in these structures.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Principles of TREX1 in binding and processing DNA substrates</title>
<p>Based on the 4 structures newly resolved in this work and literature data, we summarize the binding modes of TREX1 with various structural DNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>. The first mode is for ssDNAs longer than 4 nt and, in this case, TREX1 bound to the last 4 nucleotides at the 3′-end with the 5′-end of the strand dangling. For damaged ssDNAs with hypoxanthine bases, we showed that TREX1 digested such substrates with a similar activity as degrading DNAs with normal nitrogenous bases. The ability of TREX1 in processing dI-ssDNA also pointed to a possible role in Endo V–mediated AER. TREX1, though, lacked the activity of cutting abasic site and 8-oxoG sites as the extra oxygen could hinder the enzyme to stack bases in the substrate. The resistance of 8-oxoG to TREX1 appears as an intrinsic design for transferring the signal of oxidative DNA damage by triggering stimulator of interferon genes complex (STING)–dependent immune sensing in cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref045">45</xref>]. Two members in DEDDh exonuclease family, <italic>T</italic>. <italic>thermophiles</italic> TTHB178 and <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RNase T, are homologous to TREX1 and demonstrated similar base preference, suggesting that these proteins perform similar functions in oxidative DNA damage signaling.</p>
<p>The second mode is for the class of duplex L- and Y-structural DNA substrates with a long 3′-overhang (≥4 nt), and most of the hydrogen bonds formed between TREX1 and the substrate were in the last 3 nucleotides at the 3′-end, i.e., in the 3′-overhang region. The nonscissile strand, on the other hand, did not land on consensus positions on the protein surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g007">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005653.s010">S8 Fig</xref>). Therefore, in binding DNA duplexes with a longer 3′-overhang, TREX1 more tightly coupled to the last 3 bases of the 3′-overhang region, and the rest of the substrate exhibited different conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>For structural DNAs containing a short (&lt;4 nt) 3′-overhang, the structures resolved in this work revealed the third class of TREX1-DNA binding. The Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster in TREX1 was identified as a wedge to stack and interact with the 5′-end of the nonscissile strand, particularly at the last base in the double-stranded segment. Such specific couplings of capping the nonscissile 5′-end were not observed for TREX1 structures in binding with substrates that contained a longer 3′-overhang and provided a clear structural basis for the generation of blunt-end duplexes as the main product form after removal of the 3′-overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g007">Fig 7D</xref>).</p>
<p>Our structure analysis also showed that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster plays a critical role for TREX1 to break the terminal base pairing in dsDNAs. In the activity assays of TREX1 with duplex DNAs, minor products that lacked the last 1 or 2 nucleotides at 3′-end in the double-strand region were also observed (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g004">4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g005">5A</xref>). For the structure with a wobble base pair shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g003">Fig 3</xref>, the last base pair was indeed separated for digestion. Together, these results indicate that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster and other specific interactions enable TREX1 to break the base pairing around the nonscissile 5′-end and hence allow further nucleotide removal in the scissile strand. The terminal unwinding activity, in fact, allowed TREX1 to process the wobble-paired dsDNA generated by Endo V and to conduct dsDNA degradation as shown in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005653.g006">6C</xref>.</p>
<p>Another key residue that was identified through the TREX1 structures resolved in this work is Arg128, which makes several contacts with the nonscissile strand in a duplex. As stated earlier, for all of the dsDNA substrates that we designed to have a short (&lt;4 nt) 3′-overhang, the specific interactions of Arg128 are with the nonscissile strand. On the contrary, in the structures of TREX1 with a dsDNA containing a long 3′-overhang, Arg128 instead made contact with the single-stranded region of the scissile strand, and the mode of interactions is similar to that seen in the TREX1 structures with an ssDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref046">46</xref>]. Mutation of the satellite residue Arg128 in TREX1 has been shown to result in an approximately 8-fold reduction in the activity of digesting dsDNA, but only about 2-fold of activity reduction was observed for ssDNA degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref047">47</xref>]. This result highlighted the greater importance of Arg128 in dsDNA degradation. Our structures thus provide the necessary molecular details for understanding this result as the binding mode of TREX1 with a DNA duplex that contains a short 3′-overhang is different from that of binding an ssDNA. Since dsDNAs are primary substrates for immune silencing, our results also provide structure basis for the in vivo observation that Arg128 mutation is related to an autoimmune disease of SLE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref020">20</xref>].</p>

<title>On the roles of TREX1 in nuclear DNA repair and proofreading</title>
<p>A mystery of TREX1 in DNA repair is that the rate of spontaneous mutation in <italic>TREX1</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> mice did not increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref018">18</xref>], despite the fact that genotoxic stress did lead to translocation of TREX1 to the nucleus and elevated expression levels of the enzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>]. A hypothesis that offers a potential explanation is participation of TREX1 in DNA repair processes like Endo V–mediated AER, and in this case, other pathways such as base excision repair (BER) for repairing DNAs with a hypoxanthine base would functionally overlap with those of TREX1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref050">50</xref>]. Although this scenario is subject to further studies to firmly establish, it is in line with the substrate compatibility of TREX1 with Endo V products, as observed in our activity characterization. As such, a single-gene knockout in either of the two overlapping pathways might not result in a significant increase in the rate of spontaneous mutation. An analogue example was that double mutations of DNA glycosylase and Endo V (<italic>nfi</italic>) were shown as necessary for an increased rate of spontaneous mutation to be observed, and transforming only intact gene 1 of 2 into the doubly mutated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> was sufficient to rescue the phenotype of a higher rate of spontaneous mutation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Entanglement of multiple pathways would thus complicate the characterization of physiological impact for TREX1, and it is thus essential to consider that this enzyme is likely coupled to other partners in DNA repair–related processes. For example, TREX1 is also expected to respond to UV light–induced DNA stress since translocation of the enzyme was observed upon exposure to UV illumination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>]. The consequent repairing processes include removal of L- or Y-structural dsDNA in the replication restart pathway, gap-filling homologous recombination, and RecA-dependent homologous recombination that the TREX1 homolog <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> RNase T is also known to perform [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref033">33</xref>]. In this regard, the activity of TREX1 in trimming Y-structural dsDNA probably overlaps with that of the endonuclease Mus81-Mms4 (Slx2-Slx3), which also targets similar structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref051">51</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref052">52</xref>]. Along a similar line, the proofreading function of TREX1 in BER would overlap with that of Ape1, which bears a 3′–5′ exonuclease activity and interacts with DNA polymerase β in editing mismatched nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref055">55</xref>]. Furthermore, TREX1 may also involve in other DNA repair pathways, such as by interacting with and regulating PARP-1, a DNA repair enzyme for which the molecular details await further studies to resolve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref025">25</xref>]. The overlapping model thus provides a rationale for the unaffected rates of spontaneous mutation in TREX1 knockout mice, and for the proficiency of double-strand break (DSB) repair and BER in TREX1-deficient fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>It is important to highlight that the DNA repair functions require TREX1 to be present in the nucleus. Translocation of TREX1 to the nucleus was observed during GzmA-mediated apoptosis or under genotoxic stresses in several works via immunoprecipitation and/or immunofluorescence microscopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>]. TREX1 was also found in the nucleus and was shown to interact with a well-known DNA repair enzyme, PARP-1, via western blotting and coimmunoprecipitation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref025">25</xref>]. However, TREX1 translocation to the nucleus was not observed in the immunofluorescence microscopy data of a recent work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref005">5</xref>], suggesting the need of further studies to characterize the DNA repair function of TREX1.</p>
<p>TREX1 provides the major 3′–5′ exonuclease activity in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref002">2</xref>] as numerous in vivo studies showed that TREX1 broadly displayed important roles in immune silencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref021">21</xref>], genotoxicity responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref024">24</xref>], apoptotic DNA degradation in dying cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref026">26</xref>], and chromosomal fragmentation during telomere crisis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005653.ref027">27</xref>]. In this work, we aim to provide the structure basis for the molecular origin of TREX1 that enables such diverse activities toward a wide range of nucleic acid substrates, including ssDNA, dsDNA, DNA/RNA duplexes, and structural DNAs. The endeavor of crystallizing TREX1 with various duplex DNA substrates with a short 3′-overhang revealed the structure details for the unique catalytic powers of TREX1. We identified that the Leu24-Pro25-Ser26 cluster at the N-terminal of a short helix can cap the nonscissile 5′-end for trimming the 3′-overhang for producing a blunt-end duplex and can wedge into the duplex end to unwind the terminal base pairing in a dsDNA. These results also provide sophisticated molecular pictures for rationalizing the cellular functions of TREX1 in DNA repair, DNA proofreading, and immune silencing.</p>
