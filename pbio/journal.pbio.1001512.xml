      <abstract>
        <p>The large family of Gram-positive quorum-sensing receptors known as the RNPP proteins consists of receptors homologous to the <italic>R</italic>ap, <italic>N</italic>prR, <italic>P</italic>lcR, and <italic>P</italic>rgX proteins that are regulated by imported oligopeptide autoinducers. Rap proteins are phosphatases and transcriptional anti-activators, and NprR, PlcR, and PrgX proteins are DNA binding transcription factors. Despite their obvious importance, the mechanistic basis of oligopeptide receptor regulation is largely unknown. Here, we report the X-ray crystal structure of the <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> quorum-sensing receptor RapJ in complex with the centrally important oligopeptide autoinducer competence and sporulation factor (CSF, also termed PhrC), a member of the Phr family of quorum-sensing signals. Furthermore, we present the crystal structure of RapI. Comparison of the RapJ-PhrC, RapI, RapH-Spo0F, and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> crystal structures reveals the mechanistic basis of Phr activity. More specifically, when complexed with target proteins, Rap proteins consist of a C-terminal tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) domain connected by a flexible helix-containing linker to an N-terminal 3-helix bundle. In the absence of a target protein or regulatory peptide, the Rap protein 3-helix bundle adopts different conformations. However, in the peptide-bound conformation, the Rap protein N-terminal 3-helix bundle and linker undergo a radical conformational change, form TPR-like folds, and merge with the existing C-terminal TPR domain. To our knowledge, this is the first example of conformational change-induced repeat domain expansion. Furthermore, upon Phr binding, the entire Rap protein is compressed along the TPR superhelical axis, generating new intramolecular contacts that lock the Rap protein in an inactive state. The fact that Rap proteins are conformationally flexible is surprising considering that it is accepted dogma that TPR proteins do not undergo large conformational changes. Repeat proteins are widely used as scaffolds for the development of designed affinity reagents, and we propose that Rap proteins could be used as scaffolds for engineering novel ligand-switchable affinity reagents.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The bacterial cell–cell communication process known as quorum sensing regulates important social behaviors including antibiotic production, motility, virulence, biofilm formation, sporulation, bioluminescence, and genetic competence. Gram-positive bacteria secrete oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals that bind to membrane-bound and cytosolic receptors. How oligopeptide quorum-sensing signals regulate the activity of their target receptors was previously largely unknown. Here we show that proteins belonging to the family of bacterial quorum-sensing receptors known as the Rap phosphatases undergo a remarkable regulatory conformational change upon binding oligopeptide signals. More specifically, in the absence of the oligopeptide signal, Rap proteins consist of two distinct domains: an N-terminal domain consisting of a three-helix bundle, and a superhelical C-terminal domain comprising an array of seven similar helix-turn-helix repeats. A flexible helix-containing linker region connects these domains. In complex with the regulatory oligopeptide, however, the Rap protein domains and linker region rearrange, merging to form a single continuous superhelical structure consisting of nine helix-turn-helix repeats. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of conformational change-induced repeat domain expansion. The structure-function studies presented here set the stage for the rational development of antimicrobial peptides and peptide-mimetics capable of targeting cell–cell signaling mediated by Rap proteins and similar bacterial receptors.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Quorum sensing is a bacterial cell–cell communication process mediated by secreted signaling molecules. At low cell density, the concentration of the quorum-sensing signals is negligible and bacteria act as individuals. At high cell density, the concentration of the signals is sufficient to coordinate bacterial social behaviors including sporulation, virulence factor expression, motility, biofilm formation, bioluminescence, antibiotic production, and genetic competence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Waters1">[1]</xref>. Typically, acylated homoserine lactones are used as quorum-sensing signals by Gram-negative bacteria, whereas oligopeptides are used by Gram-positive bacteria. Despite their obvious importance, the mechanistic basis of oligopeptide receptor regulation in Gram-positive species is largely unknown.</p>
      <p>Secreted oligopeptide signals are commonly synthesized as immature pro-peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Stephenson1">[2]</xref>. The genes encoding the pro-peptides are usually encoded immediately upstream or downstream of their cognate receptor genes, forming receptor–pro-peptide gene cassettes. The immature pro-peptides are secreted from the cell and subsequently undergo proteolytic maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-LaniganGerdes1">[3]</xref>. The mature oligopeptides bind to and regulate transmembrane receptors such as histidine kinases, or alternatively, the mature oligopeptides are imported into the cell by oligopeptide permeases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Lazazzera1">[7]</xref>. Inside the cell, the oligopeptides bind to and regulate target receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Lazazzera1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego4">[11]</xref>. These cytoplasmic receptors include (1) members of the RNPP protein family, consisting of receptors homologous to the <italic>R</italic>ap, <italic>N</italic>prR, <italic>P</italic>lcR, or <italic>P</italic>rgX proteins, which are widespread in Firmicutes (e.g., <italic>Bacillus</italic> and <italic>Enterococcus</italic> species) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Pottathil1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-RochaEstrada1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Shi1">[14]</xref>, and (2) the Rgg proteins, which are ubiquitous in <italic>Streptococcus</italic> and many other low G+C Gram-positive species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Chang1">[15]</xref>. NprR, PlcR, PrgX, and Rgg proteins are DNA binding transcription factors. In contrast, as described below, Rap proteins have diverse catalytic and noncatalytic activities, and Rap proteins are not DNA binding transcription factors.</p>

          <p>Secreted oligopeptide signals are synthesized as immature pro-peptides, which are then processed and secreted. The mature oligopeptides bind to and regulate histidine kinases belonging to two-component or phosphorelay signal transduction systems, or the oligopeptides otherwise bind to oligopeptide permeases, which import the oligopeptides into the cell. Here the oligopeptides bind to and regulate (activate or, in some cases, inhibit) the activity of DNA binding transcription factors, such as <italic>Streptococcus</italic> Rgg, <italic>Bacillus</italic> PlcR and NprR, or <italic>Enterococcus</italic> PrgX. Alternatively, the oligopeptides bind to and regulate the Bacillus Rap proteins. The Rap proteins function as phosphatases targeting intermediate response regulators such as Spo0F belonging to the sporulation phosphorelay pathway that activates (phosphorylates) the master response regulator Spo0A, or the Rap proteins function as transcriptional anti-activators targeting response regulator transcription factors such as ComA and DegU. H, histidine; D, aspartate; P, phosphoryl group; P<sub>i</sub>, inorganic phosphate; REC, receiver domain; DBD, DNA Binding Domain.</p>

      <p>Rap proteins and their inhibitory oligopeptides, called Phr peptides, have been most extensively studied in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>, which encodes 11 Rap proteins on its chromosome and another five on plasmids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Gleave1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Meijer1">[18]</xref>. The founding members of the Rap family, RapA and RapB, were shown to be response regulator aspartate phosphatases (Rap) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego5">[19]</xref>. Subsequently, RapE, RapH, and RapJ were demonstrated to be response regulator aspartate phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Smits1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Parashar1">[22]</xref>, and RapC, RapF, RapG, and RapH were revealed to be transcriptional anti-activator proteins that inhibit the binding of the response regulators ComA or DegU to DNA promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Smits1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Bongiorni1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Ogura1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Genes encoding pro-Phr polypeptides overlap with the 3′ end of <italic>rap</italic> genes, forming <italic>rap-phr</italic> gene cassettes. Mature Phr peptides are imported into the cell where each oligopeptide inhibits its cognate Rap protein (e.g., PhrA inhibits RapA, and PhrC inhibits RapC) and in some cases a non-cognate Rap protein (e.g., PhrC inhibits RapB, which is not encoded in a cassette with a cognate <italic>phr</italic> gene) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego3">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego6">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Solomon3">[27]</xref>. Like <italic>rapB</italic>, <italic>rapJ</italic> is not encoded in an operon with a <italic>phr</italic> gene, and here we show that the centrally important Phr peptide PhrC, which is also commonly referred to as competence and sporulation factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Solomon2">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Solomon3">[27]</xref>, binds to RapJ and inhibits its phosphatase activity.</p>
      <p>While it is well-established that Phr peptides bind to Rap proteins and inhibit their activity, how Phr peptides regulate Rap proteins remained unknown. Here we report two X-ray crystal structures containing Rap proteins: the structures of a Rap-Phr complex, RapJ-PhrC, and a Rap protein, RapI, alone. These structures and supporting in vivo and in vitro studies, together with the previously determined structure of (1) RapH complexed with the intermediate response regulator Spo0F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Parashar1">[22]</xref> and (2) the structure of RapF complexed with the DNA binding domain of the transcription factor ComA (ComA<sub>C</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Baker1">[28]</xref>, reveal the mechanistic basis of Rap protein regulation by Phr peptides.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, our structure-function analysis shows that Rap proteins exist in radically different conformations in the target-bound, Phr peptide-bound, and ligand-free conformations. The fact that Rap proteins undergo dramatic conformational changes is particularly surprising because Rap proteins are tetratricopeptide repeat (TPR) proteins, which were believed to be rigid frameworks that do not undergo large conformational changes. Repeat proteins are widely used as scaffolds for the development of designed affinity reagents, and our results suggest that Rap proteins could be used as scaffolds for engineering or evolving novel ligand-switchable TPR-based affinity reagents. In addition, we note that the studies presented here set the stage for the rational development of antimicrobial peptides and peptide-mimetics targeting Rap-mediated cell–cell signaling.</p>

        <title>X-Ray Crystal Structure of the RapJ-PhrC Complex</title>
        <p>Our primary goal was to determine the mechanistic basis of Rap protein regulation by Phr peptides using a combination of X-ray crystallographic, biochemical, and genetic approaches. Despite extensive efforts, we had only limited success crystallizing previously identified Rap-Phr pairs, and we therefore sought to identify new Rap-Phr pairs to target for crystallization. We previously showed in vitro that RapJ dephosphorylates Spo0F <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Parashar1">[22]</xref>, an intermediate response regulator in the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> sporulation phosphorelay pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Burbulys1">[29]</xref>; however, because <italic>rapJ</italic> is not encoded in an operon with a <italic>phr</italic> gene, whether a RapJ regulatory peptide existed was unknown. To determine whether previously identified Phr peptides inhibit RapJ Spo0F phosphatase activity, we measured the ability of synthetic Phr peptides to inhibit RapJ dephosphorylation of Spo0F in vivo as a function of Spo0A activation using a luciferase gene under the control of the Spo0A-driven promoter P<italic>spoIIG</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). As expected, overexpressing RapJ completely repressed P<italic>spoIIG</italic> activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001512.s001">S1A</xref>), and deleting <italic>rapJ</italic> resulted in elevated P<italic>spoIIG</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001512.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Surprisingly, however, PhrC restored P<italic>spoIIG</italic> expression to levels approaching that of the negative control—that is, when RapJ overexpression was not induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g002">Figures 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001512.s001">S1A</xref>). In contrast, other Phr peptides tested—e.g., PhrA (ARNQT) and PhrH (TDRNTT)—had little or essentially no effect on P<italic>spoIIG</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and unpublished data).</p>

            <p>(A) RapJ activity was measured as a function of P<italic>spoIIG</italic>::<italic>luc</italic> expression in strain VP068. Each curve is representative of at least three independent experiments performed in duplicate.

        <p>To determine whether RapJ and PhrC interact directly, we incubated purified RapJ with synthetic PhrC and subjected the sample to size exclusion chromatography (SEC). Using MALDI-TOF and MALDI-TOF/TOF tandem mass spectrometry, we detected PhrC complexed with RapJ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001512.s002">Figure S2</xref>); control experiments confirmed that SEC separates the RapJ-PhrC complex from unbound PhrC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001512.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>To confirm that PhrC directly inhibits RapJ dephosphorylation of Spo0F, we phosphorylated Spo0F as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Parashar1">[22]</xref> and measured the ability of synthetic PhrC to inhibit RapJ phosphatase activity in vitro.

Other Phr peptides had no effect on RapJ Spo0F phosphatase activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and unpublished data). Based on the above in vivo and in vitro analyses, we conclude that PhrC directly inhibits RapJ Spo0F phosphatase activity; however, we note PhrC has at least three targets (RapB, RapC, and RapJ) and the physiological importance of RapJ inhibition by PhrC is unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego3">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Solomon3">[27]</xref>.</p>

These Rap domains are an N-terminal 3-helix bundle and a C-terminal TPR domain; a flexible helix-containing linker region connects the domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Relative to its position in the RapH-Spo0F and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structures, the entire N-terminal 3-helix bundle and linker region have dramatically flipped and repacked against the N-terminal surface of the C-terminal TPR domain in the RapJ-PhrC structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In fact, the RapJ 3-helix bundle (residues 1–70) and helix-containing linker region (residues 71–94) merge with the C-terminal TPR domain (residues 95–373) to form one extended TPR domain (residues 1–373) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g003">Figures 3A,B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">5</xref>).

        <p>Similarly, comparing the structure of RapI with the structures of RapH-Spo0F and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> revealed that the RapI 3-helix bundle and linker region have joined the TPR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>); however, it is important to note that RapI and RapJ are not in identical conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). The Rap protein HTH folds assemble into a right-handed superhelical structure (the TPR domain). TPR domains typically have a convex outer surface and a concave inner surface, commonly referred to as the ligand-binding groove. The RapI structure reflects this scenario, and the ligand-binding groove is in an open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g003">Figure 3B and 3D</xref>). In contrast, in the RapJ-PhrC structure, the ligand-binding groove is closed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g003">Figure 3A and 3C</xref>). PhrC binding stabilizes a closed RapJ conformation that differs from the open RapI conformation due to a compression of RapJ along the TPR superhelical axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">5</xref>).</p>

This concept has been widely accepted simply because there were no data suggesting that repeat proteins are particularly flexible or undergo large conformational changes. Upending this widely held belief, comparison of the structures of RapI alone, RapJ-PhrC, RapH-Spo0F, and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> reveals that Rap proteins can undergo enormous conformational changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001512.s007">Movie S1</xref>). In fact, as discussed below, our data show that Rap proteins can exist in single-domain or dual-domain forms.</p>
      <p>When complexed with a target such as Spo0F or ComA, Rap proteins have a distinct N-terminal 3-helix bundle, helix-containing linker region, and C-terminal TPR domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the case of RapF, the 3-helix bundle and linker region form the ComA<sub>C</sub> binding surface. In the case of RapH, the C-terminal TPR domain and 3-helix bundle make critical contacts with Spo0F; in fact, the 3-helix bundle contains the catalytic glutamine that inserts into the Spo0F active site. Comparison of the RapJ-PhrC, RapH-Spo0F, and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structures reveals the mechanism of Phr regulation. The Phr-induced conformational change (detailed below) not only simultaneously results in a total rearrangement of both the ComA<sub>C</sub> and Spo0F binding sites, but also (1) buries (renders inaccessible) RapJ residues corresponding to RapF residues that bind ComA<sub>C</sub>, including Phe24 and Leu67, which were previously shown to mediate critical interactions with ComA<sub>C</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Baker1">[28]</xref>, and (2) splits and displaces the Spo0F binding surface on the 3-helix bundle (including the catalytic glutamine) and TPR domain to opposite sides of the Rap protein where they cannot interact concurrently with Spo0F.</p>
      <p>In both the RapH-Spo0F and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub> structures, the Rap linker region helix lies at a ∼45° angle to the 3-helix bundle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In comparison to the Spo0F and ComA<sub>C</sub> bound structures, in both the RapI and RapJ-PhrC structures, the N-terminal 3-helix bundle has rotated ∼180° and the linker region helix has rotated ∼135° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Together, the rotation of the 3-helix bundle and linker region helix creates two HTH folds (HTH1 and HTH2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>) that pack against the existing C-terminal TPR domain, resulting in the extension of the TPR domain fold by two HTH repeats. To our knowledge, this represents the first example of conformational change-induced repeat domain expansion.</p>
      <p>Structural alignment of the RapI and RapJ-PhrC structures shows that RapJ in the PhrC bound conformation is compressed along the TPR superhelical axis, causing the disappearance of the concave groove that exists in the structures of RapI alone, RapH-Spo0F, and RapF-ComA<sub>C</sub>. New intramolecular RapJ contacts that form as a result of the PhrC-induced compression stabilize the RapJ closed conformation and are necessary for PhrC inhibition of RapJ Spo0F phosphatase activity. The fact that the R105A mutation resulted in a severe loss of RapJ and RapH sensitivity to PhrC and PhrH, respectively, suggests that this residue is a hotspot contributing significantly to the binding energy of the intramolecular interface formed in the closed, Phr peptide-bound conformation.</p>
      <p>We speculate that the N-terminal 3-helix bundle moves into the intermediate open conformation when Phr peptides dissociate from Rap proteins in the closed conformation or when Spo0F or ComA dissociate from Rap proteins in the fully open conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g005">Figure 5</xref>). While additional studies are required to determine whether the conformation of the 3-helix bundle and linker region in the RapI alone crystal structure represents a stable Rap protein conformation adopted in the absence of Phr peptide or target protein, existing data suggest that this is not likely to be the case. More likely is the possibility that the structure of RapI alone depicts one of many transient conformations that the 3-helix bundle and linker region can adopt in the absence of a Phr peptide or target protein. In fact, as mentioned above, there are two copies of RapI in the crystallographic asymmetric unit, and while the model of one molecule is relatively complete and includes the majority of the 3-helix bundle and linker region, there was in fact insufficient electron density to build the N-terminal 3-helix bundle and linker region in the other molecule (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In the more complete RapI model, where the N-terminal 3-helix bundle and linker region are included, the N-terminal 3-helix bundle, linker region, and C-terminal TPR domain together bury 857 Å<sup>2</sup> surface area at their interface. However, consistent with the idea that the structure of RapI depicts one of many transient conformations, we note that the position of the N-terminal 3-helix bundle and linker region in the more complete RapI model is likely influenced by crystal contacts with symmetry-related copies of RapI. The above results suggest that in the absence of a bound target such as Spo0F or ComA, or a bound Phr peptide such as PhrC, the N-terminal 3-helix bundle and linker region may adopt different conformations relative to the C-terminal TPR domain.</p>
      <p>What is the structural basis of Rap-Phr binding and selectivity? The residue at position −4 from the C-terminus of the Phr penta and hexapeptides is basic (Arg or Lys) in all of the identified <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Phr peptides; it is Arg in eight of nine <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Phr peptides, and it is Lys in only one instance, PhrG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Pottathil1">[9]</xref>. The RapJ-PhrC structure revealed that RapJ residue Asp192 forms a salt-bridge with PhrC residue Arg2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). With the exception of RapG, every <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Rap protein contains Asp at the position structurally equivalent to RapJ Asp192; in RapG, this residue is Glu (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001512.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We propose that the salt bridge between RapJ-D129 and PhrC-R2 is conserved in every <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Rap-Phr complex. This hypothesis is supported by previous analysis of Rap proteins containing mutations in the position equivalent to RapJ Asp192 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego3">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Perego5">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Core1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Diaz1">[36]</xref>, as well as by studies analyzing the effects of substitution mutations in Phr peptides at the position equivalent to PhrC Arg2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Lazazzera1">[7]</xref>. We propose that Phr peptides recognize their cognate Rap protein by first scanning the surface for a pocket of complementary shape. Second, the Rap-Phr salt bridge equivalent to the interaction of RapJ Asp192 and PhrC Arg2 is a hotspot contact that anchors the peptide-receptor complex.</p>
      <p>With the exception of the basic residue conserved at the position −4 from the C-terminus, the remaining <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Phr residues are poorly conserved and each could contribute to the determination of Rap-Phr interaction specificity. While there are not yet enough known Rap-Phr pairs to use multiple sequence alignment to identify covarying residues at the Rap-Phr interface, we have identified a number of <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Rap-Phr interactions that likely contribute to the determination of interaction specificity. For example, the PhrC residue Glu1 sidechain hydrogen bonds with the Rap Tyr297 and Lys300 sidechains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Sequence analysis of the <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Rap-Phr pairs shows that when the Phr residue equivalent to PhrC residue Glu1 is Glu or Asp, then the position equivalent to RapJ Tyr297 is Tyr and the position equivalent to RapJ Lys300 is Lys. However, when the Phr residue equivalent to PhrC residue Glu1 is Ala or Ser, then the Rap position equivalent to RapJ Tyr297 is Phe and the position equivalent to RapJ Lys300 is Leu. Similarly, the PhrC Gly3 mainchain nitrogen hydrogen bonds with the RapJ Tyr150 sidechain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and this appears to be the case for every <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Rap-Phr pair with the following exception. In the RapK-PhrK pair the Phr residue equivalent to PhrC residue Gly3 is Pro, and RapK encodes Thr at the position equivalent to RapJ Tyr150. Likewise, the PhrC Met4 mainchain nitrogen and carbonyl form hydrogen bonds with the RapJ Asn225 sidechain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g006">Figure 6</xref>), and this Asn is conserved in every <italic>B. subtilis</italic> Rap protein. Thus, this Rap-Phr interaction contributes to the binding energy but not to the determination of binding specificity in <italic>B. subtilis</italic>. Finally, we note that when the Phr residue equivalent to PhrC residue Met4 is Met, then the positions in RapB, RapC, and RapF equivalent to RapJ Tyr224 and Phe250 are Tyr and Phe, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001512-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Ongoing computational modeling and peptide docking studies guided by the RapJ-PhrC structure as well as complementary genetic and biochemical analysis of the calculated Rap-Phr interactions will test the importance of the above observations and reveal more broadly the Rap and Phr contacts that dictate Rap-Phr interaction specificity at the atomic level.</p>
      <p>Finally, analogous to antibodies and their hypervariable complementarity determining regions, repeat proteins such as the TPR proteins can be imagined as a structurally conserved backbone decorated with functional residues. This is exemplified by the variable lymphocyte receptors (VLRs) in jawless fish. Instead of the immunoglobulin-based antigen receptors created by V(D)J recombination in jawed vertebrates, the VLRs result from the combinatorial assembly of leucine-rich repeats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Pancer1">[39]</xref>. Studies of VLRs and numerous other repeat proteins such as TPR and ankyrin repeat proteins have provided tremendous insight into repeat protein function while also advancing our ability to evolve or engineer repeat proteins displaying new functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Binz1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Cortajarena1">[48]</xref>. In fact, repeat proteins are now widely used as scaffolds for the development of designed affinity reagents—for example, Designed Ankyrin Repeat Proteins (DARPins) and TPR-based recognition modules (T-Mods)—which can substitute for antibodies in chromatographic, diagnostic, co-crystallization, and therapeutic applications. In comparison to antibodies, repeat proteins can offer a number of advantages including elevated solubility, high production yields in microbial expression systems, protease resistance, and thermal stability. Antibodies are particularly difficult to manufacture since they are glycosylated and contain disulphide bonds. The stability of even truncated forms of antibodies, such as scFv and Fab fragments, relies on the formation of intradomain disulphide bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Worn1">[49]</xref>, also limiting their application. Due to the development of powerful selection techniques (e.g., ribosome display), the effort required to generate alternative binding reagents with prescribed target-binding specificity is quickly approaching that required to create conventional antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Binz1">[40]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Both the oligopeptide binding site on the Rap protein TPR concave surface and the multiple target protein binding sites on the Rap protein TPR convex surface could be engineered to bind different oligopeptides and proteins, respectively. Furthermore, the RapJ-PhrC X-ray crystal structure shows a channel leading into the oligopeptide binding site, suggesting that the RapJ peptide interaction surface could be engineered to bind the flexible C-terminus of a target protein. As discussed above, prior to our studies, repeat proteins were not known to undergo large ligand-induced conformational changes. Consequently, the use of peptides or other ligands to regulate the target binding of designed affinity reagents has not been previously explored. We propose that Rap proteins could serve as scaffolds for engineering or evolving ligand-switchable TPR-based affinity reagents.</p>

        <p>The RapJ-PhrC crystal structure was determined by the SAD method using crystals of selenomethionyl RapJ bound to PhrC that were isomorphous to the native RapJ-PhrC crystals. PHENIX (AutoSol) was used to locate heavy atom positions, calculate phases, and generate an initial model at 2.21 Å resolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Adams1">[53]</xref>. This model was then refined against 2.16 Å native data in PHENIX. The final model was generated through iterative cycles of building in COOT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Emsley1">[54]</xref> and refinement in PHENIX. The RapJ and PhrC models were built de novo into the SAD-phased map. The earliest rounds of refinement in PHENIX employed simulated annealing as well as individual atomic coordinate and individual B-factor refinement. The later rounds of refinement in PHENIX employed individual atomic coordinate and individual B-factor refinement, as well as a TLS model whose initial parameters were guided by the TLS Motion Determination (TLSMD) server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001512-Painter1">[55]</xref>. During the final rounds of refinement in PHENIX, the stereochemistry and ADP weights were optimized—that is, the weights yielding the lowest R<sub>free</sub> value were used for refinement. PhrC molecules were added only after the RapJ models were built, and then water molecules were added. Insufficient electron density was observed for the following residues and they were omitted from the model: RapJ<sub>A</sub> 1–5, 72–77, and 90–92; RapJ<sub>B</sub> 1–6 and 72–77. Two chlorine atoms were built into clear electron density during the final stages of refinement. The RapI crystal structure was determined by molecular replacement. A conserved region of RapJ consisting of residues 217–365 was used as an initial search model for molecular replacement. Phenix.mr_rosetta and RapI sequence alignment was then used to rebuild the starting model, resulting in 1,000 new models. The Phaser LLG score was used to identify the best model.

Growth on LB agar containing 0.5 µg/ml erythromycin and 2.5 µg/ml lincomycin at the restrictive temperature (37°C) that inhibits plasmid replication selected single-crossover events integrating pMiniRapJ into the chromosome. To evict the plasmid, the strain was incubated in 3 ml LB broth at a permissive temperature for plasmid replication (22°C) for 14 h, diluted 30-fold in fresh LB broth, and incubated at 22°C for another 8 h. Dilution and outgrowth were repeated two more times. Cells were then serially diluted and plated on LB agar at 37°C. Fifty individual colonies were patched in duplicate on LB agar alone and LB agar containing 0.5 µg/ml erythromycin and 2.5 µg/ml lincomycin to identify colonies that had evicted the plasmid.
