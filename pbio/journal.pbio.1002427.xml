<abstract>
<p>X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most frequent form of inherited rickets in humans caused by mutations in the phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome (<italic>PHEX</italic>). <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, a murine homologue of XLH, are characterized by hypophosphatemia, inappropriately low serum vitamin D levels, increased serum fibroblast growth factor-23 (Fgf23), and osteomalacia. Although Fgf23 is known to be responsible for hypophosphatemia and reduced vitamin D hormone levels in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, its putative role as an auto-/paracrine osteomalacia-causing factor has not been explored. We recently reported that Fgf23 is a suppressor of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (<italic>Tnap)</italic> transcription via FGF receptor-3 (FGFR3) signaling, leading to inhibition of mineralization through accumulation of the TNAP substrate pyrophosphate. Here, we report that the pyrophosphate concentration is increased in <italic>Hyp</italic> bones, and that <italic>Tnap</italic> expression is decreased in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells but not in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteoblasts ex vivo and in vitro. In situ mRNA expression profiling in bone cryosections revealed a ~70-fold up-regulation of <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA in osteocytes versus osteoblasts of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice. In addition, we show that blocking of increased Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling with anti-Fgf23 antibodies or an FGFR3 inhibitor partially restored the suppression of <italic>Tnap</italic> expression, phosphate production, and mineralization, and decreased pyrophosphate concentration in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells in vitro. In vivo, bone-specific deletion of <italic>Fgf23</italic> in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice rescued the suppressed TNAP activity in osteocytes of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice. Moreover, treatment of wild-type osteoblasts or mice with recombinant FGF23 suppressed <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression and increased pyrophosphate concentrations in the culture medium and in bone, respectively. In conclusion, we found that the cell autonomous increase in Fgf23 secretion in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes drives the accumulation of pyrophosphate through auto-/paracrine suppression of TNAP. Hence, we have identified a novel mechanism contributing to the mineralization defect in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most frequent form of inherited rickets in humans. A mouse model of XLH, known as <italic>Hyp</italic>, is characterized by exceptionally low serum phosphate and vitamin D levels, increased serum levels of the hormone fibroblast growth factor-23 (Fgf23), and impaired bone mineralization. Fgf23 is secreted from two classes of bone cells known as osteoblasts and osteocytes. Fgf23 increases urinary phosphate excretion and suppresses vitamin D hormone production in the kidney. Although Fgf23 is known to be responsible for lower blood phosphate and vitamin D hormone levels in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, its putative role as a signaling factor causing impaired mineralization has not been explored. We recently reported that Fgf23 is a suppressor of tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (<italic>Tnap)</italic> gene expression via FGF receptor-3 (FGFR3) signaling in osteoblasts, leading to inhibition of mineralization through accumulation of the TNAP substrate pyrophosphate. Pyrophosphate is a potent inhibitor of mineralization. Using a combination of cell culture and animal models, we report that the increase in osteocyte Fgf23 secretion of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice leads to FGFR3-mediated suppression of TNAP with subsequent accumulation of pyrophosphate. Hence, we have identified a novel signaling mechanism by which excessive osteocytic secretion of Fgf23 contributes to the mineralization defect in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>X-linked hypophosphatemia (XLH) is the most frequent form of inherited rickets in humans. XLH is caused by inactivating mutations in the phosphate-regulating gene with homologies to endopeptidases on the X-chromosome (<italic>PHEX</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref003">3</xref>]. Similarly, a loss-of-function deletion in <italic>Phex</italic>, the murine homologue of <italic>PHEX</italic>, leads to an XLH-like phenotype in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, a well-known animal model for XLH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref006">6</xref>]. <italic>PHEX</italic>/<italic>Phex</italic> is predominantly expressed in bone and teeth and at lower levels in muscle, skin, brain, and lungs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref008">8</xref>]. Both XLH patients and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice are characterized by hypophosphatemia, impaired bone mineralization, inappropriately low serum vitamin D hormone (1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub>), and increased circulating intact fibroblast growth factor-23 (FGF23) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref011">11</xref>]. FGF23 is a phosphaturic hormone, mainly produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes in response to increased extracellular phosphate and circulating 1,25(OH)<sub>2</sub>D<sub>3</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref012">12</xref>]. In renal proximal tubules, FGF23 suppresses the membrane expression of the type II sodium-phosphate cotransporters Npt2a and Npt2c, which are necessary for the urinary reabsorption of phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, FGF23 suppresses the renal proximal tubular expression of 1α-hydroxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref014">14</xref>], the key enzyme responsible for vitamin D hormone production. Fgf23 requires the obligatory coreceptor <italic>α-Klotho</italic> (Klotho) to bind to the ubiquitously expressed fibroblast growth factor receptor 1c (FGFR1c) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref016">16</xref>]. Hence, the hormonal actions of Fgf23 are restricted, at least at physiological concentrations, to tissues expressing Klotho such as proximal and distal tubules in the kidney, parathyroid gland, choroid plexus in the brain, and sinoatrial node in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>The molecular mechanisms why loss of <italic>PHEX</italic>/<italic>Phex</italic> function leads to increased FGF23 secretion in osteoblasts and osteocytes are still incompletely understood. PHEX is an ectoenzyme thought to be involved in the proteolytic processing of extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins. Earlier studies in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice revealed aberrant processing of SIBLING (Small Integrin-Binding Ligand, N-linked Glycoprotein) proteins such as matrix extracellular phosphoglycoprotein (MEPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref018">18</xref>], causing accumulation of acidic serine- and aspartate-rich MEPE-associated motif (ASARM) peptides. ASARM peptides are potent inhibitors of mineralization, and are thought to be at least partially responsible for the mineralization defect observed in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref019">19</xref>]. Another substrate of PHEX is the ECM protein osteopontin (OPN), a well-known mineralization inhibitor that binds to hydroxyapatite (HA) crystals and blocks the deposition of HA onto ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref020">20</xref>]. In addition to ASARM peptides, OPN was shown to be increased in bones of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref021">21</xref>]. Because the mineralization defect present in Dentin matrix protein-1 (<italic>Dmp-1</italic>)-deficient mice also leads to overexpression of Fgf23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref022">22</xref>], it is currently thought that osteocytes respond to impaired mineralization by increased Fgf23 secretion. It is interesting to note in this context that ablation of Fgfr1 in bone partially rescues the excessive Fgf23 secretion in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, suggesting that Fgfr1-mediated signaling may somehow be involved in the mechanism how osteocytes sense mineralization in the surrounding matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref023">23</xref>]. In addition, long-term inhibition of FGFR by a pan-FGFR inhibitor in <italic>Hyp</italic> and <italic>Dmp-1-</italic>deficient mice leads to normalization of serum phosphate and calcium and improves mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref024">24</xref>]. Besides disturbed mineralization, defective phosphate sensing in osteoblasts has also been implicated to play a role in the augmented Fgf23 secretion in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the exact mechanism driving Fgf23 secretion in <italic>Phex</italic> and <italic>Dmp-1</italic>-deficient models has remained elusive thus far, several lines of evidence suggest that increased circulating Fgf23 is a major pathogenetic factor in XLH patients and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, leading to hypophosphatemia and subsequently impaired bone mineralization. Firstly, extraskeletal overexpression of FGF23 also causes hypophosphatemia and osteomalacia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref027">27</xref>]. Secondly, ablation of <italic>Fgf23</italic> in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice recapitulates the <italic>Fgf23</italic>-null phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref029">29</xref>]. Thirdly, treatment of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice with anti-Fgf23 antibodies normalizes serum phosphate and vitamin D hormone levels, decreases osteoid volume, and improves bone mineralization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref024">24</xref>]. All these findings suggest that excessive Fgf23 secretion is the major driving force behind the <italic>Hyp</italic> phenotype.</p>
<p>However, because osteoblasts isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice fail to mineralize in a normal fashion in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref030">30</xref>], and dietary phosphate supplementation attempting to correct hypophosphatemia did not rescue the osteomalacia in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref031">31</xref>], it is likely that the mineralization defect in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice has at least two components, namely systemic hypophosphatemia plus independent alterations in the ECM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref032">32</xref>]. The relative contribution of local accumulation of ASARM peptides and of OPN in the ECM versus the endocrine phosphaturic effect of Fgf23 to the osteomalacia observed in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice is currently unclear.</p>
<p>We recently discovered that FGF23 suppresses tissue nonspecific alkaline phosphatase (TNAP) transcription and leads to decreased local inorganic phosphate (Pi) production as well as accumulation of pyrophosphate (PPi) by a Klotho-independent, FGFR3-mediated signaling axis in osteoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref033">33</xref>]. PPi is another well-known inhibitor of mineralization produced by osteoblasts and osteocytes. Increased levels of PPi in the ECM are known to impair the mineralization process by binding to HA crystals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref036">36</xref>]. Conversely, absence of PPi in the ECM either via genetic ablation of its intracellular-to-extracellular transporter progressive ankylosis (ANK) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref037">37</xref>] or ablation of ectonucleotide pyrophosphatase/phosphodiesterase 1 (ENPP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref038">38</xref>], an enzyme which produces PPi from ATP, results in hypermineralization of bones. Increased levels of PPi in the ECM can be a consequence of two different mechanisms, either increased production and transportation of PPi to the ECM, or decreased hydrolysis of PPi by TNAP, leading to accumulation of PPi in the ECM.</p>
<p>Based on our recent finding that Fgf23 is a regulator of <italic>Tnap</italic> transcription, we hypothesized that excessive Fgf23 secretion in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes could locally contribute to defective mineralization by suppressing TNAP and increasing PPi concentrations. Here, we report that the PPi concentration is indeed increased in <italic>Hyp</italic> bones, and that <italic>Tnap</italic> expression is decreased in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells ex vivo and in vitro. In addition, we show that blocking of increased Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells partially restores the suppression of TNAP expression, phosphate production, and mineralization in vitro. Thus, we have identified a novel mechanism contributing to the defective mineralization in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice.</p>

<title>PPi Concentration Is Increased in Bones of <italic>Hyp</italic> Mice</title>
<p>It is well known that <italic>Hyp</italic> mice are characterized by hypophosphatemia, hypocalcemia, impaired bone mineralization, and increased serum Fgf23 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref009">9</xref>]. This was confirmed in our study. Three-month-old male <italic>Hyp</italic> mice used in our experiments were hypophosphatemic and hypocalcemic, exhibited elevated serum alkaline phosphatase (ALP) activity and increased serum intact Fgf23 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) and showed impaired bone mineralization as evidenced by widened osteoid seams and enlarged osteocyte lacunae in histological bone sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Since it was previously reported that OPN protein expression is increased in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref021">21</xref>], we quantified OPN protein expression in femur extracts from wild-type (WT) and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice by western blotting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, OPN protein expression was higher in <italic>Hyp</italic> femur extracts compared to WT mice.

<title>Osteocyte-Rich Cell Fractions Isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> Femurs Show Increased mRNA Expression of PPi Regulating Genes and Decreased <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA Expression Ex Vivo</title>
<p>Our hypothesis predicts that increased Fgf23 secretion in bone cells from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice would suppress TNAP and would subsequently lead to accumulation of PPi. However, in contrast to our hypothesis, serum ALP in <italic>Hyp</italic> was actually higher compared to WT mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). However, we reasoned that the inhibitory effect of Fgf23 on TNAP might be cell-specific in bone and might only occur in osteocytes where the Fgf23 concentrations in the extracellular fluid are probably highest. To investigate a potential cell-specific effect of Fgf23 on osteoblasts and osteocytes, we isolated osteoblast- and osteocyte-rich fractions from femurs of WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, using a sequential digestion technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref039">39</xref>]. To confirm the successful isolation of osteoblasts and osteocytes, we analyzed the mRNA abundance of the osteoblast-specific marker osteocalcin (<italic>Ocn</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref040">40</xref>], and of the osteocyte-specific marker sclerostin (<italic>Sost</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref041">41</xref>]. Fractions (F) 1 and 2 were discarded because of the high contamination with other cell types. In both WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, F-3 showed higher levels of <italic>Ocn</italic> mRNA expression compared to the other fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), suggesting that this was an osteoblast-rich fraction. Conversely, <italic>Sost</italic> mRNA expression was low in F-3, F-4, and F-5, and increased 5- to 40-fold in F-6/7 and F-8/9, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Based upon these results we considered fractions 3–5 as osteoblast-rich, and F-6/7 and F-8/9 as osteocyte-rich in both WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> femurs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<p>Analysis of gene expression in osteoblast-rich fractions revealed lower mRNA expression of <italic>Ank</italic> and <italic>Enpp1</italic> and ~50-fold higher <italic>Tnap</italic> expression in <italic>Hyp</italic>- versus WT-derived F-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). The most pronounced differences between WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice were observed in F-3. Interestingly, <italic>Fgf23</italic> and <italic>Opn</italic> mRNA expression remained unchanged between the genotypes in all three fractions, confirming an earlier report that osteoblastic Fgf23 production is not different between WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref039">39</xref>]. The mRNA expression of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr3</italic> was lower in <italic>Hyp</italic>- versus WT-derived F-3 and/or F-5. In contrast, the mRNA abundance of <italic>Ank</italic>, <italic>Enpp1</italic>, <italic>Opn</italic>, <italic>Fgf23</italic>, <italic>Fgfr1</italic>, and <italic>Fgfr3</italic> was distinctly increased in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-rich fractions F-6/7 and/or F-8/9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Most interestingly, <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA abundance was decreased by 80%–90% in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-rich fractions F-6/7 and F-8/9, relative to WT-derived osteocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In accordance with the mRNA data, western blotting analysis of the pooled protein samples showed unchanged TNAP protein abundance in osteoblast-rich fractions F-3/4/5 but lower TNAP protein abundance in osteocyte-rich fractions F-6/7/8/9 isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g002">Fig 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these results corroborate the notion that osteocytes are the major source of the increased circulating Fgf23 levels in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice. Furthermore, our data show that there is not only increased OPN expression, but also increased mRNA expression of PPi-regulating factors such as <italic>Ank</italic> and <italic>Enpp1</italic> in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocytes. Collectively, the observed changes in gene expression of <italic>Ank</italic>, <italic>Enpp1</italic>, and <italic>Tnap</italic> in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-rich cell fractions are able to explain the accumulation of PPi in the ECM of <italic>Hyp</italic> bones.</p>

<p>To further examine whether osteoblasts and osteocytes isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice differentially express PPi-regulating genes and <italic>Tnap</italic> in a cell autonomous fashion, we moved from the above mentioned ex vivo approach to an in vitro model.

<p>mRNA expression analysis at day 12 revealed no significant differences in <italic>Ank</italic>, <italic>Enpp1</italic>, and <italic>Opn</italic> expression between WT osteoblasts and <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mRNA abundance was up-regulated, whereas <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA expression was lower in <italic>Hyp</italic> versus WT osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). <italic>Fgf23</italic> mRNA abundance was higher in <italic>Hyp</italic> compared to WT osteoblasts already at day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We further analyzed if this increase in <italic>Fgf23</italic> mRNA expression led to increased Fgf23 secretion in the cell culture medium. We found ~60-fold higher concentrations of intact Fgf23 in the culture medium of <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Despite increased <italic>Fgf23</italic> mRNA expression and secretion, <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression was increased in <italic>Hyp</italic> compared with WT osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Assessment of TNAP protein expression using western blotting analysis and of TNAP enzyme activity using BCIP/NBT staining showed similar levels of protein expression and activity in WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts at day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). It is well known that TNAP is responsible for Pi production in vitro during differentiation by cleaving β–glycerophosphate, a component of the differentiation medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref042">42</xref>]. Therefore, we assessed Pi concentration in the culture medium as readout for TNAP enzyme activity. Pi concentration in the medium of <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts was lower than that of WT osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). We currently don’t have a good explanation for the discrepancy between <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression and enzyme activity at the 12-day time point in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteoblasts. As another readout for TNAP enzyme activity, we analyzed PPi concentration in the cell culture medium. However, no significant changes in PPi concentration were observed between cell culture medium from WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts at day 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>In analogy to the osteocyte-rich fractions isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> femurs, mRNA abundance of <italic>Ank</italic>, <italic>Enpp1</italic>, <italic>Opn</italic>, <italic>Fgf23</italic>, and <italic>Fgfr3</italic> was increased, whereas mRNA expression of <italic>Tnap</italic> was decreased, in <italic>Hyp</italic> compared to WT osteocyte-like cells differentiated for 22 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

In accordance with decreased Tnap expression, Pi concentration was lower and PPi concentration was higher in the cell culture medium from <italic>Hyp</italic> versus WT osteocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Similar to our findings in osteoblast-like cells, intact Fgf23 in the culture medium was increased in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Taken together, our data suggest that the up-regulation in <italic>Ank</italic>, <italic>Enpp1</italic>, and <italic>Opn</italic>, as well as the downregulation in <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA and protein expression are cell autonomous effects in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells.</p>

<p>A puzzling finding in our in vitro experiments with calvarial cells was that the up-regulated Fgf23 secretion observed in both osteoblast- and osteocyte-like cells from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice suppressed <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA and protein abundance only in osteocyte-like cells but not in osteoblasts. To rule out that this finding was due to the calvarial origin of the cells, we isolated osteoblasts from femurs of newborn WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice and differentiated them for 12 and 22 d. Similar to calvarial cells, osteocalcin expression was higher at day 12, whereas <italic>Sost</italic> expression was higher at day 22 compared to day 12, consistent with a differentiated osteoblast-like phenotype at day 12 and an osteocyte-like phenotype at day 22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002427.s002">S1A Fig</xref>). At day 12, femoral osteoblasts isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice showed increased <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression, decreased phosphate production, but unchanged BCIP/NBT staining relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002427.s002">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). After 22 d of differentiation, <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA abundance, phosphate production, and BCIP/NBT staining were decreased in <italic>Hyp</italic> versus WT cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002427.s002">S1B and S1C Fig</xref>). <italic>Fgf23</italic> mRNA abundance was increased in <italic>Hyp</italic> versus WT cells at day 12 and 22 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002427.s002">S1B Fig</xref>). To test the differential sensitivity of calvarial versus femoral osteoblasts and osteocytes to recombinant FGF23 (rFGF23), we treated WT and osteoblasts and osteocyte-like cells with different doses of rFGF23, and monitored <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression. The rFGF23-induced suppression of <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression was generally similar in calvarial versus femoral osteoblasts and osteocyte-like cells from WT and <italic>Hyp</italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002427.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). However, in line with a lower sensitivity of <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteoblasts, higher concentrations of rFGF23 were needed to suppress <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA in <italic>Hyp</italic> femoral and calvarial osteoblasts, relative to osteocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002427.s003">S2 Fig</xref>). Hence, the differences in TNAP expression and the response to pharmacological treatment with rFGF23 between osteoblasts and osteocyte-like cells isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice were similar in cells derived from calvarial and femoral origin.</p>
<p>We previously reported that FGF23 inhibits <italic>Tnap</italic> transcription via FGFR3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref033">33</xref>]. The abovementioned increase in <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-rich fractions and osteocyte-like cells relative to WT cells would be consistent with the notion that the up-regulation of FGFR3 during osteocytic differentiation is the pivotal process making <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes more responsive to the suppressive effect of Fgf23 on <italic>Tnap</italic> transcription. To confirm the up-regulation of <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA during osteocytic differentiation in vivo, we performed in situ mRNA expression analysis in frozen femur sections, employing laser capture microdissection (LCM), a technique which we recently developed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref043">43</xref>]. We found that <italic>Fgf23</italic> mRNA abundance was ~3-fold higher in WT osteocytes than in WT osteoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Relative to WT osteoblasts, <italic>Fgf23</italic> mRNA expression was ~6–7-fold higher in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts and osteocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In accordance with our in vitro and ex vivo data, <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression was increased in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts, but suppressed in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes, relative to WT osteoblasts and osteocytes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). <italic>Fgfr1</italic> mRNA expression was higher in osteoblasts and osteocytes of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, relative to WT controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Notably, <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA abundance was ~5-fold higher in WT osteocytes than in WT osteoblasts, whereas <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA expression was suppressed in <italic>Hyp</italic> versus WT osteoblasts, but profoundly up-regulated in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes showed ~70-fold higher <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA abundance than <italic>Hyp</italic> osteoblasts. Taken together, these findings support the notion that the distinct up-regulation in <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA expression during osteocytic differentiation especially in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice is permissive to the Fgf23-mediated suppression of <italic>Tnap</italic> transcription in vitro and in vivo.</p>

<title>Blocking of Fgf23—FGFR3 Signaling Increases <italic>TNAP</italic> mRNA Expression and Pi Production in <italic>Hyp</italic> Osteocyte-Like Cells In Vitro</title>
<p>Next, we examined whether the changes in the mRNA expression of PPi-regulating genes in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells are causatively linked to increased Fgf23 secretion. To this end, we isolated osteoblasts from newborn <italic>Hyp</italic> and WT mice, and treated osteocyte-like cells differentiated for 22 d with either neutralizing anti-FGF23 antibody (FGF23 AB) or an FGFR3 inhibitor for 24 h. In analogy to the experiments shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g003">Fig 3</xref>, <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells expressed distinctly lower <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA, and showed lower Pi but higher PPi concentrations in cell culture medium, relative to WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). With the exception of an up-regulation in <italic>Opn</italic> mRNA abundance, treatment of osteocyte-like cells with either FGFR3 inhibitor or FGF23 AB did not have significant effects in WT cells, but increased <italic>Tnap</italic> and <italic>Opn</italic>, and lowered <italic>Ank</italic> and <italic>Enpp1</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells, relative to vehicle-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). However, both treatments did not restore <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells to WT control levels. In concordance with the increased <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression after inhibition of Fgf23 signaling, treatment of <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells with either FGFR3 inhibitor or FGF23 AB increased Pi and decreased PPi concentrations in the cell culture medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>).</p>

<p>Finally, to determine if longer term inhibition of Fgf23 signaling in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells translates into a more complete correction of TNAP activity and PPi levels, we treated osteocyte-like cells with either FGFR3 inhibitor or FGF23 AB for 96 h and subsequently assessed PPi concentration and TNAP enzyme activity, using NBT/BCIP staining for the latter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, both treatments did not alter ALP staining or PPi concentration in WT osteocyte-like cells. However, treatment with either FGFR3 inhibitor or FGF23 AB increased ALP staining in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells compared to vehicle-treated cells. The increase in TNAP activity was accompanied by a profound increase in Pi concentration and normalization of PPi levels in cell culture medium from <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells treated with either FGFR3 inhibitor or FGF23 AB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, our data provide evidence that increased Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling inhibits TNAP activity in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes, causing PPi accumulation which in turn contributes to the mineralization defect observed in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice. However, inhibition of Fgf23 signaling did not completely normalize TNAP mRNA expression and enzyme activity, suggesting that other, still unknown factors are involved in the regulation of TNAP in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes. Of note, inhibition of Fgf23 signaling increased phosphate concentrations in the cell culture medium beyond the levels found in WT osteocyte-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This finding may suggest that the increased phosphate production after inhibition of Fgf23 signaling could not be adequately used for mineralization in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells due to the presence of additional inhibitors of mineralization, most likely OPN and ASARM peptides due to <italic>Phex</italic> deficiency.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the current study, we identified a novel mechanism contributing to the defective mineralization in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice. Our data indicate that besides its endocrine role as phosphaturic hormone, excessive osteocytic Fgf23 secretion has an additional para-/autocrine role in the development of osteomalacia in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice by suppressing TNAP activity in osteocytes, which in turn leads to accumulation of PPi, a potent inhibitor of mineralization. We hypothesize that the cell-specific suppression of Tnap in osteocytes but not osteoblasts of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice is based upon the profound up-regulation of <italic>Fgfr3</italic> expression during osteocytic differentiation. This model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002427.g008">Fig 8</xref>. Moreover, we demonstrated that conditional deletion of <italic>Fgf23</italic> in cells of the osteoblastic lineage rescued the suppressed TNAP activity in osteocytes of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice in vivo, and that blocking of the cell-autonomous increase in Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells improved TNAP activity and phosphate production, and decreased PPi concentration in vitro. However, inhibition of Fgf23 signaling did not fully correct the mineralization defect in vitro, suggesting that increased local Fgf23 production is only partially responsible for impaired mineralization in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice.</p>

<title>Proposed model of PPi accumulation through increased Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes.</title>
<p>Fgf23 secreted into the extracellular fluid binds to FGFR3 and acts as a transcriptional suppressor of <italic>Tnap</italic>. TNAP is a central molecule in the mineralization process and favors mineralization through hydrolyzing PPi, thus providing Pi for mineralization. Fgf23 secretion is up-regulated in osteoblasts and especially osteocytes in <italic>Hyp</italic> bones, relative to WT osteoblasts and osteocytes. FGFR3 expression is reduced in <italic>Hyp</italic> compared with WT osteoblasts. However, differentiation of osteoblasts into osteocytes is associated with a distinct up-regulation of FGFR3 expression especially in <italic>Hyp</italic> bones. Together with the increased secretion of Fgf23, the upregulation in FGFR3 leads to autocrine/paracrine suppression of TNAP activity in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes but not osteoblasts, causing accumulation of PPi and inhibition of bone mineralization in osteocyte lacunae.</p>

<p>The XLH and <italic>Hyp</italic> phenotypes are caused by loss-of-function mutations in <italic>PHEX/Phex</italic>. It was previously thought that increased ASARM peptides were largely responsible for the cell autonomous mineralization defect observed in osteoblasts isolated from <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, and partially for the osteomalacia found in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref018">18</xref>]. Phex binds to and proteolytically cleaves free ASARM peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref046">46</xref>], and also degrades OPN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref021">21</xref>]. ASARM peptides and OPN are increased in bones of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref019">19</xref>], and known to impair mineralization in vivo and in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref047">47</xref>]. It is interesting to note in this context that transgenic overexpression of <italic>PHEX</italic> under different promoters only partially rescued the osteomalacia in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice (PHEX-tg/<italic>Hyp</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref048">48</xref>]. The current study may provide a possible explanation why osteomalacia was not fully corrected in the majority of studies with PHEX-tg/<italic>Hyp</italic> mice. In this regard, Fgf23 levels remained significantly higher in Phex-Tg/<italic>Hyp</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref049">49</xref>], thus TNAP activity may have remained suppressed in these mice, causing impaired mineralization via PPi accumulation.</p>
<p>An interesting aspect of our study was the striking differences between the expression profiles of osteoblasts and osteocytes isolated by sequential digestion from <italic>Hyp</italic> bones. Whereas <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA and protein expression was strongly suppressed in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells, <italic>Tnap</italic> mRNA expression was ~50-fold increased in <italic>Hyp</italic> relative to WT osteoblast-like cells. Vice versa, we found increased Fgf23 expression only in osteocytes but not in osteoblasts of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice as evidenced by sequential digestion of bones. This finding is in agreement with earlier reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref039">39</xref>]. However, LCM-based in situ expression profiling of osteoblasts and osteocytes revealed increased <italic>Fgf23</italic> mRNA abundance not only in osteocytes, but also in osteoblasts in <italic>Hyp</italic> bones. Therefore, the relative contribution of osteoblasts and osteocytes to the increased circulating Fgf23 levels in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice is not entirely clear. Furthermore, in agreement with earlier studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref039">39</xref>], we found that <italic>Fgfr3</italic> mRNA abundance is profoundly up-regulated during osteocytic differentiation especially in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, supporting the notion that the higher membrane abundance of FGFR3 in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocytes versus osteoblasts forms the basis for the cell type-specific suppression of <italic>Tnap</italic> transcription by Fgf23. Collectively, these results underscore the biological differences between osteocytes and osteoblasts in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice and suggest that the increased ALP activity in the serum of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice and XLH patients more likely reflects changes in bone surface cells rather than osteocytes. Although we did not assess TNAP expression in newly embedded osteocytes at bone-forming surfaces, we speculate that suppression of TNAP with subsequent accumulation of PPi may also occur in osteoid seams at the bone surface, not only in osteocyte lacunae. Up-regulation of FGFR3 expression in newly embedded osteocytes may lead to Fgf23-mediated suppression of TNAP, which may in turn result in accumulation of PPi and subsequent inhibition of mineralization in the widened osteoid seams of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice in addition to increased concentrations of ASARM peptides and OPN.</p>
<p>TNAP, an ectoenzyme, is responsible for the local production of Pi for mineralization via hydrolyzing PPi in the ECM. <italic>Tnap</italic> loss-of-function mutants are characterized by impaired bone mineralization via accumulation of PPi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref050">50</xref>]. Furthermore, TNAP-deficient osteoblasts fail to mineralize in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref051">51</xref>], underscoring the pivotal importance of TNAP for bone mineralization. We previously reported that Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling suppresses TNAP transcription and activity, causing PPi accumulation and inhibition of mineralization in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref033">33</xref>]. Here, we showed that inhibition of Fgf23-FGFR3 signaling in <italic>Hyp</italic> osteocyte-like cells by treatment with either an FGFR3 inhibitor or an anti-FGF23 antibody improved TNAP activity and decreased PPi concentration in vitro. In addition, bone-specific deletion of <italic>Fgf23</italic> in <italic>Hyp</italic>/<italic>Fgf23</italic><sup>Δ/flox</sup><italic>/Col2</italic>.<italic>3</italic><sup><italic>cre+</italic></sup> mice rescued the suppressed TNAP activity in osteocytes of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice. Although bony PPi concentrations were not quantified after treatment of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice with anti-Fgf23 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref009">9</xref>] or a pan-FGFR inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref024">24</xref>], it is likely that systemic anti-FGF23 treatment or pan-FGFR inhibition also, at least partially, corrects the increased PPi concentration in bone. This idea is indirectly supported by our finding that a 5-d treatment of WT mice with rFGF23 suppressed TNAP expression and increased PPi in bone, suggesting that circulating FGF23 levels are able to modulate bony PPi metabolism. The latter findings may also have implications for tumor-induced osteomalacia (TIO), because our data suggest that excessive extraskeletal production of FGF23 may also lead to PPi accumulation in bone. However, due to the low affinity of the FGFR3 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref033">33</xref>], this mechanism may only become operative at high circulating FGF23 levels.</p>
<p>Vitamin D hormone levels are inappropriately low in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice and in XLH patients due to the FGF23-mediated suppression of renal 1α-hydroxylase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref015">15</xref>]. The vitamin D hormone not only governs intestinal absorption of calcium and phosphate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref052">52</xref>], but also inhibits bone mineralization by stimulating the transcription of <italic>Enpp1</italic>, <italic>Ank</italic>, and <italic>Opn</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref035">35</xref>]. In line with low vitamin D hormone levels in <italic>Hyp</italic> mice, the mRNA abundance of <italic>Ank</italic> and <italic>Enpp1</italic> was almost undetectable in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived F-3 osteoblasts. On the contrary, the mRNA abundance of <italic>Ank</italic> and <italic>Enpp1</italic> was higher in <italic>Hyp</italic>- than WT-derived osteocyte-rich cell fractions ex vivo. Therefore, inappropriately low vitamin D hormone levels cannot account for the changes observed in <italic>Ank</italic> and <italic>Enpp1</italic> expression in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells. Furthermore, inhibition of Fgf23 signaling partially corrected the increased <italic>Ank</italic> and <italic>Enpp1</italic>, but not the increased <italic>Opn</italic> mRNA expression, in <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteocyte-like cells in our experiments. Collectively, our data and the work of others suggest that <italic>Phex</italic> deficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref053">53</xref>], via only partially known signaling pathways at present time, induces a complex pattern of altered gene regulation in which increased Fgf23 transcription is only a portion of the pathophysiology.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have found that the mineralization defect in bones of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice and in cultures of <italic>Hyp</italic>-derived osteoblasts is not only due to local accumulation of ASARM peptides and OPN but also due to the Fgf23-driven accumulation of PPi, another potent mineralization inhibitor. Clearly, more work is required to disentangle the complex interactions between <italic>Phex</italic> deficiency, Fgf23 secretion, and para-/autocrine Fgf23 feedback signaling in osteocytes of <italic>Hyp</italic> mice. A more complete understanding of these aspects of osteocyte biology may help to design novel treatments for the mineralization defects observed in diseases associated with excessive osteocytic Fgf23 secretion such as XLH or chronic kidney disease.</p>

<title>Culture of Osteoblast- and Osteocyte-Like Cells and In Vitro Experiments</title>
<p>Calvariae were aseptically harvested from 3-d-old mice, minced and incubated with digestion medium (α-MEM medium, 2 mg/ml type II collagenase (Invitrogen) and 2% Penicillin-Streptomycin) at 37°C in a water bath for 4 h. Bone fragments were washed with PBS and cultured in α-MEM medium supplemented with 2% Penicillin-Streptomycin and 10% calf serum (PAA). A similar protocol was followed using femora of 3-d-old mice to obtain femural osteoblast cultures. After 90% confluence, cells were grown in the presence of osteoblastic differentiation medium (50 μg/ml ascorbic acid and 10 mM β-glycerophosphate) for 12–22 d as specified. The differentiated cells were treated with various concentrations of recombinant human FGF23 carrying the R176/179Q stabilizing mutations (rFGF23, kindly provided by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, US) for 24 h, 20 ng/ml rat anti-FGF23 antibody (kindly provided by Amgen Inc., Thousand Oaks, CA, US), or 25 nM FGFR3 inhibitor PD173074 (Sigma) for 24 or 96 h. At the various time points following treatment, cell culture supernatant and samples for RNA isolation were collected and stored at −80°C. For BCIP/NBT staining, cells were fixed using acetone and methanol (30:70) for 5 min at −20°C, and stained using TNM buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl, pH 9.5, 100 mM NaCl, 5 mM MgCl2) containing 0.175 mg/mL 3-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP, Sigma) and 0.45 ng/mL nitrotetrazolium blue chloride (NBT, Sigma) for 45 min at room temperature. Stained cells were photographed using a stereomicroscope (Stemi SV6; Zeiss), and the percent area of positive staining was measured using Image J software.</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Histochemistry and Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>For immunohistochemistry, 5-μm-thick undecalcified sections were obtained from plastic-embedded femurs as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref056">56</xref>]. Sections were deplastified, incubated for 15 min in 3% hydrogen peroxide in PBS to block endogenous peroxidase activity, and, after blocking with 10% rabbit serum, incubated with rabbit anti-OPN antibody (Abcam, 1:300) at 4°C overnight. After washing, sections were incubated for 2 h with biotinylated goat anti-rabbit secondary antibody (1:2,000, Vector). Finally, the sections were counterstained with Mayer's hematoxylin. Negative control was performed by omitting the primary antibody. For TNAP staining, deplastified bone sections were incubated with vector red ALP staining kit (Vector Laboratories) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Fluorescent images of TNAP and DAPI were obtained using appropriate filter sets. Fluorescence measurements were obtained using Image J software as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref058">58</xref>]. Fluorescence along the bone surface was marked manually and quantified using Image J for obtaining relative fluorescence of osteoblasts. At least 15 osteocytes per image and a total of 6 images per animal were chosen for the quantification of relative fluorescence in osteocytes. Relative fluorescence in osteocytes was normalized to cell number. The sections were analyzed using a Zeiss Axioskop 2 microscope.</p>

<sec id="sec020">
<title>Protein Isolation from Bone</title>
<p>Proteins from femurs were isolated using a previously described protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002427.ref059">59</xref>]. Briefly, femurs were carefully defleshed and bone marrow was flushed out. After demineralization (300 μl of 1.2 M HCl at 4°C overnight), proteins were isolated using 6M guanidine-HCL in 100 mM Tris buffer, pH 7.4, at 4°C for 72 h. Extracted proteins were concentrated using ethanol precipitation and re-dissolved in 8M urea buffer. Protein concentration was determined using a BCA assay (Thermo Scientific).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec021">
<title>Western Blotting</title>
<p>Proteins were solubilized in Laemmli sample buffer, fractionated on SDS–PAGE (50 μg/well), and transferred to a nitrocellulose membrane (Thermo Scientific). Immunoblots were incubated overnight at 4°C with polyclonal rabbit anti‐OPN (1:2,000, Abcam), polyclonal goat anti-TNAP (1:2,000, R&amp;D Systems) and monoclonal mouse anti-β-actin (1:5,000, Sigma) in 2% (w/v) bovine serum albumin (BSA, Sigma) in a TBS‐T buffer [150 mM NaCl, 10 mM Tris (pH 7.4/HCl), 0.2% (v/v) Tween-20]. After washing, membranes were incubated with horseradish peroxidase-conjugated secondary antibodies (Sigma). Specific signal was visualized by ECL kit (Amersham Life Sciences). The protein bands were quantified by Image Quant 5.0 software (Molecular Dynamics).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec022">
<title>Quantification of PPi Levels</title>
<p>PPi was extracted from whole femurs with 1.2 M HCl at 4°C overnight. HCl was evaporated at 99°C, and samples were resuspended in deionized water. The amount of PPi extracted from bone or in cell culture supernatant was quantified using the PPiLight Inorganic Pyrophosphate Assay (LONZA) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Sodium PPi tetrabasic decahydrate (Sigma) was used as standard.</p>
