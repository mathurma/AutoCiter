<abstract>
<p>In this work we studied the folding process of the hybrid-1 type human telomeric DNA G-quadruplex with solvent and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions explicitly modeled. Enabled by the powerful bias-exchange metadynamics and large-scale conventional molecular dynamic simulations, the free energy landscape of this G-DNA was obtained for the first time and four folding intermediates were identified, including a triplex and a basically formed quadruplex. The simulations also provided atomistic pictures for the structures and cation binding patterns of the intermediates. The results showed that the structure formation and cation binding are cooperative and mutually supporting each other. The <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientation dynamics of the intermediates was also investigated. It was found that the nucleotides usually take correct <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations when they form native and stable hydrogen bonds with the others, while fluctuating between two configurations when they do not. Misfolded intermediates with wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations were observed in the early intermediates but not in the later ones. Based on the simulations, we also discussed the roles of the non-native interactions. Besides, the formation process of the parallel conformation in the first two G-repeats and the associated reversal loop were studied. Based on the above results, we proposed a folding pathway for the hybrid-1 type G-quadruplex with atomistic details, which is new and more complete compared with previous ones. The knowledge gained for this type of G-DNA may provide a general insight for the folding of the other G-quadruplexes.</p>

<p>G-quadruplexes are high-order DNA/RNA structures. They are involved in the regulation of telomere maintenance, DNA replication, transcription and translation, and are also attractive drug designing targets for treating cancers and promising building blocks for molecular nanodevices. The knowledge of their formation process will improve our understanding of how they achieve their functional structures and then facilitate designing of artificial G-quadruplexes with novel functions. The study of their formation process is also of academic importance, since they involve many different physical chemical factors or interactions, including the hydrogen bonds, the electrostatic effect associated with metal ions, and the <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientation of the glycosidic bonds. These make the G-quadruplex a fascinating model system for studying the structure formation of bio-molecules. Furthermore, the study of their formations may enrich the free energy landscape theory that has been well developed for protein folding, but yet to be verified in the other biomolecular systems. Here we computationally study the folding process of the hybrid-1 type human telomeric DNA G-quadruplex and infer a new folding picture, which may also cast a light to the formation of the other G-quadruplexes.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>G-quadruplexes are high-order DNA or RNA structures formed from guanine-rich sequences, and their building blocks are G-tetrads that arise from Hoogsten hydrogen-bonding between four guanines. The G-tetrads stack on top of each other and form four-stranded helical structures. Bioinformatics analysis suggests that G-quadruplex motifs are prevalent in genomes. Recently, experimental evidence is accumulating for the in vivo presence of G-quadruplexes in DNA telomeres, in gene promoter regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Lipps1">[1]</xref>, and even in messenger RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Azzalin1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Wanrooij1">[3]</xref>, suggesting that they are involved in the regulation of telomere maintenance, replication, transcription and translation. G-quadruplexes are also attractive drug designing targets for treating cancers and platforms for delivering drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Davis1">[4]</xref>. Despite of their functional importance, the folding processes by which they achieve the functional structures have not been well understood as that of DNA and RNA duplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Ponnuswamy1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Cragnolini1">[12]</xref>. It is believed that there are significant differences between G-quadruplexes and duplexes in the balance of forces, mainly the hydrogen bonds and electrostatic interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Lane1">[13]</xref>. Therefore, the study of the folding of G-quadruplex will improve our understanding of the balance between different forces in determining the structures and dynamics of such a typical folded oligonucleotide, and may facilitating designing new quadruplexes with novel functions. Moreover, the knowledge may enrich the energy landscape theory that has been well developed for protein folding, but yet to be verified in the other biomolecular systems. However, the folding of G-quadruplexes is a difficult problem due to its sensitivity to the terminal nucleotides, the dependence on ion types and concentration, and particularly due to the little known interplay between metal ions and folding dynamics; the <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientations of the glycosidic bonds of the nucleotides further complicate the folding process.</p>
<p>There are lots of experimental works on different forms of G-quadruplexes, studying their native structures, thermodynamical properties, folding kinetics and cooperativity, as well as the roles of ions in the stability and folding process. A detailed discussion of these works is beyond the scope of this article and can be found in several excellent reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Lane1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Bochman1">[19]</xref>. Recently, new progress has been made on the folding intermediates of DNA quadruplexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Bonina1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Gray1">[23]</xref>, particularly those achieved by single-molecular techniques including optic tweezers and magnetic tweezers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Koirala1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Yu1">[26]</xref>. For example, Wei <italic>et al.</italic> investigated the folding kinetics of human telomeric G-quadruplexes using magnetic tweezers and detected a G-triplex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Li1">[25]</xref>; they also observed reversible transitions from the G-quadruplex to the G-triplex as well as from the G-triplex to the unfolded coil, and then suggested that the G-triplex is an in-pathway intermediate. Molecular modeling and simulations are able to complement experiments by providing much detailed information or insights <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-te1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Li2">[31]</xref>. For example, Sugiyama <italic>et al.</italic> systematically investigated the intermediates of human telomeric G-quadruplexes using <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations and MD simulations; the folding pathways and the roles played by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions were discussed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Mashimo1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Mashimo2">[30]</xref>. Limongelli <italic>et al.</italic> studied the folding of a 15-mer G-quadruplex using metadynamics; they identified a stable G-triplex and then validated it with a number of experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Limongelli1">[32]</xref>. Despite of many pioneer works, the atomistic picture for the folding pathways of quadruplexes is still lacking due to the temporal and spatial resolution limits of experimental techniques, the exclusion of conformation dynamics or entropies in theoretical analysis, or insufficient sampling of the phase space in previous all-atom computer simulations.</p>
<p>In this work we studied the folding process of a 24-nt human telomeric DNA sequence <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (PDB ID 2GKU) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Luu1">[33]</xref> with explicitly modeled solvents and ions using an advanced sampling technique and large-scale simulations. This sequence was selected since it forms a unique native structure of hybrid-1 type in KCl solution at room temperature and has many experimental results to be compared with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Gray1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Mashimo2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Luu1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Gray2">[34]</xref>. The folding time of this sequence was measured to be longer than 10 ms by stopped-flow and spectroscopic techniques <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Gray2">[34]</xref>, well beyond the timescale of traditional all-atom MD simulations. To overcome the barrier crossing problem, we combined the power of large-scale simulations and a novel advanced sampling technique named bias-exchange metadynamics, which is very efficient at accelerating barrier-crossing events by periodically modifying the effective energy felt by the system with small repulsive Gaussian potentials and thus enforcing the escape from local minima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Laio1">[35]</xref>. For a further acceleration of the sampling and increase of its coverage in the phase space, multiple (six) copies of metadynamics were run simultaneously with each biased on a different collective variable (CV) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Piana1">[36]</xref>. The conformations and velocities of different replicas were allowed to exchange periodically according to a metropolis criterion. From the data obtained by bias-exchange metadynamics, we calculated the free energy landscape, identified several intermediate states, and further studied their stabilities and dynamics by performing massive conventional MD simulations. Based on the above results we proposed an atomistic picture for the folding process of the hybrid-1 type G-DNA and discussed its relevance to the previous experimental and theoretical results.</p>

<title>The free energy landscape and the intermediates</title>
<p>The convergence of the bias-exchange metadynamics was tested by monitoring the random walk of the replicas in their CV spaces, the exchange probability as a function of simulation time, and the evolution of FEL during simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s003">Figure S3</xref>). For the four biased replicas, the CVs sampled all the possible values of Q and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and a broad region of dRMSD (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>); and the replica walked back and forth many times in the relevant space. These features indicated that the simulation sampled a sufficient large region of CV spaces. The number of successfully exchanged events was almost linear as a function of time for all replicas, showing that the exchange happened at a steady rate throughout the simulation. The average exchange probabilities were in the range of 4–5% for the four biased replicas and about 21% for the neutral replicas. The lower values for four biased replicas were expected since they were biased at different CVs and had very different energetics. The FELs were calculated solely from the neutral replicas to avoid potential problems from the applied biases in the other replicas. It was found that the general shape of the FELs did not change after <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the two FELs calculated respectively from two neutral replicas at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were almost indistinguishable. Besides, the highest free energy barrier between basins was around several kcal/mol, reflecting a good sampling quality of the relevant phase space. The FELs at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> will be used for the following analysis.</p>
<p>The free energy landscape shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g001">Figure 1</xref> roughly manifests a diagonal shape, indicating the cooperativity between the formation of native contacts and the binding of metal ions. From the FEL six basins of attraction are identified and labeled from I to VI, respectively. Their representative structures are also shown in the figure, obtained based on a clustering analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Zhang1">[37]</xref> of the belonging conformations, which are determined using their CVs. For the first basin it is found that the structures are pretty heterogeneous. For example, the largest cluster has a rather compact structure, i.e., the first two G-repeats (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) roughly form a hairpin, upon which docks the 3′ terminal via non-native interactions. The second and third largest clusters are both characterized by hairpins, however, formed between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. Most stable interactions observed in the first basin are non-native ones, supported by the hydrogen bond map averaged on all the structures belonging to this basin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions binding on the G-DNA are weak, with the binding probabilities generally lower than 0.15. Besides, the binding probabilities are almost uniform on all nucleotides; there is no specific binding detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Based on the above analysis, the basin-I is designated as the denatured state.</p>

<title>The free energy landscape and the representative structures of the basins of attraction.</title>
<p>The unit of the free energy is kcal/mol. Multiple representative structures are given for the first two basins, due to the their heterogeneous nature. The populations of the representative structures within their respectively basins are roughly estimated and indicated by the numbers beside them. The three G-tetrads in the structures are colored red, green, and purple, respectively. This color code will be used throughout the whole text unless otherwise indicated. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions bound to DNA are shown as yellow spheres.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.g001" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The last basin (basin-VI) occupies a narrow area and is characterized by the highest values of Q and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> among all basins. Plus, clustering analysis showed that the belonging structures are homogenous and similar to the native one. Therefore the basin-VI is concluded to be the native state of the G-DNA.</p>
<p>In addition to the basin-I and basin-VI, there are other four basins of attraction on the FEL. Obviously these are intermediate states and hold the key for understanding the folding process of the G-DNA. For a better characterization of these intermediates, we feel that a clustering analysis of the BEMD data is not accurate enough, since it is not trivial to determine the width of a basin and whether a structure belongs to that basin solely based on the CVs, due to possible overlaps between basins in a low-dimensional projection of the free energy landscape. Therefore we further performed multiple conventional MD simulations initialized from these intermediates. Such simulations are free of the above mentioned problems, and most importantly, they are able to provide true dynamics of the intermediates, which is lost in BEMD due to the added potentials. In the following sections we will discuss the structures and dynamics of the intermediates by combining the data from BEMD with that from conventional simulations.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>The structure and dynamics of the intermediates</title>
<p>The structure of the intermediate-II is heterogeneous, mainly characterized by a well formed hairpin at 3′-terminal and an unstable hairpin at the 5′-terminal according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Conventional MD simulations initialized from the largest cluster confirmed such an observation. As shown by the hydrogen bond map in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g002">Figure 2(A)</xref> and the detailed structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">Figure 3(A)</xref>, the intermediate-II is compose of a well-formed native hairpin between the G-repeats <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (shorted as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> hereafter) and a non-native hairpin formed by the first two G-repeats via G9∶G3 and G10∶T1; and the interactions between two hairpins are ignorable. Dynamically, the structures are under constant fluctuations, with the RMSDs up to 1 nm with respect to their initial conformations. The fluctuations are mainly associated with relative motions between two hairpins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s005">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s017">Video S1</xref>). The consistence of the conventional simulations with the BEMD data suggests that the former has covered the most relevant phase space of the intermediate-II, although the initial structures were chosen only from the largest cluster, whose population was about 20% in this intermediate. Besides, it is interesting to note that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is in an antiparallel conformation, in contrast to its parallel conformation in the native structure. The latter structure is probably not stable in this stage without the supporting from the nearby interactions, due to the tension associated with the parallel conformation and the reversal loop. The ion binding pattern of this structure shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g004">Figure 4(A)</xref> is similar to that of the denatured structures, i.e., the binding probabilities are low and almost distributed evenly on all nucleotides. There is no strongly binding sites observed.</p>

<p>The intermediate-III is a native triplex composed of the last three G-repeats (denoted as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> hereafter), revealed by BEMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and confirmed by multiple conventional MD simulations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g002">Figure 2(B)</xref>, there are two large groups of hydrogen bonds, including that between the G-repeat <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (G21∶G17 and G22∶G16), and between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (G17∶G9 and G16∶G10). The detailed structure in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">Figure 3(B)</xref> consistently shows that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is spatially close to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is close to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The initial structures for running conventional MD simulations represent roughly 36% populations in the intermediate-III, however, the trajectories still cover a broad region of phase space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Conventional simulations demonstrate two different dynamics that drive the G-DNA toward different destinations. The first kind is a docking of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the triplex, which essentially makes the structure transform into the intermediate-IV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s009">Figure S9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s018">Video S2</xref>). Another dynamics is characterized by a flanking motion of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with respect to the triplex, constrained by a native base pair A20∶T1 and an non-native interaction G9∶G4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g002">Figure 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s019">Video S3</xref>). These two interaction pull the first G-repeat close to the triplex so that it will not drift away from the triplex. The flanking motion keeps the G-DNA in the original basin and results in a fluctuating structure, which will eventually transform into the intermediate-IV via the first kind of dynamics described above.</p>
<p>In the intermediate-III, metal ion binding pattern becomes interesting. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g004">4</xref>, a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion is trapped between the first and second G-tetrads, resulting in high ion binding probabilities of almost 90% of the nearby nucleotides. Clearly, the binding of a positive ion compromises the strong negative charges along the backbone and further stabilizes the base pairs by coordinating the O6 atoms of the nearby bases. The second <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion between the second and third G-tetrad seen in the native structure is absent in the intermediate-III, therefore the nearby native base pairs G23∶G15 and G15∶G11 are hardly detectable, although the three nucleotides are almost in position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g002">Figure 2(B)</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">Figure 3(B)</xref>).</p>
<p>The structure of the intermediate-IV is characterized by a incomplete docking of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the triplex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, supported by both BEMD and conventional simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g001">Figure 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">3</xref>). The last nucleotide G5 in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> does not reach its correct position in the third G-tetrad but forms non-native hydrogen bonds with G9 instead. The G3 and G4 nucleotides in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, however, bind correctly to the trapped <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion in the central channel and their ion binding probabilities increase to about 80% from below 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g004">Figure 4</xref>), leading to a basically formed quadruplex. At this folding stage, the lower ion binding site in the central channel is still unoccupied, although seven out of eight of its nearby nucleotides are in position. Dynamically speaking, the whole structure is very stable, indicated by the not-larger-than 0.25 nm RMSDs with respect to the initial structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s007">Figure S7</xref>). This dynamics is believed to be representative of that of the intermediate-IV since the initial structures for running conventional simulations represent 80% population of the basin.</p>
<p>The intermediate-V is different from the preceding intermediates primarily in the trapped <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion in lower site in the quadruplex channel (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The trapped ion results in a further strengthening of the native base pairs and increase of ion binding probabilities of the nucleotides in the third G-tetrad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g002">Figure 2</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g004">4</xref>). The structure is very similar to the native one and thus the intermediate should be viewed as a sub-state of the native basin of attraction. Indeed, we observed two direct folding trajectories from this intermediate to the native states in the conventional simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s008">Figure S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s009">S9</xref>).</p>

<title>The <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientations of the glycosidic bonds</title>
<p>The folding of G-DNA is complex partially due to the involvement of the <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientations of the glycosidic bonds. To reveal how such motions interplay with the folding process, we analyzed the <italic>syn/anti</italic> patterns and dynamics of the intermediates based on multiple conventional MD simulations. The torsion angle used to determine the <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations for a specific glycosidic bond was calculated based on the following four atoms: O4′ and C1′ in the sugar ring, and N9 and C8 in the base. The results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g005">Figure 5</xref> and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s011">Figure S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s012">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s014">S14</xref>. It can be seen that in four intermediates the glycosidic bonds generally take correct <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations when the corresponding nucleotides form native and stable base pairs with the others. Here by correct we mean the glycosidic bonds take the same configurations as in the native structure. However, fluctuating glycosidic bonds are also observed. For example, in the intermediate-II there are two nucleotides (G22 and G23) fluctuating between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> configurations although they are within the basically formed 3′-terminal hairpin. Even after the structure transforms to the intermediate-III, G23 is still under fluctuation. The typical time scale for the <italic>syn/anti</italic> transitions is of order of ten nanoseconds, according to conventional MD simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s011">Figure S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s012">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s013">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s014">S14</xref>). Interestingly, two nucleotides with wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations are observed although they have formed base pairs with others, which are G17 in the intermediate-II and G11 in the intermediate-III, tentatively attributed to their outer position in the formed structure and associated larger flexibility. From the intermediates-III to V, more and more stable base pairs are formed and the fluctuating bonds become fewer accordingly. In the last two intermediates, we also observed fluctuating bonds but no wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The combined power of bias-exchange metadynamics and large scale conventional MD simulations enabled us to explore the free energy landscape of the DNA G-quadruplex and the structure and dynamics of the intermediates. The relevance of the results described above to the previous experimental and theoretical data is discussed in the following sections.</p>
<p>Recently, the existence of a triplex as a folding intermediate in several different quadruplexes has been established by many experimental approaches, including CD, DSC, and ITC analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Bonina1">[20]</xref>, FRET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Gray1">[23]</xref>, optic tweezers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Koirala1">[24]</xref>, and magnetic tweezers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Li1">[25]</xref>. However, the detailed structure of the triplex, particularly the binding patterns of the associated metal ions, is still unclear due to temporal and spatial resolution limits of experimental techniques. The triplex detected in our simulations (the intermediate-III) is relevant to that detected in previous experiments. For example, our triplex is characterized by a docking of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the hairpin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, with the first G-repeat at the 5′ terminal fluctuating around. This structural feature has also been observed in the thermal denaturation experiments of several human telomere DNA sequences including Tel22 and 2GKU by Gray <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Gray1">[23]</xref>, who found that these two DNAs have common unfolding pathways and the intermediate triplex states have greater solvent exposure of the 5′-segment. The folding/unfolding of Tel22 in the presence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions has also been studied by another group using DSC and CD measurements; they confirmed the existence of a triplex as intermediate state and determined a release of 1.5 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions from the folded to the triplex states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Bonina1">[20]</xref>. As a comparison, our calculation shows that the average numbers of bound <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions in the triplex and in the native states are 1.2 and 3.0, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s010">Figure S10</xref>); the difference of 1.8 ions agrees quite well with the experimental value. Furthermore, Mashimo <italic>et al.</italic> systematically calculated the energies of various possible topologies of triplex using <italic>ab initio</italic> molecular dynamics and fragment molecular orbital method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Mashimo2">[30]</xref>, and then for the type-1 quadruplex such as 2GKU they suggested a triplex that has a similar structure to ours. Therefore the triplex detected in our computations is relevant to previous experimental and theoretical ones. Moreover, our analysis provides more atomistic details on its structure, particularly in the patterns of metal ion binding.</p>
<p>In the folding studies of the hybrid-1 type G-DNAs, the formation time and folding dynamics of the parallel conformation in the 5′-terminal and the associated reversal loop are always a myth. In previous literatures, it was often suggested that these local structures form at the end of the folding stage via a flip of the first G-repeat. However, there is little direct proof supporting this suggestion. Here thanks to the powerful BEMD, we observed two intermediates that provided insights into the underlying dynamics. In the structure of the intermediate-III, the first G-repeat <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is constrained by the interaction A20∶T1 and G9∶G4 in such a place, that only a flanking motion of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with A20∶T1 as a pivot is needed to form the parallel conformation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In the conventional MD simulations started from this intermediate, we indeed observed two direct trajectories that transformed from the intermediate-III to IV with such a motion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s006">Figure S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s018">Video S2</xref>). As a result, in the intermediate-IV the parallel conformation and the reversal loop have been mostly formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Therefore the formation of the local structures is not a once-for-all event occurring in the final folding stage, as often implicated in previous literatures. Instead, the formation starts early with the triplex (the intermediate-III), and is basically finished when the triplex transforms into the quadruplex (the intermediate-IV); and the final formation is accomplished after the trapping of the second <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion in the central channel (the intermediate-V). We believe that the new picture can be easily verified by experiments, since it suggests that the A20∶T1 and G9∶G4 interactions play a key role during the transition from the triplex to the quadruplex. It is highly possible that a knockout of these interactions will significantly impede the formation of the reversal loop and slow down the folding rate of the G-DNA.</p>
<p>Early folding events are also important for understanding the whole folding process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Hyeon1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Biyun1">[39]</xref>. Previously, Mashimo and colleagues proposed that the type-1 quadruplex first folds into the hairpin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and then to the triplex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based on <italic>ab initio</italic> calculations and molecular simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Mashimo2">[30]</xref>. Although our work agrees with theirs on the formation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as an intermediate, it suggests a different initial structure, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> versus <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To determine which structure is more kinetically connected to the triplex, we performed 10 high temperature unfolding simulations starting from the native structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s015">Figure S15</xref>). It was found that 8 of them unfold into structures containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while only one into that containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This may be attributed to the larger entropy of the partially formed structure containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, compared with that containing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Physically, the entropy of the latter is lower in that it has two spatially close strands of length 7- and 8-nt, respectively, and the excluded volume effect between them lowers the structural entropy; in contrast, the former has a long unpaired strand of length 14-nt and a free nucleotide A24; the excluded volume effect between them is obviously minimal. Besides, the hairpin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has lower enthalpy, according to two additional simulations performed for the two hairpins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s016">Figure S16</xref>). Therefore, it is more likely that the early folding of the quadruplex starts from the hairpin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>The roles of non-native interactions in the folding process of G-DNA deserve further discussing. Before that, it is worth pointing out that in the research field of protein folding, non-native interactions are known to be important, particularly for the intrinsically disordered proteins. For example, Wang and colleagues studied the binding-induced folding of IA3, which is an intrinsically disordered protein that inhibits the yeast aspartic proteinase saccharopepsin by folding its own N-terminal residues into an alpha helix upon binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Wang1">[40]</xref>. With their developed multi-scaled approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Chu1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Wang2">[42]</xref>, they found that the non-native interactions facilitate binding by reducing significantly the entropic search space in the landscape. Here in the folding of the G-DNA, the roles played by the non-native interactions were found to be similar. As described in the result section, the non-native interaction G9∶G4, together with the native A20∶T1, pull the first G-repeat close to the triplex and so that it will eventually dock on the triplex. Without these interactions, the first G-repeat may drift away and has to search in a much larger phase space. The above arguments can be easily verified by an experiment that measures the folding rates of the G-DNAs mutated on the corresponding nucleotides.</p>
<p>The structural formation and binding of metal ions are cooperative during the whole folding process. Physically, the effects of trapping of cations in the central channel of the quadruplex are twofold. First, the trapped cations compromise the strong negative charges of the backbone and facilitate their approaching to each other. Second, the metal ions are able to coordinate the O6 atoms of the nearby bases thus bridge the interactions between them. According to our simulations, the total number of bound ions increases monotonically from the intermediate II to V (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003562.s010">Figure S10</xref>). In each intermediate, the formed base pairs need the binding of cations to strengthen their stabilities. For example, in the triplex structure of the intermediate-III, although G11, G15, and G23 are almost in their native position, they do not form stable base pairs according to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g002">Figure 2</xref>, as is correlated with the absence of the second <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ions in the central channel. This feature is more clear in the intermediate-IV, where the above three nucleotides become even closer while the base pairs between them are still minimal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">3</xref>), attributed to the same reason. Only after the G-DNA proceeds to the intermediate-V, the second ions is trapped in the central channel and then the surrounding base pairs become significantly stable. From another point of view, the trapping of cations also needs the formation of the local structures. This can be seen in the intermediate-IV, probably due to the lack of the protection from G5, the second <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion is able to leak out of the channel from the bottom (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g003">Figure 3</xref>) and thus cannot be trapped there stably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Therefore it is concluded that the folding and binding of ions are cooperative and mutually supporting each other.</p>
<p>The <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientations are among the most important factors that affect the folding rate of G-DNAs. There are two different <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientation dynamics according to our simulations. In general, the glycosidic bonds either stay at the correct configurations if the corresponding bases form native pairs with the others, or keep fluctuating if the bases are relatively free. In other words, in the correctly formed native structural elements defined by base pairs and backbone arrangements, wrong yet persistent <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations are seldom observed, possible due to the steric inconsistence between local backbone arrangements and wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations. This feature is consistent with a previous work by Sugiyama <italic>et al.</italic>, who systematically studied all the possible loop conformations as well as the <italic>syn/anti</italic> arrangements for type-1 and type-2 quadruplexes using <italic>ab initio</italic> molecular dynamics and fragment molecular orbital calculations, and found that all the intermediate states leading to the native structure have correctly arranged <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Mashimo2">[30]</xref>. Another support came from a recent simulation on G-DNAs by Šponer's group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003562-Stadlbauer1">[43]</xref>, where they concluded that for folding to a specific G-DNA topology in a single molecular event, the molecule must have an appropriate combination of <italic>syn/anti</italic> nucleotides, otherwise the likely result will be a misfolded structure. However, exceptions to the above pictures do exist according to our simulations. In the early folding intermediate-II and III, two nucleotides with wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations are observed although they form native pairs with the others (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The exception may be explained by the outer positions of the nucleotides in the tertiary structure and the associated lacking of additional supports from nearby nucleotides or bound ions. Consistent with this argument, when the G-DNA folds to the intermediates-IV and further to V, more and more stable base pairs form and no wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations are observed any more.</p>
<p>Caution should be given regarding the limitations of the present simulation. First, although the current simulation detected intermediates only having less seriously wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> patterns, mainly in the early folding stage and in the outer positioned nucleotides, it could not rule out the existence of other type of intermediates with most glycosidic bonds in wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations, since none of the replicas in BEMD was biased on the glycosidic bonds to enhance sampling on the relevant phase regions. Second, even if the existence of such intermediates could be ruled out by future computations, the <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientations would still play an important role by significantly retarding the folding rate, since the molecule has to explore different combinations of <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations in a much larger phase space to find the right bottle neck leading to the native states. Third, although the BEMD simulation was shown converged here, it should be noted that the convergence was subjected to the present setup of the applied CVs. In another word, the present simulation does not preclude that there is an orthogonal CV that samples intermediates not detected by the present setup. To finally confirm that the folding intermediates detected here are the only true intermediates would require significantly more expensive unbiased simulations and/or metadynamics with alternative and independent CVs. It is also worth mentioning that we had tested many different combinations of CVs and performed several times of BEMD simulations; the present four CVs were not chosen randomly. A much more large-scale unbiased simulation for the specific DNA is being prepared.</p>
<p>It is of particular interest to make a qualitatively comparison of the folding of quadruplexes with that of proteins. It seems that the former is more complex, since even for this small G-DNA of 24 nucleotides, four intermediate states have been identified. While in proteins, two-state folding is frequently observed for small globule proteins. Whether this is due to the particular topology of the quadruplex or the balance of interactions is not known yet. It is also interesting to characterize the main feature of the energy landscape of the G-quadruplexes and see if the energy funnel theory applies for these molecules. To this end, a topology-centered coarse-grained model of DNA quadruplex may be of help. The folding of quadruplexes is also complicated by the indispensable cooperation with metal ions, since the strong negative charges associated with the nucleotides have to be compensated by cations from solvents. According to our simulations, the metal ions progressively bind to the DNA as the quadruplex builds up, suggesting that the two process are cooperative. At last, the complexity is further increased by the involvement of the <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientations of the glycosidic bonds, which increase the searching space and may also trap the G-DNA in some local minima.</p>
<p>In summary, enabled by the combined power of the bias-exchange metadynamics and large-scale conventional MD simulations, we studied the folding process of a hybrid-1 type human telomeric DNA G-quadruplex. We obtained for the first time its folding free energy landscape and identified several intermediates. Further analysis of these intermediates showed that the structure formation and metal ion binding are cooperative and mutually supporting each other. The roles of the <italic>syn/anti</italic> reorientations in the folding process were also investigated. It was found that the nucleotides already taking their native positions usually have correct <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations. However, intermediates with wrong <italic>syn/anti</italic> configurations were also detected, particularly in the early folding stages. Based on the above results, we suggest a new atomistic folding picture for the G-DNA, as shown schematically in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003562-g006">Figure 6</xref> and described as follows. The G-DNA first forms a hairpin <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the 3′-terminal, on which the second G-repeat docks, accompanied by the trapping of the first <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion in the central channel. The result of the docking is a triplex. At this folding stage the first G-repeat is constrained nearby the triplex by both native and non-native interactions and fluctuating around the triplex. After the first G-repeat docks upon the triplex eventually, an incomplete quadruplex forms, and the reversal loop also basically forms at this stage. However, the second <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binding site in the central channel is yet to be occupied, and therefore the third G-tetrad is somewhat unstable. After another <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003562.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ion is trapped inside the channel, the whole quadruplex is strengthened and the folding is completed. We believe this is a more detailed and complete picture compared with previous ones, and it represents a step forward in understanding the folding of the hybrid-1 type G-DNA. The knowledge gained here may also provide insights into the structure formation processes of the other types of DNA G-quadruplexes.</p>

(E) The number of successfully exchanged events as a function of time for six replicas. The average exchange probabilities are 5.7%, 4.8%, 3.9%, 4.2%, 21.7%, 21.9%, respectively. The lower probabilities in the first four replicas are expected since the replicas have very different energies due to the different biases applied. The curves are almost linear as a function of time, suggesting that a steady exchange rate is maintained throughout the whole simulation.</p>
