<abstract>
<p>All animal cells use the motor cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein) to transport diverse cargo toward microtubule minus ends and to organize and position microtubule arrays such as the mitotic spindle. Cargo-specific adaptors engage with dynein to recruit and activate the motor, but the molecular mechanisms remain incompletely understood. Here, we use structural and dynamic nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis to demonstrate that the C-terminal region of human dynein light intermediate chain 1 (LIC1) is intrinsically disordered and contains two short conserved segments with helical propensity. NMR titration experiments reveal that the first helical segment (helix 1) constitutes the main interaction site for the adaptors Spindly (SPDL1), bicaudal D homolog 2 (BICD2), and Hook homolog 3 (HOOK3). In vitro binding assays show that helix 1, but not helix 2, is essential in both LIC1 and LIC2 for binding to SPDL1, BICD2, HOOK3, RAB-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP), RAB11 family-interacting protein 3 (RAB11FIP3), ninein (NIN), and trafficking kinesin-binding protein 1 (TRAK1). Helix 1 is sufficient to bind RILP, whereas other adaptors require additional segments preceding helix 1 for efficient binding. Point mutations in the C-terminal helix 1 of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> LIC, introduced by genome editing, severely affect development, locomotion, and life span of the animal and disrupt the distribution and transport kinetics of membrane cargo in axons of mechanosensory neurons, identical to what is observed when the entire LIC C-terminal region is deleted. Deletion of the C-terminal helix 2 delays dynein-dependent spindle positioning in the one-cell embryo but overall does not significantly perturb dynein function. We conclude that helix 1 in the intrinsically disordered region of LIC provides a conserved link between dynein and structurally diverse cargo adaptor families that is critical for dynein function in vivo.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The large size and complex organization of animal cells make the correct and efficient distribution of intracellular content a challenge. The solution is to use motor proteins, which harness energy from ATP hydrolysis to walk along actin filaments or microtubules, for directional transport of cargo. The multi-subunit motor cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein) is responsible for transport directed toward the minus ends of microtubules. An important question is how dynein is recruited to its diverse cargo, which includes organelles such as endosomes and mitochondria, proteins, and mRNA. In this study, we use nuclear magnetic resonance spectroscopy to show that the light intermediate chain (LIC) subunit of human dynein uses a short helix in its disordered C-terminal region to bind structurally distinct adaptor proteins that connect the motor to specific cargo. We then use genome editing in the animal model <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> to demonstrate the functional relevance of the C-terminal LIC helix for dynein-dependent cargo transport in neurons. Thus, dynein recruitment to cargo involves a highly conserved interaction between LIC and adaptor proteins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Microtubule-based cargo transport and force production are critical for a wide range of cellular and developmental processes. In animal cells, the 1.4-MDa complex cytoplasmic dynein 1 (dynein) is the major molecular motor with motility directed toward microtubule minus ends. Dynein-driven cargo transport is particularly crucial in highly polarized cells such as neurons. In axons, whose microtubule plus ends are uniformly oriented toward the axonal tip, dynein is responsible for the retrograde transport of diverse vesicle and organelle cargo toward the cell body. Mutations in dynein that alter axonal transport kinetics have been linked to a variety of nervous system disorders, including spinal muscular atrophy, motor neuron disease, Perry syndrome, and Charcot-Marie-Tooth 2 disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref002">2</xref>]. In addition to transporting cargo, dynein can exert pulling forces on microtubules when the motor is stably anchored at subcellular sites such as the cell cortex. A striking example of dynein-dependent force production occurs during mitosis, when cortically localized dynein pulls on astral microtubules to position and orient the bipolar spindle, which in turn defines the axis along which the cell will divide. Dynein's functional versatility implies tight regulation of localization and motor activity, the molecular basis of which has only recently begun to be understood.</p>
<p>Dynein is a 12-subunit complex consisting of a dimerized heavy chain (HC) with a C-terminal motor domain and two copies each of five accessory chains that bind along the HC N-terminal tail: dynein intermediate chain (IC), light intermediate chain (LIC), and three types of light chain (LC). In vivo, dynein function requires the cofactor dynactin, which is itself a 1.1-MDa complex built around a short filament of actin-related protein 1 (ARP1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref003">3</xref>]. In recent years, a number of coiled-coil proteins, referred to as activating adaptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref004">4</xref>], have been shown to recruit dynein to cargo while simultaneously promoting the association of dynein with dynactin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref006">6</xref>]. Dynein, dynactin, and the N-terminal coiled-coil region of activating adaptors form a stable three-way assembly capable of highly processive motility in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref008">8</xref>], whereas the C-terminal region of adaptors links to cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref004">4</xref>]. Cryo–electron microscopy (EM) studies with the adaptors bicaudal D homolog 2 (BICD2), BICD-related protein 1 (BICDR1), and Hook homolog 3 (HOOK3) have revealed the molecular arrangement within the dynein-dynactin-adaptor assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref011">11</xref>]: the adaptor coiled-coil region binds along the length of the dynactin ARP1 filament with the adaptor N terminus located at the filament's barbed end, and the N-terminal tail of dynein HC makes contact with both the ARP1 filament and the coiled-coil region of the adaptor.</p>
<p>An additional contact between dynein and adaptors involves the C-terminal region of the LIC subunit (LIC-C) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref013">13</xref>]. Whereas the highly conserved N-terminal GTPase-like domain of LIC binds tightly to the HC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref014">14</xref>], the LIC-C sequence is more divergent and predicted to be disordered. Vertebrates possess two genes for LIC (LIC1 and LIC2), which may specify distinct dynein populations. Adaptors known to bind LIC1-C include BICD2 and Spindly (SPDL1), which are likely related [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref016">16</xref>], as well as the structurally distinct adaptors HOOK3, RAB11 family-interacting protein 3 (RAB11FIP3; hereafter referred to as FIP3), and RAB-interacting lysosomal protein (RILP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref017">17</xref>]. Whether LIC2-C also interacts with these adaptors has not been examined. SPDL1/BICD2 and HOOK3 bind to LIC1-C through a motif in their first coiled-coil segment (the CC1 box) and the N-terminal Hook domain, respectively, and point mutations in these adaptors that abrogate binding to LIC1-C compromise the formation of the dynein-dynactin-adaptor assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref018">18</xref>]. Consequently, HOOK3 mutants that fail to bind LIC1-C do not support processive dynein runs in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref017">17</xref>]. A mutation in the CC1 box of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> BicD causes a hypomorphic loss-of-function phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref019">19</xref>], indicating that the BicD-LIC interaction is functionally relevant in vivo. Numerous other loss-of-function studies have implicated LIC in many dynein-dependent processes, including mitosis and retrograde cargo transport in axons. However, the extent to which LIC loss-of-function phenotypes reflect an important role for LIC-C is less clear, as the dynein complex becomes destabilized when LIC is absent in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Aspergillus nidulans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref021">21</xref>], as well as in LIC1-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref022">22</xref>]. Indeed, biochemical analysis indicates that the N-terminal LIC domain plays an important structural role within the dynein complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref023">23</xref>]. Thus, although LIC is clearly essential for dynein function in vivo, the specific contributions of LIC-C remain to be determined.</p>
<p>Here, we dissect the interaction between LIC-C and dynein adaptors in vitro and in the animal model <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. Nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) analysis shows that human LIC1-C is intrinsically disordered and possesses two short segments with helical propensity. In agreement with a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref013">13</xref>], we show that helix 1 of LIC1-C is essential for binding to BICD2, SPDL1, and HOOK3, and we extend this finding to the adaptors FIP3, RILP, ninein (NIN), and trafficking kinesin-binding protein 1 (TRAK1), as well as to LIC2-C. Finally, we show that LIC-C mutants generated by genome editing in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> have major defects in postembryonic cell division and retrograde axonal cargo transport, demonstrating the crucial importance of LIC-C helix 1 for dynein function in vivo.</p>

<p>To assess residual secondary structure in LIC1-C, we computed the secondary structure propensity (SSP) score developed by Forman-Kay and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref024">24</xref>]. The method combines different backbone chemical shifts into a single residue–specific SSP score. The results closely matched those obtained from the GOR4 secondary structure prediction program [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref025">25</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s013">S1 Data</xref>). An SSP score of +1 and −1 indicates a fully formed α helix and β sheet, respectively. The SSP scores for LIC1-C residues with predicted α-helical propensity (residues 444–454 and 497–504) were positive values up to 0.35. However, assuming a linear relationship between the score and the population, helical structure was only transiently sampled at about 20%. These two segments of LIC1-C, which are highly conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), will be referred to as helix 1 and helix 2, respectively. The remaining segments scored mostly slightly negative SSP values and GOR4 values around zero, indicating complete structural disorder (note that β sheet and random coil have both extended secondary structure with similar scores in practice).</p>
<p>To characterize the dynamic properties of LIC1-C, we performed <sup>15</sup>N NMR relaxation measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g001">Fig 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). The relaxation rates are sensitive probes of the amplitudes and timescales of residue-specific structural fluctuations. The longitudinal relaxation rates <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub>, which report on motion faster than nanoseconds, were 1.2 s<sup>−1</sup> on average. Although such a value is not compatible with a globular protein, it is indicative of an intrinsically disordered protein that undergoes extensive local reorientation. Residues 441–456 and 492–508 had larger <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> values, which are suggestive of increased structural order of the residues with α-helical propensity. The residues between helices 1 and 2 had consistently lower-than-average <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> values, indicating a highly flexible interhelical linker.</p>
<p>The fast dynamics inferred from <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> measurements reduce the transverse relaxation rates <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> typically observed for folded proteins, but in addition, potential motion slower than nanoseconds might increase them. Whereas the measured <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> average of 4.7 s<sup>−1</sup> is again only reconcilable with high structural disorder, the helical regions showed larger values in line with partial helix formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Since the <italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> values suggest less flexibility in the helices on the fast timescale, it is likely that the increased <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub> values originate also exclusively from reduced fast-motion amplitudes. In support of this, relaxation dispersion experiments did not indicate any slow micro-millisecond dynamics. The segment with the smallest values was again the interhelical linker. Since slow motion is absent throughout the protein, the ratio <italic>R</italic><sub>2</sub>/<italic>R</italic><sub>1</sub> allowed extraction of an effective residue-specific reorientational tumbling time that is independent of the motional amplitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref026">26</xref>]. The average tumbling time was 4.5 ns, which is much smaller than a typical value expected for a folded protein consisting of approximately 140 residues.</p>
<p>The <sup>1</sup>H-<sup>15</sup>N nuclear Overhauser enhancement (NOE) is another probe of the amplitudes of motions taking place on the sub-nanosecond timescale (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). The values of nearly all residues fall below 0.5, which is again indicative of structural disorder with large amplitudes. In support of the findings described above, the largest values were typically found for the helix 1 and 2 segments, which suggests higher structural order than the other regions.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the relaxation data show that LIC1-C is intrinsically disordered with large amplitudes of motions faster than nanoseconds. In helix 1 and 2, the amplitudes are smaller and the local reorientation slower but still on the fast timescale. These results support the highly transient character of the helices derived from the SSP score.</p>
<p>For independent confirmation of the residual helical propensity in LIC1-C, we collected circular dichroism (CD) spectra of LIC1-C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Whereas fully formed α-helical proteins show prominent negative bands at 222 and 208 nm and a positive band at 193 nm, disordered proteins have very low ellipticity above 210 nm and negative bands near 195 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref027">27</xref>]. The spectrum of LIC1-C corresponded largely to structural disorder. However, there were negative values at 208 nm and a negative shoulder at 222 nm. These features are indicative of residual helical structure, in agreement with our findings from NMR spectroscopy. The helical content was maintained over a large temperature range (25, 37, 50, 60, and 70°C), similar to previous reports on other intrinsically disordered proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref028">28</xref>].</p>

<title>The C-terminal helix 1 in LIC1 is the main binding site for SPDL1, BICD2, and HOOK3</title>
<p>To identify adaptor binding sites in LIC1-C, we recorded <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra of LIC1-C bound to SPDL1(2–359), BICD2(2–422), and HOOK3(2–239) using molar ratios of 1:0, 1:0.5, and 1:1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g002">Fig 2A, 2B, 2C and 2D</xref>). The spectra obtained from each titration series revealed similar modes of interaction for the three adaptors. Rather than chemical shifts being perturbed, many peaks were significantly attenuated because of binding. This indicates decrease in the local motion of the bound residues; increase of the hydrodynamic radius of the entire complex, resulting in increase in the effective tumbling time; and/or contributions from conformational and chemical exchange [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref029">29</xref>]. Inspection of the peak height ratios between bound and free LIC1-C showed that the residues affected were mainly located in helix 1 and to a lesser extent in helix 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g002">2C and 2D</xref>).

<p>To assess binding affinities between LIC1-C and adaptors, we conducted surface plasmon resonance (SPR) experiments in which LIC1-C::6xHis was immobilized on a nitrilotriacetic acid (NTA) chip. We obtained a <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> of 5.7 ± 1.9 μM for the interaction between LIC1(388–523) and SPDL1(2–359) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). LIC1(388–471), which contains helix 1 but not helix 2, bound to SPDL1(2–359) with the same affinity as LIC1(388–523) (5.40 ± 0.25 μM). Similarly, LIC1(388–523) and LIC1(388–471) bound to BICD2(2–422) with comparable affinity (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> of 1.07 ± 0.05 μM and 0.7 ± 0.01 μM, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). We also measured binding to fluorescently labeled LIC1(388–523) in microscale thermophoresis (MST) experiments. We obtained <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> values of 13.1 ± 0.4 μM and 6.0 ± 1.3 μM for the interaction with SPDL1(2–359) and BICD2(2–422), respectively, which is in reasonable agreement with the SPR analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). From SPR and MST experiments with LIC1(388–523) and HOOK3(2–239), we obtained <italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> values of 1.9 ± 0.4 μM and 4.0 ± 0.8 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s005">S5C Fig</xref>), which are similar to those obtained with BICD2(2–422). We conclude that SPDL1, BICD2, and HOOK3 bind to LIC1-C with an affinity in the single-digit micromolar range and that an LIC1-C fragment comprising residues 388–471 is sufficient for binding. These results are in agreement with the NMR titration experiments, which showed the most pronounced intensity quenching for helix 1 residues.</p>

<title>The C-terminal helix 1 in LIC1 and LIC2 is essential for binding to structurally diverse adaptors</title>
<p>NMR spectroscopy and SPR analysis strongly suggested that helix 1 in LIC1-C is the major binding site for BICD2, SPDL1, and HOOK3. To directly test whether helix 1 is important for adaptor binding, we performed in vitro pull-down experiments using purified glutathione S-transferase (GST)-tagged versions of LIC1-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>) and LIC2-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>) as bait. In addition to BICD2(2–422), SPDL1(2–359), and HOOK3(2–552), we purified full-length versions of RILP (residues 1–401) and FIP3 (residues 2–756), as well as an N-terminal fragment of NIN (residues 1–693) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).

Deleting helix 1 in LIC1-C (Δ440–455), or mutating either the two phenylalanines or the two leucines in helix 1 to alanine (F447A/F448A and L451A/L452A) abrogated binding between LIC1-C and all six adaptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).

<title>Helix 1 is sufficient for binding to RILP, but other adaptors require additional contacts with LIC1-C</title>
<p>Next, we asked whether helix 1 of LIC1-C (residues 440–455) was sufficient to bind adaptors. In GST pull-down experiments, RILP bound robustly to LIC1(388–523) and LIC1(440–455) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3A, 3B and 3E</xref>). SPR experiments in which LIC1-C was immobilized through its N-terminal GST tag confirmed that RILP binds LIC1(440–455) with similar affinity as LIC1(388–523) (<italic>K</italic><sub><italic>D</italic></sub> of 1.67 ± 0.21 and 1.18 ± 0.14 μM, respectively; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). We conclude that helix 1 of LIC1-C is sufficient for RILP binding. By contrast, none of the other five adaptors were detected in GST pull-downs with LIC1-C helix 1, suggesting that efficient binding requires additional segments in LIC1-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).</p>
<p>NMR spectroscopy suggested that, in addition to helix 1, residues N-terminal to helix 1, as well as residues in helix 2, also make contact with adaptors. To investigate the contribution of these sites to adaptor binding, we first truncated LIC1(388–471) from its N terminus to generate progressively smaller fragments (residues 402–471, 414–471, 424–471, and 440–471), all of which retained helix 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). SPDL1(2–359), BICD2(2–422), HOOK3(2–552), FIP3(2–756), and NIN(1–693) showed reduced binding to LIC1-C with decreasing fragment size, whereas RILP bound equally well to all LIC1-C fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Thus, for most adaptors, efficient binding to LIC1-C requires residues located N-terminally of helix 1. To assess the contribution of helix 2, we generated a fragment from the beginning of helix 1 until the end of LIC1-C (residues 440–523). Although SPDL1(2–359), BICD2(2–422), and HOOK3(2–552) were not detected in pull-downs using LIC1(440–455), they bound weakly to LIC1(440–523), potentially reflecting a modest contribution of helix 2 to the interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Overall, our binding experiments with purified components demonstrate that helix 1 of LIC-C is essential for the interaction with adaptors but suggest that most adaptors also need to make additional contacts with the flexible LIC-C scaffold for efficient binding. Specifically, residues preceding helix 1 appear to make a significant contribution. The exception is RILP, for which LIC-C helix 1 on its own is sufficient for binding.</p>

<title>Point mutations in the C-terminal helix 1 of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> LIC cause severe developmental defects, impair locomotion, and shorten life span</title>
<p>To determine whether helix 1 of LIC-C contributes to dynein function in vivo, we turned to the animal model <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, which expresses a single dynein LIC, <italic>dli-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref030">30</xref>]. Just as in other LIC orthologs, the C-terminal helix 1 is highly conserved in DLI-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)–mediated genome editing to mutate either the two phenylalanines or the two leucines in helix 1 to alanine (F392A/F393A and L396A/L397A), in analogy to the human LIC-C mutations we characterized in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). For comparison, we also deleted the entire DLI-1 C-terminal region (Δ369–443). For all three <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants, homozygous offspring from heterozygous mothers developed to adulthood but were sterile, suggesting that the C-terminal region of DLI-1, and helix 1 in particular, is essential for dynein function in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Because RNA interference (RNAi)-mediated depletion of DLI-1 showed that DLI-1 is required for the stability of dynein HC 1 (DHC-1; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), we addressed the possibility that the phenotype of our <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants was a consequence of reduced DHC-1 levels. Immunoblotting of homozygous adults with an antibody against DHC-1 demonstrated that this was not the case. On the contrary, DHC-1 levels appeared slightly increased in all three <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). This indicates that the C-terminal DLI-1 mutants do not interfere with the binding of the N-terminal GTPase-like domain to DHC-1.</p>

<p>Differential interference contrast imaging revealed severe morphological defects in day 1 adults homozygous for the <italic>dli-1</italic> mutations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5D, 5E and 5F</xref>). All three <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants had a slightly dumpy body with a protruding vulva and a highly disorganized and underdeveloped gonad (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>), which is indicative of problems with postembryonic cell divisions. Furthermore, the prevalence of vacuoles suggested widespread necrotic-like cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Consistent with this, <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants exhibited severe defects in locomotion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5G</xref>), which was assessed by determining the body bending frequency in liquid medium (wild type, 1.50 ± 0.02 Hz; Δ369–443, 0.50 ± 0.03 Hz; F392A/F393A, 0.46 ± 0.04 Hz; L396A/L397A, 0.50 ± 0.03 Hz). <italic>Dli-1</italic> mutants had a significantly shorter life span compared to wild-type animals (wild type, 18.3 ± 0.7 d; Δ369–443, 13.7 ± 0.4 d; F392A/F393A, 12.3 ± 0.5 d; L396A/L397A, 13.0 ± 0.5 d) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g005">Fig 5H</xref>). None of the <italic>dli-1</italic> mutant animals lived beyond 24 d, whereas 27% of wild-type animals did. We conclude that deletion of the DLI-1 C-terminal disordered region and point mutations in the conserved helix 1 cause similar defects in development, locomotion, and life span. These phenotypes are reminiscent of those reported for other dynein mutants, including null mutants of <italic>dli-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref031">31</xref>].</p>

<title>Point mutations in the C-terminal helix 1 of DLI-1 cause accumulation of membrane cargo at nerve endings of mechanosensory neurons and perturb retrograde axonal transport</title>
<p>Next, we sought to assess the impact of the C-terminal <italic>dli-1</italic> mutations on dynein-dependent cargo transport. We chose to examine the distribution and transport kinetics of membrane cargo in axons of touch receptor neurons, which are mechanosensory neurons whose processes extend along the length of the animal just underneath its cuticle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Axonal microtubules in touch receptor neurons are polarized with their plus ends oriented toward the axonal tip, and dynein is therefore responsible for retrograde transport of cargo toward the cell body [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref032">32</xref>].

This allowed simultaneous visualization of early endosomes (mKate2), a cargo of dynein, and neuronal morphology (GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In contrast to control day 1 adults, all three <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants exhibited a pronounced misaccumulation of mKate2::RAB-5 at the axonal tips and nerve ring synapses of anterior lateral mechanosensory (ALM) and anterior ventral mechanosensory (AVM) neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g006">Fig 6B, 6C, 6D and 6E</xref>).

<p>To determine how <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants affect the kinetics of axonal transport, we imaged mKate2::RAB-5-labeled early endosomes at high temporal resolution in an axonal segment close to the cell body of ALM neurons at the larval L4 stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g006">Fig 6A and 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s009">S1 Movie</xref>). Quantitative analysis of kymographs revealed that the three <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants had near-identical defects in axonal transport. The fraction of particles moving in the retrograde direction was reduced significantly, with a corresponding increase in the fraction of stationary particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Analysis of individual runs showed that particles spent less time in retrograde motion and paused more frequently and for longer periods of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). Particles also had a decreased run length and moved at reduced speed, especially in the retrograde direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g006">Fig 6H and 6I</xref>). Overall, this analysis revealed that all three <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants strongly impaired retrograde axonal transport of early endosomes, consistent with compromised dynein function.</p>
<p>We also examined the axonal distribution of two additional types of dynein cargo, each labeled with a marker expressed from a single-copy transgene: synaptic vesicles (SNB-1 [synaptobrevin 1]::mKate2) and mitochondria (TOMM-20 [translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 20][1–54]::mKate2). Because the three <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants had identical defects in the distribution and transport kinetics of mKate2::RAB-5, we restricted our analysis to the <italic>dli-1(L396A/L397A)</italic> mutant. We found that <italic>dli-1(L396A/L397A)</italic> animals misaccumulated SNB-1::mKate2 at axonal tips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s008">S8B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s008">S8C and S8D Fig</xref>), similar to the results of a prior study that examined the distribution of SNB-1::GFP in the null mutant <italic>dli-1(js351)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>When examining the distribution of TOMM-20(1–54)::mKate2 particles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g007">Fig 7A</xref>), we found that axons of ALM neurons contained an average of 21 ± 1 mitochondria in control day 1 adults, corresponding to a density of 5.6 mitochondria per 100 μm, and that mitochondria were evenly distributed along axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g007">Fig 7B, 7C, 7D and 7E</xref>). These findings are consistent with prior reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref035">35</xref>]. Mitochondria remained evenly distributed in ALM axons in <italic>dli-1(L396A/L397A)</italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). However, the average number of axonal mitochondria increased to 33 ± 1, corresponding to a density of 9 mitochondria per 100 μm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Close inspection of mitochondrial morphology suggested that the increase was primarily due to an excess of small TOMM-20(1–54)::mKate2 puncta, which may represent fragmented mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Thus, the <italic>dli-1(L396A/L397A)</italic> mutation does not result in distribution bias of mitochondria along the axon but appears to promote mitochondrial fission. Similar results were obtained for the <italic>dli-1(Δ369–443)</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g007">Fig 7C, 7D and 7E</xref>).

<p>Given the modest impact of the <italic>dli-1(L396A/L397A)</italic> mutation on mitochondrial transport, we asked whether the mitochondrial adaptor TRAK1, which contains a CC1 box similar to SPDL1 and BICD2, binds LIC1. GST pull-downs with purified human proteins showed that maltose-binding protein (MBP)::TRAK1(103–187), which corresponds to the first coiled-coil segment, was able to bind GST::LIC1(388–523), albeit weakly and only when artificially dimerized using a general control nondepressible 4 (GCN4) sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g007">Fig 7H and 7I</xref>).

<p>Just like helix 1, helix 2 in LIC-C shows high sequence conservation, including in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> (residues 420–428; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g008">Fig 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000100.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). To assess the role of helix 2 in vivo, we used genome editing to generate animals that express DLI-1 without its C-terminal 30 residues (Δ414–443). This truncated version of DLI-1 retains helix 1 (residues 388–400) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). In contrast to the helix 1 point mutants, homozygous <italic>dli-1(</italic>Δ<italic>414–443)</italic> animals were fully viable and fertile (embryonic viability 98.4% ± 0.6% and 97.3% ± 0.7% for wild type [&gt;300 progeny, 12 mothers] and mutant [&gt;300 progeny, 14 mothers], respectively). Furthermore, we observed no increase in mKate2::RAB-5 signal at axonal tips of touch receptor neurons, indicating that dynein-dependent transport of early endosomes was not significantly affected in this mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g008">Fig 8B, 8C and 8D</xref>). Because homozygous <italic>dli-1(</italic>Δ<italic>414–443)</italic> animals produced progeny, we were able to examine the first mitotic division of embryos coexpressing GFP::β-tubulin and mCherry::histone H2B, which mark microtubules and chromosomes, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). During mitosis, dynein-dependent pulling on centrosome-nucleated microtubules is essential for the separation and positioning of centrosomes, which form the spindle poles after nuclear envelope breakdown (NEBD). At the time of NEBD in control animals, centrosomes were fully separated and the centrosome–centrosome axis was oriented approximately parallel to the anterior–posterior axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000100.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>). In <italic>dli-1(</italic>Δ<italic>414–443)</italic> embryos, centrosomes separated normally, but the centrosome–centrosome axis was frequently severely tilted relative to the anterior–posterior axis (angle &gt; 45° in 7 out of 21 mutant embryos versus 0 out of 13 controls), resulting in misoriented spindles. Despite initial misorientation, spindles ultimately correctly aligned with the anterior–posterior axis, and chromosome segregation completed without defects. The delay in spindle orientation indicates a subtle impairment of dynein-dependent pulling forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref037">37</xref>].

<p>We conclude that helix 2 of the DLI-1 C-terminal region makes a modest contribution to dynein-dependent pulling forces during mitosis but overall plays a minor role in vivo compared to helix 1, which is critical for dynein function. These results are consistent with our biochemical characterization of human LIC-C in vitro, which shows that helix 1, but not helix 2, is essential for the interaction between LIC-C and cargo adaptors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>How dynein achieves specificity for cargo is a key question underlying the functional versatility of the motor. Studies over the past few years have revealed that the N-terminal region of cargo adaptor proteins helps bring together the motor with its essential cofactor dynactin and that multiple distinct protein–protein interactions participate in the assembly of a processive dynein-dynactin-adaptor transport machine. Here, we dissected the structural determinants and the functional relevance of the interaction between the C-terminal region of the dynein LIC subunit and cargo adaptors. We present high-resolution molecular evidence that LIC-C is disordered and that a conserved segment with helical propensity, helix 1, is the main binding site for seven adaptors that differ in structure and cargo specificity. Our results agree with recent work that identified LIC1-C helix 1 as the critical structural element for the interaction with HOOK1/3, SPDL1, and BICD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref013">13</xref>], and we extend these findings to RILP, NIN, FIP3, and TRAK1. The highly conserved phenylalanines and leucines of the amphipathic helix 1 are essential for the interaction, which occurs with single-digit micromolar affinity for SPDL1, BICD2, HOOK3, and RILP, suggesting a similar binding mechanism. NMR spectroscopy analysis shows that helix 1 is transient. The presence of transiently sampled secondary elements in intrinsically disordered proteins is common and may facilitate the transition to more rigid states upon binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref041">41</xref>]. The observed signal quenching upon binding to adaptors is unlikely to be caused entirely by an increased local tumbling time. Instead, micro-millisecond conformational exchange between various states of the helical elements or binding kinetics contribute significantly to the quenching. Both mechanisms suggest residual structural disorder. Indeed, various examples of disordered proteins that maintain partial disorder during interaction with other proteins have recently been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref044">44</xref>]. A prior study used X-ray crystallography to show that LIC1-C helix 1 inserts into a hydrophobic cleft on HOOK3(1–160) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref013">13</xref>]. An analogous hydrophobic cleft is likely formed by the CC1 box, the LIC1-C binding region in SPDL1 and BICD2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref016">16</xref>]. CC1 boxes are also present in other adaptors whose N-terminal regions are structurally similar to SPDL1 and BICD2, such as HAP1 and TRAK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref045">45</xref>]. Consistent with this, we show that the first coiled-coil segment of TRAK1 interacts with LIC1-C in a helix 1-dependent manner. RILP, NIN, and FIP3 contain neither a Hook domain nor a CC1 box. The structural element that accommodates the LIC-C helix 1 in these adaptors remains to be identified.</p>
<p>LIC1-C helix 1 is essential for adaptor binding, but we find that helix 1 on its own—i.e., LIC1(440–455)—is not sufficient for efficient binding to 5 out of 6 adaptors tested, RILP being the exception. Pull-down assays with LIC1-C truncations show that segments N-terminal to helix 1 contribute to adaptor binding. LIC1-C binding to SPDL1, FIP3, and NIN appears to be particularly sensitive to N-terminal LIC1-C truncations, as we find that LIC1(424–471) has markedly reduced affinity relative to LIC1(388–471). This is in agreement with NMR analysis, which indicates that residues 418–421 participate in the interaction with SPDL1. NMR analysis also indicates that LIC1-C helix 2 participates in the interaction with adaptors, but in vitro binding experiments show that the contribution of helix 2 to the overall binding affinity is relatively minor.</p>
<p>Vertebrates possess two LIC paralogs that differ significantly in their C-terminal region. Prior studies in cultured cells suggest that there is functional redundancy among LIC1 and LIC2 but also hint at functional specialization in dynein-dependent cell division processes and membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref053">53</xref>]. One attractive possibility is that the C-terminal regions of LIC1 and LIC2 discriminate between adaptors. Our results show that LIC1 and LIC2 use the same helix 1–based mechanism for adaptor binding, and we did not detect any striking differences in the ability of the two C-terminal regions to interact with our set of six adaptors. Nevertheless, it is plausible that LIC1 and LIC2 exhibit subtle preferences for specific adaptors. For example, we find that NIN binds slightly better to LIC2 than LIC1. Posttranslational modifications could possibly further modulate the affinity for adaptors in an isoform-specific manner.</p>
<p>Previous work in vitro showed that the dynein-dynactin-adaptor assembly fails to form in HOOK3 and SPDL1 mutants that cannot bind to LIC1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref017">17</xref>] and that addition of excess LIC1-C helix 1 inhibits processive movement mediated by HOOK3 or BICD2 fragments in motility assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref013">13</xref>]. Here, we present direct evidence that LIC-C helix 1 is important for dynein function in vivo. Like other invertebrates, the nematode <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> expresses only one LIC isoform, which facilitates the identification of functionally critical regions. In all assays, the outcome of mutating the two conserved phenylalanines or leucines in the C-terminal helix 1 of DLI-1 is identical to that of deleting the entire C-terminal region. Unlike DLI-1 depletions, the phenotype of the C-terminal DLI-1 mutations cannot be attributed to destabilization of DHC-1 and therefore likely reflects defective adaptor binding. On the animal level, sterility and other developmental defects suggest failure of postembryonic cell division, similar to what was described for <italic>dli-1</italic> null mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref031">31</xref>]. We show on the cellular level that the C-terminal DLI-1 mutations disrupt the distribution of early endosomes and presynaptic vesicles in axons of touch receptor neurons. Since we find that axonal length is normal in day 1 adults of <italic>dli-1(L396A/L397A)</italic> and <italic>dli-1(</italic>Δ<italic>369–443)</italic> mutants, this is unlikely to be an indirect consequence of a developmental defect. Instead, the misaccumulation at the axonal tip is suggestive of impaired retrograde transport by dynein, as previously described for other dynein mutants, including the <italic>dli-1</italic> null mutant <italic>js351</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref031">31</xref>]. Consistent with this, we show that the frequency, velocity, and run length of early endosome movement is significantly decreased in our <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants, with a predominant effect on retrograde movement. Neurodegeneration (i.e., axon beading) starts to become evident in <italic>dli-1</italic> mutant day 1 adults and likely contributes to the animals' severe locomotory deficit and shortened life span.</p>
<p>The residual retrograde movement of early endosomes in axons of <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants could indicate that dynein retains a limited ability to form processive dynein-dynactin-adaptor complexes without the interaction between DLI-1 and adaptors. This may also explain the modest effect of <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants on mitochondrial transport. However, it is difficult to rule out that a small fraction of wild-type maternal DLI-1, passed on from the heterozygous mother to homozygous mutant progeny, could persist in touch receptor neurons at the L4 stage and promote residual dynein activity. Nevertheless, the observation that <italic>dli-1</italic> mutants have a more pronounced effect on early endosomes and synaptic vesicles than on mitochondria indicates that DLI-1 binding to adaptors may not be equally important for all cargo transport.</p>
<p>In contrast to the point mutants in the DLI-1 C-terminal helix 1, there are no obvious developmental defects in animals expressing the DLI-1(Δ414–443) mutant that lacks the C-terminal helix 2, and mKate2::RAB-5 is not misaccumulated at the axonal tip of touch receptor neurons in this mutant. We have not examined neuronal cargo transport kinetics, but given that <italic>dli-1(</italic>Δ<italic>414–443)</italic> animals are healthy and propagate normally, any defects are unlikely to be substantial. We do, however, observe a delay in mitotic spindle positioning in one-cell <italic>dli-1(</italic>ΔΔ<italic>414–443)</italic> embryos. The mild phenotype contrasts with the failure of spindle assembly observed in one-cell embryos after DLI-1 depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref030">30</xref>]. Furthermore, the mitotic defects of <italic>dli-1(</italic>Δ<italic>414–443)</italic> embryos are not enhanced by a null allele of the dynein cofactor <italic>nud-2</italic>, which partially compromises dynein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref038">38</xref>]. Thus, analysis in vivo and in vitro indicates that LIC-C helix 2, despite its high sequence conservation, makes a relatively modest contribution to dynein function compared to helix 1.</p>
<p>Together with the work of Lee and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref013">13</xref>], our study establishes the molecular mechanism used by LIC to interact with structurally diverse cargo adaptors. An interesting open question is whether LIC-C could have additional binding partners besides adaptors. Two recent cryo-EM studies revealed that two dyneins can be recruited by a single dynactin-adaptor complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref011">11</xref>]. In one of the structures, an extra density, most likely corresponding to LIC-C of the first dynein, packs against the N-terminal coiled-coil of BICDR1 while simultaneously contacting one of the HCs of the second dynein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref010">10</xref>]. It is tempting to speculate that this interaction between LIC-C and HC facilitates the incorporation of a second dynein into dynein-dynactin-adaptor assemblies.</p>

The spectral widths were 14,045 Hz (<sup>1</sup>H), 3,200 Hz (<sup>15</sup>N), 3,770 Hz (C = O), and 15,835 Hz (Cα/Cβ); the interscan delay was 1.7 s; and the number of scans was 16 for all experiments. The NUS-acquired data were reconstructed using the hmsIST software [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000100.ref056">56</xref>]. Zero-filling was achieved by addition of 256 points in both indirect dimensions. A solvent subtraction function was applied in the direct dimension.

<p>Because of high sequence redundancy and extensive peak overlap, we used a “divide-and-conquer” approach for chemical shift assignment. We measured and overlaid <sup>15</sup>N-<sup>1</sup>H HSQC spectra for two smaller LIC1 constructs, 388–471 and 472–523, with 388–523 to facilitate the verification of assignment.

<title>SPR</title>
<p>SPR analysis with SPDL1, BICD2, and HOOK3 fragments was conducted with a Biacore 3000 system. His-tagged LIC1(388–523) and LIC1(388–471) constructs (ligand) were immobilized on three different flow cells (FC1–3) on an NTA sensor chip at densities of 200–300 RU, whereas the fourth flow cell (FC4) was spared for blank sensogram measurement. Concentrated stocks of Strep-tagged SPDL1(2–359), BICD2(2–422), and HOOK3(2–239) (analyte) were dialyzed exhaustively against HBS-P flow buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 0.005% [v/v] surfactant P<sub>20</sub> [pH 7.4]). The background-blank sensogram was subtracted from sensograms measured with immobilized ligands. Injections for each analyte concentration were performed in triplicate. Data processing was done on Biacore evaluation software.</p>
<p>SPR analysis with RILP::Strep-tag II was performed using a Biacore X100 system equipped with a CM5 sensor chip (GE Healthcare). Anti-GST antibody was immobilized using amine-coupling chemistry using the Amine Coupling Kit (GE Healthcare) and the GST Capture Kit (GE Healthcare) according to manufacturer's instructions. The surfaces of flow cells 1 and 2 were activated for 7 min with a 1:1 mixture of 0.1 M N-hydroxysuccinimide and 0.4 M 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide at a flow rate of 5 μL/min. Anti-GST antibody at a concentration of 30 μg/mL in 10 mM sodium acetate (pH 5.0) was immobilized at a density of 7,500 RU on flow cells 1 and 2. Surfaces were blocked with a 7-min injection of 1 M ethanolamine (pH 8.0). Anti-GST antibody high-affinity sites were blocked with 3 cycles of a 3-min injection of recombinant GST at 5 μg/mL in running buffer (10 mM HEPES, 150 mM NaCl, 3 mM EDTA, 0.05% surfactant P<sub>20</sub> [pH 7.4]) followed by a 2-min injection of regeneration solution (10 mM glycine-HCl [pH 2.1]). To collect kinetic binding data, at the beginning of each cycle, GST::LIC1(388–523)::6xHis or GST::LIC1(440–455)::6His in running buffer (ligand) was injected over flow cell 2 at a density of 720–530 and 550–460 RU, respectively. Flow cell 1 was injected with GST::6xHis at a density of 575–430 RU to serve as a reference surface. RILP::Strep-tag II (analyte) was injected in running buffer over the two flow cells at concentrations of 50, 11, 4.5, 1.8, and 0.3 μM at a flow rate of 30 μL/min and a temperature of 25°C. The complex was allowed to associate and dissociate for 120 and 600 s, respectively. Surfaces were regenerated with two 2-min injections of regeneration solution. Three independent runs were performed for each condition. The data were fit to a 1:1 interaction model using the evaluation module of the Biacore X100 software, version 2.0.1 (GE Healthcare).</p>

Then, 10 nM of labeled LIC1(388–523)::6xHis and 16 two-fold dilution series of the adaptor were loaded into 16 standard capillaries (NanoTemper Technologies) (SPDL1[2–359]::Strep-tag II highest concentration 42.5 μM; BICD2[2–422]::Strep-tag II highest concentration 36.5 μM; HOOK3[2–239]::Strep-tag II highest concentration 70 μM). We observed sigmoidal behavior of the fluorescence level over time, which allowed characterization of the interactions. Raw data were analyzed using the NanoTemper software (MO affinity analysis v 2.2.7). The signal-to-noise ratios for SPDL1(2–359)::Strep-tag II, BICD2(2–422)::Strep-tag II, and HOOK3(2–239)::Strep-tag II were 18.8, 22.1, and 7.1, respectively.</p>

The region was then expanded by a few pixels along the length of the axonal segment. The difference in integrated fluorescence intensity between the outer and inner region was used to define the integrated background intensity after normalization to the area of the inner region. The final integrated intensity of mKate2 signal at the axonal tip was then calculated by subtracting the integrated background intensity from the integrated intensity of the inner region.
