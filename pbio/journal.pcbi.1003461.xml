<abstract>
<p>Apoptosis is a tightly controlled process in mammalian cells. It is important for embryogenesis, tissue homoeostasis, and cancer treatment. Apoptosis not only induces cell death, but also leads to the release of signals that promote rapid proliferation of surrounding cells through the Phoenix Rising (PR) pathway. To quantitatively understand the kinetics of interactions of different molecules in this pathway, we developed a mathematical model to simulate the effects of various changes in the PR pathway on the secretion of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a key factor for promoting cell proliferation. These changes include activation of caspase 3 (C3), caspase 7 (C7), and nuclear factor κB (NFκB). In addition, we simulated the effects of cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibition and C3 knockout on the level of secreted PGE2. The model predictions on PGE2 in MEF and 4T1 cells at 48 hours after 10-Gray radiation were quantitatively consistent with the experimental data in the literature. Compared to C7, the model predicted that C3 activation was more critical for PGE2 production. The model also predicted that PGE2 production could be significantly reduced when COX2 expression was blocked via either NFκB inactivation or treatment of cells with exogenous COX2 inhibitors, which led to a decrease in the rate of conversion from arachidonic acid to prostaglandin H2 in the PR pathway. In conclusion, the mathematical model developed in this study yielded new insights into the process of tissue regrowth stimulated by signals from apoptotic cells. In future studies, the model can be used for experimental data analysis and assisting development of novel strategies/drugs for improving cancer treatment or normal tissue regeneration.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is known to be important for embryogenesis, tissue homoeostasis, and cancer treatment. Furthermore, researchers have recently observed that apoptosis may promote wound healing and tissue regeneration, and accelerate undesired solid tumor regrowth after chemotherapy/radiation therapy. Mechanisms of apoptosis-induced tissue regrowth are related to a molecular network discovered recently in our lab. To quantitatively understand the kinetics of interactions of different molecules in this network, we developed a mathematical model and validated it by comparing the simulation results to experimental data reported in previous studies. To gain new insights into the process of tissue regrowth after inducing apoptosis, we used the model to simulate the effects of radiation on the production of a key growth stimulating factor, PGE2, in apoptotic cells. Additionally, we simulated how PGE2 production could be altered when cells were treated with different inhibitors. We expect that the new mathematical model can be used in future studies to facilitate design of better approaches to cancer treatment or normal tissue regeneration.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Apoptosis, or programmed cell death, is an important and tightly controlled process in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Spencer1">[1]</xref>. However, not all cells in the same population undergo apoptosis when exposed to identical death signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Meyn1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Spencer2">[3]</xref>. This “fractional killing” phenomenon is problematic in cancer treatment, but may be beneficial for wound healing since it has been observed that surviving cells in damaged tissues repopulate at a more rapid pace <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Tubiana1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>. While there could be multiple factors that contribute to the rapid regrowth, one potential mechanism is that apoptotic cells may release signals that can promote proliferation of surrounding cells through the “Phoenix Rising” (PR) pathway discovered recently in our lab <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>. This pathway may play important roles in both regeneration of damaged normal tissues and recurrence of tumors after chemotherapy/radiation therapy.</p>
<p>Wound healing in normal tissues is a complicated process that is time-dependent and requires coordination of different cells. While it is known that inflammation is the initial response to tissue damage, the exact cellular and molecular events in wound healing remain unclear. It has been generally assumed that factors released from damaged tissues mobilize and recruit stem and progenitor cells to the damaged site, where they proliferate, differentiate, and eventually replace the damaged tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Crosby1">[7]</xref>. Our previous studies have shown that two of the key molecular players in the initial response are caspase 3 (C3) and caspase 7 (C7), which are two proteases activated during the execution phase of apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>. Mice lacking either of these caspases are deficient in skin wound healing and liver regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>. The activation of C3 and C7 triggers a cascade of molecular events that lead to upregulation of prostaglandin E2 (PGE2), a growth-promoting signal that stimulates stem and progenitor cell proliferation and thus tissue regeneration.</p>
<p>Tumor recurrence often happens after chemotherapy and radiation therapy due to incomplete killing of tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Fuks1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Clarke1">[9]</xref>. Our previous studies have shown that apoptotic cells in the tumor mass can release signals to stimulate proliferation of remaining cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>. Here, C3 in apoptotic cells is again a key regulator for the upregulation of signals that promote tumor regrowth.</p>
<p>The PR pathway outlined in our previous studies involves a complicated network of molecular interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). To understand the dynamics of these interactions, we developed a mathematical model that links the concentrations of activated C3, activated C7, and nuclear factor κB (NFκB) to the activity of PGE2 in the PR pathway. This type of “input-output” model, combined with experimental data, has been shown to be useful in understanding mechanisms of molecular events in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-LeDuc1">[10]</xref>. Our model was built upon previous mathematical models for regulatory networks involved in apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Spencer1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Legewie1">[11]</xref> and arachidonic acid (AA) metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Yang1">[12]</xref>. Our model was validated by comparing the predicted PGE2 concentrations in MEF and 4T1 cells at 48 hours after 10 Gray (Gy) radiation with the experimental data observed in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>. Using this model, we numerically simulated time-dependent changes in levels of key molecular players in the PR pathway after radiation therapy, and evaluated effects of C3 activation, C7 activation, C3 knockout, and cyclooxygenase-2 (COX2) inhibition on PGE2 production.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>The PR pathway shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> was modeled as a molecular network with seventeen key interactions. The model development was an iterative process, and involved various simplifications and assumptions (for details see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> section). The final outline of the model is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>. To validate the model, we compared numerically simulated [PGE2] with experimental data of [PGE2] reported in our previous study for wild-type MEF and 4T1 cells with/without radiation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g005">Figure 5b</xref> in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>). It should be noted that two units are used for concentrations reported in this paper: pg mL<sup>−1</sup> and µM. The former is used for [PGE2] in order to directly compare it with experimental data in the literature; the latter is used for concentrations of all other molecules in the model. The conversion factor for [PGE2] is 3.525×10<sup>5</sup> pg mL<sup>−1</sup> per µM. The maximal difference between model predictions and experimental data of [PGE2] was 9% (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003461-t001"><bold>Table 1</bold></xref>), which was smaller than the uncertainties in the experimental data.</p>

<title>Mathematical model of the Phoenix Rising pathway.</title>
<p>Seventeen molecular interactions in apoptotic cells were considered in the model. The input of the model was radiation-induced activation of C3, C7, and NFκB. Through the pathway, the activated molecules could result in secretion of PGE2 into the cell's microenvironment. The secreted PGE2 may promote proliferation of stem cells, progenitor cells, and tumor cells in surrounding regions. The mathematical model was used to simulate the dynamics of PGE2 synthesis and how inhibitions of different molecular players in the pathway affected PGE2 synthesis.</p>

The numerical results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref> demonstrated that there was a time delay of ∼24 hours in PGE2 production, due to slow activations of C3 and C7. After the delay, [PGE2] in wild-type MEF and 4T1 cells as well as C7 knockout (KO) MEF cells experienced a short, rapid increase phase, followed by a slow increase phase. In contrast, the simulated production of PGE2 in C3 KO MEF cells was slow and increased linearly with time between 24 and 48 hours. To investigate the dependence of [PGE2] on activation rates of C3 and C7, we simulated [PGE2] in MEF cells at 48 hours after radiation for a set of values of <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>3</sub></italic>. The numerical results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref> demonstrated that [PGE2] was insensitive to changes in <italic>k<sub>3</sub></italic> when <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> was maintained at its baseline, but increased significantly with increasing <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic> when <italic>k<sub>3</sub></italic> was maintained at its baseline, suggesting that PGE2 production was regulated mainly by the amount of activated C3 (C3<sup>*</sup>) but not activated C7 (C7<sup>*</sup>). To simulate effects of C3* or C7* deficiency on PGE2 production in irradiated cells, we assumed [C3*] (or [C7*]) be zero in C3 (or C7) knockout cells. The numerical results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref> demonstrated that in C3 (or C7) knockout cells, activation of C7 (or C3) was important for increasing the production of PGE2. Taken together, our model predicted that activation of C3 was critical for PGE2 production whereas activation of C7 was important only in C3 knockout cells. This model prediction was consistent with experimental observations <italic>in vivo</italic> reported in our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>, which showed that C3 deficiency could make MEF cells inefficient in promoting stem and progenitor cell proliferation. When both C3 and C7 were knocked out, our mathematical model predicted no PGE2 production in apoptotic cells. This prediction was also consistent with an experimental observation that lethally irradiated MEF cells with double knockout of C3 and C7 were less capable to promote stem or progenitor cell proliferation than those with only C3 knocked out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>.</p>

<p>Nuclear factor κB (NFκB) is critical for the regulation of PGE2 production through the control of COX2 expression (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Lee1">[13]</xref>. To simulate effects of NFκB on PGE2 production, we fixed [NFκB] at different levels, and calculated the steady state [PGE2] in unirradiated 4T1 cells. The numerical results are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>; and similar results were also observed for unirradiated MEF cells (data not shown). These profiles demonstrated that the dependence of [PGE2] on [NFκB] variation was biphasic, which was controlled by the rate of COX2 transcription (see the equation for <italic>v<sub>10</sub></italic>). When [NFκB] was &lt;10<sup>−4</sup> µM, the simulated [PGE2] was close to zero. When [NFκB] was increased from 10<sup>−2</sup> to 1 µM, a two-order-of-magnitude change, the increase in simulated [PGE2] was minimal. This was because the increase in simulated concentration of COX2 mRNA (COX2<sub>t</sub>) was only 21%, which was too small to cause a significant increase in the simulated [PGE2]. In studies reported in the literature, [NFκB] in untreated cells is often higher than 0.1 µM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Ihekwaba1">[14]</xref>, suggesting that the PR pathway was insensitive to radiation- or other tissue damage-induced increase in [NFκB].</p>

<p>To simulate effects of C3 knockout on the PR pathway, we let [C3<sup>*</sup>] be zero. The simulated concentrations of iPLA2, iPLA2<sup>*</sup>, AA, and PGH2 in C3 knockout MEF cells are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>; and the dynamic change in simulated [PGE2] is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold></xref>. These results demonstrated that C3 gene knockout reduced the amount of activated iPLA2 by a factor of 3.5, thereby slowing the production of AA, which in turn reduced the levels of PGH2 and PGE2. Although the simulated concentrations of PGH2 and PGE2 would continue to increase with time beyond the 48-hour period, the increase may not happen in experimental studies. This is because our mathematical model did not consider cell proliferation nor the inactivation of C7* and NFκB that may happen in cells over time. More importantly, the cells may have already died/lysed after 48 hours.</p>

<p>Previous studies have shown that exogenous COX2 inhibitors can enhance efficacy of radiation therapy of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Petersen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Kishi1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Kang1">[17]</xref>. The mechanism of enhancement is likely to be related to the reduction in the release of growth-promoting signals, such as PGE2, from apoptotic cells. To simulate this mechanism, we introduced a parameter <italic>α</italic> to model competitive inhibition of COX2 (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> section), and numerically simulated the dependence of [PGE2] on <italic>α</italic> at 48 hours post radiation. The simulation results shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g010"><bold>Figure 10</bold></xref> indicated that [PGE2] decreased rapidly with increasing the value of <italic>α</italic>, suggesting that inhibition of COX2 could indeed reduce the production of growth-promoting signals in apoptotic cells.</p>

<p>Experimentally, COX2 inhibition can be achieved through treatment of cells with exogenous competitive inhibitors. In this study, the competitive inhibition was modeled through introducing a parameter, α, which was the ratio of inhibitor concentration versus equilibrium constant of binding between COX2 and its inhibitor. It can be observed that [PGE2] decreased rapidly with increasing the value of α.</p>

<p>We also examined the two negative feedback mechanisms (<italic>Ki<sub>14</sub></italic> and <italic>Ki<sub>16</sub></italic>) shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> and their roles played in the regulation of PGE2 production <italic>in silico</italic>. We observed that removal of both negative feedback mechanisms (i.e., setting both <italic>1/Ki<sub>14</sub></italic> and <italic>1/Ki<sub>16</sub></italic> to zero) led to &lt;2% increase in [PGE2], suggesting that these inhibitory mechanisms were weak and insignificant in the regulation of tissue regeneration after radiation treatment.</p>
<p>Finally, we performed a sensitivity analysis of model predictions. It was observed that [PGE2] was sensitive to only four rate constants: k<sub>−5</sub>, k<sub>6</sub>, k<sub>7</sub>, and k<sub>17</sub>, among all 25 rate and equilibrium constants (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g011"><bold>Figure 11</bold></xref>). Approximately, [PGE2] was proportional to changes in k<sub>−5</sub> and k<sub>6</sub>, and reversely proportional to changes in k<sub>7</sub> and k<sub>17</sub>. In the mathematical model, k<sub>17</sub> determined the rate of PGE2 degradation, k<sub>6</sub> and k<sub>7</sub> determined the rates of AA production and degradation, respectively, and k<sub>−5</sub> affected AA production indirectly through regulation of iPLA2 synthesis. Therefore, the analysis suggested that the simulated concentration of PGE2 was sensitive to its rate of degradation and the intracellular concentration of AA.</p>

<p>In summary, the mathematical model of the PR pathway yielded new insights into the process of growth-promoting signal production in apoptotic cells. While the model is limited by uncertainty in some parameter values and is only as good as the assumptions that were made, it provides useful information on the PR pathway. The model can be used to integrate experimental data obtained from different studies, adjust for cell-to-cell variability observed in different experiments, and determine sensitivity of the PR pathway to individual molecular interactions. The model can be further improved to serve as a tool for <italic>in silico</italic> experiments in future studies that may generate experimentally testable hypotheses, and facilitate development of novel strategies for improving cancer treatment and normal tissue regeneration.</p>

<p>The PR pathway begins when a damaged cell activates its execution caspases (e.g., C3 and C7) to undergo apoptosis. The caspases then proceed to cleave/activate iPLA2, which binds to the membrane and catalyzes the hydrolysis of phospholipids to produce AA. AA is then converted to PGH2, catalyzed by COX2, which in turn is used to produce PGE2 catalyzed by prostaglandin E synthases (PGES) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Morita1">[18]</xref>. Finally, PGE2 is secreted into the environment of apoptotic cells to signal for cell replacements in damaged tissues.</p>
<p>To model the PR Pathway, we considered cell damage through treatment (e.g., radiation), which led to activation of C3, C7, and NFκB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Vile1">[19]</xref>. The activation processes have been modeled extensively in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Spencer1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Legewie1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Stucki1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Terry1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Schlatter1">[22]</xref>. Thus, we used the activated forms of these molecules, i.e., C3<sup>*</sup>, C7<sup>*</sup>, and NFκB, as inputs for our model. The activated C3 and C7 would then trigger a cascade of reactions, which involved AA, COX2, iPLA2, PGE2, and PGH2 in the PR pathway shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>. Meanwhile, the activated NFκB is critical for COX2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Lee1">[13]</xref>, and the latter is required for catalyzing PGH2 production from AA. The proposed network model also included two inhibitory reactions based on a mathematical model of AA metabolism, developed by Yang <italic>et al</italic>. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Yang1">[12]</xref>, where PGES and COX2 could be inhibited by AA and PGE2, respectively. To simplify the model of the PR pathway, we did not consider interactions between lysyl oxidases (LOXs) and AA, which may lead to a reduction in the production of PGE2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Yang1">[12]</xref>. Although the amount of reduction might be small, further studies are needed to elucidate roles of LOXs played in the PR pathway.</p>
<p>Based on all these considerations, we constructed a simple network model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>, which consisted of seventeen molecular interactions. In developing the mathematical model to recapitulate key experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Li1">[6]</xref>, we made the following assumptions. <italic>First</italic>, chemical species shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003461-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref> behaved independently from other intracellular molecules that were not included in the model. <italic>Second</italic>, enzymatic reactions were governed by the Michaelis-Menten equation, except for the hydrolysis of phospholipids (see the description below), and they could be blocked by competitive inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Yang1">[12]</xref>. <italic>Third</italic>, PGES concentration was assumed to be time-independent within the simulation period (i.e., 48 hours) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Yang1">[12]</xref>. <italic>Fourth</italic>, NFκB is a transcription factor involved in the regulation of COX2 expression. The rate of transcription, i.e., COX2 mRNA (COX2<sub>t</sub>) synthesis, was assumed to be governed by the Hill equation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Terry1">[21]</xref>. The rate of translation from COX2<sub>t</sub> to COX2 was assumed to be proportional to the concentration of COX2<sub>t</sub>. <italic>Fifth</italic>, iPLA2 is a housekeeping gene and constitutively expressed in cells under normal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Ong1">[23]</xref>. Thus, its rate of synthesis was assumed to be constant. <italic>Sixth</italic>, the degradation of all chemical species considered in this model was assumed to be a first order reaction. <italic>Finally</italic>, the activated C3 and C7 were observed to be minimal but NFκB was clearly visible in Western blot analysis at 24 hours post radiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Huang1">[5]</xref>. Therefore, the rate of NFκB production was assumed to be constant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Kim1">[24]</xref>, and the rates of C3 and C7 activation were assumed to be proportional to the Heaviside step function of time, <italic>H(t - 24)</italic>, which is equal to 0 if <italic>t&lt;</italic>24 hours and unity if <italic>t≥</italic>24 hours.</p>
<p>Phospholipid hydrolysis catalyzed by iPLA2<sup>*</sup> has been modeled as a three-step reaction: (i) iPLA2<sup>*</sup> adsorption to plasma membrane (M<sub>B</sub>), (ii) binding of adsorbed enzyme (iPLA2<sup>*</sup>-M<sub>B</sub>) to phospholipids (PS), and (iii) conversion of PS to reaction products, including AA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Deems1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Cherney1">[26]</xref>. The final step in the reaction is very slow compared to the first one, indicating that the ratio of concentrations between iPLA2<sup>*</sup> and iPLA2<sup>*</sup>-M<sub>B</sub> is approximately equal to the equilibrium dissociation constant times the concentration of available adsorption sites on the membrane. Furthermore, it is known that the concentration of iPLA2<sup>*</sup>-M<sub>B</sub> is approximately equal to that of iPLA2<sup>*</sup>-M<sub>B</sub>-PS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Cherney1">[26]</xref>, and the rate of AA production from PS is proportional to the concentration of iPLA2<sup>*</sup>-M<sub>B</sub>-PS. Assuming the amount of phospholipid hydrolyzed during the 48-hour period to be negligible compared to its total amount in a cell, we found that the rate of AA production was proportional to the total concentration of iPLA2<sup>*</sup> in the cell (see the equation for <italic>v<sub>6</sub></italic>). PGH2 production from AA is catalyzed by COX2, which can be competitively inhibited by either endogenous PGE2 or exogenous drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Petersen1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Kishi1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Kang1">[17]</xref>.

<p>In these equations, all concentrations are defined as the number of moles per unit cell volume (V<sub>c</sub>) except for [AA] and [PGE2] because a fraction of these molecules produced in cells are secreted into extracellular medium, and it is the concentration in the medium that was measured in previous experiments. To directly compare model predictions with previous experimental data, [AA] and [PGE2] were therefore defined as the number of moles per unit volume of cells plus the medium (V<sub>t</sub>), which were close to the concentrations in the medium since the volume ratio (V<sub>t</sub>/V<sub>c</sub>), denoted by β, is significantly larger than unity, and there is no substantial difference in the concentrations between intracellular and extracellular spaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003461-Cherian1">[27]</xref>.
