<abstract>
<p>Cellular decision-making is driven by dynamic behaviours, such as the preparations for sunrise enabled by circadian rhythms and the choice of cell fates enabled by positive feedback. Such behaviours are often built upon ultrasensitive responses where a linear change in input generates a sigmoidal change in output. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles are one means to generate ultrasensitivity. Using bioinformatics, we show that <italic>in vivo</italic> levels of kinases and phosphatases frequently exceed the levels of their corresponding substrates in budding yeast. This result is in contrast to the conditions often required by zero-order ultrasensitivity, perhaps the most well known means for how such cycles become ultrasensitive. We therefore introduce a mechanism to generate ultrasensitivity when numbers of enzymes are higher than numbers of substrates. Our model combines distributive and non-distributive actions of the enzymes with two-stage binding and concerted allosteric transitions of the substrate. We use analytical and numerical methods to calculate the Hill number of the response. For a substrate with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> phosphosites, we find an upper bound of the Hill number of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and so even systems with a single phosphosite can be ultrasensitive. Two-stage binding, where an enzyme must first bind to a binding site on the substrate before it can access the substrate's phosphosites, allows the enzymes to sequester the substrate. Such sequestration combined with competition for each phosphosite provides an intuitive explanation for the sigmoidal shifts in levels of phosphorylated substrate. Additionally, we find cases for which the response is not monotonic, but shows instead a peak at intermediate levels of input. Given its generality, we expect the mechanism described by our model to often underlay decision-making circuits in eukaryotic cells.</p>

<title>Authors Summary</title>
<p>Dose-response curves are said to be ultrasensitive when they are sigmoidal rather than hyperbolic and often underlay cellular decision-making circuits. Zero-order ultrasensitivity is a well-known mechanism to generate sigmoidal curves in phosphorylation cycles, but one of its assumptions often implies that the substrate is more abundant than the modifying enzymes. We show that this assumption is unlikely to always hold <italic>in vivo</italic>, and we present a general model that generates ultrasensitivity when the enzymes are in excess of their substrate. The model combines conformational allosteric transitions of the substrate with two-stage binding of the enzymes: the enzymes bind first to a docking site on the substrate and then to the substrate's phosphosites. Ultrasensitivity is generated because the kinase can bind to the fully phosphorylated form of the substrate (at its docking site) and sequester the substrate away from the phosphatase and, similarly, the phosphatase can bind to the fully dephosphorylated form of the substrate and sequester the substrate away from the kinase. The number of kinase-phosphatase competitions for the substrate determines the degree of ultrasensitivity. Finally, we show that this model can generate non-monotonic responses that peak at intermediate levels of input.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Covalent modifications, such as phosphorylations, play a pivotal role in regulating the activity of proteins and in the processing of extracellular signals in eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Bhalla1">[1]</xref>. These modifications typically affect the tertiary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Groban1">[2]</xref> of the targeted proteins, thus changing their enzymatic activity or their binding affinities for other proteins. For phosphorylations, there are two types of modifying enzymes: kinases phosphorylate; phosphatases dephosphorylate. Cycles of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation are embedded in regulatory and signalling pathways and can regulate the flow of information inside the cell. Extracellular and intracellular cues are sensed and transduced to variations in the concentration of active enzymes. In the presence of a signal, an increase in activity of a kinase can, for example, activate a transcription factor and so turn on a programme of gene expression. The same programme of expression can be turned off by an increase in the activity of a phosphatase relative to the activity of the kinase. Phosphorylation cycles can therefore be treated as a mechanism to generate a dose-response curve or more generally an input-output relationship. The input is typically either the concentration of one of the enzymes (assuming the levels of the other enzyme are approximately constant on the time scale of the response) or the ratio of the concentration of one enzyme to the other. The output is a function of the phosphorylation state of the substrate.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation cycles have been predicted to exhibit ultrasensitivity, generating a response to a change in the stimulus that is more non-linear, or more sigmoidal, than a Michaelis-Menten-like response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Goldbeter1">[3]</xref>. Ultrasensitivity, and the degree of non-linearity it implies, is important because it is a pre-requisite for biochemical networks to generate oscillations or bistable behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Ferrell1">[4]</xref>. Sequential cascades of phosphorylation cycles, such as cascades of MAP kinase, can amplify signals and increase the degree of ultrasensitivity of the response with each step of the cascade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Ferrell2">[5]</xref>. Single cycles but with substrates with multiple phosphorylation sites can have steep response curves too, although the degree of ultrasensitivity can depend on the order in which the sites are modified and whether the modifying enzyme is processive or distributive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Lenz1">[7]</xref>. Product-inhibition of the kinase and phosphatase, in which their products remain bound to the enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar2">[8]</xref>, and other forms of sequestration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Blthgen1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Liu1">[10]</xref> also induce ultrasensitive behaviour.</p>
<p>Perhaps the most famous means, though, is zero-order ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Goldbeter1">[3]</xref>, but this mechanism imposes constraints on the concentrations of enzymes and their substrates that do not always appear to hold <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Berg1">[11]</xref>. Both enzymes must be saturated – the concentration of the substrate should far exceed the enzyme's Michaelis-Menten constant – so that the modifying reactions proceed at a rate that is independent of the concentration of the substrate. Such saturation often occurs when the concentration of the substrate is much greater than the concentration of the enzymes. Examples of zero-order ultrasensitivity are known <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-LaPorte1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Meinke1">[13]</xref> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Melen1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Cimino1">[15]</xref>, but other ultrasensitive systems have also been discovered with enzymes that are more abundant than the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Malleshaiah1">[16]</xref>.</p>
<p>Attempts at reconciling these opposing observations have attracted some modelling. Mechanisms to explain how an excess of enzymes over the substrate can still generate an ultrasensitive output have included product-inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar2">[8]</xref> and local saturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Malleshaiah1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Dushek1">[17]</xref>. These models, however, require assumptions of their own or <italic>ad hoc</italic> constraints that affect their generality.</p>
<p>Here we estimate the distribution of enzymes-to-substrate ratios in the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and so estimate how widespread are the conditions that invalidate zero-order ultrasensitivity. We then present a general, mechanistic model for robust ultrasensitivity in single and multi-site phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles in conditions where the enzymes are in excess relative to their substrate. We explore this novel mechanism, obtaining analytical calculations of the Hill number (a measure of ultrasensitivity), identify the origins of ultrasensitivity, and show that the mechanism can also exhibit non-monotonic responses.</p>

<title>Distribution of saturation levels in phosphorylation reactions in budding yeast</title>
<p>The zero-order model of ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Goldbeter1">[3]</xref> hinges on the assumption that the enzymes are saturated and so enzymes to substrate ratios, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, are often low, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the concentrations of enzyme and of substrate available in the system. Enzyme saturation can always occur when that ratio is sufficiently below one (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>
<p>Systematic measurements of Michaelis-Menten constants and the concentrations of enzymes and their substrates <italic>in vivo</italic> are still limited. Experimental evidence suggests that many enzymes operate away from saturation with ratios of substrate concentration to Michaelis-Menten constants ranging between 10<sup>−2</sup> and 1 in physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Berg1">[11]</xref>. We expanded on these reports and estimated the ratios of enzymes to substrate <italic>in vivo</italic> in the yeast <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> by comparing information about phosphorylation reactions with global measurements of protein expression. We extracted from BioGRID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Stark1">[18]</xref>, a curated database of protein-protein interactions, all interactions that are annotated as corresponding to either phosphorylations or dephosphorylations in budding yeast. We thus compiled a list of kinases and phosphatases and their respective substrates (which may themselves be kinases or phosphatases). We then compared these proteins with the protein expression data of Ghaemmaghami <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Ghaemmaghami1">[19]</xref>, who constructed an extensive fusion library and used immunodetection to measure the absolute levels of protein abundance during log phase growth in rich media.</p>
<p>Taken together, these two sets of data allow us to show that the enzyme to substrate ratio, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for a number of phosphorylation dependent systems in yeast does not appear to be biased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). We obtain 2850 phosphorylation reactions, comprising 98 unique kinases and 1136 unique substrates and 43 dephosphorylation reactions involving 16 unique phosphatases and 32 unique substrates. The data for phosphatases is scarce and thus not as informative, and so we focus on kinases. The distribution of ratios for kinases is unimodal, centred on a 1∶1 kinase to substrate ratio, with a minimum of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a maximum of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). Half of all reactions (49%) operate under <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and so are likely not to satisfy the conditions for zero-order ultrasensitivity. It is worth noting that randomly sampling any two genes in the Ghaemmaghami <italic>et al.</italic> data set and calculating their ratio produces a distribution that is statistically different from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g001">Fig. 1A</xref> (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test), but is equally unimodal with a peak at approximately the same location. We therefore conclude that a distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that is significantly different from a baseline distribution has not been selected, and so ultrasensitivity in phosphorylation cycles ought not to be a phenomenon that depends on extreme values of concentrations.</p>

<title>The model</title>
<p>Our model combines concerted allosteric transitions of the state of the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Monod1">[20]</xref> with an implicit form of two-stage binding.</p>
<p>A covalent modification of a substrate molecule often throws a conformational switch that modifies the molecule's tertiary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Groban1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Volkman1">[21]</xref>. Conformational changes are naturally described by allosteric transitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Monod1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Changeux1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Martins1">[26]</xref>. We assume that the substrate alternates between active and inactive states through thermal fluctuations and may be biased towards one or another state by its level of phosphorylation. A related model with conformational changes controlled by phosphorylation reactions has been used previously to describe the nuclear translocation of a family of transcription factors of the immune system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar3">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>In a two-stage binding mechanism, the enzymes – the kinase and the phosphatase – bind to their target in two independent but sequential steps: first, they bind to a docking site on the substrate molecule; second, and only subsequently, are the enzymes able to find, bind to and catalyze the modification of a phosphosite, perhaps through a rearrangement of the substrate's tertiary structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Remenyi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Ubersax1">[29]</xref>. We assume that the kinase can only bind to its docking site on the substrate when the substrate is in its active form and that the phosphatase can only bind to its docking site when the substrate is inactive. Both enzymes may either use the same docking site (or partly overlapping docking sites) or different docking sites, but in either case, the structural conformation of the active state is such that the phosphatase cannot bind and the structural conformation of the inactive state is such that the kinase cannot bind. Two-stage binding implies that the kinase can still bind a molecule of substrate when the substrate's phosphosites are all phosphorylated and, likewise, the phosphatase can still bind the substrate when the substrate's phosphosites are all unphosphorylated because each enzyme can always bind to their docking site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>

<title>A model of a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle for an allosteric substrate with multiple phosphorylation sites has two “sink” states and multiple competitions between the modifying enzymes for the substrate.</title>
<p>For each level of phosphorylation, the free substrate switches conformations allosterically between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (inactive, in grey) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (active, in yellow). The rate of allosteric transitions from active states to inactive states is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the reverse rate of allosteric transitions from inactive states to active states is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The kinase (in red) binds to the active forms of the substrate; the phosphatase (in blue) binds to the inactive forms. The two sinks <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, are shown with shadows. The rate of association of the kinase to the substrate is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; the rate of dissociation of the kinase-substrate complex is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Phosphorylation of a phosphosite resulting in dissociation of the kinase from the substrate has rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per phosphosite (distributive catalytic rate represented by the diagonal black arrows). Phosphorylation of a phosphosite whereby the enzyme remains bound to the substrate has a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (non-distributive catalytic rate represented by the straight grey arrows). The rate of association of the phosphatase to the substrate is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and its rate of dissociation is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Dephosphorylation of a phosphosite whereby the enzyme remains bound to the substrate has a non-distributive rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>The output or response of a phosphorylation cycle is typically considered to be a function of the phosphorylation state of the substrate, but there is no consensus on what this function should be. With only a single phosphosite, the fraction of phosphorylated substrate, either free or in complex with one of the two enzymes, can be used. When there are multiple phosphosites and so multiple states of partial phosphorylation, there is no longer a unique choice of output. Some studies have used the fraction of the fully phosphorylated substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar1">[6]</xref>, but it seems likely that substrates could have some activity when only partially phosphorylated. Others have taken an average of the phosphorylation states, weighting by the number of phosphorylated sites for each individual molecule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Dushek1">[17]</xref>, but proteins are perhaps unlikely to have such tightly regulated patterns of activity. The level of output could also depend on which sites are phosphorylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Kim1">[30]</xref> or depend only on a few essential sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Wang1">[31]</xref>, but these choice require systems that are well characterized experimentally. Our allosteric mechanism avoids this dilemma: each molecule must be either active or inactive and the response function is the fraction of substrate that is active <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar3">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our model therefore works as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g002">Fig. 2</xref>): substrates with an arbitrary number of phosphosites, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, undergo conformational transitions between active forms, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and inactive forms, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of phosphorylated sites on each molecule. The enzyme-substrate complexes that form are <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the kinase and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> denotes the phosphatase. Only then can each enzyme modify the phosphorylation state of a single phosphosite. Both enzymes compete for the free form of the substrate at each stage of phosphorylation, which allosterically transitions between the two states <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The competition for a particular molecule of substrate does not therefore occur at the same time, but still exists because of each molecule switching back and forth between the forms preferred by each enzyme (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Further, the enzyme-substrate complex may either dissociate following each modification – in which case the enzymatic reactions follow a distributive scheme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Huang1">[32]</xref> – or remain bound after each modification – in which case the catalytic reactions may follow a processive scheme <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Patwardhan1">[33]</xref>. By formulating a model where both distributive and processive schemes can coexist, we can analyse their contributions to the degree of ultrasensitivity in the system.</p>
<p>We note that it is not strictly necessary to assume, as we have here, that distributive phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions trigger the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex. It is mechanistically more likely that there is an intermediate complex, and it is from this complex that the enzymes dissociate to subsequently rebind and catalyse the modification of the remaining phosphosites distributively. This extra layer does not, however, introduce significant qualitative changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Malleshaiah1">[16]</xref>, thus in the interest of simplicity and mathematical tractability we consider only a single step for the interaction of enzymes with the modifiable phosphosites, the catalytic modification of the phosphosites and the dissociation of the enzyme-substrate complex in the distributive case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g002">Fig. 2</xref>).</p>
<p>The model can be described by a system of ordinary differential equations, where the phosphatase binds the substrate at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, dissociates from the substrate at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and catalyses the dephosphorylation of the substrate at a distributive rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or at a non-distributive rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>In this regime of fast and non-biased allosteric kinetics, non-distributive schemes of phosphorylation-dephosphorylation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e097" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are not ultrasensitive as they can only attain a Hill number of at most 1 (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e089">Eqs.

<p>Ultrasensitivity is therefore generated by sequestration, which is enabled by two-stage binding. When there is little phosphatase in the system (low signal in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>), the kinase operates freely, phosphorylates the substrate almost completely and then remains bound to substrate in the state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Most of the substrate will be sequestered by the kinase because the kinase is more abundant than the substrate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and, as determined above, a condition for ultrasensitivity is a small dissociation rate of the enzyme-substrate complex. As the phosphatase enters and accumulates in the system, it has little impact initially because most of the substrate is shielded from it and the amount of free kinase is still enough to win the competition for the little free substrate that is available. As more phosphatase is added, it eventually starts winning the competition for the substrate, and once the phosphatase can win one competition then it can win all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and so sequesters the substrate in its own sink, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). The concentration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rises sharply as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> collapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). When the ratio of phosphatase to kinase is high (high input) the situation has been completely reversed and the substrate is almost completely sequestered by the phosphatase and beyond the reach of the kinase. The existence of the two sink states, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, therefore makes ultrasensitivity possible in a phosphorylation cycle with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is indeed a necessary condition that the enzymes are in excess relative to the substrate because only then they can sequester the substrate entirely.</p>

<title>Modulation of the allosteric bias by the enzymes enhances ultrasensitivity</title>
<p>While we conclude from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e092">Eq. (16)</xref> that the enzymes need not modulate the allosteric conformational transitions of the substrate for the system to be ultrasensitive, the higher the allosteric bias induced by each enzyme in that enzyme's favour the more ultrasensitive the system becomes. If the free substrate is more biased towards the active form when it is more phosphorylated, then this bias favours binding of the kinase because the kinase binds only to active substrate. Similarly, if the free substrate is more biased towards the inactive form when it is less phosphorylated, then this bias favours binding of the phosphatase because the phosphatase binds only to inactive substrate. Such an induced bias could also be necessary if, for example, there is promiscuity and so crosstalk between different enzymes and substrates from various subsystems. Enzymes that modulate the allosteric bias of their substrate can force the substrate into conformational states that prevent other enzymes from physically binding. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and assuming symmetry, we impose the bias by setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the allosteric equilibrium constant. From <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e075">Eq. (12)</xref> and, taking the limit of fast allosteric rates, we obtain<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003175.e141"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e141" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(17)</label></disp-formula><xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e141">Eq. (17)</xref> has the same upper bound of 2, i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but shows enhanced ultrasensitivity, all other rates being equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>).</p>
<p>The presence of an allosteric bias can generate ultrasensitivity even if one of the conditions we presented above for the non-biased case – the stability of enzyme-substrate complexes – does not hold. In such cases, while the sink state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may not be effective in sequestering the substrate away from the phosphatase, the allosteric bias increases the probability of the fully phosphorylated substrate being in the active state, which the phosphatase cannot access, thus preventing linear changes in the overall activity in response to linear changes in the levels of the phosphatase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003175.s004">Fig. S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, allosteric biases can drive non-distributive systems, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, into ultrasensitivity. From <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e141">Eq. (17)</xref>, a moderate degree of ultrasensitivity is reached when the dissociation constant of the enzymes-substrate complex is low (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or when the rate of dissociation is much slower than the catalytic rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the allosteric bias of the substrate is high (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Under these conditions, the system becomes processive: the enzymes bind to their docking site and proceed to phosphorylate or dephosphorylate all phosphosites with few dissociation events. Eventual dissociation of the kinase is therefore most likely to occur only when the substrate is fully phosphorylated, and eventual dissociation of the phosphatase is most likely to occur only when the substrate is fully dephosphorylated. The Hill number can approach an upper limit of 2, which is independent of the number of phosphosites. As discussed before, two-stage binding means the enzymes can still bind to the docking site even if no phosphosites are available for modification; effectively, the enzymes therefore compete twice for the free forms of the substrate.</p>
<p>Higher Hill numbers occur when the non-distributive catalytic rate is much slower than both the binding rate of the enzymes to their docking site and the dissociation rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the allosteric bias is high (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Under these conditions, the enzymes are more likely to unbind from their docking site and dissociate from the substrate following each enzymatic reaction than to modify the next phosphosite. Consequently, both enzymes may compete for the free forms of the substrate at each state of phosphorylation, and the upper bound of the Hill number is therefore <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These conditions make the system quasi-distributive, but the degree of ultrasensitivity is substantially constrained when compared to an equivalent system that is purely distributive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g003">Fig. 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003175.s005">Figs.

<title>Non-monotonic response curves</title>
<p>When, perhaps counter-intuitively, the fully phosphorylated state induces a strong conformational bias towards the inactive state, and thus hinders the binding of kinase, the system can generate a non-monotonic response with a peak of activity at intermediate levels of input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). If only kinase is present in the system (low input), the activity is low because there is a strong bias towards the inactive form of the substrate, which is inaccessible to the kinase (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e077">Eq. (13)</xref> with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Most of the substrate is in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> state and the activity is, accordingly, low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Rather than impeding phosphorylation of the substrate, the addition of phosphatase now enhances it by shifting substrate into states of phosphorylation that are more accessible to the kinase. As a consequence, the concentration of the sink state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> eventually rises and so does the activity, peaking at an intermediate level of phosphatase. As more phosphatase is added, then the expected behaviour occurs: the phosphatase starts winning the competition, the concentration of the sink state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> rises, and the activity decreases. The example depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g004">Fig. 4</xref>, simplified with symmetric rates for the kinase and the phosphatase and a single phosphosite, represents this type of phosphorylation cycle. The system only responds for a certain range of signal and not at both lower and higher concentrations. A similar type of non-monotonic behaviour can also occur in alternative models of phosphorylation cycles, where the kinase and the phosphatase bind to each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Szomolay1">[35]</xref>.</p>

<title>Ultrasensitivity does not require allostery</title>
<p>Our predictions of ultrasensitivity do not depend on allostery. We considered an alternative variation of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>), similar to other models that have been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Malleshaiah1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Dushek1">[17]</xref>.

The substrate only has one conformational form, to which both the kinase and the phosphatase can bind. They bind to a docking site before modifying the phosphorylation state, but with a constraint: either they bind to the same docking site, and thus only one type of enzyme can be bound at a time, or they bind to different docking sites, but a bound enzyme blocks the access of the opposing enzyme to its docking site via steric hindrance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>).

<p>This alternative model without allostery shows that it is possible to achieve Hill numbers of magnitude comparable to those predicted by zero-order ultrasensitivity even though <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Here we use <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e175">Eq.

The kinase cannot sequester the substrate in its sink state, but the concentration of phosphatase is too low to bind to the substrate in significant numbers. As the concentration of the phosphatase increases, the complex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is formed, but the modifying rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is slow, so the substrate remains in a phosphorylated form. Finally, the addition of phosphatase reaches a critical level where enough unphosphorylated substrate is produced and accumulated in the sink state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003175-g005">Fig. 5B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here we have shown that a phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle with neither the kinase nor the phosphatase saturated can exhibit ultrasensitivity. Both the concentration of the kinase and the phosphatase must exceed that of the substrate and both must first bind to a docking site on the substrate before accessing its phosphosites. We consider either the substrate to be allosteric and in one conformation to bind only the kinase and in the other conformation to bind only the phosphatase or that the binding of one enzyme prevents the binding of another. Ultrasensitivity is mostly generated by sequestration of the substrate either when fully phosphorylated and the substrate is bound by the kinase at its docking site or when fully dephosphorylated and the substrate is bound by the phosphatase at its own docking site. The maximal degree of ultrasensitivity is determined by the number of competitions between the kinase and phosphatase for the substrate. If both enzymes bind simultaneously, i.e., if they have distinct docking sites that remain available when the opposing enzyme is bound, the degree of ultrasensitivity can be substantially reduced and depends on the affinity of each enzyme to forms of the substrate that are either bound by the opposing enzyme or are in conformational states that do not favour binding of that enzyme. In this scenario, each enzyme may no longer be able to sequester the substrate in an inaccessible sink state.</p>
<p>Under the assumptions of our model, namely the rates of binding and unbinding of the enzymes to the docking site in the substrate are independent of the substrate's phosphorylation state, we find maximal ultrasensitivity occurs when the system has a purely distributive scheme, i.e., when the enzymes unbind from the substrate upon catalysing the modification of the phosphorylation state. If, on the other hand, the enzymes do not release the substrate immediately following phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events, then the degree of ultrasensitivity is reduced. Our results on the relative effects of processive and distributive catalytic rates are analogous to those of Dushek <italic>et al.</italic>, who studied ultrasensitivity in phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles of membrane-anchored proteins and modelled the diffusion of enzymes towards their substrate explicitly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Dushek1">[17]</xref>. The authors observed that the system is only ultrasensitive if the enzymatic reactions are diffusion-limited and there exists a refractory period that maintains the enzymes inactive immediately after the catalytic reactions. Those conditions effectively impose a distributive mechanism. Indeed, processive schemes are generally believed to make poor switches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Patwardhan1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Distributive mechanisms of phosphorylation have been identified in, for example, the phosphorylation of the p42 MAP kinase in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, and are essential there to generate switch-like responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Ferrell3">[36]</xref>. In endogenous conditions it is possible that non-distributive and distributive mechanisms coexist within the same phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle. Some sites may be phosphorylated or dephosphorylated processively and others distributively, as has been suggested for the phosphorylation of the Pho4 transcription factor in budding yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Jeffery1">[37]</xref>. For this type of systems, the Hill number will fall short of its theoretical maximum of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e203" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but ultrasensitivity remains possible (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e089">Eqs. (15)</xref> and <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e092">(16)</xref>).</p>
<p>We expect our model to apply widely. As we have shown, approximately 50% of kinases are expected to have concentrations higher than those of their substrates in budding yeast. Not all copies of the same kinase are however necessarily co-localized with all of their substrates, and so the effective kinase to substrate ratio may be smaller. Having concentrations of the modifying enzymes higher than the substrate could help avoid the slow responses expected when enzymes are saturated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar4">[38]</xref>, as required for zero-order ultrasensitivity. Further, the majority of kinases phosphorylate their substrates multiple times <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Patwardhan1">[33]</xref> and substrates typically have docking sites for kinases and phosphatases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Remenyi1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Ubersax1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Tanoue1">[39]</xref>. An example is the pheromone response in budding yeast, where a kinase Fus3 and a phosphatase Ptc1 compete for a substrate Ste5, which has four phosphosites and docking sites for both Fus3 and Ptc1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Malleshaiah1">[16]</xref>. As the concentration of extracellular pheromone increases, Ptc1 is recruited to the plasma membrane where it can interact with Ste5 and so its local concentration increases with respect to the kinase Fus3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Malleshaiah1">[16]</xref>. As predicted, the degree of ultrasensitivity of the response decreases as the number of phosphosites on Ste5 decreases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Malleshaiah1">[16]</xref>. Moreover, it has recently been shown the scaffold Ste5 undergoes allosteric transitions, and the kinase Fus3 can only bind one of the conformational states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Zalatan1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Bhattacharyya1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>The ultrasensitivity in our model is generated fundamentally by competitions between the kinase and the phosphatase with the winner sequestering the substrate. Sequestration has been proposed as mechanism for generating ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar2">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Liu1">[10]</xref> and even bistability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Chan1">[42]</xref> in phosphorylation cycles and in other systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Buchler1">[43]</xref>. Salazar and Höfer proposed a mechanism where enzymes are directly inhibited by their products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar2">[8]</xref>. In our model, sequestration occurs indirectly because of the existence of docking sites for the enzymes on the substrate and because binding to these docking sites occurs with an affinity independent of the state of phosphorylation of the substrate. This difference is not minor: product-inhibition requires a constraint on the dissociation constants of the substrate-enzyme complexes – the kinase must have low affinity for the phosphorylated state and the phosphatase low affinity for the unphosphorylated state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Salazar2">[8]</xref>. In our model, ultrasensitivity is independent of whether the enzymes prefer fully modified states of substrate over non-modified states, and Hill numbers higher than 1 can be reached even when the affinities are the same for all states of phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003175.e092">Eq. (16)</xref>). Liu <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Liu1">[10]</xref> have also proposed a mechanism with regulated degrees of sequestration that is capable of generating ultrasensitivity. In their model, the substrate is sequestered by another protein (a scaffold for example) or translocates to a compartment, depending on the substrate's phosphorylation state. It follows that if, for example, the fully phosphorylated state is sequestered and the phosphatase cannot access it, the system can become ultrasensitive with an upper bound for the Hill number that is equal to the number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of phosphosites. Liu <italic>et al.</italic> do not model the enzyme-substrate complexes explicitly, but by modelling the formation of those complexes with a two-stage binding process, we have shown that the enzymes themselves can be the agents of sequestration (if each binds to a different allosteric form or if the binding of one enzyme sterically inhibits the binding of the competing enzyme). Additionally, the fully phosphorylated forms of the substrate need not be structurally different from the partially phosphorylated forms, and our model generates ultrasensitivity with an upper bound of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003175.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Thus even systems with a single phosphosite can become ultrasensitive.</p>
<p>It is commonly assumed that a simple phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycle cannot generate ultrasensitivity if the enzymes are not saturated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Gunawardena1">[44]</xref>. Our model shows that this assumption is not true if biochemistry is modelled more closely to include docking sites for the enzymes on the substrate. Given that there is little evidence for selection on the ratio of the <italic>in vivo</italic> concentration of kinases to their substrates (as we have shown here), we expect that our mechanism may be common. Phosphorylation-dephosphorylation cycles require energy to operate, but our results emphasize again that “futile” cycles need not be expending energy needlessly but use that energy to generate ultrasensitivity, thus laying the foundation for sophisticated cellular responses such as irreversible switching and oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003175-Ferrell1">[4]</xref>.</p>
