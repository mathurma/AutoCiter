<abstract>
<p>Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor important for regulating innate and adaptive immunity, cellular proliferation, apoptosis, and senescence. Dysregulation of NF-κB and its upstream regulator IκB kinase (IKK) contributes to the pathogenesis of multiple inflammatory and degenerative diseases as well as cancer. An 11–amino acid peptide containing the NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)-binding domain (NBD) derived from the C-terminus of β subunit of IKK, functions as a highly selective inhibitor of the IKK complex by disrupting the association of IKKβ and the IKKγ subunit NEMO. A structure-based pharmacophore model was developed to identify NBD mimetics by in silico screening. Two optimized lead NBD mimetics, SR12343 and SR12460, inhibited tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α)- and lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced NF-κB activation by blocking the interaction between IKKβ and NEMO and suppressed LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflammation in mice. Chronic treatment of a mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) with SR12343 and SR12460 attenuated inflammatory infiltration, necrosis and muscle degeneration, demonstrating that these small-molecule NBD mimetics are potential therapeutics for inflammatory and degenerative diseases.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Aberrant up-regulation of the transcription factor nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) and the IκB kinase (IKK) that regulates NF-κB is associated with a variety of inflammatory and degenerative diseases in humans, including aging. Thus, development of effective and specific drugs able to decrease IKK/NF-κB activity has significant therapeutic potential. In this study, a structure-derived computational approach was used to screen for small-molecule inhibitors of the protein–protein interaction between the IKKß and IKKγ subunits of the IKK complex. We identified and developed a novel class of small molecules that selectively inhibit IKK/NF-κB activation by dissociating the IKK complex without affecting c-Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK)/p38-mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) signaling. These novel molecules reduce lipopolysaccharide (LPS)-induced acute inflammation in mice and improve muscle pathology in the <italic>mdx</italic> mouse model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD), suggesting that they would have potential clinical utility.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Nuclear factor κB (NF-κB) is a transcription factor essential for regulating immune responses, cell proliferation, apoptosis, embryonic development, senescence, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref001">1</xref>]. In mammalian cells, the NF-κB family is composed of 5 subunits, RelA/p65, RelB, C-Rel, p50 (p105/NF-κB1), and p52 (p100/NF-κB2), all containing a Rel-homology domain (RHD) required for homo- or heterodimerization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref001">1</xref>]. NF-κB dimers are sequestered in the cytoplasm by an inhibitory protein IκBα, which masks the conserved nuclear localization sequence (NLS) of RelA/p65 to prevent nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref001">1</xref>]. Upon stimulation, IκBα undergoes phosphorylation, polyubiquitination, and proteasome-mediated degradation, releasing the NF-κB dimers to enable nuclear translocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref001">1</xref>]. This activated NF-κB down- or up-regulates target gene expression by binding to the κB enhancer or promoter elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref001">1</xref>]. Inducers of NF-κB activity include pro-inflammatory cytokines, such as tumor necrosis factor α (TNF-α), interleukin-1 (IL-1), and lipopolysaccharide (LPS), as well as T-cell receptor (TCR) ligands, genotoxic, and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref001">1</xref>].</p>
<p>NF-κB activation is regulated by the IκB kinase (IKK) complex, composed of 2 catalytic subunits, IKKα and IKKβ, and a regulatory subunit NF-κB essential modulator (NEMO)/IKKγ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref004">4</xref>]. Domains in the C-termini of IKKα and IKKβ, required for interaction with the α-helical region in the N-terminus of NEMO, are termed NEMO-binding domains (NBDs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref005">5</xref>]. An 11–amino acid peptide derived from the NBD domain of IKKβ (amino acids 735–745) can disrupt the association of IKKβ and NEMO and reduce NF-κB activation when fused to a protein transduction domain (PTD) for intracellular delivery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The NBD peptide has strong therapeutic effects in numerous inflammatory and degenerative disease models in mice and other species. Chronic, systemic administration of the NBD peptide attenuates macrophage-mediated muscle necrosis and degeneration in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, a murine model of Duchenne muscular dystrophy (DMD) as well as in the golden retriever muscular dystrophy (GRMD) canine model of DMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref008">8</xref>]. Similarly, the NBD peptide ameliorates active chronic colitis in IL-10-deficient mice without affecting NF-κB basal activity when administered systemically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref009">9</xref>]. Intra-articular injection of NBD peptide also attenuates synovial inflammation and the severity of arthritis in a rat model of adjuvant arthritis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref010">10</xref>]. It also ameliorates inflammation-induced osteoclastogenesis and arthritis by down-regulating NF-κB target genes, TNF-α, and IL-1β [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref011">11</xref>]. Systemic delivery of the NBD peptide reduces the severity of Parkinson’s disease by suppressing nigral microglial activation and reducing dopaminergic neuronal loss as well as alleviates nephropathy and atherosclerosis in type 1 diabetic mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref014">14</xref>]. In addition, the peptide prevents LPS-induced pulmonary inflammation in sheep and improves pulmonary function in a piglet model of acute respiratory distress syndrome by topical administration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref016">16</xref>]. Moreover, clinical testing of the NBD peptide for local treatment of canine diffuse large B cell lymphoma revealed a reduction in the proliferation of malignant B cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref017">17</xref>]. In addition, chronic systemic administration of NBD peptide delays the onset and reduces the severity of multiple aging symptoms and pathology in <italic>Ercc1</italic><sup><italic>-/Δ</italic></sup> mice, a mouse model of human progeria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Despite these strong and varied therapeutic effects of PTD-NBD peptides in animal models, the expense of peptide synthesis, the short half-life of the peptide, and its lack of oral bioavailability limit its clinical use. Thus, development of small molecules that mimic the NBD peptide, targeting the NBD of IKKβ to disrupt its binding to NEMO, would have clinical utility. Here, a structure-based pharmacophore model that mimics these interactions was derived from the crystal structure of the IKK complex, followed by virtual screening using this model against commercially available databases of drug-like molecules. The resulting hits were prioritized using in silico Absorption, Distribution, Metabolism, Excretion, and Toxicity (ADME/Tox) filtering and molecular docking to determine the higher-affinity hits. Using these as starting points, multiple rounds of medicinal chemistry optimization resulted in the discovery of compounds capable of inhibiting LPS- and TNF-α-induced NF-κB activation by disrupting the association between IKKβ and NEMO. Also, these compounds exhibited potent therapeutic effects in murine models of LPS-induced endotoxemia and DMD, suggesting their potential as therapeutic drugs for clinical management of diseases driven by IKK/NF-κB activation.</p>

<title>Generation of a structure-based pharmacophore model using a computational approach based on the conserved interactions between IKKβ and NEMO</title>
<p>Recognition of small molecules by proteins is largely mediated by molecular surface complementarities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref020">20</xref>]. Thus, the site of protein–protein interaction between NEMO and IKKβ potentially is a good target for in silico drug screening. To investigate the chemical features essential in the protein–protein interaction, the X-ray structure of the NEMO/IKKβ complex retrieved from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) (ID 3BRV) was used to generate a structure-based pharmacophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref021">21</xref>] using the pharmacophore generation module of LigandScout [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref023">23</xref>]. Each interacting atom from each residue was “translated” into a pharmacophoric feature, resulting in the structure-based pharmacophore (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) consisting of 8 features and 13 exclusion volumes, representing important atoms from the protein’s environment.</p>

<title>Identification of small-molecule inhibitors of NF-κB activation</title>
<p>To determine whether the small molecules identified by the in silico screening inhibit NF-κB activation, a HEK293 cell line stably expressing a luciferase reporter driven by a synthetic, NF-κB-dependent promoter was utilized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref025">25</xref>]. To induce NF-κB activation, cells were treated with 10 ng/mL of TNF-α and harvested 3 h post treatment for analysis of luciferase activity. Treatment with ZINC12909780 slightly down-regulated NF-κB activation at a concentration of 100 μM, whereas the luciferase activity remained unchanged in cells treated with ZINC05682974 or ZINC09327678 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). To determine whether ZINC12909780 inhibits NF-κB in a dose-dependent manner, concentrations were tested at 0, 6.25, 25, 50, and 100 μM.

<p>To identify NBD mimetics with higher biological activity than ZINC12909780 or the NBD peptide, the ZINC 10.0 database (approximately 13.5 million compounds) was screened in silico for structurally similar compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref026">26</xref>]. Fifteen analogs with a similarity score &gt;90% were identified, and 13 that passed all the ADME/Tox filters were acquired for testing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004663.s006">S1 Table</xref>). Four of the compounds—ZINC9642366 (Zinc1), ZINC3369392 (Zinc5), ZINC3269261 (Zinc8), and ZINC3264658 (Zinc9), as well as an IKK active site inhibitor IKKi VII used as a positive control—lowered NF-κB activity robustly, while other analogs had minimal effects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To rule out the possibility that the reduction observed in luciferase assays was due to drug toxicity, a colorimetric MTT assay using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-dephenyltetrazolium bromide was performed to assess cell viability. Treatment with ZINC8 resulted in 40% of cell death at 24 h, suggesting that at least part of the reduction in luciferase activity could be attributed to cytotoxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Because ZINC5 displayed potent NF-κB inhibitory efficacy in cell culture with little toxicity (less than 10%), it was tested for dose-dependent inhibition of NF-κB. ZINC5 showed a greater inhibitory effect compared to ZINC12909780 without overt cell toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g002">Fig 2E &amp; 2F</xref>).</p>

<title>NBD mimetics inhibit NF-κB DNA binding activity</title>
<p>To confirm that the NBD mimetics reduce IKK kinase activity, phosphorylation of IκBα by IKK in response to 10 ng/ml of TNF-α was measured by western blot at 0, 5, and 10 min after stimulation. ZINC5 reduced the level of p-IκBα following stimulation, while ZINC12909780 led to a less robust reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). To determine whether the mimetics also reduce NF-κB DNA binding activity, electrophoretic mobility shift assay (EMSA) was conducted both in vitro and in vivo. ZINC5 and ZINC12909780 were tested in C2C12 cells (a mouse myoblast cell line) at 200 μM and were shown to inhibit TNF-α-induced NF-κB DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).

However, ZINC5 was extremely unstable even in cell culture media containing FBS, while ZINC12909780 was relatively more stable. The addition of acetonitrile increased the stability of both ZINC compounds, especially ZINC 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g003">Fig 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Optimization of the NBD mimetics</title>
<p>ZINC5 and ZINC12909780 both contain ester bonds, leading to their rapid degradation in the presence of serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). To improve bioactivity and stability, structure–activity relationship studies (SARs) were performed, and more than 100 small molecules were synthesized and tested. Four lead NBD mimetics that showed enhanced inhibitory effects, compared to the original ZINC compounds, were identified, including 3 non-esters—SR12343, SR12460, and SR12454—and 1 ester SR11481 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g004">Fig 4A &amp; 4B</xref>). These 3 non-esters significantly inhibited TNF-α-mediated NF-κB activation with half maximal inhibitory concentrations (IC<sub>50</sub>) of 11.34 μM, 20.24 μM, and 37.02 μM, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004663.t001">Table 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g004">Fig 4B</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004663.s002">S1A Fig</xref>). The ester SR11481 was not as effective (IC<sub>50</sub> 45.03 μM), possibly due to the presence of the ester bond (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). A renilla luciferase reporter was cotransfected for normalization. To determine whether the inhibitory effect of the mimetics is limited to TNF-α-mediated induction of IKK/NF-κB, LPS-mediated NF-κB activation was examined. NF-κB activity was induced in Raw 264.7 by 1 μg/ml of LPS for 2 h, and the IKKi VII (2 μM) and the 8K-NBD peptide (400 μM) were included as positive controls. Expression of the NF-κB target genes cyclooxygenase 2 (COX-2), IL-6, IL-1β, TNF-α, IκBα, and inducible nitric oxide synthase (iNOS) were determined by quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis. SR12460 and SR12454, which are more similar in structure than the other 2 mimetics, were able to significantly inhibit the transcription of all NF-κB target genes tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). SR12343 displayed a similar profile to the 8K-NBD peptide, showing significant inhibition on COX-2, IL-6, and iNOS expression at a much lower concentration (50 μM) compared to NBD peptide (400 μM). SR11481 did not induce a detectable suppression of the NF-κB target genes, likely due to its poor stability. IKKi VII, while able to inhibit most NF-κB target gene expression, failed to down-regulate iNOS expression, which was significantly inhibited by the NBD peptide and all non-ester NBD mimetics. This suggests that IKK inhibitors targeting the ATP-binding pocket likely down-regulate the expression of a slightly different set of NF-κB regulated genes.</p>

<title>NBD mimetics target the NEMO/IKKß interaction to inhibit NF-κB signaling</title>
<p>To determine whether the novel NBD mimetics target the NEMO-IKKβ interaction in vivo, co-immunoprecipitations were performed using extracts from Raw 264.7 macrophages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). All 4 of the mimetics reduce the IKKβ-NEMO interaction as well as or better than the NBD peptide, with SR12343 being the most effective. SR12343 also reduced the association between NEMO and IKKβ in Raw 264.7 cells in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). No interaction between NEMO and TNF receptor-associated factor 2 (TRAF2) or IκBα was observed under these conditions. Previous studies suggested that the NBD peptide also inhibits the interaction of NEMO with IKKα [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref027">27</xref>]. However, SR12343 had only a marginal effect on NEMO/IKKα binding only at the highest dose, suggesting that these inhibitors affect the NEMO/IKKα interaction with a much lower efficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To demonstrate that SR12343—which was the most effective mimetic in disrupting the NEMO/IKKβ interaction in vivo—affects the NEMO/IKKβ interaction directly, in vitro glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays were performed using recombinant GST-NEMO and FLAG-IKKβ. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, SR12343 was able to disrupt the interaction between GST-NEMO and FLAG-IKKβ even at a dose of 12.5 μM. To demonstrate that the reduction of NF-κB-mediated transcription upon stimulation of TNF-α and LPS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g004">Fig 4</xref>) is not due to off-target effects, the activation of NF-κB signaling and mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) pathways was examined by western blot analysis. The levels of phosphorylated IKK complex, IκBα, and p65 in response to TNF-α and LPS were all reduced by SR12343 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5D &amp; 5E</xref>). Consistently, the degradation of IκBα was partially reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5D &amp; 5E</xref>). However, there were no changes in the levels of phospho-c-Jun N-terminal kinase (p-JNK), p-p38MAPK, total JNK, and p38MAPK by treatment with SR12343 (150 μM) in response to TNF-α or LPS stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5G &amp; 5H</xref>). These results suggest that the observed inhibitory effects of SR12343 are mediated directly through IKK/NF-κB but not due to off-target effects such as through the JNK or p38MAPK pathways. SR12343 treatment also had no effect on the activation of noncanonical NF-κB pathway by anti-lymphotoxin β receptor (LTβR) as shown by unaltered processing from p100 to p52 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>

<title>Novel NBD mimetics suppress LPS-induced acute pulmonary inflammation in vivo</title>
<p>To determine the stability of the NBD mimetics in vivo, their levels were measured in the plasma of mice 2 h post i.p. injection with 10 mg/kg of each compound. The concentration of SR12460 was very high in plasma (&gt;6.5 μg/mL; 20 μM), while levels in brain, muscle, spleen, and liver were lower. SR12343 and SR12454 had lower plasma concentrations, with SR12343 showing a higher level in liver and SR12454 showing higher concentrations in muscle and spleen. The level of SR11481 was undetectable in plasma and tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Because SR12454 and SR12460 share similar chemical structures and SR11481 demonstrates poor in vivo exposure, SR12460 and SR12343 were selected for further in vivo analysis. However, it is important to note that SR12343 was not as orally active as SR123460 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004663.s002">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>To determine their NF-κB inhibitory effects in vivo, SR12343 and SR12460 were tested in an acute model of LPS-induced systemic endotoxemia. C57BL/6J mice were pretreated with vehicle control, 8K-NBD peptide, or NBD mimetics at 10 mg/kg for 30 min, followed by LPS induction at 10 mg/kg (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Lung and liver were harvested 2–4 h post treatment for qRT-PCR analysis of NF-κB target genes. SR12343 was able to significantly inhibit NF-κB transcriptional activity in lung, demonstrated by the inhibition of iNOS, IκBα, COX-2, and IL-6, while expression of TNF-α was unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). The NF-κB inhibitory effects of the compounds were less effective in liver compared to lung, demonstrated by significant inhibition of only COX-2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Despite lower plasma and tissue concentrations of SR12343 compared to SR12460, its inhibition of NF-κB/IKK in liver and lung were greater than that of SR12460 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). Similarly, acute treatment with SR12343 also affected the LPS-induced expression of NF-κB target genes at protein level. The extent of phosphorylation of IκBα and the levels of COX-2 were reduced in lung and liver tissues treated with SR12343 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Serum levels of IL-6 detected by ELISA increased significantly following LPS induction and were reduced by acute treatment with SR12343 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). These results are consistent with our RT-PCR analysis shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6C</xref>. However, no significant differences in lung histopathology were observed. Finally, there was a slight reduction in the number of white blood cells and neutrophils in the SR12343-treated group (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004663.t002">Table 2</xref>). Taken together, the results demonstrate that SR12343 and SR12460 are effective at attenuating LPS-induced acute lung inflammation by suppressing NF-κB target gene expression.</p>

<title>Novel NBD mimetics alleviate necrosis and muscle degeneration in mdx mice</title>
<p>Because SR12343 and SR12460 both reduced LPS-induced NF-κB activation in vivo, they were further tested in <italic>mdx</italic> mice, a mouse model of DMD in which NF-κB is chronically activated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref028">28</xref>]. <italic>Mdx</italic> mice develop normally at birth and undergo a massive myonecrosis starting at 3 wk. Treatment of <italic>mdx</italic> mice with IKK/NF-κB inhibitors effectively reduces inflammation, blocks necrosis, and increases muscle regeneration. Initially, the effect of acute treatment of SR12343 on NF-κB DNA binding activity in tibialis anterior (TA) muscle in 9-wk-old <italic>mdx</italic> mice was examined by EMSA. Treatment with a single injection of 30 mg/kg of SR12343 resulted in a reduction in NF-κB DNA binding 2 h post injection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004663.s005">S4C Fig</xref>). Subsequently, <italic>Mdx</italic> mice were chronically treated with vehicle, SR12343 (30 mg/kg), SR12460 (30 mg/kg), or 8K-NBD (10 mg/kg) starting from day 21, 3 times/wk for 4 wk, similar to the dosing regimen used with the NBD peptide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g007">Fig 7A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref007">7</xref>].

<p>To determine whether SR12343 and SR12460 improve muscle pathology, TA muscle was stained with hematoxylin–eosin to assess inflammatory infiltration, necrosis, central nucleation, and fibrosis. Vehicle-treated TA muscles exhibited extensive infiltration and necrosis as reflected by clusters of inflammatory cells, disorganized myofibers, and nonuniform staining, with limited muscle regeneration. Consistent with previous studies, 8K-NBD peptide treatment reduced inflammatory cell infiltration and necrosis as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g007">Fig 7B &amp; 7C</xref>, while not significantly affecting the percentage of centralized myonuclei (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004663.s005">S4A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref030">30</xref>]. SR12343 treatment led to the most significant pathological improvement, represented by limited infiltration and enhanced muscle reconstruction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g007">Fig 7B &amp; 7C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004663.s005">S4B Fig</xref>). Similarly, SR12460 treatment improved muscle pathology, although not as effectively as SR12343. In addition, Masson trichrome stain was conducted to further measure muscle fibrosis. Chronic treatment with SR12343 reduced muscle fibrosis (blue) in diaphragm and TA muscle tissues in comparison to control group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g008">Fig 8A &amp; 8B</xref>). To further quantitate the extent of inflammation in <italic>mdx</italic> muscle tissues, diaphragm and TA muscle were immunostained for cluster of differentiation 68 (CD68), a macrophage marker. Treatment with SR12343 reduced the number of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells by almost 50% per myofiber in both diaphragm and TA tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g008">Fig 8A &amp; 8B</xref>). Notably, there is a higher level of macrophage infiltration in diaphragm in comparison to TA, as reflected by a greater number of CD68<sup>+</sup> cells per myofiber. This result is consistent with the Trichrome stain in which the diaphragm exhibited more severe muscle fibrosis compared to TA. Moreover, qRT-PCR analysis revealed significant improvement of myofiber regeneration in SR12343-treated TA muscle relative to vehicle controls, evidenced by increased expression of embryonic myosin heavy chain (eMyHC) as well as paired box protein 7 (Pax7), a marker of skeletal muscle satellite cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). SR12460 and the 8K-NBD peptide also increased eMyHC expression, but to a lesser extent than SR12343. To quantify the average fiber size in an unbiased way, TA muscle was stained with laminin to outline myofibers, and Feret diameter of all myocytes was quantitated in a whole muscle section. Fiber size of centrally and noncentrally nucleated myofibers was smaller in mice treated with SR12343 and the 8K-NBD peptide, suggesting an active reconstruction of myofibers during the regenerative phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g007">Fig 7E &amp; 7F</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The NBD peptide derived from the NBD in IKKβ is highly therapeutic in numerous mouse and canine models of inflammatory and degenerative diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref018">18</xref>]. In fact, the NBD peptide is far more effective as a therapeutic than small-molecule inhibitors of the active site of IKKβ kinase. However, synthesis of the NBD peptide on a large scale can be problematic and extremely expensive, which impedes its clinical utility in humans, for whom a larger dose is needed compared to rodents and dogs. Also, the NBD peptide is not orally active. Thus, the development of small-molecule NBD mimetics represents a significant advance towards clinical translation of this established molecular target. Here, we identified and optimized several novel NBD mimetics that selectively inhibited IKK/NF-κB activation. The 2 lead compounds, SR12343 and SR12460, inhibited both TNF-α- and LPS-induced NF-κB activation more efficiently and at a lower concentration than the NBD peptide in both HEK293 and Raw 264.7 cells.</p>
<p>To identify the NBD mimetics, a computational screening campaign based on the pharmacophore model was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref021">21</xref>]. This structure-based pharmacophore model used has been utilized successfully to identify small-molecule inhibitors of p53 up-regulated modulator of apoptosis (PUMA) targeting its binding with B cell lymphoma 2 (Bcl-2) family members through the BH3 domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref031">31</xref>]. A crystal structure study of the NBD-IKKβ interaction demonstrated that amino acid residues W741, W739, and F734 are essential IKKβ hydrophobic motifs for dynamically interacting with NEMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, a comprehensive analysis of binding energy hot spots revealed 3 regions critical for the protein–protein interaction interface between NEMO and IKKβ: the documented NBD regions (W739, W741, and L742) and 2 novel hot spot regions centered on IKKβ residues L708/V709 and L719/I723 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref032">32</xref>]. Consistently, a mutated 11-mer NBD peptide (735–745)—with substitutions of arginine for W741 and W739—was unable to bind to NEMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref027">27</xref>]. A longer IKKβ-derived peptide (701–746) containing all 3 residues and domains exhibited the strongest affinity to NEMO, with IC<sub>50</sub> around 10 nM, compared to the traditional 11-mer NBD peptide that was less potent, with IC<sub>50</sub> around 100 μM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>To identify NBD mimetics with greater bioactivity, F734 not contained within the 11–amino acid NBD peptide was included in our pharmacophore model and in silico screening. The novel NBD mimetics identified and optimized were able to inhibit NF-κB activity in a dose-dependent manner (IC<sub>50</sub> approximately 10–40 μM) and were more potent than the 11-mer NBD peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref033">33</xref>]. These results are consistent with other results suggesting that, although IKKβ<sub>737–742</sub> is the core component essential for IKK complex formation, the larger region spanning IKKβ<sub>701–746</sub> enhances the binding affinity between IKKβ and NEMO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref034">34</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>The identified and optimized NBD mimetic SR12343 was able to dissociate the NEMO/IKKβ complexes both in vitro and in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5</xref>), consistent with previous reports that NBD peptide blocks the association of preformed IKK complexes in inactive state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref033">33</xref>]. Also, although the NBD peptide has been reported to block interaction of NEMO with IKKα and reduce IL-1-induced, IKKα-dependent NF-κB activation in mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref027">27</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref036">36</xref>], SR12343 disrupted the binding of NEMO and IKKα much less effectively. This specificity for NEMO/IKKβ could be due to the fact that there is a methionine in IKKα at position 734 instead of a phenylalanine, while F734 along with W739 and W741 was included for the generation of the pharmocophore model. Our results also demonstrated that the SR12343 suppressed TNF-α- and LPS-induced NF-κB activity by inhibiting the phosphorylation of IKK, IκBα, and p65 while not affecting JNK and p38MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5</xref>). It appears that SR12343 has a more substantial inhibition in LPS-induced NF-κB activation in comparison to TNF-α stimulation. This is possibly due to a stronger secondary NF-κB activation upon TNF-α stimulation by up-regulating the expression of multiple pro-inflammatory factors. MAPK signaling can be stimulated by similar pro-inflammatory factors, such as TNF-α and LPS, increasing expression of pro-inflammatory genes via AP-1 and NFAT [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref037">37</xref>]. In addition, SR12343 did not affect the noncanonical NF-κB pathway signaling through the LTβR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>NBD mimetics inhibited a unique subset of target genes compared to IKK kinase inhibitors, particularly iNOS both in vitro and in vivo. The expression of iNOS in response to LPS can be down-regulated 6-fold in Raw 264.7 cells and by 50% in both lung and liver, by the treatment of mice with NBD mimetics. iNOS is involved in arginine metabolism, leading to the production of citrulline and nitric oxide (NO), the latter of which—acting as a free radical—promotes cytotoxicity and tissue injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref038">38</xref>]. iNOS-null <italic>mdx</italic> mice have significantly reduced macrophage cytolysis and decreased myofiber injury at both acute, necrotic phase (4 wk) and regenerative phase (6–12 wk), suggesting a critical role of NO-mediated myonecrosis in the pathology of <italic>mdx</italic> mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref038">38</xref>]. We demonstrated a reduction in necrosis, fibrosis, and inflammatory infiltration in both the diaphragm and TA muscle in treated <italic>mdx</italic> mice—in particular, SR12343-treated <italic>mdx</italic> mice—compared to controls. Also, similar to <italic>mdx</italic> mice treated with NBD peptide, treatment with the NBD mimetics—SR12343, in particular—resulted in increased myogenesis as shown by higher expression of eMyHC and Pax7 and the smaller size of centrally nucleated fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004663.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This is consistent with the observed ability of NF-κB to regulate cell differentiation via its transcriptional regulation of cyclin D1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref039">39</xref>]. Taken together, our results suggest that small-molecule NBD mimetics can simultaneously inhibit pro-inflammatory responses, reduce macrophage cytotoxicity, and improve muscle degeneration, with an even greater efficacy than NBD peptide. No overt signs of liver toxicity from the chronically treated mice were observed, based on serum clinical chemistries.</p>
<p>We previously demonstrated that chronic treatment of the <italic>Ercc1</italic><sup>−/Δ</sup> mouse model of accelerated aging with the NBD peptide delayed the onset of numerous age-related symptoms, improved pathology, and reduced cellular senescence. Similar to the NBD peptide, preliminary experiments suggest that chronic treatment of <italic>Ercc1</italic><sup>−/Δ</sup> mice with SR12343 resulted in an extended health span. Thus, these novel NBD mimetics could be used not only for treatment of inflammatory and degenerative diseases but also for aging.</p>
<p>Collectively, our data demonstrate that the novel small-molecule NBD mimetics are potent and highly selective IKK inhibitors that act by disrupting the association of IKK complexes. They exhibit significant inhibitory effects on NF-κB activation in the model of LPS-induced acute lung injury (ALI) and the murine model of DMD (<italic>mdx</italic> mice), suggesting the potential of NBD mimetics to become a distinct class of anti-inflammatory drugs. Taken together, NBD mimetics may provide therapeutic value for the chronic management of inflammatory diseases and cancers in the future.</p>

<title>Muscle immunohistochemistry and quantification</title>
<p>To ensure rigorous quantitation of average fiber size, TA muscle was stained with laminin to outline myofibers. Using NIS Elements (Nikon, Melville, NY) analysis software, the laminin signal was corrected for background and underwent signal homogenization and structure amplification by utilizing a local contrast and kernel-based smoothing algorithm. Muscle fibers were defined by applying a uniform binary mask to the negative space of the laminin image, then segmented with the use of a Boolean operator to isolate only negative space overlapping with the total tissue area present in the image. Nuclei defined by Hoechst labeling (Sigma bisBenzimide H 33258) was defined using a uniform binary mask, and segmentation was performed with a watershed algorithm. Centrally nucleated fibers were determined by first eroding the binary mask of the muscle fibers so that only the central portion of each fiber was present. A Boolean operator was used to determine whether the eroded fibers overlapped with the nuclear-associated mask, and if so, they were considered to be centrally nucleated. Using the original muscle fiber mask, Feret diameters for centrally nucleated and noncentrally nucleated fibers were then measured.</p>

Features identified by the LigandScout software are those that take into consideration chemical functionality but not strict structural topology or definite functional groups. As a result, completely new potential pharmacons can be identified through database screening. Moreover, to increase the selectivity, the LigandScout model includes spatial information regarding areas inaccessible to any potential ligand, thus reflecting possible steric restrictions. In particular, excluded volume spheres placed in positions that are sterically not allowed are automatically added to the generated pharmacophore model. In this way, the structure-derived pharmacophore model contains the pharmacophore elements of the candidate ligands in response to the protein’s active site environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref041">41</xref>].</p>

Structure-based drug design approaches use this as the fundamental guiding principle; that is, closely related molecules will elicit similar activity in a biological assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref043">43</xref>]. The morphological similarity is a similarity technique dependent only on surface shape and charge characteristics of ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref044">44</xref>]. Morphological similarity is defined as a Gaussian function of the differences in the molecular surface distances of 2 molecules at weighted observation points on a uniform grid. The computed surface distances include both distances to the nearest atomic surface and distances to donor and acceptor surfaces. This function is dependent on the relative alignment of the molecules, and consequently their alignment and conformation must be optimized. The conformational optimization problem is solved by fragmentation, conformational search, alignment, and scoring, followed by incremental reconstruction from high-scoring aligned fragments. The alignment problem is addressed by exploiting the fact that 2 unaligned molecules or molecular fragments that have some degree of similarity will have some corresponding set of observers that are seeing the same things. Optimization of the similarity of 2 unaligned molecules or molecular fragments is performed by finding similar sets of observers of each molecule that form triangles of the same size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004663.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

<title>In silico ADME/Tox screening</title>
<p>Computational modeling tools were used to estimate the bioavailability, aqueous solubility, blood brain barrier potential, human intestinal absorption, the cytochrome P450 (i.e., CYP2D6) enzyme inhibition potential, mutagenicity, and hERG inhibition of the hits obtained from the database screening. The bioavailability, aqueous solubility, and human intestinal absorption were estimated using the ACD/ADME Boxes software (ACD Labs, Toronto, Canada; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acdlabs.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.acdlabs.com</ext-link>), while mutagenicity, hERG, and CYP2D6 inhibition were estimated with ACD/Tox screening (ACD Labs, Toronto, Canada; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.acdlabs.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.acdlabs.com</ext-link>).</p>

<p>All values were presented as mean +/− SEM or mean +/− SD. Microsoft Excel and Graphpad Prism 6 were used for statistical analysis. Two-tailed Student <italic>t</italic> test was performed to determine differences between 2 groups. When comparing differences in more than 2 groups, 1-way ANOVA (Dunnett test) was conducted. A value of <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05 was considered statistically significant, shown as “*” for <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.05, “**” for <italic>P</italic> &lt;0.01, and “***” for <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001.</p>
