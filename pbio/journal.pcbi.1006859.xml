<abstract>
<p>Combining structural proteomics experimental data with computational methods is a powerful tool for protein structure prediction. Here, we apply a recently-developed approach for <italic>de novo</italic> protein structure determination based on the incorporation of short-distance crosslinking data as constraints in discrete molecular dynamics simulations (CL-DMD) for the determination of conformational ensemble of the intrinsically disordered protein α-synuclein in the solution. The predicted structures were in agreement with hydrogen-deuterium exchange, circular dichroism, surface modification, and long-distance crosslinking data. We found that α-synuclein is present in solution as an ensemble of rather compact globular conformations with distinct topology and inter-residue contacts, which is well-represented by movements of the large loops and formation of few transient secondary structure elements. Non-amyloid component and C-terminal regions were consistently found to contain β-structure elements and hairpins.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>As the population ages, neurodegenerative diseases such as Parkinson’s disease will become an increasing problem in many countries. Aggregation of the protein α-synuclein is the primary cause of Parkinson’s disease, but there is still a dearth of structural information pertaining to the native, non-aggregating form of this protein. A better understanding the structural state of the native protein may prove useful for the design of new therapeutics to combat this disease. In order to obtain more structural information on this protein, we have recently modelled the native α-synuclein protein. These models were generated using a novel approach which combines protein crosslinking and discrete molecular dynamics simulations. We have found that the α-synuclein protein can adopt several shapes, all with a similar topology, resembling a three fingered closed claw. A region of the protein important for aggregation was found to be protected from the surrounding biological environment in these conformations, and the stabilization of these structures may be a fruitful avenue for future drug research into mitigating the cause and effect of Parkinson’s disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>α-Synuclein is involved in the pathogenesis of misfolding-related neurodegenerative diseases, in particular Parkinson’s disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref002">2</xref>]. A misfolding event leads to the formation of oligomers which are believed to result in cell toxicity and which eventually lead to the death of neuronal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref003">3</xref>]. α-Synuclein is thought to interact with lipid vesicles <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref004">4</xref>] and the toxicity is thought to be mediated via membrane disruption by misfolded oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref005">5</xref>]. Moreover, a prion-like spread of the pathology <italic>via</italic> the conversion of native α-synuclein molecules by toxic oligomers has been suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref006">6</xref>]. Native α-synuclein is considered to be an intrinsically disordered protein, although there is evidence that some globular structure exists in solution, which may serve as a basis for understanding the mis-folding and oligomerization pathways. A number of biophysical methods, such as NMR, EPR, FRET, and SAXS—in combination with computational methods—have been applied to the study of intrinsically disordered proteins, including the structure of α-synuclein in solution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref010">10</xref>]. In all of these cases, even a limited amount of experimental structural data was helpful in the characterization of the conformational ensemble of α-synuclein in solution.</p>
<p>Recently, we developed a method for determination of protein structures, termed short-distance crosslinking constraint-guided discrete molecular dynamics simulations (CL-DMD), where the folding process is influenced by short-distance experimental constraints which are incorporated into the DMD force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref011">11</xref>]. Adding constraints to DMD simulations results in a reduction of the possible conformational space and allows the software to achieve protein folding on a practical time scale. We have tested this approach on well-structured proteins including myoglobin and FKBP and have observed clear separation of low-energy clusters and a narrow distribution of structures within the clusters. The conformational flexibility of intrinsically disordered proteins, such as α-synuclein, brings additional challenges to the computational process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref012">12</xref>]. In cases like this, proteins exist as a collection of inter-converting conformational states, and crosslinking data represents multiple conformations of a protein rather than a single structure. In addition, recent research indicates that traditional force fields with their parametrization are not ideal for providing an accurate description of disordered proteins, and tend to produce more compact structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref013">13</xref>]. Recently research has been focused on improving traditional state-of-the-art force fields and their ability to predict structures of disordered proteins without losing their accuracy for structured proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref014">14</xref>]. In this work we use a Medusa force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref017">17</xref>] that is utilized in DMD simulations is discretized to mimic continuous potentials. DMD uses a united atom representation for the protein where all heavy atoms and polar hydrogens are explicitly accounted. The solvation energy is described in terms of the discretized Lazaridis-Karplus implicit solvation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref018">18</xref>] and inter-atomic interactions, such van der Waals and electrostatics, are approximated by a series of multistep square-well potentials.</p>
<p>Other additional potentials, such as pair-wise distance constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref020">20</xref>] and solvent accessibility information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref022">22</xref>] can also be readily integrated. During CL-DMD simulations there are no continuous forces that would drive the atoms to satisfy all constraints, rather generating conformational ensembles, which satisfy an optimal number of the constraints are generated. This, to some degree, naturally resolves conflicting experimental constraints. Thus, CL-DMD simulations are a viable computational platform for the structural analysis of intrinsically disordered proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref023">23</xref>] in general, and α-synuclein in particular.</p>
<p>Here, we used the CL-DMD approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref011">11</xref>] to determine conformational ensembles of the α-synuclein protein in solution. During this process, α-synuclein was crosslinked with a panel of short-range crosslinkers, crosslinked proteins were enzymatically digested, crosslinked residues were determined by LC-MS/MS analysis, and the resulting data on inter-residues distances were introduced into DMD force field as external constraints. To experimentally validate the predicted structures, we analyzed α-synuclein using surface modification (SM), circular dichroism (CD), hydrogen-deuterium exchange (HDX), and long-distance crosslinking (LD-CL).</p>

<p>α-Synuclein was crosslinked with a panel of short-range reagents azido-benzoic acid succinimide (ABAS-<sup>12</sup>C<sub>6</sub>/<sup>13</sup>C<sub>6</sub>), succinimidyl 4,4'-azipentanoate (SDA), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref024">24</xref>] triazidotriazirine (TATA-<sup>12</sup>C<sub>3</sub>/<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub>), [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref025">25</xref>] and 1-ethyl-3-(3-dimethylaminopropyl)carbodiimide (EDC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref026">26</xref>]. ABAS and SDA are hetero-bifunctional amino group-reactive and photo-reactive reagents, TATA is a homo-bifunctional photo-reactive reagent, and EDC is a zero-length carboxyl-to-amino group crosslinker. Crosslinked proteins were digested with proteinase K or trypsin proteolytic enzymes, and the digest was analyzed by LC-MS/MS to identify crosslinked peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s009">S1 Table</xref>). We used an equimolar mixture of <sup>14</sup>N- and <sup>15</sup>N-metabolically labeled α-synuclein to exclude potential inter-protein crosslinks from the analysis and to facilitate the assignment of crosslinked residues based on the number of nitrogen atoms in the crosslinked peptides and the MS/MS fragments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref027">27</xref>]. The distances between crosslinked residues are based on the length of the crosslinker reagents, and were introduced as constraints into the DMD potentials (see section below and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref011">11</xref>] for additional details). A total of 30 crosslinking constraints were used in these DMD simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s009">S1 Table</xref>).

<title>Expression and purification of α-synuclein</title>
<p>α-Synuclein was expressed using a pET21a vector provided by Dr. Carol Ladner of the University of Alberta. The protein was expressed in E. coli BL21(DE3) bacteria and was purified as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref025">25</xref>]. Briefly, the protein was overexpressed with 1 mM IPTG in 1L LB cultures of BL21DE3 E. coli for 4 hours at 30°C. Cells were lysed with a French press and the lysate was heated at 70°C for 10 minutes and then centrifuged at 14000 g for 30 minutes. The soluble fraction was precipitated for 1 hour in 2.1 M (NH<sub>4</sub>)<sub>2</sub>SO<sub>4</sub>. α-Synuclein was then purified by fast protein liquid chromatography on a Mono Q 4.6/100 SAX column (GE Life Science), using a gradient from 50–500 mM NaCl, in 50 mM Tris at pH 8.0. Elution fractions containing α-synuclein were further purified by size exclusion on a Superdex 200 30/100 GL column (GE Life Science). For the expression of metabolically labeled <sup>15</sup>N α-synuclein, 1L of M9 Minimal media was prepared with 1 g/L <sup>15</sup>NH<sub>4</sub>Cl (Cambridge Isotopes) as the sole source of nitrogen. BL21(DE3) cells were grown overnight in 50mL of this media, then seeded into 1 L, grown to an A<sub>600</sub> of approximately 0.8, and induced using 1 mM IPTG.

ABAS crosslinking reaction mixtures were incubated for 10 minutes in the dark to allow the NHS-ester reaction to take place, followed by 10 minutes of UV irradiation under a 25 W UV lamp (Model UVGL-58 Mineralight lamp, UVG) with a 254 nm wavelength filter. ABAS reaction mixtures were quenched with 10 mM ammonia bicarbonate. EDC reaction mixtures were incubated for 20 minutes. A portion of each crosslinking reaction mixture was checked by SDS-PAGE gel to see the extent of potential intermolecular crosslinked products. Aliquots were subsequently split and digested with either trypsin or proteinase K at an enzyme: protein ratio of 1:10. Digestion was quenched using a final concentration of 10 mM AEBSF (ApexBio), and samples were then acidified with formic acid for analysis by mass spectrometry. For TATA, 100 μM synuclein in 50 mM sodium phosphate buffer was reacted with 0.5 mM TATA-<sup>12</sup>C<sub>3</sub>/<sup>13</sup>C<sub>3</sub> (Creative Molecules). Samples were incubated for 5 minutes with 254 nm UV light from the same lamp as was used for the ABAS reactions. Samples were then split and digested with either proteinase K or trypsin at an enzyme: protein ratio of 1:20. For SDA reactions, 20 μL of 1mg/mL α-synuclein was crosslinked using 1 mM SDA (Creative Molecules, Inc.). Aliquots were incubated for 15 minutes in the dark prior to incubation under the same UV lamp as used previously for ABAS reactions but changing the wavelength to 366 nm. Samples were then run on an SDS-PAGE gel, and bands representing the α-synuclein monomer were excised and subjected to in-gel trypsin digestion. After in-gel digestion, samples were acidified using formic acid prior to mass spectrometric analysis. The CBDPS crosslinking reaction mixture consisted of 238 μL of 50 μM α-synuclein, with 0.12 mM CBDPS. Samples were split and digested with either proteinase K or trypsin at an enzyme: protein ratio of 1:10.

MS data were acquired using a data-dependent method. The data dependent acquisition also utilized dynamic exclusion, with an exclusion window of 10 ppm and exclusion duration of 60 seconds. MS and MS/MS events used 60000- and 30000-resolution FTMS scans, respectively, with a scan range of m/z 400–2000 in the MS scan. For MS/MS, the CID collision energy was set to 35%.

<p>Top-down ECD-FTMS hydrogen/deuterium exchange was performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref030">30</xref>]. Briefly, protein solution and D<sub>2</sub>O from separate syringes were continuously mixed in a 1:4 ratio (80% D<sub>2</sub>O final) via a three-way tee which was connected to a 100 μm x 5 cm capillary, providing a labeling time of 2 s.

In-cell ECD fragmentation experiments were performed using a cathode filament current of 1.2 A and a grid potential of 12 V. Approximately 800 scans were accumulated over the m/z range 200–2000, corresponding to an acquisition time of approximately 20 minutes for each ECD spectrum.

<title>Discrete molecular dynamics modelling</title>
<p>Crosslink guided discrete molecular dynamics (CL-DMD) simulations were performed according to the protocol described in our previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref011">11</xref>]. Briefly, discrete molecular dynamics (DMD) is a physically based and computationally efficient approach for molecular dynamics simulations of biological systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref017">17</xref>]. In DMD, continuous inter-atom interaction potentials are replaced with their discretized analogs, allowing the representation of interactions in the system as a series of collision events where atoms instantaneously exchange their momenta according to conservation laws. This approach significantly optimizes computations by replacing integration of the motion equations at fixed time steps with the solution of conservation-law equations at event-based time points [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref033">33</xref>]. In order to incorporate experimental data for inter-residue distances between corresponding atoms into DMD simulations, we introduced a series of well-shape potentials that energetically penalize atoms whose interatomic distance do not satisfy experimentally determined inter-atom proximity constraints. The widths of these potentials are determined by the cross-linker spacer length and side chain flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref011">11</xref>]. Starting from the completely unfolded structure of α-synuclein molecule, we performed an all-atom Replica Exchange (REX) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref034">34</xref>] simulations of the protein where 24 replicas with temperatures equally distributed in the range from 0.375 to 0.605 kcal/(mol k<sub>B</sub>), are run for 6 x 10<sup>6</sup> DMD time steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The simulation temperature of each of the replicates periodically exchanged according to the Metropolis algorithm allowing the protein to overcome local energetic barriers and increase conformational sampling. During the simulations we monitored the convergence of the system energy distribution specific heat curve, calculated by Weighted Histogram Analysis Method (WHAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref035">35</xref>] which was used as the indicator of system equilibration. We discarded the first 2 x 10<sup>6-time</sup> steps of system equilibration during the analysis. Next, we ranked all of the structures among all of the trajectories, and selected the ones with lowest 10% of the energies, as determined by the DMD Medusa force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref036">36</xref>]. These structures were then clustered using the GROMACS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref037">37</xref>] distance- based algorithm described by Daura et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref038">38</xref>]. It uses root-mean-square deviation (RMSD) between backbone Cα atoms as a measure of structural similarities between the cluster representatives. A RMSD cut-off was chosen to correspond to the peak of the distribution of pair-wise RMSDs for all of the low-energy structures. Because the energies of the resulting centroids representative of the clusters are very close to each other (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) and picking one of them would potentially introduce a bias related to our scoring energy function, we presented them all as our predicted models of the α-synuclein globular structure. We then calculated the root-mean-square deviation of atomic positions within each cluster and used this as a measure of fluctuations of the structures of corresponding centroids (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g002">2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g003">3</xref>).

<title>Results and discussion</title>
<p>In contrast to ordered proteins, where the lowest energy structures are usually represented by a few centroids with distinct conformations and folds close to the corresponding native structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref011">11</xref>], disordered proteins are usually represented by a broader variety of structures, which are distinct from each other, reflecting the conformational freedom of the intrinsically disordered protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref039">39</xref>]. In our case, the lowest energy structures forming the conformational ensemble for α-synuclein are shown as overlays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g004">Fig 4A</xref>. They can be described as rather compact globular structures with a common general topology, containing a few distinct secondary structure fragments. Overall, a distinct topology can be observed for all these conformers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). The protein forms a three-prong closed claw-like shape with the N-terminal (blue), intermediate (yellow), and C-terminal (red) subdomains having converged at the top, with the connecting subdomain (green) being located at the bottom of the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g004">Fig 4</xref>). The C-terminal portion of the molecule was found in close proximity to the N-terminal portion, possibly reflecting long-range electrostatic interactions between these subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g004">Fig 4</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref008">8</xref>]. The C-terminal portion was also in contact with the intermediate subdomain—in some conformers it protruded deeper into the structure and was positioned between the N-terminal and the intermediate subdomains. It should be noted that non-N-acetylated α-synuclein protein was used in this study, although in the cell, α-synuclein is predominantly N-acetylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref040">40</xref>], and this post-translational modification may have some effect on the protein structure by increasing the propensity of the N-terminus to form an α-helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref041">41</xref>], and that this may affect the aggregation of synuclein under some conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref043">43</xref>]. N-terminal acetylation, however, does not appear to have a significant effect on the propensity of synuclein to aggregate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref044">44</xref>] under lipid-free conditions, and it therefore seems that the structural features important for predicting aggregation and designing small molecules to affect misfolding are also present in the absence of acetylation.</p>

<p>Some of the experimental constraints may conflict with each other due to the fact that proteins exist in multiple conformations. During DMD simulations, the total potential is minimized, satisfying an optimal number of constraints and generating an ensemble of structures satisfying subsets of consistent experimental constraints. This ensemble is further clustered into substates that represent subsets of non-conflicting constraints. Depending on the conformation and the number of constraints that are satisfied, these structures will have different energy scores assigned by the force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref036">36</xref>]. This allows us to account for both the nature of conformational changes of the protein in solution (i.e., while the structure of the protein is “breathing” and transitioning between conformations), and possible errors during the determination of the experimental constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref012">12</xref>]. Nevertheless, we found that the lowest-energy conformers satisfy most of the experimental distance constraints (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s004">S4 Fig</xref>), while the models with higher energy satisfy a lower number of constraints. No quantitative crosslinking data or weighting of observed crosslinks were used in the simulations, but more-populated conformations have a higher chance of being represented in the resulting crosslinking dataset, given that crosslinks are not randomly distributed and are most likely to form between residues which spend a significant amount of time within close contact. A comparison of predicted structures within the ensemble revealed that the conformational changes to the protein structure were mainly due to movement of the large loops and hairpins constituting the N-, C-terminal, and intermediate subdomains.</p>
<p>The validity of this ensemble was tested by removing all of the crosslinking constraints and allowing the structure to relax over 2x10<sup>6</sup> steps, to see if the structure was stabilized only by the potentials enforcing satisfaction of the experimental crosslinks. The predicted representatives of the clusters were allowed to fluctuate in this way, and the result was a relatively minor expansion of the protein (results for the centroid of the most representative lowest energy cluster, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, are shown for clarity), from a radius of gyration of 14.1 Å initially, to an average of 15 Å (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). This indicates that the structure has not been overfit to the experimental data during the simulation, which can be a problem when modelling intrinsically disordered proteins with experimental distance constraints [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>The crosslinking analysis applied here is conceptually similar to the PRE-NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref040">40</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref046">46</xref>] or FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref048">48</xref>] techniques used for the prediction of α-synuclein conformational ensembles, with pairwise distances between crosslinked residues being analogous to the pairwise distances between the spin-label and the atomic nuclei of the protein in case of PRE-NMR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s006">S6 Fig</xref>) or between fluorophores, in the case of FRET. The lowest energy-cluster centroids in our ensemble tend to be more compact than those based on PRE-NMR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s006">S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s007">S7</xref> Figs), FRET ensembles, or SAXS data. It has been suggested that the higher values of the radius of gyration determined by these techniques may be caused by an existing equilibrium between the monomeric and multimeric states of the synuclein protein under the experimental conditions used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref050">50</xref>]. SAXS data can be uniquely sensitive to the more-extended conformations of the ensemble [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref049">49</xref>]. Unconstrained all-atom molecular dynamics simulations produced multimodal distributions which included compact states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref049">49</xref>], although it was noted that modelling disordered proteins may require the development of specialized force fields [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref049">49</xref>]. It was also shown that the addition of experimental distance constraints to the all-atom Monte Carlo conformational search leads to more compact structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref049">49</xref>]. Thus, representation of the slightly more compact states may still be caused by bias due to the short-range crosslinking reagents used in this study, as well as by the traditional parameterization of the Medusa force field [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition, we selected the lowest-energy structures for our clustering and model selection, which eliminated some of the unfolded less-compact states, while in the PRE-NMR based approach, the authors used all of the generated structures for the analysis. We are confident in this approach as these lower energy conformations were also compatible with the long-distance crosslinks. The other difference between these two techniques is the range of distance constraints produced. The PRE-NMR technique uses distances up to ~2 nm. Local residue-specific conformational preferences are not well reproduced in the PRE-RMD ensembles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref046">46</xref>]. When applying CL-DMD for well-structured model proteins, i.e., proteins with known crystal structure, we also found that long-distance constraints (&gt;15 A) were not particularly helpful in finding the true protein structure solutions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref011">11</xref>]. Short-distance constraints were critical in finding the correct local conformations in well-structured proteins and might possibly be helpful in producing more detailed structures in the case of the CL-DMD ensembles described here.</p>
<p>Some transient secondary-structure elements were observed in the conformers of the ensemble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The extent and the location of the predicted secondary-structure motifs in the lowest-energy conformer were in good agreement with the experimental data obtained by HDX and CD. Thus, ~25 of the total number of protected protons were detected by HDX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g001">Fig 1</xref>) of the whole protein, and ~2.4% of α- and 29.1% of β-structure was detected by CD. We were able to detect amide HDX protection only when the exchange time was reduced from ten seconds to two seconds, which indicates the transient nature of the secondary structure observed. The location of the predicted secondary structure within the N-terminal portion of the protein was confirmed by determining the protection status of individual residues using the c-ion fragment series (i.e., the fragments starting from N-terminus) as obtained by ECD MS/MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g001">Fig 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Here, we observed some propensity for the protein to form α-helical secondary structure near the N-terminus, particularly between residues 25–55. However, it is not nearly as extensive as the secondary structure formed in the presence of detergent micelles. In particular, two centroids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>) show a greater tendency towards α-helicity, and together represent some 48% of the ensemble.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, for this protein, using ECD or ETD fragmentation we were unable to obtain reliable z-ion fragment series (i.e., fragments starting from the C-terminus) which would have spanned the predicted β-structural elements, probably due to the high net negative charge on the C-terminal portion of the molecule. However, the amount of protection predicted in the structure of the C-terminal part of the model, added to observed protection of the N-terminal part from ECD-HDX data, is in agreement with the total protection value of the protein (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s008">S8 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We then used our recently developed top-down UVPD-HDX method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref051">51</xref>] in an attempt to determine the possible locations of secondary structure in the C-terminal portion of the α-synuclein molecule. We were able to observe a number of UVPD-specific fragment ions spanning the C-terminal portion of the protein sequence—a region which had previously not been covered. Deuteration analysis of these fragments allowed us to confirm the presence of secondary structure in this region and to further narrow the location of the secondary-structure elements to residues 116–119 and 128–138, and ~10 protected residues in the residue 71–116 segment of the sequence (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1006859.s008">S8</xref> Figs). Surface modification results were in agreement with the final α-synuclein structures. As expected, lysine residues which ended up being exposed to the solvent in the model were equally modified with PCAS in the unfolded and folded states (i.e., with and without 8 M urea), and residues which were partially buried in the model exhibited a larger extent of modification in the fully unfolded state with 8 M urea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g006">Fig 6</xref>). The long-distance intra-protein CBDPS crosslinks were also in good agreement with the final models of the protein.</p>

<p>Interestingly, the aggregation-prone non-amyloid-β component (NAC) region, which is reportedly involved in the nucleation of the aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref052">52</xref>], was consistently predicted to contain hairpins in extended conformation, which were in contact with the C-terminal loop, which, in turn, interacted with the N-terminal sub-domain. It would be intriguing to see if a distortion of any of these interactions could lead to an “opening up” of this region which might facilitate stacking interactions with similar portions of other monomers during the aggregation initiation. We are currently performing CL-DMD-based differential structural characterization of α-synuclein oligomers, in comparison to the native structures reported here, in order to localize critical mis-folding events leading to the pathological aggregation. Two recent studies, by Lautenschlager <italic>et al</italic>. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref004">4</xref>] and Fusco et al [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref005">5</xref>] have indicated that cellular toxicity of synuclein oligomers may be dependant on both the N- and C-terminal domains and their interactions with lipid bilayers. In toxic oligomeric species, the synuclein N-terminus has less interaction with the membrane surface, and this interaction is replaced by an interaction with the NAC region, leading to toxicity. In the case of the C-terminus, increased concentrations of calcium may create a charge-neutralizing effect, which leads to increased toxicity and oligomer formation, possibly by disrupting its interaction with the NAC region.</p>
<p>The β-structure in the NAC-containing intermediate domain and in the C-terminal subdomain of the predicted ensemble is in general agreement with the C-terminal half of the protein’s propensity towards formation of β-structure, as determined by NMR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref007">7</xref>]. The fact that, in the ensemble, the NAC region was repeatedly found to contain β-structure-like hairpins may explain the propensity of this region to form inter-molecular β-structures which appear early in the aggregation process. These hairpins also resemble those observed in the aggregating form of Aβ1–40 found in fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref053">53</xref>], and in the mature fibrillar form of the synuclein protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref054">54</xref>]. This increases our confidence in the significance of this particular transient structure in the native protein. In agreement with previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref045">45</xref>], we also found that the NAC region was in contact with C- terminal portion of the molecule, but in our ensemble it is not quite shielded by it, as was suggested. Rather, it is stabilized by β-sheet-like contacts. Additionally, the residues V74-V82 within the NAC region, which has been shown to be critical for incorporation into newly forming fibrils (Ricardo <italic>et al</italic>., 2018), remains somewhat exposed in the most favorable conformations of the ensemble, and with this region already incorporating important β-sheet contacts, it seems primed for incorporation into newly-forming fibrils, which may help explain the tendency for native synuclein to spontaneously form fibrils with mere agitation.</p>
<p>The structures of the major α-synuclein conformational clusters determined here and the presence of the secondary structure detected in the NAC region and C-terminal portions of the molecule allowed us to hypothesize a possible mechanism for the misfolding conformational change and the early aggregation events. The existence of the transient hairpin/beta-structure in the NAC and C-terminal subdomains predisposes the protein to form the beta-nucleation sites of the early oligomers, which may further mature to the cross-beta-structure of the fibrils. The mis-folding conformational change that is necessary for the formation of inter-molecular contacts would then be the detachment of the NAC-containing hairpin (possibly in concert with stabilizing C-terminal beta-strands) from the core of the molecule. This would provide a stacking template for the similarly detached NAC hairpin of the other α-synuclein molecule. This hypothesis can be tested by determining the structure of the early oligomers, which is currently underway in our laboratories.</p>
<p>The locations of the mutations shown to be influencing the aggregation of the α-synuclein within the proposed structure is interesting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1006859.g007">Fig 7</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref055">55</xref>]. The familial mutations A30P, E46K, H50Q, G51D and A53 T/E [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref056">56</xref>] were found to located on the same surface of the connecting subdomain. Although the effects of the these mutations could possibly be produced via different mechanisms (such as modified membrane binding or fibril stability), at least the effect of the oligomer-promoting mutations A30P and A56P can be explained in terms of the structure described here, where they would increase the segmental flexibility and possibly relax the location and interaction of the N-terminal subdomain with the core of the molecule. A76P oligomer-promoting mutation similarly would facilitate segmental flexibility and the detachment of the NAC-containing β-hairpin postulated above. The S87E mutation, which blocks α-synuclein oligomerization and fibrilogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1006859.ref057">57</xref>], would possibly disrupt NAC β-hairpin via electrostatic repulsion with the E83 residue.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>In summary, we have determined <italic>de novo</italic> the conformational ensemble of native α-synuclein in solution by short-distance crosslinking constraint-guided DMD simulations, and validated this structure with experimental data from CD, HDX, SM, and LD-CL experiments. The predicted conformational ensemble is represented by rather compact globular conformations with transient secondary structure elements. The obtained structure can serve as a starting point for understanding the mis-folding and oligomerization of α-synuclein.</p>

<title>Replica exchange (REX) rate illustration.</title>
<p>The plot shows the exchange rates between 24 replicas during DMD REX simulation. Each replicate is represented by line of its own colour (from red to blue). Each 24 of the replicates starts with temperatures equally distributed in the range from 0.375 to 0.605 kcal/(mol k<sub>B</sub>) and is run for 6 x 10<sup>6</sup> DMD time steps. The first 2 x 10<sup>6</sup> DMD time steps were disregarded during the analysis to account for equilibration of the simulation. During the simulation, replicates exchange their temperatures allowing “colder” replicates to “heat up” and “hot” replicates to “cool down” (lines moving up and down in the plot), which assists in overcoming small local energy barriers. As it can be seen, each replicate (line of each colour) passes through different temperatures from low to high, which indicates that all replicates are well mixed (the plot is highly mosaic) during the simulation. For each replicate, states with different temperatures are visited during REX simulation, which suggests that the REX analysis is adequate.</p>
