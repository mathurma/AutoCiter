                <p>During development, signaling networks control the formation of multicellular
                    patterns. To what extent quantitative fluctuations in these complex networks may
                    affect multicellular phenotype remains unclear. Here, we describe a
                    computational approach to predict and analyze the phenotypic diversity that is
                    accessible to a developmental signaling network. Applying this framework to
                    vulval development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, we demonstrate that
                    quantitative changes in the regulatory network can render ∼500
                    multicellular phenotypes. This phenotypic capacity is an order-of-magnitude
                    below the theoretical upper limit for this system but yet is large enough to
                    demonstrate that the system is not restricted to a select few outcomes. Using
                    metrics to gauge the robustness of these phenotypes to parameter perturbations,
                    we identify a select subset of novel phenotypes that are the most promising for
                    experimental validation. In addition, our model calculations provide a layout of
                    these phenotypes in network parameter space. Analyzing this landscape of
                    multicellular phenotypes yielded two significant insights. First, we show that
                    experimentally well-established mutant phenotypes may be rendered using
                    non-canonical network perturbations. Second, we show that the predicted
                    multicellular patterns include not only those observed in <italic>C.
                    elegans</italic>, but also those occurring exclusively in other species of the
                        <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. This result demonstrates that
                    quantitative diversification of a common regulatory network is indeed
                    demonstrably sufficient to generate the phenotypic differences observed across
                    three major species within the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. Using our
                    computational framework, we systematically identify the quantitative changes
                    that may have occurred in the regulatory network during the evolution of these
                    species. Our model predictions show that significant phenotypic diversity may be
                    sampled through quantitative variations in the regulatory network without
                    overhauling the core network architecture. Furthermore, by comparing the
                    predicted landscape of phenotypes to multicellular patterns that have been
                    experimentally observed across multiple species, we systematically trace the
                    quantitative regulatory changes that may have occurred during the evolution of
                    the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>During development, regulatory signaling networks instruct cell populations to form
                multicellular patterns and structures. To what extent perturbations in the
                quantitative performance of these networks may lead to phenotypic changes remains
                unclear. Experimental genetics studies typically uncover mutant phenotypes that
                emerge from extreme modes of perturbation (e.g., knockout or overexpression) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-NussleinVolhard1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Sulston1">[2]</xref>. However, there is ample evidence that biological
                networks operate amidst quantitative fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-ColmanLerner1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Volfson1">[6]</xref>. The
                sources of these quantitative perturbations include stochastic behavior, population
                heterogeneity, epigenetic effects and environmental changes.</p>
            <p>The fundamental question then is how much phenotypic variation is possible by
                quantitative perturbations in network performance without wholesale changes to
                network topology. On the one hand, we may expect that the wild-type multicellular
                phenotype may be highly robust to quantitative variations. Indeed, computational
                analysis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> segment polarity network demonstrated
                the robustness of the wild-type multicellular pattern to significant parameter
                changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-vonDassow1">[7]</xref>. This robustness may be a more pervasive property of
                developmental regulatory networks that allows their modular utilization in different
                multicellular geometries and developmental contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Meir1">[8]</xref>. On the other hand, for a
                given multicellular system, some degree of fragility in the regulatory network is
                essential for evolutionary diversification. New multicellular phenotypes must be
                accessible through modifications to the underlying regulatory network, providing
                avenues for sampling new phenotypes that may be more beneficial under different
                selective pressures.</p>
            <p>The extent to which this phenotypic diversification must involve a topological
                overhaul of the regulatory network as opposed to quantitative changes to a fixed
                network topology remains unclear. Closely related species may have evolved by
                subtle, quantitative changes in network interactions rather than large-scale changes
                to network topology. Indeed, there is evidence for such “quantitative
                diversification” of phenotypes in the evolution of maize and finch beaks
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Abzhanov1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Doebley1">[10]</xref>. However, analyzing extant species identifies
                only quantitative changes that have withstood selection and conceals the complete
                phenotypic diversity that a regulatory network can render. Meanwhile, experimentally
                reconstructing that diversity faces the challenge of systematically imposing
                quantitative regulatory perturbations <italic>in vivo</italic> and scoring the
                numerous phenotypes that would be generated.</p>
            <p>Computational modeling has proven to be a useful tool for predicting multicellular
                patterns and morphology based on the underlying regulatory mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-vonDassow1">[7]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Amonlirdviman1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Tomlin1">[18]</xref>. Thus, such models may
                provide an effective framework to explore the full diversity of phenotypes that is
                accessible through quantitative changes to a particular developmental regulatory
                network. Here, we develop a computational approach to analyze quantitatively the
                phenotypic diversity of <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulval development. The
                    <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulva develops from an array of six precursor cells
                that commit to a spatial pattern of distinct fates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Greenwald1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Sulston2">[20]</xref>. We
                have described previously a mathematical model of the regulatory network that
                controls <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulval development and elucidated potential
                quantitative advantages of the biochemical coupling in this signaling network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Giurumescu2">[21]</xref>. In
                this work, we extend this mathematical model of the signaling network to make
                predictions about the range of phenotypes that this network can render. We probed
                whether this developmental network is so robust to parameter changes that only a
                narrow set of multicellular phenotypes is possible. Or, can quantitative variations
                give rise to a broader range of phenotypes? In contrast to other recent models of
                    <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulval development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Fisher1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Fisher2">[13]</xref>, our model incorporates
                directly the underlying molecular mechanisms and the quantitative strength of these
                molecular regulatory pathways. Thus, it provides the necessary foundation for
                examining quantitative diversification of multicellular phenotype.</p>

            <p>Our computational analysis reveals that a significant amount of phenotypic diversity
                is achievable through quantitative changes to the regulatory network. Thus, this
                developmental regulatory network is not “wired” to generate
                robustly only the wild-type phenotype. Furthermore, the phenotypes predicted by the
                model include not only those observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, but also those
                found exclusively in several closely-related species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Felix1">[22]</xref>. Thus, our model
                predictions validate the hypothesis that quantitative changes to a common regulatory
                network have occurred during the diversification of several species within the

                framework to analyze published experimental phenotypic data, we extract the
                quantitative regulatory differences that may have accrued during the evolution of
                three major species of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus.</p>

                <p>We sought to better understand how much phenotypic diversity a developmental
                    regulatory network can produce through quantitative changes without altering the
                    network architecture. To conduct this analysis, we started with our previously
                    reported mathematical model of the regulatory network that controls vulval
                    development in <italic>C. elegans</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Giurumescu2">[21]</xref>. This model uses ordinary differential equations
                    to track the activity of two key signals in each precursor cell: MAP kinase and
                    the lateral Notch signal (details are provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The
                    levels of these two signals are then used to predict the fate of each cell. The
                    model consists of eight dimensionless parameters whose values influence the
                    pattern of fate choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g002">Figure
                    2A</xref>). To determine the phenotypes that are accessible through quantitative
                    modulation of the network, we allowed each parameter to vary across a broad
                    range of physiological values (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). For each combination of
                    parameter values, the multicellular phenotype was computed. In this manner, the

                            as the wild-type

                <p>This phase diagram of phenotypes represents the predicted multicellular patterns
                    that the vulval developmental network can produce. Extreme values along each
                    parameter axis emulate the classical experimental scenario where specific
                    molecular pathways are eliminated (e.g., knock out) or overexpressed. Away from
                    these extremes, the phase diagram represents phenotypes that are predicted to
                    occur when regulatory mechanisms are tuned quantitatively without wholesale
                    changes to network topology. Thus, by counting the number of unique phenotypes
                    that exist in this multidimensional parameter space, we sought to quantify the
                    “phenotypic capacity” of the <italic>C. elegans</italic>
                    vulval signaling network.</p>
                <p>Our calculations show that the phenotypic capacity has an upper limit. That is,
                    even as the parameter space is broadened, the number of distinct phenotypes
                    saturates at approximately 560 multicellular patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). This result reveals that the
                    developmental network is not constrained to a few outcomes. The wild type and a
                    handful of well-studied mutant phenotypes by no means represent the phenotypic
                    capacity of this system. Furthermore, in this six-cell system there are four
                    fates possible to each cell (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Hence, the theoretical
                    upper limit to the number of phenotypes is 4,096. Our model predicts that the
                    molecular network constrains the system from accessing ∼85%
                    of the theoretically possible phenotypes.</p>
                <p>To better understand how the phenotypes are represented in parameter space, we
                    determined the amount of parameter space associated with each phenotype (see
                    <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Phenotypes that occur only at a few points in parameter
                    space may be inaccessible experimentally, while their counterparts occupying a
                    large fraction of parameter space may represent the more tangible outcomes. The
                    distribution of Parameter Space Occupancy (PSO) resembles a log-normal
                    distribution (μ = −19.60,
                    σ = 4.90) with a slight positive skew
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). On the low
                    end of the distribution, our model predicts 19 phenotypes that are two standard
                    deviations below the mean PSO (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s010">Table S4</xref>), and 9 of these phenotypes do not
                    entail the mixed ‘m’ cell fate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s007">Table S1</xref>).
                    Consistent with this prediction, none of these predicted phenotypes are among
                    the well-studied experimentally observed phenotypes. These highly unlikely
                    outcomes reduce our evaluation of the overall phenotypic capacity of this
                    system.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, on the other end of the distribution, a small subset of phenotypes
                    occupies a disproportionately large portion of the parameter space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Within the
                    positive skew is the wild-type phenotype, consistent with a previous study that
                    showed that the developmental segment polarity network robustly produces the
                    wild-type multicellular pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-vonDassow1">[7]</xref>. Extending beyond
                    the wild-type phenotype, our model predicts an additional 33 phenotypes with PSO
                    values that are two standard deviations above the mean (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s011">Table S5</xref>
                    for a list of these phenotypes), 25 of which do not entail the mixed
                    ‘m’ cell fate. These phenotypes are highly represented in
                    parameter space and suggest that significant phenotypic diversity may be sampled
                    by tuning quantitatively a common underlying regulatory network. In fact,
                    consistent with model predictions, several of these 25 phenotypes have been
                    observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Greenwald2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Sternberg1">[24]</xref>. However, 10 of
                    these 25 phenotypes have not been reported and are novel predicted phenotypes
                    for future experimental validation.</p>
                <p>To further evaluate these 10 novel phenotypes, we developed two metrics that
                    provide additional insights into how phenotypes are distributed in parameter
                    space. While the PSO metric quantifies what fraction of points in parameter
                    space are associated with a particular phenotype, it does not report how these
                    points are distributed in parameter space. One extreme is that the parameter
                    points associated with a phenotype are disjointed and scattered throughout
                    parameter space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).
                    In this case, a perturbation in any parameter value would alter the phenotype,
                    i.e. the phenotype would be highly fragile to parameter changes. The other
                    extreme is that the parameter points are contiguous and clustered together into
                    a subspace. In this scenario, the phenotype would be more robust to parameter
                    variations. However, the level of robustness would depend on the shape of the
                    phenotype subspace. A phenotype subspace that contains a high fraction of points
                    at the “surface” (i.e., borders parameter points belonging
                    to another phenotype) would be less robust than a phenotype where all its
                    parameter points are tightly packed into a subspace with minimal exposure to
                    other phenotypes.</p>

                            effecting a random unit-value parameter change from a randomly selected
                            point in the phenotype. Isolated points in the parameter space do not
                            contribute to the CS metric as unit-value parameter changes starting at
                            such points would lead to exiting the phenotype. Interior points however
                            are fully connected to neighbors and contribute the most to the CS
                            metric. (B) Schematic of the Mean Path Length (MPL) metric of phenotype

                            phenotype. The larger the value, the more robust the phenotype to random

                            CS/MPL values lower than 0.5/1.0, while the MPL is a better metric at
                            values higher than these thresholds.</p>

                <p>To capture these aspects of how parameter points of a particular phenotype are
                    distributed in parameter space, we developed a Connectivity and Shape (CS)
                    metric (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The value of the CS metric is bounded between 0
                    and 1 and represents the average likelihood that for any point in phenotype
                    subspace, a unit change in any single parameter value maintains the phenotype
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Thus, a CS
                    value of 0 would refer to a highly fragile phenotype whose points in parameter
                    space are “isolated” or surrounded by other phenotypes. In
                    contrast, a CS value of near 1 would refer to a highly robust phenotype for
                    which most of the points in its parameter subspace are surrounded by other
                    points associated with the same phenotype. As a complementary approach to gauge
                    the robustness of a phenotype to parameter changes, we quantified the Mean Path
                    Length (MPL) as the average number of unit changes or
                    “jumps” in parameter values needed to start from any point
                    within a phenotype subspace and land on a foreign phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, Materials and
                        Methods)<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Dayarian1">[25]</xref>. Large values of MPL indicate that many
                    changes in parameter values are needed to change phenotype, signifying a highly
                    robust phenotype.</p>
                <p>We calculated the MPL and CS metrics for the 26 phenotypes with the highest PSO,
                    including the wild-type phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). In addition, we computed these metrics for two
                    phenotypes (1°2°2°1°2°1° and
                    2°1°2°1°2°1°) that occupy less
                    parameter space (ranked 78<sup>th</sup> and 79<sup>th</sup>, respectively, in
                    terms of PSO, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) but
                    are well-established experimental outcomes. Among these 28 phenotypes, our
                    calculations show a high correlation between MPL and CS, suggesting that these
                    two metrics are equivalent ways to gauge the robustness of a phenotype to
                    parameter variations. The model predicts seven phenotypes with CS and MPL values
                    greater than that of wild type. All seven are experimentally observed in
                        <italic>C. elegans</italic>, suggesting that robustness, as quantified by
                    these metrics, may be an important determinant of experimental realizability.
                    Meanwhile, there are 20 phenotypes with CS/MPL metrics lower than the wild type.
                    Among these 20, ten have been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic> genetics
                    experiments, while the remaining 10 are the aforementioned novel phenotypes that
                    have not been observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Notably, the CS and MPL
                    values of some of these novel phenotypes (e.g.,
                    2°2°2°3°2°2°,
                    3°2°2°3°2°2°, and
                    3°2°3°1°3°2°) falls within the
                    range of experimentally observed counterparts, suggesting that these novel
                    phenotypes may be the most realizable experimentally upon performing the correct
                    manipulations in the LIN-3/MAP kinase and the LIN-12 pathways.</p>

                <title>Identifying optimal molecular perturbations to render specific mutant
                    phenotypes</title>
                <p>Having predicted novel phenotypes and the experimental realizability of these
                    outcomes, a key question is how does one render such phenotypes experimentally?
                    The classical computational approach is to choose reference parameter values for
                    the wild-type phenotype and then to test the effect of specific parameter
                    perturbations. The choice of parameter perturbation is motivated typically by a
                    corresponding mutation that has been performed experimentally with the goal of
                    determining whether the predicted phenotype matches the experimental outcome.
                    The pitfall, however, is that suitable reference parameter values for the
                        <italic>in vivo</italic> biochemistry of signaling pathways in live worms
                    are unknown. Furthermore, worms are not quantitative clones, and each worm is
                    likely to differ in its parametric settings. Finally, the execution of a
                    particular experimental perturbation is unlikely to be realized in the same
                    quantitative manner in each worm in every trial.</p>
                <p>Based on these considerations, we take a different approach that is enabled by
                    the phase diagram of phenotypes that we have computed for this system. Using
                    this phase diagram, we determine all possible single-parameter changes (i.e.,
                    single mutations) that successfully transition the wild-type phenotype into a
                    mutant phenotype of interest. The fraction of these successful single-parameter
                    changes that is associated with a particular parameter reveals the relative
                    efficacy with which that parameter perturbation
                    “transitions” the wild-type phenotype into the mutant
                    outcome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and
                    <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In this manner, these computations yield a transition
                    probability that an increase (or decrease) in each parameter will shift the
                    phenotype from wild type to a mutant pattern. Parameter changes with a higher
                    transition probability have a greater likelihood of generating the desired
                    mutant phenotype. Thus, this approach is the computational equivalent of a
                    random genetic screen that evaluates all possible mutations to determine the
                    most effective ones that lead to the mutant phenotype of interest.</p>

                <p>To test initially this approach, we applied it to mutant phenotypes that have
                    been well established by genetics experiments in <italic>C. elegans</italic>. We
                    first predicted the best single-parameter changes needed to transform the
                    wild-type organism into a vulvaless mutant. Vulvaless phenotypes have been
                    observed in genetics experiments and occur when all vulval precursor cells
                    acquire the 3° fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Sulston1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Sternberg1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Wang1">[26]</xref>. Our
                    model predicts that the best way to render the
                    3°3°3°3°3°3° phenotype is by
                    decreasing the level of inductive signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This prediction is consistent
                    with experiments in which anchor cell ablation yields the uninduced
                    all-3° fate pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Kimble1">[27]</xref>.</p>
                <p>In the other extreme of phenotypes, mutant worms with multiple vulvae have been
                    observed when the inductive signaling pathway is hyperactivated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Beitel1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Liu1">[30]</xref>. In these mutants, the
                    vulval precursor cells acquire an intriguing alternating pattern of
                    2°1°2°1°2°1° where each
                    1° cell produces an invagination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Sternberg2">[31]</xref>. Consistent with
                    this experimental observation, the model predicts an increase in inductive
                    signal as one of the most prominent ways to yield this alternating phenotype
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
                <p>In addition, because all possible single mutations are evaluated, our model
                    analysis predicts additional “equivalent mutations” that
                    would render the same
                    2°1°2°1°2°1° phenotypic outcome
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). One of
                    these equivalent mutations is to flatten the gradient in soluble inductive
                    factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This
                    particular prediction is remarkably consistent with what has been recently
                    uncovered about the most classical experimental mutation to yield this
                    phenotype. The loss of <italic>lin-15</italic> has been shown to cause the
                    secretion of LIN-3 from the surrounding cells, an event that would ablate the
                    gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Cui1">[32]</xref>. A second equivalent mutation predicted by the
                    model is an increase in the threshold of lateral signaling needed to inhibit the
                    MAP kinase pathway (κ<sub>L</sub>). This prediction for generating a
                    well-established phenotype through a non-canonical perturbation is testable
                    experimentally by decreasing the binding affinity of the lateral signaling
                    transcription complex (LAG-1:LIN-12-cyto) to LBS elements in the
                    <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions of the genes that negatively regulate
                    inductive signaling (<italic>ark-1</italic>, <italic>lip-1</italic>,

                    signaling to inhibit the inductive MAP kinase pathway and would be an indirect
                    way to inflate the inductive signaling activity, conceptually consistent with
                    the direct hyperactivation of the inductive signaling pathway.</p>

                    variable. In addition to
                    2°1°2°1°2°1°, the other
                    prominent outcome is
                    1°2°2°1°2°1°. There are several
                    possible sources of variability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Samoilov1">[5]</xref>. The quantitative
                    levels and interactions of signaling molecules may differ among wild-type
                    organisms in which the mutation is performed; thus, their response to a specific
                    perturbation may produce different outcomes. Alternatively, even if two
                    organisms were “quantitative clones,” the magnitude of a
                    perturbation being introduced by the mutation may vary; for example, the amount
                    of RNAi delivered may be different. Finally, even if the perturbation and the
                    wild-type organisms were exactly the same, the execution of the molecular
                    network may deviate due to stochastic effects.</p>
                <p>Regardless of the source of variability, the key question we focused on is why
                    this variability would produce these two particular outcomes and not others. We
                    hypothesized that in the parameter space, variable mutant phenotypes may lie in
                    the same general direction from the wild-type phenotype. That is, because the
                    starting point, the extent of perturbation and the execution of a perturbation
                    may differ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), the
                    target points in parameter space on which these perturbations land will vary but
                    lie within a common vicinity. To test this hypothesis, we determined what other
                    phenotypes would be predicted by the model upon increasing the inductive signal
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) or
                    flattening the gradient (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s004">Figure S3</xref>). Indeed, the
                    1°2°2°1°2°1° phenotype is
                    predicted to occur in response to both perturbations, revealing that the
                    variable mutant phenotypes lie in the same direction in parameter space from the
                    wild-type phenotype. Furthermore, our model predicts that converting the
                    wild-type phenotype to either the
                    2°1°2°1°2°1° or
                    1°2°2°1°2°1° phenotypes would
                    require approximately the same amount of increase in inductive signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These predictions
                    confirm the hypothesis that these two phenotypes may co-occur because these
                    outcomes exist at similar positions relative to the wild-type phenotype in the
                    multidimensional parameter space.</p>

                <p>An apparent conundrum in our model predictions is that when inductive signal is
                    increased, the number of predicted phenotypes is far greater than that observed

                    phenotypes may not be sampled by classical genetics experiments that typically
                    involve knock-out or strong overexpression strategies. Another hypothesis is

                    development where precursor cells commit to a

                    Compelling recent experiments have revealed that tuning the level of inductive

                    that a common regulatory network has quantitatively diversified, so that the
                    network still produces the wild-type phenotype, but when quantitatively

                            drawn to the right of the wild-type phenotype. The phenotypes are
                            grouped into Classes A, B, C, and D and are shaded (white, light grey,
                            dark grey and black) according to the amount of perturbation in
                            inductive signal that rendered each mutant. In some species the first
                            pre-cursor cell (P3.p) is not competent to participate in vulval
                            development, and therefore, it is designated as ‘x’.
                            (B) The quantitative diversification hypothesis. Species belonging to
                            the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus all produce a common wild-type
                            phenotype using a common regulatory network that performs with
                            quantitative differences in parameter settings. Thus, <italic>C.
                            elegans</italic> (red), <italic>C. briggsae</italic> (blue) and
                                <italic>C. remanei</italic> (green) are hypothesized to occupy
                            different subspaces within the wild-type parameter space. This
                            quantitative diversification has been proposed to explain the fact that
                            changes in the level of inductive signal produce species-specific mutant
                            phenotypes.</p>

                <p>Experimentally testing this hypothesis of quantitative diversification would
                    involve uncovering the regulatory network driving vulval development in each
                    member of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus and proving that the network
                    architecture is indeed the same. This approach raises practical hurdles of
                    performing numerous genetics experiments across multiple species. A deeper
                    challenge is that it is difficult to prove unequivocally that the regulatory
                    network is the same between two species, since one cannot rule out the existence
                    of an undiscovered mechanism. On the other hand, a modeling framework can be
                    particularly effective in testing the quantitative diversification hypothesis. A
                    model can directly test whether the proposed vulval regulatory network that has
                    been inferred from studies in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is capable of
                    rendering the breadth of phenotypes observed across multiple species solely
                    through quantitative changes in regulatory mechanisms.</p>
                <p>To conduct this analysis, we compared our predicted phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) to the
                    experimentally observed phenotypes in the three major members of the
                        <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus, <italic>C. elegans</italic>,
                        <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. remanei</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We find that 8 of
                    the 9 experimentally observed phenotypes across the three species are captured
                    by our model predictions. These results demonstrate unequivocally that a common
                    vulval developmental network is capable of producing a significant fraction of
                    the phenotypic diversity observed in the three major members of the
                        <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. Thus, the model provides new and
                    strong support for quantitative diversification of a common vulval developmental
                    network during the evolution of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus.</p>
                <p>Where the model fails also provides intriguing insight. Our model does not
                    predict the 3°2°2°2°3° phenotype that
                    occurs when inductive signal is decreased moderately in <italic>C.
                    briggsae</italic>. <italic>C. briggsae</italic> is phylogenetically closer to
                        <italic>C. remanei</italic> than to <italic>C. elegans</italic>
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Felix1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Kiontke1">[36]</xref>, suggesting that
                    quantitative diversification hypothesis may fail to explain fully how <italic>C.
                        briggsae</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> vulval regulatory networks
                    have diverged. In addition, the model predicts several phenotypes that are not
                    found in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and
                        <italic>C. remanei</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These additional phenotypes may occur in other members
                    of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. The seminal dataset collected by
                    Felix in fact spans eight additional species. We are currently developing
                    algorithms for systematically clustering and comparing model-predicted
                    phenotypes to this larger experimental dataset.</p>
                <p>Meanwhile, an important feature of the experimental data gathered by Felix is
                    that species-specific phenotypes emerge only when the inductive signal is tuned
                    to a certain quantitative level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). The 3°3°3°3°3°
                    (Class A) and 1°1°1°1°1° (Class D)
                    phenotypes are observed only when inductive signal is strongly decreased or
                    increased, respectively; meanwhile Class B
                    (3°2°3°2°3°,
                    3°2°2°2°3° and
                    3°3°1°3°3°) and Class C
                    (1°2°1°2°1°,
                    2°2°1°2°1°,
                    2°2°1°2°2° and
                    2°1°1°1°2°) phenotypes occur upon
                    moderate decrease and increase in inductive signal, respectively. Thus, a more
                    rigorous test of quantitative diversification is not only to prove that a common
                    regulatory network can render the breadth of experimentally-observed phenotypes,
                    but also to demonstrate that the predicted phenotypes occur only when the
                    network is tuned in the appropriate quantitative manner. To undertake this more
                    rigorous test of quantitative diversification, we determined the amount of
                    change in inductive signal needed to render the predicted phenotypes. The
                    predicted quantitative hierarchy of phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) directly matches experimental
                    observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g006">Figure 6B</xref>),
                    providing stronger evidence to support the quantitative diversification
                    hypothesis.</p>
                <p>The model predictions directly validate the hypothesis that the parameter space
                    associated with the wild-type phenotype actually contains several subspaces,
                    each representing different species. A key question is which subspace of
                    parameter values corresponds to each species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The answer to this question would
                    reveal how the quantitative settings of this developmental network have evolved
                    during the emergence of the <italic>Caenorhabditis</italic> genus. To address
                    this question, we analyzed more closely the layout of phenotypes in the
                    multidimensional parameter space. We know that each species produces different
                    phenotypes when the level of inductive signal is changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Felix1">[22]</xref>. For example,
                        <italic>C. elegans</italic> transitions from the phenotype
                    3°2°1°2°3° (WT) to
                    3°3°1°3°3° when inductive signal is
                    reduced moderately; meanwhile, <italic>C. remanei</italic> forms
                    3°2°3°2°3° upon intermediate reductions
                    in inductive signal. In both species, a strong reduction in inductive signal
                    produces 3°3°3°3°3°. Therefore, by
                    identifying the subset of wild-type parameter values that produce a
                    WT→3°3°1°3°3°→3°3°3°3°3°
                    transition versus
                    WT→3°2°3°2°3°→3°3°3°3°3°3°
                    transition upon reducing inductive signal, we isolated the <italic>C.
                    elegans</italic> and <italic>C. remanei</italic> parameter subspaces (Materials
                    and Methods). Similarly, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> forms patterns with
                    adjacent 1° fates upon mild increase of inductive morphogen signal,
                    while <italic>C. elegans</italic> requires a strong increase in morphogen
                    activity to render such outcomes. Therefore, by distinguishing between
                    WT→1°2°1°2°1°→1°1°1°1°1°
                    transitions and
                    WT→2°1°1°1°2°→1°1°1°1°1°
                    transitions, we identified the subset of wild-type parameter values that
                    correspond to <italic>C. elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic>
                    subspaces. We find that <italic>C. elegans</italic> represents
                    41.01±7.90%, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> represents
                    3.71±1.95%, and <italic>C. remanei</italic> represents
                    41.31±8.20% of all wild-type space points. The remaining
                    13.97±2.25% of wild-type space points represents
                    transition patterns that are inconsistent with experimental results for these
                    three species.</p>
                <p>Having identified the sub-region of wild-type parameter space belonging to
                        <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae</italic> and <italic>C.
                        remanei</italic>, we determined how the parameters differ among these

                    The model identifies two potential groups of parameters. The values of the first
                    group may be higher or lower in <italic>C. elegans</italic> relative to

                    (λ, φ and κ<sub>M</sub>). In contrast, the model
                    predicts that a second group of parameters has changed in a biased manner,
                    either selectively increasing or decreasing, during the evolution of <italic>C.

                    remanei</italic> than in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, indicating that inductive
                    signaling produces a stronger lateral signal in <italic>C. remanei</italic>
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).
                    Furthermore, the threshold of inductive signaling (κ<sub>M</sub>) needed
                    to trigger the lateral signal is lower in <italic>C. remanei</italic>. Taken
                    together, these predictions reveal that the ability to send out lateral signals
                    is far stronger and more sensitive to inductive signaling in <italic>C.

                    primarily in the ability to receive lateral signals (θ) and thereby
                    inhibit inductive signaling (χ, κ<sub>L</sub>). Inductive
                    signaling is predicted to be more sensitive to lateral inhibition in <italic>C.

                    in quantitatively modulating a common developmental signaling network. We
                    demonstrate that the underlying quantitative molecular changes can in fact be
                    inferred from experimental observations of phenotypic variability. This
                    inference requires a computational approach, since the underlying molecular
                    signaling network is highly interconnected and its relation to emergent
                    multicellular phenotypes is non-intuitive. Our approach hinges on a mathematical
                    framework for predicting multicellular phenotypes from the underlying signaling
                    network and a broadly applicable computational approach to analyze the

                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Sulston2">[20]</xref>. These cells are arranged linearly along the
                        antero-posterior axis of the body. During the third stage of larval
                        development, the VPCs receive a spatially graded EGF-like stimulus (LIN-3)
                        from the anchor cell (AC) in the gonad. Binding of LIN-3 to its receptor
                        LET-23 activates the MAP kinase MPK-1 and induces their differentiation. In
                        addition to the soluble LIN-3 signal, juxtracrine interactions through
                        Notch-like receptor LIN-12 contribute to VPC differentiation. Together, the
                        inductive LIN-3 signal and the lateral Notch signal establish a pattern of

                    Because these threshold values are unknown, and in fact, may be a source of

                    This total level of occurrence of each phenotype was divided by the total number

                    collection of points in the parameter space that are associated with a
                    particular phenotype as the phenotype subspace. To quantify the CS value for
                    each phenotype, we distinguished between isolated, edge, and interior points in
                    the phenotype subspace. Isolated points are those points for which unit jumps
                    along <italic>both</italic> (increase and decrease) directions of
                    <italic>every</italic> parameter axis lead to points associated with another

                    in <italic>both</italic> directions along <italic>every</italic> parameter axis
                    reach points that still belongs to the same phenotype. Finally, between these
                    possibilities are edge points: a unit jump in <italic>at least one</italic>
                    direction along <italic>at least one</italic> parameter axis leads to another
                    phenotype. To calculate the CS metric for a phenotype, we assign each point in
                    the phenotype subspace a score equal to the number of neighboring points that
                    belong to the same phenotype. This score ranges between 0 (for isolated points)
                    and 16 (for interior points). We add the scores of each point in the phenotype
                    subspace and normalize this total by the maximum possible score for the
                    phenotype space, accounting for edge effects due to finite parameter domains.
                    This normalized score is the CS value plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g003">Figure 3C</xref>.</p>
                <p>A complementary approach to gauge robustness is to quantify how easy it is to
                    drift out of the phenotype subspace by computing the MPL of escape from the
                    phenotype subspace. We choose randomly a point in the subspace and then make
                    unit jumps along a randomly selected parameter axis and direction. We record the
                    number of jumps taken before exiting the phenotype. This process is repeated
                    until the running average number of jumps stabilizes. We conduct 10 such drift
                    trial reseeding the random number generator between trials. The mean path length
                    is the average over these 10 trials.</p>
                <p>Importantly, the 8-dimensional phenotype phase diagram will be sensitive to the

                    thresholds determine how fates are assigned (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s007">Table S1</xref>).

                        (<italic>C. briggsae</italic> or <italic>C. remanei</italic>) were
                    considered.</p>
                <p>For the purpose of this discussion, let <italic>P<sub>k</sub></italic> denote
                    each dimensionless parameter where
                    <italic>k</italic> = 1 to 8. Let
                    <italic>i</italic> denote a point in the W parameter space, and
                    <italic>j</italic> denote a point in the M-parameter space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). By scanning through all (i, j)
                    pairs, we determined the total number that differ only by a single parameter
                    value. These pairs represent the cases where a single-parameter change can cause
                    a W→M phenotype transition. Among this total number of single-mutation
                    pairs, we determined the fraction of phenotype transitions that are attributable
                    to an increase in a particular parameter <italic>P<sub>k</sub></italic>. This
                    fraction is the transition probability of W→M phenotype transition by
                        <italic>increasing P<sub>k</sub></italic>. The same calculation was
                    conducted for quantifying the transition probability due to a decrease in
                            <italic>P<sub>k</sub></italic>.</p>
                <p>To determine the robustness of the transition probability to variations in the
                    fate-determining thresholds, we computed the transition probability for 25
                    different threshold combinations presented above. Hence, the

                <title>Predicting the phenotypes accessible through quantitative changes in the
                    level of inductive signal</title>
                <p>Starting from the wild-type phenotype, we determined all the mutant phenotypes
                    that may be rendered solely by increasing (or decreasing) the inductive signal.
                    Since some mutant phenotypes are more prevalent than others, we quantified the
                    likelihood that an increase (or decrease) in inductive signal would produce each
                    mutant (M). To quantify this likelihood of phenotype occurrence, we first
                    tallied the total number of ways that a change in inductive signal
                    (<italic>I</italic>) would abolish the wild-type (W) phenotype. Among this
                    total, we quantified the fraction that shifted W to a specific mutant M upon an
                    increase (or decrease) in <italic>I</italic>. This fraction represents the
                    likelihood of producing M phenotype by an increase (or decrease) in inductive
                    signal (<italic>I</italic>).</p>
                <p>Phenotype assignments must be sensitive to fate-determining threshold values of
                    MAPK and lateral signals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s007">Table S1</xref>). To quantify the robustness of the
                    likelihood of phenotype occurrence to threshold variations, we performed the
                    calculation for 25 different threshold combinations (as described above). The
                    mean of the likelihood of phenotype occurrence is reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s003">Figure S2A</xref>,
                    and the error bars denote the standard deviation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows the mutant phenotypes with
                    the greatest likelihood of phenotype occurrence upon an increase (empty) or
                    decrease (filled) in inductive signal. The more complete set of phenotypes,
                    including the ones that occur less frequently, are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s003">Figure S2A</xref>.
                    Similar calculations were performed to determine the phenotype diversity due to
                    changes in gradient steepness. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s004">Figure S3</xref> shows the mutant phenotypes with
                    greatest likelihood of phenotype occurrence upon an increase (empty) and
                    decrease (filled) in gradient steepness. Note the occurrence of
                    1°2°2°1°2°1° and
                    2°1°2°1°2°1° phenotypes in both

                <p>In addition to the likelihood of generating a particular mutant phenotype, it is
                    also important to gauge the amount of change in inductive signal needed to
                    render each mutant. Some mutant phenotypes may require only small changes, while
                    others may require substantial perturbations. Therefore, we quantified the fold
                    change in <italic>I</italic> needed to produce a specific mutant phenotype (M).
                    For every increase (or decrease) in <italic>I</italic> that produced phenotype
                    M, we kept track of the associated magnitude of change in <italic>I</italic>.
                    The geometric mean of these magnitudes was computed to give the fold change in
                        <italic>I</italic>. As with other calculations, we examined the robustness
                    of this quantity to variations in fate-determining thresholds. The mean fold
                    change in <italic>I</italic> across a broad range of threshold settings is
                    reported in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000354-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and

                <title>Partitioning the wild-type subspace into species-specific regions</title>
                <p>A key experimental observation is that changes in inductive signal produce
                    species-specific phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000354-Felix1">[22]</xref>. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s005">Figure S4</xref> highlights the progression of
                    phenotypes observed in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C.
                    briggsae</italic>, and <italic>C. remanei</italic> along the inductive signal
                    axis. We developed a computational approach to analyze how these experimental
                    phenotypes are arranged in our predicted phase diagram of phenotypes with the
                    goal of identifying the regions within the wild-type subspace that belongs to
                    each species.</p>
                <p>First, we designated each phenotype with a letter code (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s005">Figure S4</xref>),
                    so that a string of characters or a word may be used to represent the phenotype
                    progression of each species. Phenotypes that are not described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s005">Figure S4</xref>
                    were designated ‘O’. For example, following the lines for
                        <italic>C. elegans</italic> in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s005">Figure S4</xref>, one word is APWRD. Using this
                    nomenclature, we identified the words that are consistent with the fate
                    progression observed experimentally in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C.
                        briggsae</italic>, and <italic>C. remanei</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s012">Table S6</xref>).</p>
                <p>Next, we determined the word associated with every predicted point in the
                    wild-type subspace. To construct the word, we varied the value of
                    <italic>I</italic> from its minimum to maximum while holding all other parameter
                    values constant. As the <italic>I</italic>-axis was traversed, we recorded each
                    phenotype with its character designation, thereby yielding a 11-character word
                    (11 characters because of the discretization of the <italic>I</italic>-axis).
                    The length of these words was then condensed by eliminating adjacent repeats of
                    a character. For example, APPPOWOSSDD would become APOWOSD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000354.s006">Figure S5</xref>).
                    Since ‘O’ phenotypes include cases where VPCs are designated
                    as ‘m’ fate (a fate whose experimental equivalent remains to
                    be elucidated), we removed ‘O’ from the predicted words. In
                    the example, APOWOSD would become APWSD. Thus, at the end of this step, every
                    point in the wild-type parameter is associated with a word that characterizes
                    how the phenotype would change when <italic>I</italic> is increased or
                    decreased.</p>
                <p>Finally, we compared the predicted words associated with each point in wild-type
                    parameter space with the experimentally observed phenotype progressions/words of
                        <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, and <italic>C.
                        remanei</italic>. In this manner, we identified the regions within the
                    wild-type parameter space associated with each species.</p>
