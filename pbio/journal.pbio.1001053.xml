      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001053-g001"/>Amyotrophic lateral sclerosis (ALS) is
                a neurodegenerative disease in which the motor neurons of the central nervous
                system—those cells of the brain and spinal cord that control muscles—die
                off. The resulting paralysis typically leads to death within 3–5 years of
                onset. The cause of the disease in the majority of cases is completely unknown, and
                there is no treatment that halts or significantly slows the disease. In the United
                States ALS is often known as Lou Gehrig's Disease, after the baseball player
                who famously suffered from it.</p>
      <p>Several genes have been linked to ALS. The most recent, called FUS (fused in sarcoma,
                a reference to the context of its discovery), is the subject of two new studies in
                this issue of <italic>PLoS Biology</italic>, one by Zhihui Sun, Zamia Diaz, James
                Shorter, Aaron Gitler, and colleagues, and the other by Shulin Ju, Gregory Petsko,
                Dagmar Ringe, and colleagues. Both explore FUS biology in yeast, and highlight the
                potential for modeling elements of complex diseases in this simplest of eukaryotic
                cell systems. Results from both studies suggest that defects in RNA processing and
                transport may be a central element of ALS pathophysiology.</p>
      <p>Within the cytoplasm of motor neurons in ALS patients, proteins aggregate to form
                insoluble clumps, called inclusions, which can include both FUS and another
                ALS-causing protein, called TDP-43. When the two research groups overexpressed human
                FUS in yeast, they observed cytoplasmic inclusions. Inclusions form in most of the
                neurodegenerative diseases, including Alzheimer's disease and Parkinson's
                disease, suggesting that common defects in protein handling may link all of
                them.</p>
      <p>In humans, FUS is found predominantly in the nucleus, and at least some
                ALS-associated mutations reduce the nuclear/cytoplasmic ratio of the protein,
                suggesting that its mislocalization to the cytoplasm, rather than mutation per se,
                may be an important step in disease pathogenesis. Supporting that hypothesis, both
                groups found that restricting overexpressed wild-type FUS to the nucleus mitigated
                its toxic effect.</p>
      <p>Both FUS and TDP-43 are RNA-binding proteins. But Sun et al. found that purified FUS
                is far more prone to aggregation than purified TDP-43, and both groups showed that
                the molecular features that are critical for aggregation differed between the two
                proteins, which may indicate that the disease-causing mechanism also differs between
                them, despite their broadly similar functions.</p>
      <p>Both groups conducted genome-wide screens to identify genes that specifically
                mitigate toxicity. Gratifyingly, despite differences in lab and protocol details,
                there was a large overlap between the two sets of candidates, suggesting these genes
                play central roles in bypassing whatever the toxic pathways are. The handful of
                identified genes included ones coding for other DNA/RNA binding proteins. One,
                called ECM32, has a human homolog, hUPF1, that Ju et al. found also rescued
                toxicity. One function of hUPF1 is in messenger RNA quality control, strengthening
                the case that RNA handling is defective in FUS-caused ALS. Interestingly, expression
                of hUPF1 was able to rescue FUS toxicity in yeast without driving FUS out of the
                inclusions or sending it back to the nucleus, suggesting that it may be possible to
                overcome the effects of mislocalized FUS therapeutically without solving the
                difficult problem of restoring it to its proper compartment.</p>
      <p>These two studies have at least two important consequences. By identifying new genes
                that can lessen ALS-linked toxicity, they point the way to exploration of new
                therapeutics based on RNA processing. Perhaps just as importantly, they demonstrate
                that yeast has the potential to be a versatile system for modeling aspects of ALS
                that previously have only been modeled in mice. Since testing ideas about
                pathogenesis and treatment is much faster and cheaper in yeast, these results may
                open the way for more rapid progress in understanding the disease, its treatment,
                and the role of this new gene in ALS development.</p>
