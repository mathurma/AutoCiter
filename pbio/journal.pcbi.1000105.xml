Various regions in this space exhibit considerable difference in the local conservation of molecular function. We analyze and capture local function conservation by means of logistic curves. Based on this analysis, we propose a method for predicting molecular function of a query protein with known structure but unknown function. The prediction method is rigorously assessed and compared with a previously published function predictor. Furthermore, we apply the method to 500 functionally unannotated PDB structures and discuss selected examples. The proposed approach provides a simple yet consistent statistical model for the complex relations between protein sequence, structure, and function. The GOdot method is available online (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://godot.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de" xlink:type="simple">http://godot.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de</ext-link>).</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Proteins are an essential class of molecules playing a variety of roles within a cell. They can be described in various ways: amongst others, by sequence, structure, and function. Determining protein function by wet lab procedures is challenging and tedious. Simultaneously, sequencing and structural genomics projects turn out ever increasing numbers of protein sequences and structures, which are largely lacking functional characterization. As a consequence, there is a growing demand for computational methods that can assist human experts in the functional annotation of proteins. We present a method for protein function prediction based on a novel concept, called local function conservation. Local function conservation in sequence and structure is determined by rigorously analyzing the variability of protein function with respect to sequence and structure similarity. Our method predicts protein function even if the protein to be functionally annotated has only distant relatives. Furthermore, we estimate the reliability of the function prediction. With this approach, we advance automated function prediction and contribute to a better understanding of the complex relations between protein sequence, structure, and function.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work forms part of the BioSapiens project, which is funded by the European Commission within its FP6 Programme under the thematic area ‘Life sciences, genomics and biotechnology for health’, contract number LSHG-CT-2003-503265.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Protein structure databases are growing at a rapid rate and, in recent years, structural genomics initiatives have increased the growth rate further.

Two recent reviews <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Domingues1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Friedberg2">[26]</xref> provide an overview of state-of-the-art predictors and discuss many of the aforementioned methods in detail.</p><p>The underlying idea of similarity based function transfer is that proteins with similar sequence and structural features are likely to perform the same function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Sangar1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Jones1">[29]</xref>. We take this principle one step further by examining groups of similar proteins. Such a group can be seen as a local region within the protein universe. A molecular function that is shared by all proteins in a local region is considered to be conserved. Local regions may be interspersed with proteins not annotated with this function and function conservation can vary between different regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Hegyi1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Wilson1">[31]</xref>. Therefore, we use the frequency of functionally identical proteins within a local region to determine the extent to which a function is conserved in the respective region of protein space. The degree of local function conservation is regarded as a confidence measure for the prediction, high conservation implying high confidence that the respective function is correct. This quantitative estimate yields a differentiated view on function conservation, enabling us to predict protein molecular function more accurately.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><p>We estimate the rate of errors made when inferring protein function annotations based on protein sequence and structure similarity.

Finally, we apply the method to 500 uncharacterized structural genomics targets from the PDB and discuss some of the findings in detail.</p><sec id="s2a"><title>Error Rates for Function Inference</title><p>The analysis is based on a set of 7290 representative protein domains with maximal 40% sequence identity as provided by the ASTRAL Compendium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Chandonia1">[32]</xref>.

Some GOA annotations cannot be resolved to domain precision. Therefore, we reduced the domain set to single domain structures (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> for details). Out of this reduced set of 4099 single domain structures, 3449 (84%) domains are annotated with molecular function GO terms. The subsequent analyses are performed on this set of 3449 protein domains. These 3449 protein domains are annotated with 0 to 11 level three GO terms (with a first quartile of 1, a mean of 1.96, and a third quartile of 3 GO terms).</p><p>The domains are compared against each other with different measures for protein similarity (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> for details): for measuring similarity we use two sequence-based programs, namely local profile alignment (LP) and global profile alignment (GP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-vonhsen1">[35]</xref>, and two structure-based programs, namely Combinatorial Extension (CE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Shindyalov1">[36]</xref> and TM-align (TM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Zhang1">[37]</xref>.</p><p>How reliably can functional annotations be inferred from the neighboring proteins of a protein according to each similarity measure? This question is analyzed for GO level three. With a leave-one-out cross-validation for each protein we assess the errors made when inferring GO terms from the nearest neighbor to each protein. The average percentage of correct annotation inferences ranges from 51% to 62%, depending on the similarity measure (55% for CE, 51% for TM, 62% for LP, 62% for GP). Compared to other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Joshi1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Jones1">[29]</xref>, we observe slightly lower error rates.</p><p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000105-g001">Figure 1A</xref> the inferred annotations are sorted according to the similarity measures and then binned such that each bin contains an equal number of counts (ca. 670 annotations). This allows for comparing the number of errors in inference according to different similarity measures, where the different similarity measures are operating at different scales. Even for very similar proteins, in the highest scoring bins, we observe a maximum of only 83% annotations being correctly inferred. Consequently, when inferring annotations from nearest neighbors without further analysis, at least 17% of the annotations are predicted falsely. The situation is even worse for lower similarity ranges. These errors can be attributed to the local properties in sequence and structure space. They demonstrate the difficulty of function annotation transfers at different similarity ranges.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000105-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000105.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Assessing Similarity-Based Inference.</title><p>(A) The plot serves to assess the errors made when inferring GO terms from the nearest neighbor of each protein.

Within the space of these proteins, the method looks for regions of similar domains having the same function. The degree of function conservation in such regions can vary considerably depending on the type of molecular function, the number of protein domains having that function, and the metric used to calculate protein similarity. Therefore, we estimate the degree of function conservation separately for each GO molecular function in the region around each protein domain. Analyzing the region of 200 nearest neighbor proteins and using logistic regression, we obtain one logistic curve for each GO term, capturing the extent of functional conservation in the region around the protein domain. The logistic regression is done separately for each similarity measure.</p><p>In the prediction phase, the method predicts the molecular functions for an unknown query protein using the pre-computed logistic curves. Initially, the uncharacterized query protein is compared to all protein domains in the training set. The logistic curves of the most similar proteins in the data set are used to predict the molecular functions of the query: if the logistic curve of one of these nearest neighbors indicates high function conservation for a specific GO term in the region of the query, the GO term is predicted with a corresponding raw function conservation score. Raw function conservation scores are deduced from the logistic curves based on the similarity of the query to the nearest neighbors. The method computes several raw conservation scores for the query structure, one for every GO term annotated to the nearest neighbors. Usually, there exist several raw function conservation scores for one and the same GO term, either from different nearest neighbors with the same functions, or from one protein domain selected as nearest neighbor by different similarity measures. In order to assign one score to each of the predicted GO terms, we have developed two alternative schemes of combining raw function conservation scores along the GO graph: selective combination and consensus combination. Both combination schemes ensure that a GO term is predicted together with all its ancestors in the GO hierarchy, and that parental GO terms obtain scores that are at least as high as those of their GO descendants. This approach is in compliance with the GO true path rule, which states that “the pathway from a child term all the way up to its top-level parent(s) must always be true” (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.geneontology.org/GO.usage.shtml#truePathRule" xlink:type="simple">http://www.geneontology.org/GO.usage.shtml#truePathRule</ext-link>). The combined scores provide an estimate for the reliability of the predicted GO terms.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>GOdot: illustration of the method with a sample query</title><p>We illustrate the GOdot function prediction mechanism for a sample query protein with PDB ID 1ve3, for which a crystal structure is available from a structural genomics initiative. In the representative set, the nearest neighbors according to CE, TM, LP, and GP are the protein domains d1p91a (CE score 5.9), d1vlma (TM score 0.74), d1vl5a (LP score 188), and d1qama (GP score 136). For each of these, the surrounding space was pre-analyzed. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000105-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the surrounding region is depicted for d1vlma according to TM similarity. The domain d1vlma has molecular functions GO∶0003824, GO∶0008168, GO∶0008757, GO∶0016740, and GO∶0016741 attached.

Evaluating the logistic curve at a TM score of 0.74 (from 1ve3 to d1vlma), yields a raw function conservation score of 0.9955. Similarly, measuring with CE, LP, and GP, the raw function conservation scores for GO term GO∶0008757 are 0.9817, 0.9980, and 0.9998, respectively. These are computed from the above-mentioned nearest neighbors, which are all annotated with this molecular function.</p><p>Using the combination schemes, the raw function conservation scores are combined selectively into 0.9998 (which is the maximum of the above raw function conservation values), and into ≈1–10<sup>−11</sup> according to the consensus combination (which is 1−(1−0.9817)·(1−0.9955)·(1−0.9980)·(1−0.9998)).

The rest (83%) of the annotations is based on automatic electronic inference.</p><p>When using these functional annotations for training a new computational method like GOdot, there is an obvious trade-off between quality and coverage: the higher the number of annotated proteins used, the lower is the ratio of manually curated annotations on these. The previously described set strives for maximum coverage, as this is the aim in a typical application scenario. We also tested the method on a second set based on high-quality annotation data.</p><p>The high-quality data set is restricted to annotations that stem traceably form literature (evidence code TAS) or from direct experiments (evidence codes IDA, IEP, IGI, IMP, IPI), leaving 945 proteins with curated experimental annotations.

The PHUNCTIONER method uses structural multiple alignments of functionally similar proteins to derive position specific scoring matrices (PSSMs) for specific GO functions; structures with unknown function are scanned against a library of PSSMs to assign function to the structure. PHUNCTIONER can predict 121 molecular function GO terms from different levels of the GO hierarchy. For a query protein, it predicts one of these GO terms along with a score. The list of predicted GO terms is sorted according to the scores from likely to unlikely. The assessment of the PHUNCTIONER method was previously performed with ROC plots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Pazos1">[17]</xref>. These ROC plots are GO-level specific and were constructed as follows. For GO level three, only the highest scoring level-3 GO term from the prediction list is considered for one query and evaluated to be either true or false. Sorting predictions for multiple queries according to their scores one obtains a ROC curve. The PHUNCTIONER method was assessed this way on sets of up to 6168 query proteins, where query proteins were selected such that at least one of their annotated GO terms was predictable by the PHUNCTIONER method. We have repeated this evaluation procedure in an analogous fashion on the set of 3449 protein domains also employed in our other experiments.</p><p>The resulting ROC curves for the GOdot method are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000105-g007">Figure 7</xref>. The two GOdot predictors, using selective and consensus combination of scores, are compared to a baseline reference predictor. The reference predictor predicts GO terms based on their background frequencies within the dataset. The curve of an optimal predictor would pass through the upper left corner of the plot, a diagonal line in the ROC plot indicates random performance. Indeed, the background reference predictor matches the diagonal closely. The GOdot selective and consensus predictors are clearly superior to the reference predictor.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000105-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000105.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Evaluation According to PHUNCTIONER Protocol.</title><p>Following the protocol described for evaluation of the PHUNCTIONER method in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Pazos1">[17]</xref>, the ROC curve considers only the highest scoring predicted level three GO term for each query protein.

(ii) Since the benchmark dataset for the published validation of PHUNCTIONER is not accessible to us in the form used for the validation we have to compare the performances of the two methods on differing datasets. Taking this into account, we realized a scenario which makes it harder for GOdot, in principle, to attain the same true positive rate for a given false positive rate. We did so by assessing the performance of GOdot on the full set of 1806 GO terms (compared to only 121 GO terms for PHUNCTIONER). The performance we observe for GOdot is higher than that reported for PHUNCTIONER. As a point in case, a comparison of Figure 7 with Figure 2B of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Pazos1">[17]</xref> shows that, at a false positive rate of 10%, PHUNCTIONER achieves approximately 36% true positive rate (true positive rate≙sensitivity, false positive rate≙1−specificity).

We analyzed the GOdot results for the subset of these proteins having four or more GO terms with a consensus combined score &gt;1–10<sup>−10</sup> (49 in total). For 13 of these proteins the predictions included at least one problematic GO term. In most of these cases the problematic GO term was annotated to protein neighbors that were multidomain proteins. These GO terms corresponded to the molecular function of a particular domain outside the region of sequence or structure similarity. Four additional proteins remain uncharacterized according to public annotation databases. The corresponding GOdot predictions were not necessarily incorrect, but they only included GO terms that were not very informative. Most of the GOdot predictions (32 proteins) were consistent with additional functional information that had been made available in the UniProt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-UniProt1">[38]</xref> database or in the literature.</p><p>Direct experimental evidence for the function annotation was usually not available for these proteins with consistent GOdot predictions. One case with experimental evidence is Cytochrome P450 from <italic>Sulfolobus tokodaii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Oku1">[39]</xref>, PDB ID 1ue8. In other cases the structural model provides direct evidence for the molecular function, for instance if the model includes a ligand binding to the protein. The PH0226 protein from <italic>Pyrococcus horikoshii</italic> (PDB ID 1ve3) is such an example. The crystal structure includes the cofactor S-adenosyl-L-methionine (SAM) bound to the protein. The protein also shows significant structural similarity to other SAM-dependent methyltransferases, and is a member of the Methyltransferase homologous family, as identified by Pfam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Finn1">[40]</xref>. This evidence is consistent with the GOdot prediction of S-adenosylmethionine-dependent methyltransferase activity (GO∶0008757) with a combined consensus score of 1–10<sup>−11</sup>. This same query was used to illustrate the GOdot function prediction process in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000105-g004">Figure 4</xref>.

The method uses functionally conserved regions as a new concept. These functional conservations are determined by statistical learning on a representative set of protein domains. Protein sequence and structure information of an unannotated protein are used as input to GOdot, which then predicts a list of GO terms. Each of the predicted GO terms has a reliability estimate attached which is computed based on the previously determined functionally conserved regions.</p><p>Both, the assessment using cross-validation on a representative dataset and the comparison with PHUNCTIONER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000105-Pazos1">[17]</xref> demonstrate that the analysis of functionally conserved regions is a powerful tool for function prediction: reference function predictors are considerably outperformed by the GOdot method. A high function conservation score is shown to indicate a high likelihood that a predicted GO term is correct. Consequently, function conservation scores can be used as reliability estimates within the prediction procedure.</p><p>To our knowledge, the GOdot method is the first approach that directly addresses the problem of estimating varying local function conservation in protein space with respect to different measures for protein similarity. For each similarity measure, each GO term and each protein domain in the representative training set, function conservation is captured with a logistic curve. The result is a large number of mutually intertwined and overlapping logistic curves. The set of logistic curves offers a new view on the relation between sequence and structure on the one hand and function on the other hand. We regard the analysis of functionally conserved regions as an important contribution to current function prediction efforts, and we expect forthcoming developments in this field to uncover more detailed insights into the sequence-structure-function space.</p><p>Local function conservation within protein space can be determined with respect to other protein similarity measures, such as shape or surface properties of protein binding sites, for example. The GOdot method can be easily extended to include other quantitative measures of protein similarity. For any new similarity measure one would simply perform an all-against-all comparison on the training set of proteins. Local function conservation can then be determined for that similarity measure. We are working on extending the GOdot method with new similarity measures to further improve its performance.</p><p>The GOdot method is available online as a web-server (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://godot.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de" xlink:type="simple">http://godot.bioinf.mpi-inf.mpg.de</ext-link>), to which one can submit uncharacterized PDB structures. The method performs sequence and structure comparisons of the query protein to each entry from the representative set of protein domains. GO terms are predicted and function conservation scores are computed as reliability estimates. A ranked list of predicted GO terms is the output of the web-server.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>The Functionally Annotated Protein Data Set</title><p>The analysis is based on a representative set of protein sequences and structures annotated with function data.

Therefore, in our studies we focus mostly on GO terms from level three, where the GO root is defined as being at level zero and GO ‘molecular function’ as level one. We consider a GO term to belong to level three, if it has any path of length three to the root node. An example of a level three GO term is ‘transferase activity’ (GO∶015972), which has the parent ‘catalytic activity’ (GO∶052747), which is in turn a direct child of ‘molecular function’ (GO∶161526).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Learning Molecular Function from Sequence and Structure Data</title><p>Similarity between proteins is measured using different distance measures.

The probability of a GO term being correct is computed from the probabilities of the descendant GO terms being correct. The probability of a term being correct is one minus the probability that all descendant terms are incorrect.

With a compute cluster as back-end to the GOdot web-server, we provide answers typically within 20 to 60 minutes. In the training stage, establishing the protein space requires all-against-all comparisons, which is quite expensive (300 CPU days). When the distances are available, computing the logistic curves for 28774 annotations (of all-level GO terms to 3449 proteins) takes 9 minutes and is negligible in comparison.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000105.s001" mimetype="application/pdf" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000105.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Details on Application to Structural Genomics Proteins.
