			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Probiotics are deliberately ingested preparations of live bacterial species that confer health benefits on the host. Many of these species are associated with the fermentation of dairy products. Despite their increasing use, the molecular details of the impact of various probiotic preparations on resident members of the gut microbiota and the host are generally lacking. To address this issue, we colonized germ-free mice with <italic>Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron,</italic> a prominent component of the adult human gut microbiota, and <italic>Bifidobacterium longum,</italic> a minor member but a commonly used probiotic. Simultaneous whole genome transcriptional profiling of both bacterial species in their gut habitat and of the intestinal epithelium, combined with mass-spectrometric analysis of habitat-associated carbohydrates, revealed that the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> elicits an expansion in the diversity of polysaccharides targeted for degradation by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> (e.g., mannose- and xylose-containing glycans), and induces host genes involved in innate immunity. Although the overall transcriptome expressed by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> when it encounters <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> in the cecum is dependent upon the genetic background of the mouse (as assessed by a mixed analysis of variance [ANOVA] model of co-colonization experiments performed in NMRI and C57BL/6J animals), <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content>'s expanded capacity to utilize polysaccharides occurs independently of host genotype, and is also observed with a fermented dairy product-associated strain, <italic>Lactobacillus casei</italic>. This gnotobiotic mouse model provides a controlled case study of how a resident symbiont and a probiotic species adapt their substrate utilization in response to one another, and illustrates both the generality and specificity of the relationship between a host, a component of its microbiota, and intentionally consumed microbial species.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Over the millennia, our species has evolved to cope with, and perhaps benefit from, consuming microbes present in decomposing food. Some have postulated that ingestion of food-borne microbial species was common in the Pleistocene diet of hominins practicing subterranean food storage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b002">2</xref>]. Eventually these microbes were co-opted by humans to transform foods via fermentation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b003">3</xref>]. During the last century, technological improvements, such as refrigeration and pasteurization, have resulted in dramatic decreases in consumption of food-borne microbes in many countries. This sanitization has coincided with increased prevalence of a number of disorders, both within and outside of the gastrointestinal tract, including inflammatory bowel disease and atopic states (e.g., asthma and food allergies). Although links between certain “western” diseases and decreased exposure to microbes are being considered at the present time (e.g., the hygiene hypothesis in the case of atopic disorders) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b004">4</xref>], the positive health effects of consuming fermented foods were noted more than 100 y ago when Elie Metchnikoff correlated their ingestion with increased life span in Bulgarian peasants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b005">5</xref>]. More recently, the effects of consuming live microbial supplements with presumptive health benefits on human physiology have become the subject of various clinical studies (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b007">7</xref>]). However, the impact of these “probiotic” species on the composition and functioning of the human gut microbiota, the degree to which their effects are mediated through the resident microbiota versus direct signaling to the host, and the impact of host genotype on probiotic responses remain open questions. The answers have important implications for designing and interpreting clinical trials that explore the specific and general effects of different probiotics, and whether their consumption should be dictated by the microbial ecology or other properties of the host, including diet and genotype.</p>
      <p>The task of determining the mechanism of action of probiotics in humans is daunting. Our intestines contain 10–100 trillion microbes. A recent comprehensive 16S rRNA sequence-based enumeration has provided detailed snapshots of the composition of this community in a few healthy individuals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b008">8</xref>]. Our 21st century microbiota contains members of at least nine of the 70 described divisions of Bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b009">9</xref>], although it is dominated by just two: the Firmicutes and the Bacteroidetes. One methanogenic archaeon, <italic>Methanobrevibacter smithii,</italic> which belongs to the Euryarchaea, is very prominent, comprising up to 10% of microbes in the colonic microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b010">10</xref>]. Variations in the microbial composition of the gut exist between individuals, primarily at the level of species and subspecies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b008">8</xref>]. Moreover, within a given intestinal habitat (address), some microbial members appear to be entrenched “residents” (autochthonous components), whereas others act more like hitchhikers (allochthonous members) that pass through together with food, water, and other components of the environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b011">11</xref>].</p>
      <p>These considerations emphasize the importance of creating simplified and defined model systems for studying the functional properties and operating principles of our gut microbial communities, and the consequences of adding probiotics. In this report, we colonize germ-free mice with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bacteroides thetaiotaomicron</named-content> with or without <italic>Bifidobacterium longum. B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> was chosen because it is a prominent saccharolytic member of our distal gut microbiota (6% of all bacteria in the enumeration study described above) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b008">8</xref>], that possesses the largest arsenal of glycoside hydrolases and polysaccharide lyases among sequenced human gut symbionts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b012">12</xref>]. Thus, its highly evolved “glycobiome” helps us to process otherwise indigestible glycans in our diet. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> is a normal, albeit less prominent member of our microbiota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b013">13</xref>] that belongs to the Actinobacteria and is commonly used as a probiotic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b014">14</xref>]. Since both bacterial genomes have been sequenced, we were able to use a <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron/B. longum</italic> “community” GeneChip to simultaneously examine how each organism affects the other's transcriptome in a specified intestinal habitat of a host consuming a consistent and defined diet. Using a combination of in silico reconstructions of microbial metabolism based on these transcriptional profiles, mass spectroscopic analysis of glycan utilization, and whole genome transcriptional profiling of laser capture microdissected intestinal epithelium from germ-free and colonized mice, we were able to ascertain how a resident symbiont and probiotic species affect one another's carbohydrate substrate range and host biology. The generality of our findings was explored by testing the effect of two different host genetic backgrounds on the behavior of this model bi-component microbiota, and by comparing the responses of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> to two other probiotic strains added to a variety of fermented milks: <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Bifidobacterium animalis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Lactobacillus casei</named-content>.</p>

        <p>Three groups of 7-wk-old, germ-free male mice belonging to the NMRI inbred strain and maintained on a standard polysaccharide-rich chow diet, were colonized with a single gavage of 10<sup>8</sup> colony forming units (CFU) of either <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> (ATCC 29148; isolated from the fecal microbiota of a healthy adult human) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b015">15</xref>], <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> (NCC2705; recovered from an infant) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b014">14</xref>], or both bacterial species (<italic>n</italic> = 5 animals/group). Mice were sacrificed 10 d later, a period of time sufficient for the intestinal epithelium and its overlying mucus layer to turn over several times. The number of viable bacteria was determined in the cecum of each mouse at the time of their sacrifice. This gut habitat was chosen as the site for our analyses because it is a readily defined anatomic structure, interposed between the distal small intestine and colon, that normally houses a very dense and diverse microbiota (&gt;10<sup>12</sup> organisms/ml luminal contents; seven divisions of bacteria in a recent comprehensive 16S rRNA gene sequence-based survey) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b016">16</xref>]. The cecal microbiota is sustained, at least in part, by its ability to access large quantities of plant-derived polysaccharides that are delivered from the small intestine in an undigested state because the mouse (and human) host lacks the requisite glycoside hydrolases to break them down (e.g., xylans, arabinogalactans, and polygalacturonates/pectins) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b018">18</xref>].</p>
        <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> colonized the cecum in a highly reproducible fashion. Moreover, microbial density was not significantly different for either species when they were introduced alone (10<sup>10</sup>–10<sup>11</sup> CFU per milliliter of cecal contents; <italic>p &gt;</italic> 0.05 according to Student <italic>t</italic>-test). Furthermore, the co-colonization (bi-association) experiment revealed that the two bacterial species can co-exist in the cecum without a statistically significant impact on one another's population size (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To gain a genome-wide view of the effects of co-colonization on each organism's transcriptome, RNA was isolated from the cecal contents of each animal in each treatment group. The resulting RNA preparations were highly enriched for microbial RNA (&gt;90% as judged by quantitative reverse transcriptase PCR [qRT-PCR] assays of 16S and 18S rRNAs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b017">17</xref>]. Transcripts expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> were profiled using a custom “community” GeneChip (Affymetrix, Santa Clara, California, United States) that contains oligonucleotides representing 4,719 of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s 4,779 predicted chromosomal protein-coding genes (98.7%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b017">17</xref>] and 1,722 of <italic>B. longum'</italic>s 1,730 genes (99.5%). Each known or predicted gene in each genome was represented by an average of 13 perfect match and control mismatch 25-mer “probe pairs” (together designated as a gene's “probe set”) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st001">Table S1</xref>). Probe pairs were designed to minimize cross-reactivity between genes contained within and between the two bacterial genomes: this was confirmed experimentally by hybridizing the GeneChips to cDNA targets prepared from each of five cecal RNAs from one or the other group of mice colonized with a single bacterial species (“mono-associated” animals). When the five <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> mono-association–derived cDNA targets were hybridized to the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron/B. longum</italic> GeneChip, a “present” call (defined by GeneChip software) was obtained from an average of 67.7% of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> probe sets, but from only 4.3% of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> probe sets. Similarly, cDNAs generated from the cecal RNAs of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> mono-associated mice produced “present” calls for 63.2% of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> probe sets versus 5.6% of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> probe sets. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> probe sets called “present” in at least three of the five GeneChips hybridized with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> targets (153 probe sets) were designated as cross-reacting, and eliminated from further analysis using an electronic probe mask. The reciprocal analysis resulted in electronic masking of 84 cross-reacting <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> probe sets.</p>
        <p>The five GeneChip datasets produced from the group of co-colonized animals were then referenced to five GeneChip datasets from the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> mono-associated group, yielding a cohort of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genes showing changed expression as a function of colonization state. A total of 681 <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genes were designated as differentially expressed upon co-colonization using selection criteria that maintained a false discovery rate (FDR) of less than 0.01: 359 (53%) of these genes were expressed at higher levels in the presence of <italic>B. longum,</italic> whereas 322 were expressed at lower levels. Functional categorization of the differentially expressed genes using clusters of orthologous groups (COGs) revealed a “metabolism”-biased response to co-colonization, including statistically significant over-representation of up-regulated <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genes involved in “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” and “energy production and conversion” (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01 based on a binomial distribution test; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg001">S1</xref>B; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st002">Table S2</xref> for a list of genes sorted by COGs).</p>

        <title>Co-colonization Results in Differential Expression of Genes Encoding Mannosidases and Related Enzymes</title>
        <p>Mannose is highly coveted as a source of energy for many saccharolytic bacteria: it is a ubiquitous monosaccharide found in both plant and animal glycans, and is easily shunted into the glycolytic pathway via an isomerization of mannose-6-phosphate to fructose-6-phosphate. The desirability of mannose as a substrate is evidenced by the fact that the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genome dedicates over 15% of its repertoire of glycoside hydrolases to the liberation of glycosidically linked mannose (30 mannosidases; ten mannanases). <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s 40 mannose-liberating enzymes contrasts with the three mannosidases present in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content>.</p>
        <p>Three of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s mannosidases are more highly expressed with bi-association (BT2199, BT3530, and BT4093; 1.9-, 2.3-, and 1.7-fold, respectively), whereas two of <italic>B. longum'</italic>s mannosidases show reduced expression (BL1327 and BT1329; 2.8- and 6.7-fold, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These two <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> α-mannosidases are positioned in the gene cluster referred to above that contains two linked permease genes (BL1331 and BL1332; down-regulated 7.4- and 10.1-fold, respectively) and two other glycoside hydrolase activities (BL1333 [substrate specificity unknown]; BL1335 [endo-β-N-acetylglucosaminidase]; down-regulated 8.8- and 14.1-fold, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g001">1</xref>D). Expression of nine of the ten genes encoding <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> enzymes that deliver monosaccharides to the glycolytic and pentose phosphate pathways is unchanged by the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g002">Figure 2</xref>). The lone exception is another component of the gene cluster, a mannose-6-phosphate isomerase (BL1337) that shows 4.2-fold lower expression with co-colonization (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Thus, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> exhibit changes in their transcriptome that suggest differences in either the extent or efficiency of mannoside utilization occur during co-colonization compared to when either species is the sole occupant of the cecum. The apparent decreased catabolism of mannose by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> is consistent with its decreased expression of mannosidases. Nonetheless, despite the relative disparity in mannoside-degrading enzymes between the two organisms (40 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> versus three in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content>), we must be cautious before concluding that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> is a relatively poor competitor for mannosylated glycans. For example, in the co-colonized cecum, other substrates may be available that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> prefers over mannose, resulting in down-regulation of its mannosidase genes, increases in mannose levels, and subsequent up-regulation of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s mannosidase genes. Alternatively, co-colonization could result in changes in the environment, such as pH or osmolarity, that render <italic>B. longum'</italic>s mannosidases more stable, or more efficient, resulting in their subsequent down-regulation.</p>

        <p>In contrast to their disparate responses to mannose-containing glycans, expression of enzymes dedicated to degradation of xylose-containing glycans is enhanced in both bacterial species when they co-exist in the cecum. <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> increases expression of four xyloside-degrading glycoside hydrolases: an endo-xylanase predicted to be secreted (BT3662; 1.8-fold), an exo-xylanase (BT3663; 2.4-fold), and two secreted xylosidases (BT4095 and BT4185; 1.8- and 2.3-fold, respectively) (FDR &lt; 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g001">1</xref>C).</p>

        <title>Verification of Bacterial Glycan Utilization Behaviors within the Ceca of Colonized Mice</title>
        <p>The coincident regulation of glycoside-degrading machinery by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> suggests that when both components of this model community are present in their cecal habitat, utilization of a subset of available polysaccharide substrates changes. To examine this notion further, gas chromatography–mass spectrometric (GC-MS) analysis was employed to establish which monosaccharide components of polysaccharides were significantly depleted in each colonization state. When compared to germ-free controls, mono-association with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> produced a preferential depletion of the three most prominent hexoses (glucose, galactose, and mannose), whereas there were no significant changes in the most prominent pentoses (arabinose and xylose). <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> mono-association also resulted in significant depletion of galactose, glucose, and mannose: however, unlike <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> mono-association, the pentose arabinose was also depleted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This latter observation is consistent with <italic>B. longum'</italic>s considerable arabinoside-degrading capability (11 arabinosidases, exceeded only by glucosidases as the most highly represented class of glycoside hydrolases in its genome; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st003">Table S3</xref>). Consistent with the documented co-colonization–associated up-regulation of xylose-degrading enzymes by both <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <italic>B. longum,</italic> xylose was depleted to a significant degree when both bacterial species were present in the cecal habitat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p>
        <p>To determine if depletion of xylose in the co-colonized state could be attributed to differential usage by either bacterial species, we performed in silico metabolic reconstructions to visualize expression of genes encoding enzymes that shunt monosaccharides liberated by the glycoside hydrolases/polysaccharide lyases into either the glycolytic or pentose phosphate pathways. With co-colonization, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> increases expression of only one of its ten genes that can be assigned to these pathways: a xylulokinase (BT0792) that catalyzes a key step in D-xylose catabolism (3.1-fold increase with co-colonization, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In contrast, neither of the two enzymes assigned to xylose-specific metabolism in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content>—a xylose isomerase (BL1704) and xylulokinase (BL1709)—showed differences in their expression between the two colonization states.</p>
        <p>The observed up-regulation of genes involved in both liberation and catabolism of xylose by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> indicates that it is responsible for at least some of the depletion that occurs during co-colonization. The up-regulation of xyloside-degrading machinery by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> may be a result of both bacterial species turning to an available, but less-coveted substrate that is neglected in mono-association, but accessed when their preferred substrates are depleted in the more competitive environment of co-colonization. Although less parsimonious, an alternative possibility is that each bacterial species, when present alone in the cecum, possesses a complement of glycoside hydrolases that is insufficient for efficient degradation of available xylose-containing glycans. However, when their repertoires of glycoside hydrolases are combined, complementary enzymes activities allow the two bacterial species to participate in a “synergistic” harvest of this class of glycans, a phenomenon observed in other mixed microbial communities that degrade cellulose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b022">22</xref>]. A third, formal possibility is that in mono-associated mice, each species restrains expression of these genes (despite the presence of substrate), but with co-colonization, in response to some signal from the other species, they up-regulate the genes to the combined benefit of both species. This is cooperation (the sacrifice of individual fitness for the fitness of the group) and is unlikely to be taking place because of the inevitability of “cheating” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b023">23</xref>].</p>

        <p>Despite the large effect of host genotype on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> gene expression, the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content>–induced expansion in the carbohydrate substrate range of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> occurs independently of host genotype.

Comparison of the 801 genes that are expressed at higher levels during co-colonization, with the 1,005 genes expressed at reduced levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st008">Tables S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st009">S9</xref>), revealed that “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” is one of the most significantly over-represented COGs (15% of the response, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 10<sup>−10</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg006">Figure S6</xref>B). Nearly twice as many glycoside hydrolases/polysaccharide lyases exhibit higher expression during co-colonization compared to mono-association (61 up-regulated versus 33 down-regulated; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg007">S7</xref>B).

        <p>A comparison of the glycoside hydrolase/polysaccharide lyase families represented in the groups of genes that increase or decrease their expression during co-colonization irrespective of host genotype further substantiated that <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s polysaccharide substrate preferences change in the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content>. The 61 polysaccharide-degrading enzymes that show increased expression fall into 27 different glycoside hydrolase/polysaccharide lyase families (44 families are represented in the entire <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genome), consistent with a broad diversification of glycan utilization. The most highly represented glycoside hydrolase family, 43 (11 members), provides evidence that substrates containing β-xylose and α-arabinose become a major focus of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> when <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> is present (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg007">Figure S7</xref>C).

        <p>The 33 glycan-degrading enzymes with decreased expression also display diverse activities: they represent 18 glycoside hydrolase/polysaccharide lyase families, and show a distribution dissimilar to the up-regulated enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg007">Figure S7</xref>C). Highly represented activities distinct from those present in the up-regulated group include β-hexosaminidases (glycoside hydrolase family 20) and α-fucosidases (glycoside hydrolase family 95), the enzymes that liberate monosaccharides commonly found in host mucus glycans, which are coveted substrates of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b017">17</xref>].

        <p>Probiotic bacterial species vary in their ability to establish residency within the human intestinal microbiota.

Both species, although less well adapted than <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> to take up residency in the human gut, can remain viable during their transit through our gastrointestinal tracts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b028">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>To determine the specificity of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s response to <italic>B. longum,</italic> we performed expression profiling of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> in the presence of either <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. animalis</named-content> DN-173 010 (Danone Vitapole, Jouy-en-Josas, France) or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. casei</named-content> DN-114 001 (Danone Vitapole, CNCM number, I-1518). To ensure continuous interaction between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and these two frequently ingested strains, B6 mice were mono-associated with each of the three species, or were first given <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> followed by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. animalis</named-content> or <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. casei</named-content> every 3 d over a 10-d span (five mice/treatment group).

        <p>Whole genome transcriptional profiling of cecal populations of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> revealed that the impact of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. animalis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. casei</named-content> on the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> transcriptome was modest when compared with the response elicited by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content>. Fifty-eight genes showed increased levels of expression in the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. animalis</named-content> and 53 increased in the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. casei</named-content> (FDR &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g003">Figure 3</xref>A; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st010">Tables S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st011">S11</xref> for gene lists). Moreover, the principal COG categories representing the response to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. animalis</named-content> were “transcription” and “replication” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), whereas the two COG categories that dominate the response to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. casei</named-content> are “carbohydrate transport and metabolism” and “inorganic ion transport and metabolism.” These latter two categories are composed largely of glycoside hydrolase genes and <italic>SusC/D</italic> paralogs, respectively, and represent over 60% of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s functionally categorized response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).

Two of the induced hexosaminidases (BT0459 and BT0460) are present in a putative operon containing an up-regulated α-sialidase and β-galactosidase dedicated to degrading sialylated glycans from host mucus (BT0455–BT0461; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). In addition to the expanded degradation of host glycans, <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s up-regulation of three enzymes that target arabinose-containing polysaccharides (BT0360, endo-α-arabinosidase; BT0368, α-arabinofuranosidase; and BT4668, arabinogalactan endo-β-galactosidase) suggests that accessing dietary plant-derived substrates is also part of the response to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. casei</named-content>.</p>
        <p>In summary, comparison of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s response to the three bacterial species revealed that they are able to induce distinct responses in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron,</italic> both in terms of the magnitude of the response (i.e., the number of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genes that undergo significant changes in expression) and the function of affected genes.

        <p>The transcriptional responses of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> to co-colonization, and the resulting transformation in the cecal nutrient environment raised the question of how host epithelial responses differ between colonization states. Therefore, we performed comprehensive transcriptional profiling on cecal epithelia harvested from the same groups of NMRI mice that were used to profile bacterial gene expression (i.e., <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> mono-associated; <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> mono-associated, and <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron/B. longum</italic> co-colonized). A group of age-matched, untreated male germ-free NMRI mice that were given the same batch of autoclaved chow served as additional controls.</p>
        <p>Laser capture microdissection (LCM) was performed on cecal cryosections prepared from four mice/treatment group (~5,000 epithelial cells recovered/cecum). RNA was prepared from epithelial cells harvested from the cecum of each individual mouse in each treatment group. Equivalent amounts of RNA from each cecum were then pooled from each mouse per group, targets were generated by two independent amplifications of each pooled RNA sample, and each amplified RNA preparation was hybridized to a separate Affymetrix mouse 430 v2.0 GeneChip.</p>
        <p>Expression profiles from each of the three colonization states were referenced to datasets obtained from germ-free controls to identify significantly up-regulated genes using criteria described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>. These comparisons yielded 50 genes in the cecal epithelium of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> mono-associated mice, 24 genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> mono-associated hosts, and 52 genes in co-colonized animals, whose expression was defined as significantly increased relative to germ-free epithelium.

        <p>Since these conclusions were based on a GeneChip analysis of pooled RNAs, we performed follow-up qRT-PCR assays of laser capture microdissected cecal epithelial RNAs isolated from the individual animals used to prepare the pooled samples (<italic>n</italic> = 4/colonization state). <italic>Reg3γ</italic> and <italic>Isg15</italic> were selected for verification because they had exhibited different expression profiles across the three colonization states. The qRT-PCR results established that GeneChip data obtained from pooled RNA samples were representative of individual animals within each group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>
        <p>To gain a broader perspective of the host responses to each of the three colonization states, we categorized all up-regulated host genes using Ingenuity Pathways Analysis software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ingenuity.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ingenuity.com</ext-link>). A right-tailed Fisher exact test was used to determine significantly over-represented (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.05) functional categories containing a minimum of eight genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-st012">Table S12</xref>). Gene interaction networks were then generated for each colonization state using these up-regulated genes as “focus genes” among the thousands of genes called “present” for each condition (<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> mono-association, 10,795 genes; <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> mono-association, 10,479 genes; and co-colonization, 12,138 genes). Unsupervised generation of molecular interaction networks, based on (1) focus genes, (2) genes called “present”, and (3) unrepresented but highly connected genes was performed by the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis software using a knowledge base that consists of more than 1,000,000 functional and physical interactions for more than 23,900 mammalian genes (including 8,200 for mouse). These networks reveal that the host response to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> is centered on tumor necrosis factor-α (TNF-α; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg008">Figure S8</xref>A), an LPS-responsive cytokine produced by natural killer (NK) and T cells and macrophages. This contrasts to the network generated by the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> response which is centered on the T cell–produced cytokine, interferon-γ (IFN-γ; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg008">Figure S8</xref>B).</p>
        <p>The network generated from the co-colonization gene set revealed that both TNF-α and IFN-γ are central highly connected nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg008">Figure S8</xref>C), suggesting that the cytokine milieu in the cecal epithelium of co-colonized mice shares characteristics with each mono-association state.</p>
        <p>Consistent with the Ingenuity Pathway Analysis network construction, the group of genes showing highest expression in the co-colonized state relative to germ-free controls includes three members of the interferon-inducible 47kDa GTPases (<italic>Igtp,</italic> 5.6-fold; <italic>Ifi47,</italic> 6.6-fold; and <italic>Iigp2,</italic> 3.7-fold) and three members of the interferon-inducible p56 family (<italic>Ifit1,</italic> 12.3-fold; <italic>Ifit2,</italic> 16.0-fold; and <italic>Ifit3,</italic> 3.2-fold). The interferon-stimulated gene-15 <italic>(Isg15)</italic>, a ubiquitin family member implicated in mediating viral resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b030">30</xref>], is induced 17.1-fold with co-colonization (20.5-fold by qRT-PCR) compared to 2.0-fold (2.1-fold by qRT-PCR) and 1.2-fold (1.8-fold by qRT-PCR) with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> mono-associations, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g004">4</xref>C). Two other interferon-responsive genes, <italic>Zbp-1,</italic> a Z-DNA binding adenosine deaminase, and <italic>Muc4,</italic> a mucin capable of inhibiting viral capsid binding to target glycans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b031">31</xref>] are up-regulated in all colonization states but show highest expression with co-colonization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>
        <p>In addition to inducing host cytokine-responsive genes, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> appears to possess the capacity to regulate host antibacterial proteins. Reg3γ (regenerating islet-derived-3γ) is a C-type lectin that is secreted by an epithelial cell lineage that plays an important role in innate immune responses. Reg3γ binds with high affinity to peptidoglycan, and exhibits broad microbicidal activity against Gram-positive bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b032">32</xref>]. We found that although Reg3γ is induced in mice colonized with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> alone (5.2-fold above germ free; 3.6-fold by qRT-PCR), it is significantly down-regulated when <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> is present by itself (repressed 8.5-fold compared to germ free; 9.7-fold by qRT-PCR) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g004">Figure 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g004">4</xref>C). Pancreatitis-associated protein (Pap; <italic>Reg3β</italic>), another member of the Reg family that also contains a lectin domain, displayed an expression profile similar to <italic>Reg3γ</italic> on two different types of Affymetrix GeneChips, including a custom GlycoGeneChip containing components of the mouse gene involved in carbohydrate metabolism (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.functionalglycomics.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.functionalglycomics.org</ext-link> see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040413-g004">Figures 4</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040413-sg009">S9</xref>). The ability of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> to repress host expression of antibacterial proteins may not only promote its own survival in the gut, but also influence the composition, structure, and function of its microbial community.</p>

        <title>Prospectus</title>
        <p>Using gnotobiotic mice, we have investigated the effects of introducing three commonly consumed live microbial strains that vary in their ability to colonize the human gut, on <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron,</italic> a prominent symbiotic member of our microbiota, and on the host. Our findings indicate that when <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> encounters <italic>B. longum,</italic> it expands its repertoire of prominently expressed glycoside hydrolases, including multiple enzymes involved in mannoside and xyloside degradation, and up-regulates xylose catabolism. By comparing the responses in two different inbred strains of gnotobiotic mice, we find that host genotype affects the specific suite of microbial genes deployed when <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> encounters <italic>B. longum.</italic> However, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content>–induced diversification in the carbohydrate substrates accessed by <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> occurs independent of host genotype and is characterized by a general shift in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s focus away from mucus glycans and towards dietary plant polysaccharides.</p>
        <p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. animalis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. casei</named-content> strains selected for our study are common components of the fermented dairy foods we ingest. Co-colonization of either species with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> has allowed us to conclude that (1) if glycoside gene expression is used as a biomarker of substrate range, the impact of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> is not a generic effect of Bifidobacteria (it is not detectable with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. animalis</named-content>); and (2) <italic>L. casei,</italic> a member of a different division of Bacteria, can emulate the effects of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. longum</named-content> on <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron'</italic>s polysaccharide utilization—albeit by altering expression of a different constellation of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> genes. Once genome sequences for these strains become available, it will be possible to ascertain how <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. thetaiotaomicron</named-content> influences their transcriptomes, and thus establish more about the nature and consequences of their interactions. The changes that we observe may be due to direct effects of the co-habitating species on one another (e.g., through production of chemical messengers), or indirect effects (e.g., changes in substrate availability or changes in host response).</p>
        <p>Together, our findings emphasize the importance of assessing the impact of probiotics on our gut microbiota. Humans have complex and varied microbiotas, non-uniform diets, and diverse genotypes. Further tests of the mechanism of action of commonly ingested live microbial supplements could include creation of more elaborate gnotobiotic mouse models containing intentional communities composed of sequenced representatives of other prominently represented divisions of bacteria in our gut microbiota (e.g., a member of the Firmicutes combined with a member of Bacteroidetes). These studies should utilize strains of commonly used probiotics whose genomes have been sequenced, pay attention to variables such as the diet and genetic background of the mouse, look at effects in different regions of the digestive tract, and seek to identify serum- or fecal-based biomarkers of host responses that may be applicable to humans. Since we do not yet know the degree to which differences in our microbial ecology reflect differences in the metabolic activities of our microbiotas, it seems reasonable to suggest that current clinical trials of the effects of presumptive probiotics also pay careful attention to documenting a subject's microbiota prior to, during, and after treatment. In principle, the impending revolution in metagenomics may help by allowing comprehensive documentation of changes in the gut “microbiome” of a given individual as a function of probiotic administration. As illustrated by a recent study, computational tools are now in hand to take metagenomic datasets of a fecal microbiome, and infer features of the metabolic properties of a person's gut microbial community [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b033">33</xref>].</p>

        <p>To avoid problems associated with multiple hypotheses testing, we did not use <italic>p</italic>-values from the second ANOVA model to determine the statistical significance of each effect for each gene. Instead, we calculated the <italic>q</italic>-value for each gene based on the distribution of <italic>p</italic>-values across all genes. The <italic>q</italic>-value is a measure of the FDR: the percentage of genes incorrectly deemed to have significant expression changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b037">37</xref>]. The advantage of using <italic>q</italic>-values, rather than <italic>p</italic>-values, is that the calculation of <italic>q</italic>-values automatically takes into account that many hypotheses are being tested simultaneously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b037">37</xref>]. For each gene, we calculated the <italic>q</italic>-values for genotype effect, treatment effect, and genotype by treatment interaction effect, using the program QVALUE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040413-b037">37</xref>]. We considered a gene's expression to exhibit a significant effect (genotype, treatment, or genotype-by-treatment interactions) if its <italic>q</italic>-value for that effect is less than 0.01. A <italic>q</italic>-value of 0.01 for genotype effect is equivalent to a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.03937. A <italic>q-</italic>value of 0.01 for treatment effect is equivalent to a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.01833, and a <italic>q</italic>-value of 0.01 for the interaction effect is equivalent to a <italic>p</italic>-value of 0.006818.</p>
        <p>The ANOVA provided us with sets of genes displaying significant genotypic effect, treatment effect, and interaction effects. We divided these genes into seven sets: set 1 includes genes with only genotypic effect; set 2 includes genes with only treatment effect; set 3 includes genes with only interaction effect; set 4 includes genes with both genotypic and treatment effects; set 5 includes genes with both genotypic and interaction effects; set 6 includes genes with both treatment and interaction effects; and set 7 includes genes with all three effects. For genes with genotypic effects (set 1, set 4, set 5, and set 7), fold-changes were calculated by dividing the average gene expression when host is NMRI by the average gene expression when host is B6. For genes with treatment effects (set 2, set 4, set 6, and set 7), fold-changes were calculated by dividing the average gene expression from mono-association by the average gene expression from co-colonization.</p>
