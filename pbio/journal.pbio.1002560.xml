<abstract>
<p>The Slit protein is a major midline repellent for central nervous system (CNS) axons. In vivo, Slit is proteolytically cleaved into N- and C-terminal fragments, but the biological significance of this is unknown. Analysis in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ventral nerve cord of a <italic>slit</italic> allele (<italic>slit-UC</italic>) that cannot be cleaved revealed that midline repulsion is still present but longitudinal axon guidance is disrupted, particularly across segment boundaries. Double mutants for the Slit receptors <italic>Dscam1</italic> and <italic>robo1</italic> strongly resemble the <italic>slit-UC</italic> phenotype, suggesting they cooperate in longitudinal axon guidance, and through biochemical approaches, we found that Dscam1 and Robo1 form a complex dependent on Slit-N. In contrast, Robo1 binding alone shows a preference for full-length Slit, whereas Dscam1 only binds Slit-N. Using a variety of transgenes, we demonstrated that Dscam1 appears to modify the output of Robo/Slit complexes so that signaling is no longer repulsive. Our data suggest that the complex is promoting longitudinal axon growth across the segment boundary. The ability of Dscam1 to modify the output of other receptors in a ligand-dependent fashion may be a general principle for Dscam proteins.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Most complex nervous systems have an anterior-posterior axis of symmetry: the midline of the central nervous system. Longitudinal nerves, formed by bundled axons, connect the brain to other parts of the body and grow long distances parallel to the central nervous system midline. In the fruit fly, the nerve cord is segmented, and the boundary of each segment represents a challenge for the longitudinal axons to cross. What cues promote growth of axons across these boundaries remains unknown. The Slit protein is classically known as a repulsive signal that prevents axons from crossing the midline by binding to its receptor Robo on the surface of axons. However, it is known that Slit is cleaved into two fragments, but the significance of this process remains to be elucidated. In this study, we find that cleavage of Slit allows the large fragment (Slit-N) to bind to another receptor called Dscam1, which then forms a complex with Robo1. Our experiments confirm that Slit processing is required for the longitudinal growth of axons across the segment boundary. Our work suggests that the Slit-N-Dscam1-Robo1 complex signals axons to grow, but Slit-N is not a specific navigational cue. Dscam proteins have evolutionarily conserved ligand-binding activities; therefore, they may be able to alter the signaling output of other receptors. The Slit fragments play diverse roles, from tumor metastasis to HIV replication; thus, identifying a receptor that is specific for Slit-N provides a molecular explanation for why cleavage occurs.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Longitudinal axon guidance is distinguished by long periods of growth independent of intermediate targets. In vertebrates, long distance gradients of Wnt and Shh have been shown to guide longitudinal axons in an anterior-posterior direction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref002">2</xref>]. Longitudinal axons also respond to local cues derived from the central nervous system (CNS) midline, notably attractants such as Netrin and repellents such as Slit. The conflicting actions of these cues act to set the dorsal-ventral positions for longitudinal axon pioneers and dopaminergic axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref006">6</xref>]. In vitro culture of longitudinal explants with both Netrin and Slit synergistically promotes axon growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref005">5</xref>], suggesting that the opposing cues not only define accurate lateral positioning but also may promote axon growth.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the highly organized and segmented nature of the nerve cord makes it easy to detect gross defects in longitudinal axon guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref007">7</xref>]. Mutations in the <italic>lola</italic> gene specifically disrupt longitudinal formation between segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Lola is a transcription factor that regulates the expression of multiple axon guidance genes such as <italic>robo1</italic>, <italic>slit</italic>, and <italic>Dscam1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>Notch</italic> and <italic>Delta</italic> are the only two cell surface genes identified that have highly penetrant longitudinal disruption phenotypes as single mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref011">11</xref>]. Notch signaling induces neurons to produce a mesh of projections that link segments, providing a substrate for navigating growth cones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref012">12</xref>]. The Netrin receptor Frazzled (Fra) is found on this mesh, as well as axons, and traps Netrin diffusing from the CNS midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref013">13</xref>]. Longitudinal pioneer axons grow along the edge of this Netrin-positive region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>]. Netrin therefore has two activities in longitudinal axon guidance as a local contact-dependent cue and as a midline-derived chemoattractant that must be suppressed by other signals to prevent inappropriate midline crossing.</p>

<p>Embryos stained with monoclonal antibody (mAb) BP102 (A–D) to reveal the central nervous system (CNS) axon scaffold and anti-Fas2 (1D4) to reveal the longitudinal tracts (E–L). (A) Stage 16 wild-type embryo with an intersegmental longitudinal tract marked by an arrow. (B) <italic>slit</italic><sup><italic>2</italic></sup> homozygous embryo displaying the characteristic collapse of the axon scaffold onto the CNS midline. (C) <italic>robo1</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup> homozygous embryo showing the characteristic pattern of thickened commissures and reduced longitudinals (arrow). BP102 staining in the longitudinal tracts is reduced. (D) Stage 16 uncleavable <italic>slit</italic> mutant displaying reduced or absent longitudinals (arrows) and variability in the degree of axon collapse towards the midline in each segment, e.g., a gap between the commissures is visible in the lowest segment but not in any other segment. (E) <italic>Dscam1</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup> <italic>robo</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup> mutant in which several longitudinal tracts are absent (arrows). The nerve cord has not condensed as much as wild type or the <italic>robo</italic> mutant, so less segments are visible in the field of view. The individual segments are more variable than the <italic>robo</italic> mutant. (F) <italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>e76</italic></sup>, a strong allele in which the longitudinal connectives (arrow) are almost completely absent. There is also a reduction in the thickness of the commissures. (G) Stage 17 wild-type embryo with longitudinal tracts running parallel to the CNS midline (center of image). (H) <italic>Dscam1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> embryo with breaks to the outermost fascicle (arrow) and an overall waviness to the longitudinal fascicles. (I) <italic>robo1</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup> mutant in which the innermost fascicles frequently merge and form circles around the midline. The medial and lateral fascicles are present (not always in the focal plane) and largely intact but display thinning and occasional breaks and defasciculation (arrows). (J) <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant in which many of the longitudinal axons have fused to form a large fascicle that meanders along the midline (arrow). Remnants of the outermost fascicle are present but slightly out of focus, reflecting an overall degree of disorganization to the nerve cord. The occasional <italic>robo-</italic>like circle is visible (arrowhead). (K) <italic>Dscam1</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup> <italic>robo</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup> homozygous embryo displaying disruption to all the longitudinal axon tracts. A large, thick fascicle follows the midline, occasionally forming circles (arrowhead). The outermost fascicle is still present but is thicker than normal, so it has likely fused with the intermediate fascicle. There are frequent breaks, and sometimes the fascicle is completely absent (arrows). (L) <italic>lola</italic><sup><italic>B40</italic></sup> strong allele showing a large fascicle wandering back and forth across the midline (arrow). The underlying data are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s001">S1 Data</xref>.</p>

<p>The Robo/Slit signaling system plays a key role in defining the lateral position of longitudinal axons in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, acting as a repellent from the CNS midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref018">18</xref>]. The emerging view is that Slit and Netrin signaling balance each other to maintain the lateral position of axons, and this view is supported by mutant analysis in flies and vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref019">19</xref>]. However, in embryos with reduced Robo/Slit signaling in which longitudinal axons inappropriately cross the midline, ectopic <italic>slit</italic> expression in the longitudinal pathway was sufficient to rescue guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>]. Nondirectional <italic>slit</italic> signals can therefore promote longitudinal trajectories by preventing midline crossing, suggesting that Robo/Slit signaling suppresses the Netrin-induced attraction to the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>]. The results of subsequent epistasis experiments examining the behavior of the pCC longitudinal pioneer axon in combinations of <italic>fra</italic>, <italic>robo1</italic>, and <italic>slit</italic> mutants are consistent with this conclusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref019">19</xref>]. These observations lead to the question of whether this secondary Slit activity is mediated by Robo or alternative receptors.</p>
<p>Dscam1 is a high-affinity receptor for Slit with a role in axon branching of adult mechanosensory axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref020">20</xref>]. In the embryo, <italic>Dscam1</italic> mutants have strong disruptions to the outermost longitudinal fascicle, and intact fascicles often have a wavy appearance suggesting a role in longitudinal growth and guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref021">21</xref>]. We find that Dscam1 only binds Slit-N and that binding recruits Robo1 in a complex. A <italic>slit</italic> mutant that cannot be cleaved (<italic>slit-UC</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref022">22</xref>] retains repulsive activity but displays strong disruption of longitudinal axon guidance, suggesting that Slit-N is required for the progression of longitudinal axons from segment to segment. Several lines of genetic evidence suggest that Slit-N signaling through the Dscam1-Robo1 complex promotes longitudinal axon outgrowth across the segment boundary.</p>

<title>Analysis of an Uncleavable <italic>slit</italic> Mutation Reveals a Role in Longitudinal Axon Guidance</title>
<p>Proteolytic cleavage of Slit does not appear to be required for axon repulsion, as expression of an uncleavable <italic>slit</italic> transgene rescues <italic>slit</italic> mutants as effectively as wild-type <italic>slit</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref023">23</xref>]. Subsequent analysis of a <italic>slit</italic> allele (<italic>slit-UC</italic>) incapable of being cleaved revealed a role for Slit cleavage in muscle migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref022">22</xref>]. We analyzed the effect of the <italic>slit-UC</italic> allele on CNS formation and found that the axon scaffold superficially resembles that of a <italic>robo1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). However, while <italic>robo1</italic> mutants have a highly regular CNS axon scaffold, <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants are variable from segment to segment. The <italic>slit-UC</italic> longitudinal connectives between segments are often missing or have collapsed into one tract, whereas <italic>robo1</italic> mutants almost always have two tracts on either side of the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref007">7</xref>]. To analyze this phenotype in more detail, we stained with anti-Fasciclin 2 (Fas2), which labels three parallel longitudinal tracts on either side of the midline. In the <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant, all three longitudinal fascicles contribute to form a single thick fascicle that meanders along the midline forming occasional circles of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1J</xref>). The outermost fascicle is highly discontinuous and frequently appears to have stalled. This contrasts with the <italic>robo1</italic> phenotype in which only the innermost (pCC/MP1) pathway wanders across the midline, while the medial and lateral tracts generally do not, although they can be thinner or show occasional breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). The <italic>slit-UC</italic> allele therefore has a phenotype that is stronger than <italic>robo1</italic> mutants alone. The <italic>slit-UC</italic> Fas2 phenotype resembles strong <italic>lola</italic> alleles in which the majority of Fas2-positive axons wander back and forth across the midline in a single large fascicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1L</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref008">8</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>Dscam robo1</italic> Double Mutants Resemble the <italic>slit-UC</italic> Phenotype</title>
<p>As the <italic>slit-UC</italic> phenotype is more severe than <italic>robo1</italic>, we constructed double mutants for both <italic>Dscam1</italic> and <italic>robo1</italic> to see if any synergy between these Slit receptors was observed. <italic>Dscam1 robo1</italic> double mutants have an enhanced <italic>robo1</italic> phenotype resembling that of <italic>slit-UC</italic> because the longitudinal connectives are frequently reduced to one tract (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Unlike <italic>slit-UC</italic>, which appears variable at all stages of axon outgrowth, <italic>Dscam1 robo1</italic> double mutants are relatively regular until stage 16 and then rapidly become more irregular perhaps because the nerve cord often fails to condense (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s008">S1 Fig</xref>). We stained the longitudinal tracts with anti-Fas2 and found that in <italic>Dscam1 robo1</italic> mutants, all the axon tracts are disrupted, with a single thick fascicle wandering across the midline, and the medial and lateral tracts are clearly disrupted, frequently stalled so there is no connection of segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1K</xref>). This phenotype strongly resembles the <italic>slit-UC</italic> phenotype. To accurately quantify longitudinal phenotypes, we counted the number of Fas2-positive fascicles at the segment boundaries (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s001">S1 Data</xref>). We used two different <italic>Dscam1</italic> alleles to generate the double mutants, and one combination (<italic>Dscam1</italic><sup><italic>P</italic></sup> <italic>robo</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup>) was statistically indistinguishable from <italic>slit-UC</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.98, Tukey honest significant difference [HSD] test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g002">Fig 2</xref>). The other combination (<italic>Dscam1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> <italic>robo</italic><sup><italic>4</italic></sup>) had a weaker phenotype, although it was still significantly stronger than any of the other genotypes tested. This may be due to the nature of the alleles or genetic modifiers on the mutant chromosome. Both <italic>Dscam1</italic> and <italic>robo1</italic> mutants have breaks in the outermost Fas2-positive fascicle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1H and 1I</xref>), and the double mutant combination had a statistically significant increase in severity of the longitudinal axon guidance phenotype (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Tukey HSD test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Mutants in the <italic>robo2</italic> and <italic>Dscam3</italic> paralogues have disruptions in the longitudinal fascicles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s009">S2 Fig</xref>), so we included these genes in the fascicle analysis, finding they make minor contributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g002">Fig 2</xref>). In summary, Slit cleavage and the <italic>Dscam1</italic> and <italic>robo1</italic> genes are all required for longitudinal axon guidance, with the high frequency of stalled (missing) Fas2-positive tracts suggesting an axon growth defect as well.</p>

<title>Pioneer Axon Basis of the <italic>slit-UC</italic> Phenotype</title>
<p>The longitudinal connectives in the fly embryo are pioneered in part by the pCC interneuron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref025">25</xref>]. To understand what role Slit cleavage might be playing, we examined the behavior of the pCC axon in the <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant using anti-Fas2 staining. In early stage 13 <italic>slit-UC</italic> embryos, the pCC axons can clearly be seen growing at different rates, supporting a role in axon growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Cell body positioning in the <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant is also irregular, suggesting a role in neuronal migrations. In wild-type embryos, the pCC axon does not cross the midline, projecting ipsilaterally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In contrast, in <italic>robo1</italic> mutants, 96% of pCC axons cross the midline in the first commissure they encounter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3C, 3C′ and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s002">S2 Data</xref>). Surprisingly, given the similarity to <italic>robo1</italic> mutants when stained with BP102, only 30% of pCC axons cross the midline at the first commissure in <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3B′ and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s003">S3 Data</xref>). This difference is statistically significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Tukey HSD test). The <italic>slit-UC</italic> allele produces a less stable Slit protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref022">22</xref>], which may be responsible for the pCC phenotype, but midline repulsion is clearly present. The ascending (pCC and also vMP2) and descending (MP1 and dMP2) pioneers fasciculate to form the first longitudinal tract that spans the segment boundary. In <italic>robo1</italic> mutants, the pioneer axons recross the midline on arriving at the next segment (stage 14), forming the characteristic circular fascicles that give the mutant its name (<italic>roundabout</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3C′′</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref007">7</xref>]. The same circular fascicles are seen in <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3B′′</xref>). We scored the presence of a Fas2-positive midline-crossing fascicle at the posterior of a segment as evidence for pCC crossing the midline and found such a fascicle present in 95% of the segments examined. This frequency is statistically indistinguishable from <italic>robo1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In summary, in <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants most pCC axons do not cross the midline at the first commissure they encounter but do cross at the next commissure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). This phenotype is quite distinct from <italic>robo1</italic> mutants (see the schematic in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s010">S3 Fig</xref>) and allows us to experimentally separate midline repulsion from crossing the segment boundary. The phenotype potentially reveals an inability of Slit/Robo signaling to suppress Netrin-based midline attraction, a possibility we test below. Alternative explanations include a decrease in repulsion as the embryo gets older or a need for an increase in growth cone motility to cross the segment boundary as the axon environment grows more complex.</p>

(C′′) <italic>robo</italic> mutant in which the circular fascicles created by longitudinal pioneers recrossing the midline in every segment are visible. (D) Quantification of initial pCC midline crossing in early to mid-stage 13 embryos.

Genotypes are shown beneath the columns. Error bars are one standard deviation. The data were analyzed using a Tukey HSD within a one-way ANOVA.

The presence of a pCC axon at or near the midline was scored as a crossing event. Genotypes are shown beneath the columns, and error bars are one standard deviation. The data were analyzed using a Tukey HSD within a one-way ANOVA. There was no significant difference between <italic>robo</italic> and <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants. (F) Schematic representing the axon trajectories observed in <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants. The pCC axons are born just posterior to a commissure (red arrow). Ninety-six percent of <italic>robo</italic> mutant pCC axons immediately cross this commissure, but only 30% of <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant axons do. The pCC axons grow anteriorly, encountering the descending MP1 longitudinal pioneer axons. In both <italic>robo</italic> and <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants, the pCC axon typically follows the MP1 axon to the midline. The primary difference between <italic>robo</italic> and <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants is therefore the tendency to cross the midline at the first commissure (red arrow).

<title>A Slit-N-Dependent Dscam1-Robo Complex</title>
<p>As axon guidance receptors can form complexes that alter responses to ligands, we tested whether Dscam1, Robo1, and Slit could form a complex in cell culture. The receptors and Slit were expressed in 293 cells, which can proteolytically process Slit to produce Slit-N [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref026">26</xref>]. Immunoprecipitation of Robo1 can pull down Dscam1, but only in the presence of Slit, suggesting that Dscam could modify Robo signaling output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). When Robo1 was present alone, Slit-FL was preferentially immunoprecipitated by anti-Robo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). However, when plasmids for Robo1 and Dscam1 were present in approximately stoichiometric amounts, Slit-N was preferentially immunoprecipitated, indicating that the Dscam1-Robo1-Slit-N complex forms in preference to Robo1-Slit-FL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We also tested the ability of Dscam1 to bind Slit isoforms in the absence of Robo1. We transfected 293 and COS cells with plasmids for full-length Slit and Dscam1. Immunoprecipitation of Dscam1 pulled down Slit-N, but not Slit-FL from 293 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Our COS cell line cannot proteolytically process Slit, allowing us to test whether Dscam1 will bind to Slit-FL when Slit-N is absent. No evidence for Slit-FL binding was found, strongly suggesting that Dscam1 only binds Slit-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Expression of Robo2 increases Slit processing in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref027">27</xref>], but we found no evidence that the presence of Dscam1 influenced cleavage. Because 293 cells process Slit efficiently, the differences in processing may be best visualized in vivo, where processing is more highly regulated. This result provides a molecular explanation for Slit processing and suggests there is an equilibrium between Robo1 homodimers and the Dscam1-Robo1 complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4I</xref>). In flies, expression of the Netrin receptor Frazzled lacking a cytoplasmic domain (<italic>FraΔC</italic>) has been used to dissect the function of Fra [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref029">29</xref>]. If the role of Dscam1 is simply to inhibit Robo1, then a Dscam1 dominant-negative construct lacking the cytoplasmic domain (<italic>Dscam1ΔC</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref030">30</xref>] would be expected to mimic expression of a similar <italic>robo1</italic> construct (<italic>robo1ΔC</italic>). Labeling of the ventral nerve cord with anti-Fasciclin 2 (Fas2) reveals three parallel longitudinal tracts on either side of the CNS midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Pan-neural expression using the <italic>sca-GAL4</italic> driver and a single copy (1x) of <italic>Dscam1ΔC</italic> is highly disruptive to the longitudinal tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The large number of stalled axons and breaks in the tracts suggests that Dscam1 is playing a role in axon growth. In contrast, a single copy of a <italic>robo1ΔC</italic> transgene induces mild midline crossing as is seen for weak <italic>robo1</italic> mutants, although breaks in the outermost fascicle are also seen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref031">31</xref>]. Surprisingly, when embryos expressing a single copy of <italic>Dscam1ΔC</italic> (1x) are stained with BP102 to reveal the CNS axon scaffold, it appears more or less like wild type, indicating that the transgenes have a disproportionately strong impact on longitudinal axon guidance. Coexpression of both <italic>Dscam1ΔC</italic> and <italic>robo1ΔC</italic> transgenes in single copies did not produce an increase in severity. The contrasting results obtained for <italic>robo1ΔC</italic> and <italic>Dscam1ΔC</italic> indicate that Dscam1 is not merely soaking up Slit-N in the embryo (in which case a <italic>robo1</italic>-like phenotype should be observed) but is actively signaling within the longitudinal tracts. Dscam1ΔC is likely inhibiting the activity of other receptors or complexes. Expression of multiple copies of <italic>robo1ΔC</italic> produces a <italic>robo1-</italic>like phenotype of increased midline crossing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref032">32</xref>]. Increasing the copy number (2x) of <italic>Dscam1ΔC</italic> and the pan-neural driver results in disruption of both longitudinal and commissural axon guidance, and these connectives are largely missing in affected embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4H</xref>). The commissural axon defect confirms our earlier observations that <italic>Dscam1</italic> participates in growth towards the CNS midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref033">33</xref>]. We expect Dscam1ΔC to be binding to Slit-N and Robo1, disrupting the signaling output of the complex. As Robo1 is present in only the longitudinal portions of the CNS axon scaffold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref034">34</xref>], Robo1/Dscam1 complexes are likely participating in longitudinal axon guidance.</p>

<title>Dscam1 Has at Least Two Binding Sites for Slit-N</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that Slit-N binds with high affinity (22 nM) to the first four immunoglobulin (Ig) domains of Dscam1 (EC4 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref020">20</xref>].

COS cell expression was confirmed by immunohistochemistry and western blot. Two Slit constructs with an N-terminal myc epitope (to avoid any steric hindrance at the cleavage site), myc-Slit-FL and myc-Slit-N (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), produced identical bands of ~123 kD corresponding to Slit-N in National Institutes of Health (NIH) 293 cells. In cell overlay studies, Slit-N did not bind to constructs lacking the first five Ig domains or longer (IgΔ1–5 and IgΔ1–7 constructs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5C</xref>), confirming our earlier result that the binding site lies in the N-terminal ectodomain of Dscam1. Slit-N bound to the full-length Dscam1 ectodomain (EC-FL) and to constructs lacking the first (IgΔ1) and first two Ig domains (IgΔ1–2; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). This suggested that Slit-N would bind to either Ig3 or Ig4. However, deletion of either of these domains alone did not prevent binding. We speculated that the binding sites could lie on either side of the variable domains and deleted both Ig1 and Ig4 simultaneously also without disrupting binding. These results strongly suggest that Slit-N has at least two binding sites in the first five Ig domains of Dscam1. To confirm these results, we utilized a series of constructs in which the Slit ectodomain is deleted from the carboxy-terminal end and the derivatives fused with the Fc region of human IgG (EC series, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref035">35</xref>]. We previously demonstrated that EC4 binds to Slit-N fused to alkaline phosphatase and that Slit-N does not bind Fc alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref020">20</xref>]. These constructs are fused to the antibody constant region, allowing immunoprecipitation. Slit proteins were produced using a baculovirus system, and in the insect cell lines used, Slit processing was observed at a low level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s011">S4 Fig</xref>). When Slit-FL was tested for binding to the EC constructs, Slit-N was found to bind to all constructs tested, but Slit-FL did not, even though Slit-FL is present in considerable excess (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). This implies that there is a Slit binding site in the first three Ig domains of Dscam1. We confirmed this finding with Slit-N expression alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5F</xref>). Combined with the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3</xref>, this suggests that Dscam1 has a strong preference for binding Slit-N. As a further control, we mapped the binding site of Netrin-B to Ig domains 7 and 8, as NetB bound to Ec8 but not Ec6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). This result is consistent with those obtained for vertebrate Dscam and cNetrin-1, which placed binding in Ig domains 7–9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref036">36</xref>]. In summary, Slit-N binds to at least two sites in the first five Ig domains of Dscam1, with one site lying in the first three Ig domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5H</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Schematic representation of the Dscam1 expression constructs used. Ig domains are either orange for constant domains or red for variable domains, and fibronectin (FN) domains are blue rectangles. The naming scheme for the constructs indicates which Ig domains are deleted (Δ), while the construct with the entire ectodomain is called FL-EC. All constructs had their cytoplasmic domain replaced with a 6xHis epitope tag. Immunoblot with an anti-His antibody indicates that all constructs are expressed at their predicted sizes. (B) Schematic of N-terminally Myc epitope-tagged Slit constructs generated with leucine-rich repeats (LRRs) in red, epidermal growth factor (EGF) repeats in blue, the Laminin G domain in bright pink, and the cysteine knot in dull pink. (C) Cell overlay assays. COS cells were transfected with different Dscam1 expression constructs and tested for binding to N-terminally myc-tagged Slit-N produced by 293 cells. The relevant constructs are indicated. Binding of myc-Slit-N was detected by anti-myc (red) and counterstained with 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) to reveal the nuclei (blue). Myc-Slit-N was found to bind FL-EC, IgΔ1, IgΔ1–2, IgΔ3, IgΔ4, and IgΔ1,4, but not IgΔ1–5 or IgΔ1–7, indicating myc-Slit-N binding in the first five Ig domains. Scale bars: 30 μm. (D) Diagram of Dscam-Fc deletion series [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref035">35</xref>]. Immunoglobulin (Ig), FN, and the transmembrane (TM) domains are indicated. The variable Ig domains are shaded black (Ig2, Ig3, and Ig7). The TM domain of full-length Dscam is replaced by an antibody constant region (Fc) domain in the deletion series. (E) Immunoprecipitation of Slit-N by Dscam-Fc fusions. Baculovirus-produced Slit-FL is loaded as a standard in the right-hand lane, and a low level of Slit-N can also be observed. Slit-FL was incubated with the EC proteins and immunoprecipitated with anti-Fc antibody, and immunoblot detection was with anti-Slit-N antibody. Slit-N was found to bind to all EC constructs tested, but not to the beads alone. Previous experiments revealed that Slit-N does not bind Fc protein alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref020">20</xref>]. The secondary antibody used to detect Slit-N detects the Fc fusion proteins (asterisks), including a specific degradation product for EC16. (F) Coimmunoprecipitation of Slit-N with EC proteins 3, 4, and 16 was detected by an immunoblot for Slit-N. Slit-N binds to all three constructs. Fc proteins are marked by asterisks. (G) Immunoprecipitation of NetB by Dscam-Fc fusions. Media from 293 cells expressing NetB was incubated with the EC proteins and then immunoprecipitated with anti-Fc antibody. The immunoblot was probed with anti-myc antibody to detect NetB. NetB bound to EC8 and all larger constructs. The bands migrating at the same weight as NetB in the EC6 and EC16 lanes are Dscam-Fc fusion proteins. EC16 has several degradation products when mixed with 293 cell media. We are confident that no NetB is bound in the EC6 lane. (H) Schematic summarizing the binding site data, indicating that Slit-N has at least two binding sites in the Dscam1 ectodomain and that the NetB binding site is physically distinct from the Slit binding sites.</p>

<title><italic>Dscam1</italic> Modulates <italic>slit-N</italic> Phenotypes In Vivo</title>
<p>The preferential binding of Slit-N to Dscam1 led us to identify an assay system in which we could observe differential effects of Slit-FL and Slit-N in vivo. Motor neurons express <italic>robo1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref037">37</xref>] and <italic>Dscam1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s012">S5 Fig</xref>). <italic>Dscam1</italic> mutants show motor neuron innervation defects, suggesting <italic>Dscam1</italic> is active in the process. Dscam1 is also seen at a low level at muscle attachment sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s012">S5 Fig</xref>), so Dscam1 may be present on the muscles themselves. Muscles do not normally express <italic>slit</italic> as they respond to Slit at muscle attachment sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref038">38</xref>]. Muscle overexpression of <italic>UAS-slit-FL</italic> in muscles has been previously shown to repel innervating motor neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref039">39</xref>]. We found that overexpression of <italic>UAS-slit-N</italic> only repelled 30% of motor neurons innervating the muscle 6/7 cleft, whereas <italic>UAS-slit-FL</italic> repelled 70% of axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Expression of an uncleavable <italic>slit</italic> transgene (<italic>UAS-slit-U</italic>) repelled 74% of motor neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), the same level as <italic>UAS-slit-FL</italic>. Removal of <italic>Dscam1</italic> activity increased the repulsive effect of <italic>UAS-slit-N</italic> to a level that is statistically equivalent to that of <italic>UAS-slit-FL</italic>, but muscle innervation was different from overexpression of <italic>UAS-slit-N</italic> alone or the failure of innervation seen in <italic>Dscam1</italic> homozygotes (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001, Tukey HSD test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). As muscles do not normally express slit, and Dscam1 may be present on the muscles at a low level, these results must be interpreted with caution. As Dscam1 modulates the response of motor neurons to ectopically expressed Slit-N, it may be acting as a receptor in vivo. However, loss of <italic>Dscam1</italic> may allow the expression or activation of an alternative receptor that responds directly to Slit-N. Dscam1-Dscam1 interactions between the motor neuron and muscle could also be mediating a repulsive effect. In the absence of <italic>Dscam1</italic>, Slit-N appears to be as repulsive as Slit-FL or Slit-U. Motor neuron growth cones actively integrate both positive and negative cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref040">40</xref>]. Slit-N may have both a repulsive activity and a second activity such as promoting axon outgrowth that may have conflicting effects on motor neurons.</p>

<title>Embryonic Dscam1-Slit Signaling Requires the Robo Binding Site in Slit</title>
<p>Previous genetic analysis of <italic>slit</italic> suggested that deletion of the epidermal growth factor (EGF) domains enhances the repulsive function of <italic>slit</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref041">41</xref>]. Expression of a <italic>slit</italic> construct lacking the EGF domains also disrupted longitudinal axon guidance, suggesting the EGF domains might be the Dscam1 binding site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref041">41</xref>]. We expressed EGF domains 1–3 in cell culture and were able to immunoprecipitate the EGF domains with anti-Dscam1, but not with anti-Robo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>). We confirmed the interaction using a cell overlay assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). To test the involvement of Robo in Slit-N signaling, a <italic>slit</italic> construct with the Robo binding site of leucine-rich repeat 2 (LRR2) deleted was generated (Slit-D). Slit-D was found to still be capable of binding Dscam1 in an immunoprecipitation assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Interestingly, the bound Slit-D protein is the uncleaved form, indicating that Slit-D can bind to Dscam1 in the absence of proteolytic processing. Slit-D also bound Dscam1 in a cell overlay assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7E</xref>), confirming that the Dscam1 binding site is distinct from the Robo binding site (schematic in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). We expressed <italic>slit-D</italic> at the CNS midline in a <italic>slit</italic> mutant, and as expected, <italic>slit-D</italic> was unable to rescue the collapse of axons onto the CNS midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). However, pan-neural expression of <italic>slit-D</italic> disrupted the guidance of all longitudinal tracts and caused the appearance of a large fascicle wandering the midline that was reminiscent of <italic>slit-U</italic>, <italic>Dscam1 robo1</italic>, and <italic>lola</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). Slit-D may be acting as a dominant-negative binding to Dscam receptors and/or endogenous Slit. We expressed <italic>slit-D</italic> in muscles to test whether removal of the Robo binding site could unmask a positive activity of Dscam1-Slit signaling. However, overexpression of <italic>slit-D</italic> actually inhibited innervation at muscle 6/7 to the same extent as <italic>Dscam1</italic> mutants, suggesting that Slit-D may act as a dominant negative to inhibit Dscam1 function (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g006">6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">7I</xref>). Similar results were obtained for a construct lacking all the leucine-rich repeat (LRR) domains (ΔL1–L4; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g006">Fig 6H</xref>), which has no effect when expressed in the CNS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref041">41</xref>]. Deletion of the Robo binding site therefore appears to inactivate Slit’s biological activity even though Slit-D remains capable of binding Dscam1, suggesting that in the embryo Dscam1-Slit signaling is Robo dependent.</p>

The Robo binding site of LRR2 is indicated. (B) Immunoprecipitation of Myc-EGF1-3 by Dscam but not Robo. HEK 293 cells were transfected with the Myc-EGF1-3 plasmid, and COS-7 cells were transfected with 3 ug Dscam and Robo individually, as indicated above the immunoblot. Dscam1 was immunoprecipitated using a C-terminal V5 epitope tag, and Robo was immunoprecipitated using the 13C9 mAB. The immunoblot was probed with anti-Myc to detect the EGF1-3 protein. A band is observed only in the Dscam1 lane. (C) Cell overlay assay. COS-7 cells were transfected with Dscam1 plasmid and incubated with media from 293 cells transfected with the Myc-EGF1-3 construct. Binding of EGF1-3 was detected by anti-Myc immunofluorescence (red), and the cell nuclei were counterstained with DAPI (blue). (D) A Slit derivative lacking the Robo binding site (Slit-D) physically associates with Dscam1 in an immunoprecipitation assay. HEK 293 cells were transfected with <italic>slit-D</italic> and <italic>Dscam1</italic> constructs (+ and − above the blot) and immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibody to immunoprecipitate Dscam1 via an epitope tag. The blot was probed with anti-Slit-N antibody. A 150 kD band corresponding to full-length (unprocessed) Slit-D immunoprecipitates in the presence of Dscam1, suggesting that inhibition of binding by the C-terminal domain of Slit is relieved by removal of the N-terminal LRR2 domain.

Binding of Slit-D to the cells was detected with the anti-Slit (C555) antibody as revealed by red immunofluorescence.

<title>Lateral Expression of <italic>slit-N</italic> Partially Suppresses <italic>slit</italic> Mutant Phenotypes</title>
<p>The pCC axon behavior in <italic>slit-UC</italic> is distinct from that in <italic>robo1</italic> mutants. A possible explanation is that cleavage of Slit allows Slit-N to suppress attraction to the CNS midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>]. If this model is true, then it should be possible to suppress the <italic>slit</italic> mutant phenotype by expressing <italic>slit-N</italic> at places other than the midline (midline expression would not allow us to distinguish between repulsion and suppression of attraction). In <italic>slit</italic> mutants, the longitudinal fascicles are attracted to and collapse onto the CNS midline, with separation between the fascicles limited to occasional very small circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g008">Fig 8C</xref>), similar to those seen in <italic>robo1</italic> mutants but much smaller. We used the <italic>24B-GAL4</italic> muscle driver to express <italic>slit-N</italic> lateral to the CNS, as muscle precursors are present to the sides of the developing CNS (a subset lie on top of the CNS as well). Expression of <italic>slit-N</italic> in <italic>slit</italic> mutants induced separation of fascicles such that the fascicles formed small circles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Quantification of the phenotype revealed it to be statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). The CNS phenotype of homozygous <italic>slit</italic> mutants is very strong and challenging to suppress, and most experiments typically use <italic>slit/+</italic> heterozygotes to detect effects. <italic>Netrin</italic> mutants can weakly suppress <italic>slit</italic> homozygotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref019">19</xref>], and our results with ectopic Slit-N are similar in strength of suppression.</p>

<title><italic>NetrinA</italic>,<italic>B Dscam1</italic> Double Mutants Have Increased CNS Axon Defects</title>
<p>If Dscam1 is acting to suppress attraction to midline Netrins, then <italic>NetAB</italic> mutants should partially suppress the <italic>Dscam1</italic> longitudinal phenotype. <italic>NetAB</italic> mutants have mature longitudinal tracts that, although largely intact, often show breaks in the outermost fascicle and defasciculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). When combined with a <italic>Dscam1</italic> mutation, the longitudinal tracts show much greater disruption of the outermost fascicles and occasionally the medial fascicle, as well as a lot of axon stalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). When stained with BP102 to visualize the entire CNS axon scaffold, <italic>NetAB</italic> mutants display missing longitudinal connectives (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g009">Fig 9E</xref>; Table S2 in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref042">42</xref>]). When stained with BP102, <italic>NetAB; Dscam1</italic> double mutants have dramatic disruptions of the longitudinal connectives and commissures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g009">Fig 9F</xref>). The <italic>NetAB</italic> phenotype is quite variable, and this is reflected in a wide range of phenotypes observed in <italic>NetAB; Dscam1</italic> double mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s013">S6 Fig</xref>). We quantified these defects and found statistically significant difference between <italic>NetAB</italic> and <italic>NetAB; Dscam1</italic> for both commissures (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0005, Tukey HSD; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s006">S6 Data</xref>) and longitudinal tracts (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, Tukey HSD; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s007">S7 Data</xref>).

<title>Model for the function of Dscam1-Robo1-Slit-N signaling in longitudinal axon guidance.</title>
<p>Slit is expressed by midline glia at the CNS midline and likely processed after secretion. Slit-N can form a complex with Dscam1 and Robo1 to promote longitudinal axon growth. The stoichiometry of the Slit-N-Dscam1-Robo1 complex is unknown, but Slit-N dimerization could potentially recruit two Robo1 and two Dscam1 molecules to the complex. Full-length Slit is shown binding as a dimer to Robo receptors, promoting repulsion. Netrin is shown binding to Frazzled receptors as a dimer based on vertebrate data for DCC/Neogenin and promotes attraction to the CNS midline. Vertebrate data suggest that integration of conflicting attractive and repulsive cues may also promote axon growth. Netrin promotes longitudinal growth via an unknown receptor and a contact-dependent mechanism. The combination of signals received by the growth cone serve to promote axon growth parallel to the midline (arrow).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we determined that one function of Slit cleavage is to allow Slit-N binding to Dscam1 and to promote the formation of a complex between Dscam1 and Robo1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g010">Fig 10</xref>). All three components of this complex are required for pioneer axon growth across segment boundaries. Several lines of evidence suggest that the complex transduces an axon growth-promoting signal. These findings establish that one function of Slit cleavage in vivo is to function in longitudinal axon guidance.</p>

<title>Longitudinal Axon Guidance</title>
<p>Pioneer longitudinal axons need to traverse segment boundaries. Previous work has established that crossing the boundary requires a combination of pathway cues and growth cone motility for axons to connect adjacent segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref012">12</xref>]. Longitudinal glia and a mesh of neuronal filopodia provide signals to guide pioneers to and across the segment boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref043">43</xref>]. Netrins guide the positioning of the longitudinal glia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref044">44</xref>], are also trapped by the Fra receptor on the neuronal mesh, and are presented to the navigating pioneers during their initial trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref013">13</xref>]. In <italic>NetAB</italic> and <italic>fra</italic> mutants, the dMP2 descending pioneer axon makes guidance errors, and this may underlie the defects seen in the longitudinal connectives at the end of embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref047">47</xref>]. Our finding that the <italic>NetAB; Dscam1</italic> double mutant strongly disrupts longitudinal connectives confirms that these genes play important roles in this process. It is noteworthy that the <italic>lola</italic> transcription factor regulates expression of <italic>fra</italic>, as well as <italic>robos1-3</italic>, <italic>slit</italic>, and <italic>Dscam1</italic>, potentially explaining why <italic>lola</italic> has such a profound longitudinal axon phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The significance of the segment boundary as a barrier to axon growth is well established in the homologous grasshopper CNS, in which the growth cones of the ascending and descending longitudinal pioneers pause at the segment boundary for 5 h until selective fasciculation between the pioneers is established. Ablation studies revealed that selective fasciculation is absolutely critical for longitudinal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref048">48</xref>]. In the fly CNS, the physical distances are significantly smaller, and fasciculation may play a lesser role [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref025">25</xref>]. For example, filopodia from the pCC pioneer can contact glia on the other side of the segment boundary before the arrival of dMP2/MP1 axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref043">43</xref>]. Mutants in <italic>Fas2</italic> that prevent fasciculation of the pioneers do not disrupt pioneer guidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref049">49</xref>]. Nevertheless, the descending MP1 and dMP2 growth cones pause at the segment boundary and wait for the ascending pCC and vMP2 axons to arrive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition, mutants in the adhesion molecule <italic>N-cadherin</italic> (<italic>CadN</italic>) can display breaks in the MP1 pathway that are suggestive of axon stalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref050">50</xref>]. The mature <italic>CadN</italic> phenotype closely resembles that of <italic>Dscam1</italic> mutants, and our observation that <italic>NetAB</italic> mutants have fasciculation defects suggests that both <italic>Dscam1</italic> and <italic>NetAB</italic> are required in axons that follow the pioneers. It was predicted that longitudinal axon phenotypes might be more subtle in the fly, as the shorter distances would allow guidance defects to self-correct over time through the use of parallel pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref025">25</xref>]. This may explain why pioneer defects in mutants such as <italic>CadN</italic> and <italic>NetAB</italic> only result in subtle defects in outermost fascicle of the mature Fas2 pattern. Detecting strong defects in pioneer axons will likely require knockdown of parallel pathways at the same time, and we are actively testing this hypothesis with <italic>Dscam1</italic>.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Growth Cone Motility</title>
<p>In flies, growth cone motility appears to be another critical requirement for crossing the segment boundary. Temperature-shifted <italic>Notch</italic> mutants display strong segment crossing defects. Activation of noncanonical Notch signaling in the pioneer axons is sufficient to rescue the mutant defects because of an increase in growth cone motility. Notch signaling promotes the formation of filopodia, which may allow the growth cone to sample growth-promoting cues on the other side of the segment boundary [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref012">12</xref>]. In vertebrates, the simultaneous and conflicting actions of midline attractants and repellents on longitudinal growth cones have been proposed to drive forward growth parallel to the midline, in the so-called “push-pull” model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref005">5</xref>]. Interestingly, part of the chemorepellent activity of Slit is the ability to increase axon outgrowth of cultured axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref051">51</xref>]. Expression of Slit and Netrin in the spinal cord is continuous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref053">53</xref>], but the segmented nature of the fly ventral nerve cord means that expression occurs at discrete locations. It may therefore be necessary to increase motility at the segment boundary to ensure crossing. We propose that this is the function of the Dscam1-Slit-N-Robo1 complex, and we discuss this in detail below. It is important to note that alternative mechanisms are also possible. Slit-N bound to axons after diffusing from the midline could be acting as a contact-dependent attractant, either neutralizing Dscam1-mediated homophilic repulsion between axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref054">54</xref>] or promoting attachment between the longitudinal axons and their substrate as has been proposed for Slit-N in muscles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref027">27</xref>]. The complex could be trapping Slit-N for presentation to additional receptors as has been proposed for Robo1 and Syndecan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref055">55</xref>]. Slit-N signaling could also modulate fasciculation via regulation of cadherins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref056">56</xref>].</p>

<title>The Role of the Dscam1-Slit-N-Robo1 Complex in Longitudinal Axon Guidance</title>
<p>While most prior studies on fly Dscam1 have focused on dendrite inhibition, Dscam1 clearly also has a positive role in axon outgrowth, as Dscam1 is required for the growth of presynaptic arbors and overexpression increases the size, branch length, and branching of arbors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref058">58</xref>]. Differences in elongation rates for longitudinal pioneers have been described in <italic>robo1</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>]. Our work suggests that <italic>Dscam1∆C</italic> disrupts axon growth in both commissures and longitudinal tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g004">Fig 4E and 4H</xref>). The <italic>Dscam1 robo1</italic> and <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants have significant breaks in the longitudinal fascicles suggestive of stalling at the segment boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1J and 1K</xref>), and examination of the pCC growth cones in the <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant reveals different rates of outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Pan-neural expression of the <italic>slit-D</italic> construct also causes longitudinal breaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). Finally, lateral expression of <italic>Slit-N</italic> causes a modest promotion of growth away from the midline in <italic>slit</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that Dscam1, Robo1, and Slit-N all play a positive role in axon outgrowth, especially in longitudinal axons. Lack of a growth-promoting signal in <italic>slit-UC</italic> or <italic>Dscam1 robo1</italic> mutants would prevent pioneer axons from crossing the segment boundary.</p>
<p>In previous studies, the longitudinal pioneers have been observed to stall, exit the CNS, or grow in the opposite direction when guidance is disrupted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref048">48</xref>]. The <italic>slit-UC</italic> allele used in our work encodes a protein with decreased stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref022">22</xref>], so it is likely to be acting as a hypomorphic allele with reduced repulsive function. The reduction in repulsion in <italic>slit-UC</italic> or <italic>Dscam1 robo1</italic> mutants allows axons that do not stall to inappropriately enter the midline, resulting in a large central fascicle that wanders back and forth across the midline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g001">Fig 1J and 1K</xref>). A priority for us is to construct additional <italic>slit-UC</italic> alleles with hopefully greater protein stability through CRISPR-Cas9 based approaches. This may allow clearer visualization of axon growth phenotypes.</p>
<p>Our interpretation of the role of the Dscam1-Robo1-Slit-N complex relies heavily on prior studies of Dscam1 and limited observations of growth rate differences in the <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant. Our observations have been complicated because of the components of the complex participating in additional processes, with <italic>Dscam1</italic> being required for midline crossing and <italic>robo1</italic> and <italic>slit-UC</italic> being required for midline repulsion. Crossing the midline is an alternative path for a longitudinal axon to take if it fails to cross the segment boundary. We hope to uncover stronger, more definitive phenotypes through construction of double mutants with other longitudinal components such as <italic>CadN</italic>. An alternative approach will be to visualize filopodial dynamics in pioneer growth cones in living embryos as a measure of axon outgrowth. Again, this may be complicated by the nature of the complex components. For example, the repellent function of Slit/Robo1 normally limits the number of filopodia, and loss of <italic>robo1</italic> produces a more highly branched growth cone with longer filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref059">59</xref>]. However, it was recently shown that Slit protein initially stimulates filopodial extension towards sources of Slit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref060">60</xref>], and subsequent endocytosis of Robo-Slit complexes may then lead to filopodial retraction and growth cone repulsion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref061">61</xref>]. Dscam is likely to influence filopodial dynamics as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref062">62</xref>], maybe as simply as by modifying Robo1 activity. Proving an effect of the complex on growth will require genetic backgrounds and tools that clearly separate the different activities of the components. Such analysis may be more definitively carried out in cultured neuron systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref060">60</xref>].</p>

<title>Lack of Suppression of Netrin-Mediated Attraction</title>
<p>The primary role of Robo/Slit signaling is repulsion from the CNS midline. Ectopic <italic>slit</italic> expression in lateral neurons can guide dMP2 axons, revealing a second function for Slit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>]. As the Robo1-positive dMP2 growth cones grow right over the source of ectopic Slit and are not repelled, this indicates that Slit is not acting as a directional cue. The Slit activity has been proposed to suppress Netrin-mediated attraction to the midline, thereby ensuring that longitudinal axons continue projecting parallel to the midline [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref014">14</xref>]. The Dscam1-Slit-N-Robo1 complex is an obvious candidate to mediate this activity, but our results suggest that this is not the case. If the Netrin and Dscam pathways were interacting, one would expect a decrease in longitudinal defects. However, the <italic>NetAB; Dscam1</italic> double mutants have widespread disruption of longitudinal tracts and also commissures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g009">Fig 9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002560.s013">S6 Fig</xref>). This result demonstrates that Dscam1-based signaling is operating in parallel to Netrins in both outgrowth processes.</p>

<title>Implications for Dscam Function in Axon Guidance</title>
<p>Dscams are evolutionarily conserved Netrin receptors, yet they do not play a role in Netrin-mediated axon guidance in the vertebrate spinal cord [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref064">64</xref>]. The emerging picture that Dscam1 promotes axon growth suggests a solution of this paradox. Neurotrophic factors are among the key extracellular signals that promote axon growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref065">65</xref>]. When tested in vitro, high concentrations of trophic factors can orient axon outgrowth, but they have minor effects on axon guidance in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref066">66</xref>]. If Dscams are transducing growth-promoting signals, this would explain why strong Dscam effects on axon guidance in vivo are only observed in conjunction with mutants in bona fide guidance pathways. For example, Netrins A and B are required for attraction to the CNS midline and for longitudinal axon guidance. When a <italic>NetAB</italic> mutant is combined with a <italic>Dscam1</italic> mutant, both commissures and longitudinals are affected. When <italic>Dscam1</italic> is combined with a <italic>robo1</italic> mutation, only the longitudinals are disrupted. <italic>Dscam1</italic> is therefore enhancing defects specific to the axon guidance pathway being tested.</p>

<title>Recombinant Baculoviral Proteins</title>
<p>Protocols for growth and maintenance of Sf9 cells and High Five cells, recombinant baculovirus construction, and heterologous expression using the Bac-to-Bac HBM Expression Kit were as described by Life Technologies. Briefly, an LR recombination reaction between each entry recombinant clone and a baculovirus shutter vector in DH10Bac cells produced recombinant baculovirus clones that were transfected separately into Sf9 cells for recombinant virus production. High titer P3 viral stocks for each construct were produced by successive 72-h amplifications of the initial and P2 stocks. Approximate viral titers were determined by a plaque assay. The viral stocks were used to infect High Five cells grown to a density of 1.0 x 10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml in a disposable shaking flask (Bio-Express, Kaysville, Utah). For the expression of Slit-FL and Slit-N, High Five cells were infected with recombinant baculovirus at multiplicities of infection (MOIs, pfu/cell) ranging from 1 to 20. Media containing recombinant proteins were harvested at days 1, 2, 3, and 4 post infection (PI) with various MOI. Western blotting was used to determine the best expression time and MOI. All combinations of conditions for High Five cells and Sf9 cells were cultured at 27°C with shaking flasks.</p>

<title>Recombinant Protein Detection</title>
<p>Cells infected with 6xHis-tagged Slit-N and Slit-FL recombinant baculovirus were harvested at 1–4 d PI with various MOI. The cell pellets were homogenized, and culture medium was collected. Noninfected cells were prepared similarly as a negative control. Protein production was confirmed by western blotting using 1:1000 rabbit anti-his primary antibody from Abcam ab9108 (Cambridge, Massachusetts) for Slit-N and Slit-FL, 1:250 goat anti-rabbit lgG HRP secondary antibody (Jackson Labs), and SuperSignal West Pico Chemiluminescent Substrate (Pierce, Rockford, Illinois). Images were collected with FOTO/Analyst ImageTech (FOTODYNE, Hartland, Wisconsin).</p>

<title>Antibody Production</title>
<p>GenScript (Piscataway, New Jersey) was contracted to produce a rabbit anti-SlitN polyclonal antibody based on the antigenic peptide (CQLGENKIKEISNKM) designed and selected by the contracted company. The synthesized peptide was injected into the two rabbits separately. Four immunizations per rabbit were performed. Serum was collected, and the antibody was purified using peptide-conjugated resin. The quality of the antibody was examined by ELISA. The antibody was used to confirm recombinant protein produced in infected insect cells and in mammalian cells.</p>

<title>Generation of Stable Insect Cell Lines</title>
<p>Eight Dscam-Fc expression constructs in the pIB/V5-His vector [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref035">35</xref>] were transfected into either Sf9 cells or High Five cells with Cellfectin II reagent. Forty-eight hours post transfection, the medium was replaced with fresh culture medium. Cells were split at 1:5 and cultured overnight with culture medium when they were confluent, followed by removal of the medium and replacement with selective medium containing 50 μg/ml Blasticidin. The selective medium was replaced every 3 to 4 d until foci were forming, and the mock cells had completely died. Resistant cells were expanded into flasks for frozen stocks with selective reagent. Blasticidin was used at a concentration of 10 μg/ml for Sf9 cells and 20 μg/ml for High Five cells for maintenance after selection. Medium without blasticidin was used when splitting cells, and selective medium was added after the cells attached. Both Sf9 cells and High Five cells were incubated at 27°C. Protein expression was confirmed with SDS-PAGE and western blot. The protocol for building a stable cell line is according to the instruction manual.</p>

<title>DNA Constructs</title>
<p><italic>Drosophila Dscam</italic> (isoform 1-30-30-2) pcDNA3-V5-His [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref033">33</xref>] was fully resequenced and used as a template to generate different Dscam constructs: IgΔ1, IgΔ1–2, IgΔ1–5, and IgΔ1–7 with different Ig domains removed from the N-terminus and the intracellular domain removed. The full-length ectodomain construct is called FL-EC. The forward primers for different constructs were used with the same reverse primers in separate reactions to generate different N-terminus deletion Dscam constructs with a C-terminal extension containing a V5 epitope and the polyhistidine-tag encoded by pSecTag/FRT/V5-His vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002560.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). For constructs with deletions of individual Ig domains (IgΔ3, IgΔ4, IgΔ1,4), EC-FL or IgΔ1 was used as the template, and the In-Fusion Cloning kit from Clontech (Mountain View, CA) was used to generate deletions according to the manufacturer’s recommended protocol. In brief, PCR primers were designed to flank the desired deletion region and contained 15-bp overlaps at their 5′ ends (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002560.t001">Table 1</xref>); PCR products were gel-purified and recombined using the In-Fusion cloning reaction from the kit. The recombinant DNAs were transformed into <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> competent cells for screening. All of the constructs were sequenced using the ABI BigDye Terminator Cycle Sequencing Ready Reaction Kit v3.1. The reactions were run on an ABI3730 DNA Analyzer at the Nevada Genomics Center (UNR), and the sequences were analyzed using Vector NTI Advance 9 software (Life Technologies). To generate Myc-tagged full-length (Slit-FL) and the N-terminal cleavage fragment of Slit (Slit-N), pcDNA-Slit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref026">26</xref>] was fully resequenced and subcloned into pSecTag/FRT-His TOPO vector. PCR was performed using different reverse primers with the same forward primer containing a Myc-tag nuclei acid sequence in the 5′ end (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002560.t001">Table 1</xref>). To construct Myc-tagged EGF domains 1–3 of Slit, the same strategy was used (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002560.t001">Table 1</xref>). pcDNA-slit-D was constructed by digesting pcDNA-slit with KpnI and EcoRV so that a 2,700 base pair fragment of the <italic>slit</italic> coding region was removed. This region was replaced with a synthetic gene fragment (Genscript, Piscataway, New Jersey) that lacked the LRR2 Robo binding site. pUAST-slit-D was constructed by sublconing a KpnI-XbaI fragment from pcDNA-slit-D. <italic>Robo1ΔC</italic> was constructed by PCR amplification of the Robo1 open reading frame from the initiating methionine to 9 amino acids after the end of the transmembrane domain (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002560.t001">Table 1</xref>). EcoRI and XbaI sites in the primers allowed subcloning into pUAST.</p>

<title>Cell Overlay Assays</title>
<p>COS-7 or 293 cells at 80% confluence were transfected with DNA expression constructs using Lipofectamine 2000 or 3000 (Life Technologies), according to the manufacturer’s instructions. For receptor expression, Dscam constructs were transfected into Cos-7 cells, and for ligand expression, pSegTag-Myc-Slit-FL and pSegTag-Myc-Slit-N were transfected into 293 cells. Approximately 48 h post-transfection, the supernatant was removed from receptor expressing cells and replaced with supernatant containing Myc-tagged ligand. Cells were incubated in a 37°C incubator for 1 to 2 h before being rinsed three times in 1XPBS and undergoing fixation and antibody labeling. Alternatively, the mixture of ligand and receptor DNA constructs (1:1) was cotransfected into COS-7 cells. Forty-eight hours post transfection, the medium was removed, and the cells were washed with PBS. After rinsing, the cells were fixed for 15 min in 4% paraformaldehyde with 0.1% Tween-20 at room temperature, followed by rinsing in PBS containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBST) five times. The cells were blocked in 5% heat-denatured normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h. After blocking, the cells were incubated with primary antibodies diluted in 5% heat-denatured normal goat serum in PBST for 1 h: rabbit polyclonal anti-His tag at 1:1000, Abcam ab9018, or anti-Myc mouse monoclonal 1:500 from Abcam ab32. The cells were then rinsed five times in 1X PBST. Secondary antibodies, Alex 488 Goat anti-rabbit IgG, and/or Alex 595 Goat anti-mouse IgG (Jackson Labs) were diluted with 1:1000 in 5% heat-denatured goat serum in 1XPBST, then added to the cells, and incubated for 1 h at room temperature. The cells were subsequently washed in 1X PBST five times, followed by washing in 1X PBS and 1-min incubation in 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) (Molecular Probes) to stain the nuclei. The cells were then washed in 1X PBS and mounted in FluorSave (Calbiochem). For double labeling, cells were incubated with the second primary and secondary antibody after finishing the first primary and secondary antibody with the same procedure.</p>

<title>Immunoprecipitation Assays</title>
<p>Immunoprecipitation (IP) assays from cell culture followed the protocols of Banerjee et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002560.ref067">67</xref>]. For IP assays with baculovirus proteins, the following protocol was followed: 50 μl of Protein G coupled beads were washed with high-salt binding buffer (100 mM phosphate buffer containing 1M NaCl, 10 U/ml Heparin, 1 mM DTT, 0.2 mM PMSF, and 1/1000 proteinase inhibitor cocktail) two times. The Sepharose beads were spun down at 500 x g for 2 min, and a magnet (Life Technologies) was used to separate the supernatant and Protein G Dynabeads. Two tubes of beads were used per IP: one for the ligand preclearing and the other for the IP itself. Eight soluble receptor Dscam-Fc supernatants from the High Five Dscam-Fc stable cell line and ligands (Slit-FL and Slit-N from the baculovirus expression) were collected by spinning down the culture at 1000 x g for 10 min, the supernatants were further concentrated using a centrifugal filter kit (Millipore), and finally, they were diluted in high-salt binding buffer. The ligand proteins were incubated with Protein G beads at room temperature for about 1 h to remove nonspecific binding. Two hundred and fifty μl of Dscam-Fc was incubated with 50 μl of prewashed Protein G Sepharose or Dynabeads rocking at RT for 1 h (because both proteins were expressed in the medium at 27°C). The unbound supernatant was removed, and the bead-receptor complex was incubated with precleared ligand for 1 h at room temperature. Nonbinding protein was removed, the beads were quickly washed in high-salt binding buffer three times, 50 μl sample buffer was added to each sample, and the samples were boiled for about 5 min and then either directly loaded into an SDS page gel or placed at −80°C. For IP assays from 293 and COS-7 cells, the cells were lysed 48 h after transfection in 500 μl prechilled cell lysis buffer (50 mM HEPES, pH 7.2, 100 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgCl2, 1 mM CaCl2, and 1% NP-40) containing Protease Inhibitors (10X, 100 μl/ml) and PMSF (0.3 M stock, 4 μl/ml). The lysates were kept on ice for 30 min and centrifuged at 15,000 g for 30 min at 4°C, followed by recentrifugation, and used subsequently for the IP. Protein G Plus-Agarose beads were used to pull down proteins; 50 μl beads for each IP reaction were washed three to five more times in 450 μl lysis buffer. The cell supernatants were precleared by incubation with Protein A beads. The beads were exchanged for anti-Robo antibody 13C9 (1:20 dilution) and incubated for 2 h at room temperature or 8 h at 4°C. The supernatant–antibody mix was incubated with prewashed Protein A or G beads for 1 h at the room temperature or 2 h at 4°C (Bhat et. al., 2010). The beads were then washed five times with lysis buffer and one time in cold PBS, followed by elution of the immunocomplexes in 50 μl SDS sample buffer, which was boiled at 100°C for 10 min, and then cooled in ice. Immunoblotting was with anti-V5 (1:1000 dilution, Life Technologies) to detect Dscam, and anti-SlitN antibody was used to detect Slit protein (1:200 dilution).</p>

<title>pCC Phenotype Analysis</title>
<p>For quantification of initial pCC axon behavior, early to mid-stage 13 embryos were used, as the growth rate defects of <italic>slit-UC</italic> make earlier quantification unreliable. Individual pCC axons were scored for midline crossing. For analysis of pCC crossing at the second commissure encountered, stage 14 embryos were used, and the presence of one or two axons from the pCC pathway at the CNS midline was scored as a positive crossing event for that segment. If an axon approached the midline and extended anteriorly along or near the midline, the axon was scored as crossing. In all cases, if it was unclear as to whether an axon was crossing, the axon was scored as not crossing. For quantification of longitudinal tracts, the number of tracts between segments was counted. The intersegment area was identified as lying between the intersegmental and segmental nerve roots and by a reduction of Fas2 staining in the cell bodies underneath the axon scaffold. Abdominal and thoracic segments were scored for all measures.</p>

<title>Schematic of pCC axon behavior in different genotypes.</title>
<p>Cartoons representing the behavior of the pCC ascending and MP1 descending longitudinal pioneer axons in wild type, <italic>slit-UC</italic>, and <italic>robo</italic> mutants. Commissural axons are shown as light gray horizontal bars. The pCC axon is brown, MP1 scarlet. Additional neurons include the SP1 commissural pioneers (light blue), the aCC motor neuron (light gray), dMP2 (yellow), and vMP2 (medium gray). (A) In wild-type embryos, both pathways grow away from the midline and fasciculate upon meeting. Both pathways subsequently defasciculate to avoid growth towards the midline. (B) In the <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutant, the axon trajectories are largely normal, although 30% of pCC axons cross the midline shortly after starting growing. The majority of axons do not cross the midline at the first commissure. Almost all of the ascending and descending pioneers cross the midline at the next commissure encountered, and pCC axons frequently grow over the pCC cell body. The MP1 axons are frequently found at the anterior edge of the commissure. This combined behavior creates the circles seen in the <italic>robo</italic> mutant. The critical difference is that only a minority of pCC axons cross early in their trajectories. The cell bodies are shown in their wild-type positions for clarity, but in <italic>slit-UC</italic> mutants, they are usually closer to the midline in a manner resembling <italic>robo</italic> mutants. (C) In <italic>robo</italic> mutants, almost all pCC axons cross the midline (red arrow) at the first commissure they encounter. They almost always recross the midline in the next commissure they encounter. The descending MP1 axons also incorrectly cross the midline after crossing the segment boundary, creating characteristic axon circles.</p>

<title>Expression and purification of baculovirus Slit.</title>
<p>In all experiments, High Five cells were transfected with Baculovirus Slit-FL or Slit-N and cultured at 27°C. Culture medium was centrifuged, and the supernatant concentrated in a centrifugal filter unit. Equal volumes from each condition were loaded into an SDS-PAGE gel. Immunoblot analysis was with anti-His antibody, which detects the 6xHis epitope tag at the carboxy-terminal of Slit. (A) Full-length Slit was expressed at various multiplicities of infection (MOI = ratio of infectious virus particles to cells) using the Bac to Bac HBM baculovirus expression system. Immunoblot analysis found MOIs of 2–5 to be most effective. (B) Full-length Slit was expressed at MOI = 2 and harvested at different post-infection (PI) times: 24, 48, 72, and 96 h. Those found to be the most effective were 48 and 72 h PI times. (C) N-terminal Slit was expressed at different MOIs, with MOI = 2 being the most productive. (D) Slit-FL was further purified over a nickel column to bind the 6xHis epitope tag and analyzed by Coomassie Blue staining. The full-length Slit fragment (~178 kD) is clearly visible. (E) Slit-FL purification analyzed on an immunoblot with anti-Slit-N antibody. There is a lesser amount of Slit-N, which is presumably purified by dimerization with Slit-FL, as it lacks the carboxy-terminal epitope tag.</p>

<title>Embryonic expression of Dscam1 protein.</title>
<p>Stage 16 embryo stained with an antibody against Dscam1. The DAB staining was enhanced with nickel to increase weak staining. The CNS axon scaffold is at the bottom of the picture. There appear to be some unstained fascicles in the commissures, but otherwise, we estimate that 95% of CNS axons are stained. The nerve roots containing the motor neurons in the process of navigating towards their target muscles are also Dscam1 positive, and staining can be seen in the focal plane underneath the muscles (arrows). Innervation of muscles 6, 7, 12, and 13 will not occur until the end of the next stage. The muscle attachment sites also stain strongly (arrowheads). We have tested antibodies from both the Zipursky and Schmucker laboratories and only see this staining with one antibody. In <italic>Dscam1</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> null alleles, axonal staining completely disappears, but the muscle attachment site staining is reduced but not absent. We therefore cannot exclude the possibility that the muscles or the tendon cells express a low level of Dscam1.</p>
