         <p>An <italic>in vivo</italic> functional analysis of an odorant binding protein in <italic>Drosophila</italic> challenges the established model of its role in pheromone signaling.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
         <p>Pheromones form an essential chemical language of intraspecific communication in many animals. How olfactory systems recognize pheromonal signals with both sensitivity and specificity is not well understood. An important in vivo paradigm for this process is the detection mechanism of the sex pheromone (<italic>Z</italic>)-11-octadecenyl acetate (<italic>cis</italic>-vaccenyl acetate [cVA]) in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. cVA-evoked neuronal activation requires a secreted odorant binding protein, LUSH, the CD36-related transmembrane protein SNMP, and the odorant receptor OR67d. Crystallographic analysis has revealed that cVA-bound LUSH is conformationally distinct from apo (unliganded) LUSH. Recombinantly expressed mutant versions of LUSH predicted to enhance or diminish these structural changes produce corresponding alterations in spontaneous and/or cVA-evoked activity when infused into olfactory sensilla, leading to a model in which the ligand for pheromone receptors is not free cVA, but LUSH that is “conformationally activated” upon cVA binding. Here we present evidence that contradicts this model. First, we demonstrate that the same LUSH mutants expressed transgenically affect neither basal nor pheromone-evoked activity. Second, we compare the structures of apo LUSH, cVA/LUSH, and complexes of LUSH with non-pheromonal ligands and find no conformational property of cVA/LUSH that can explain its proposed unique activated state. Finally, we show that high concentrations of cVA can induce neuronal activity in the absence of LUSH, but not SNMP or OR67d. Our findings are not consistent with the model that the cVA/LUSH complex acts as the pheromone ligand, and suggest that pheromone molecules alone directly activate neuronal receptors.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>Animals produce chemical signals, called pheromones, to communicate with other members of the same species to regulate social behaviors. How pheromones are detected is a fundamental question. One important model system for pheromone recognition is in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where the sex pheromone <italic>cis</italic>-vaccenyl acetate (cVA) activates olfactory sensory neurons expressing the odorant receptor OR67d. cVA neuronal stimulation requires not only OR67d but also an extracellular odorant binding protein called LUSH. Previous work showed that cVA association with LUSH induces a conformational change in the protein. A mutant version of LUSH that mimics this structural alteration—when expressed in vitro and infused around OR67d neurons—stimulates these neurons in the absence of cVA, suggesting that the ligand that activates OR67d neurons is a cVA/LUSH complex rather than free cVA. By contrast, we show that the same mutant, when expressed in vivo, does not activate OR67d neurons, questioning the significance of the conformational change. We also show that high concentrations of cVA can induce neuronal activity in the absence of LUSH, but not OR67d, indicating that LUSH is important but not essential for pheromone detection. Together, these findings challenge the established model of cVA signaling and suggest that this pheromone directly activates OR67d.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Pheromones—“carriers of excitement” in Greek—are chemical signals produced by an individual and recognized by conspecifics to induce a defined behavioral response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>. Because pheromones are the basis of communication controlling diverse social interactions in many organisms (e.g., aggregation, kin recognition, sexual and competitive behaviors), understanding how these chemicals are detected has long been a fundamental question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Wyatt1">[1]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many animal pheromones are long-chain hydrocarbons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Ferveur1">[2]</xref>, whose structural versatility provides a large chemical repertoire for the generation of species- and behavior-specific signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Lassance1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Rasmussen1">[4]</xref>. In mammals, pheromones can also be peptides, such as rodent Exocrine gland-secreting peptide 1, which is released in male tears and enhances female sexual receptivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Haga1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kimoto1">[6]</xref>, or small proteins, such as major urinary proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Chamero1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Pheromone detection has been intensively studied in insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Hansson1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kaissling1">[12]</xref>. These volatile chemicals are captured from the air on the surface of insect antennae, head appendages that are covered with porous, cuticular sensory hairs, called sensilla. Pheromone molecules pass, probably by diffusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Maitani1">[13]</xref>, through the pores to the interior of sensilla, which house the ciliated dendritic endings of olfactory sensory neurons (OSNs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). These cilia are bathed in lymph fluid rich in odorant binding proteins (OBPs) (also known as pheromone binding proteins [PBPs]) and odorant degrading enzymes (ODEs), which are secreted from auxiliary cells that flank OSN somata. Three transmembrane receptors localize to pheromone-sensing OSN cilia: one member of the odorant receptor (OR) repertoire, which is thought to be the principal determinant of pheromone response specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-vanderGoesvanNaters1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Nakagawa1">[15]</xref>, the co-receptor ORCO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton2">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Larsson1">[17]</xref>, and a CD36-related protein called sensory neuron membrane protein (SNMP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Rogers1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton3">[21]</xref>.</p>

            <p>(A) Schematic of a pheromone-sensing trichoid sensillum illustrating the major ultrastructural features and proteins involved in detection of cVA. The OSN bears a single sensory cilium where the heteromeric pheromone receptor OR67d/ORCO and the CD36-related SNMP are localized. Auxiliary cells secrete at least three OBPs, including LUSH, and ODEs, including the carboxylesterase Est-6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Chertemps1">[49]</xref>, into the lymph that bathes the OSN cilium within the sensillar hair lumen. (B) cVA-dependent conformational changes in LUSH. Ribbon view of the superimposed backbones of apo LUSH (grey) and cVA/LUSH (green, monomer A, conformation A only is represented; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s002">Figure S2</xref>) (PDB IDs 1T14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Thode1">[27]</xref> and 2GTE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, respectively). The ligand, cVA, is depicted in stick form (yellow, carbon atoms; red, oxygen atoms). The most prominent conformational differences between the structures are within the C-terminal tail (Ct). (C) Close-up of the regions of LUSH corresponding to residues 83–87 and 115–123 for the structures shown in (B). The side chains of K87, D118, and F121 are represented by sticks. In apo LUSH (grey)—but not in this conformation of cVA/LUSH (green)—K87 and D118 can form a salt bridge (dotted line) (see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001546-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

      <p>One of the best-studied pheromone detection systems is that of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> sex pheromone (<italic>Z</italic>)-11-octadecenyl acetate (<italic>cis</italic>-vaccenyl acetate [cVA]), which evokes neural activity in OR67d-expressing OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Genetic analyses demonstrated that cVA detection requires OR67d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kurtovic1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Ha1">[23]</xref>, ORCO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Jin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton3">[21]</xref>, and SNMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Jin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton3">[21]</xref>, as well as the OBP LUSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>. Unexpectedly, loss of LUSH also results in decreased spontaneous firing of OR67d neurons—in the absence of pheromone—leading to the proposition that this OBP plays a direct role in cVA-evoked neuronal activity, rather than acting simply as a solubilizer or carrier of this pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In vitro, LUSH binds cVA as well as several short-chain <italic>n-</italic>alcohols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kruse1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Thode1">[27]</xref>, and phthalates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Zhou1">[28]</xref>. X-ray crystal structures for apo (unliganded) LUSH, various alcohol/LUSH complexes, and the cVA/LUSH complex have been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kruse1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Thode1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. A notable common feature of complexes of LUSH with either cVA or alcohols is that the ligand is almost completely encapsulated within the six α-helical bundle—similar to many other ligand/OBP complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Pelosi1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Tegoni1">[31]</xref>—making it unlikely for ORs to be able to recognize directly the ligand within this complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. Importantly, the cVA/LUSH complex is structurally distinct from apo LUSH or alcohol/LUSH complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kruse1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Thode1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, in particular within the C-terminal tail (amino acids 113–124 in the processed LUSH protein) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. These observations led to the suggestion that this unique conformation of the cVA/LUSH complex is important for the stimulation of OR67d neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The functional significance of these cVA-evoked structural changes has been tested by recombinant expression of site-directed mutant versions of LUSH that are predicted to exhibit different degrees of this conformational change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. These purified proteins were infused into individual sensilla housing OR67d OSNs in <italic>lush</italic> mutant animals, which lack the endogenous OBP, via a glass recording electrode. Basal and cVA-evoked activity of these neurons was then measured by extracellular electrophysiological recordings. A complementary pair of mutants, LUSH<sup>F121A</sup> and LUSH<sup>F121W</sup>, predicted to diminish or enhance the conformational change, respectively, led to decreased or increased cVA sensitivity. Notably, one mutant, LUSH<sup>D118A</sup>, which disrupts a predicted salt bridge suggested to be present in apo but not cVA-bound LUSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, induced increased firing of OR67d neurons in the absence of cVA. Presentation of cVA did not further increase this neuronal activation. These observations led to a model in which cVA induces “conformational activation” of LUSH, and that it is this cVA/LUSH complex—and not free cVA—which is recognized (through an undefined mechanism) by the neuronal pheromone receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This model contrasts with the widely held idea that pheromone molecules must ultimately directly bind and stimulate pheromone-sensing ORs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Leal1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-vanderGoesvanNaters1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Nakagawa1">[15]</xref>, although pheromone/OR interactions have never been shown biochemically. However, the role of an extracellular protein, LUSH, in pheromone neuron activation in insects provided an interesting parallel with the discovery that small protein pheromones can stimulate olfactory neurons in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Chamero1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We have tested this model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref> by transgenic expression of the same LUSH mutants predicted to affect the cVA-induced conformational changes. We find that in vivo-expressed LUSH mutants do not recapitulate the effects observed with recombinant LUSH. We also show that LUSH, but not SNMP or OR67d, is dispensable for pheromone-evoked activity at high cVA concentrations. These results do not support the proposition of the cVA/LUSH complex as the pheromone-sensing neuron ligand.</p>

         <title>A Transgenic System for Structure-Function Analysis of LUSH</title>
         <p>To test the activity of in vivo-expressed mutant LUSH proteins, we first generated a wild-type genomic <italic>lush</italic> rescue construct, which spans the entire transcription unit and flanking intergenic sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This construct, referred to hereafter as LUSH<sup>wt</sup>, is expected to contain all regulatory sequences necessary to recapitulate endogenous <italic>lush</italic> expression. By site-directed mutagenesis, we generated three additional <italic>lush</italic> constructs encoding proteins equivalent to the recombinantly expressed LUSH variants previously analyzed (LUSH<sup>F121A</sup>, LUSH<sup>F121W</sup>, and LUSH<sup>D118A</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.

The scale bar represents 20 µm. A higher magnification detail of one optical section of the wild-type antennal section shows two ORCO-positive neurons flanked by LUSH-positive auxiliary cells. Similar restriction of LUSH expression to auxiliary cells was observed in all genotypes; overlap of green and magenta signals is due to auxiliary cells overlaying neurons in a different optical section.</p>

         <p>We first compared LUSH expression in these fly strains by Western blot analysis of antennal protein extracts using an anti-LUSH antibody. In all genotypes, we observed a single prominent band, which corresponds to LUSH as it co-migrates with endogenous LUSH in wild-type extracts and is absent in <italic>lush</italic> mutant extracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Relative quantification of LUSH levels showed that there is no statistical difference in the expression of the mutant or wild-type transgenic LUSH proteins when compared to endogenous LUSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). There is some variability between extracts from the same genotype, which is probably due to the difficulty of reproducible protein extraction from the small, cuticular, antennal structures.</p>
         <p>Immunofluorescence for LUSH and ORCO on antennal sections confirmed that all transgenic LUSH variants are expressed in auxiliary cells surrounding ORCO-positive OSNs (immunofluorescence detection of secreted LUSH in sensillar lymph is difficult, probably because this extracellular fluid is largely lost during tissue preparation and staining). These LUSH-expressing cells are located within the distal region of the antenna where pheromone-sensing trichoid sensilla are found (including those housing OR67d neurons), in a pattern indistinguishable from endogenous LUSH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

         <p>In cVA/LUSH complexes, the pheromone directly interacts with F121 in the C-terminal tail, suggesting that this residue has a central role in triggering the cVA-induced conformational change of LUSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. It was hypothesized that substitution of F121 by a smaller residue (such as alanine) or a larger residue (such as tryptophan) might reduce or enhance, respectively, this conformational change. Indeed, recombinant LUSH<sup>F121A</sup>—infused through the recording electrode into OR67d sensilla (also referred to as T1 sensilla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>) of <italic>lush</italic> mutants—restored sensitivity to cVA that is ∼50-fold lower than that conferred by recombinant wild-type LUSH across a 1,000-fold range of pheromone concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.

All three transgenes restore sensitivity to this pheromone in a <italic>lush</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, in contrast to the observations with recombinant LUSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, neuronal responses across a 10,000-fold range of cVA concentrations were very similar across all three genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

         <title>Mutation of LUSH<sup>D118</sup> Does Not Increase Spontaneous Activity in OR67d Neurons</title>
         <p>A second residue in LUSH implicated in cVA-evoked conformational activation is D118, which is predicted to form a salt bridge with K87 in apo LUSH that is disrupted upon cVA binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. It was hypothesized that this salt bridge maintains LUSH in an “inactive” state, leading to the prediction that mutation of D118 would produce an “activated” form of LUSH. Consistently, recombinant LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> was found to induce—in the absence of cVA—increased activity in OR67d neurons compared to recombinant wild-type LUSH, up to the level observed in wild-type OR67d neurons stimulated with 1% cVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. This LUSH<sup>D118A</sup>-evoked activity depended upon both OR67d and SNMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.</p>
         <p>To test whether D118 is critical in transgenically expressed LUSH, we measured spontaneous activity in OR67d neurons in LUSH<sup>wt</sup> and LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> flies. We also tested the LUSH<sup>F121A</sup> and LUSH<sup>F121W</sup> lines, because recombinant LUSH<sup>F121A</sup> was unable to rescue the loss of spontaneous activity in OR67d neurons observed in <italic>lush</italic> mutants thereby providing a second piece of evidence linking LUSH conformational changes and OR67d neuronal firing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. We observed that all LUSH transgenes restored spontaneous firing of OR67d neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Quantification of this activity revealed minor variation in their mean firing frequencies (∼1–3 spikes/s), but these differences were not statistically significant across genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Importantly, LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> flies did not exhibit the elevated level of spontaneous activity reported for recombinant LUSH<sup>D118A</sup>. Surprisingly, spontaneous firing was also observed in the LUSH<sup>F121A</sup> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), which is inconsistent with the activity of recombinant LUSH<sup>F121A</sup> but consistent with our observation that the transgenic protein supports cVA-evoked activity as effectively as LUSH<sup>wt</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

We considered the possibility that transgenic LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> is also constitutively active but that its constant presence leads to desensitization of OR67d neurons. If this were the case, we would not expect these OSNs to be able to respond to cVA.

         <p>These observations indicate that the transgenic expression of LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> does not lead to desensitization of OR67d neurons. Rather, they highlight an important functional difference between recombinant and transgenic LUSH<sup>D118A</sup>: recombinant LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> was reported to be unable to support further activation of OR67d neurons when cVA is presented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. This observation was suggested to reflect the fact that the “conformationally activated” LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> could not be further activated by cVA. By contrast, our results indicate that transgenic LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> supports cVA-evoked activity essentially identically to wild-type LUSH. Because of these differences, we analyzed an independently generated LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> transgenic line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Ronderos1">[34]</xref>.

We first superposed the 12 available structures of LUSH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s002">Figure S2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kruse1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Thode1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.

         <title>Requirement for LUSH Can Be Bypassed by High Concentrations of cVA</title>
         <p>The model that the cVA/LUSH complex directly activates OR67d neurons predicts that LUSH should be essential for cVA-evoked activation of this receptor. However, previous studies demonstrated that OR67d (with or without SNMP) can respond weakly to cVA in the absence of LUSH when mis-expressed in a neuron normally insensitive to this pheromone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-vanderGoesvanNaters1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. As heterologous receptor expression may not necessarily reflect activity of the endogenous signal transduction pathway, we examined the responses of OR67d neurons to cVA in the presence or absence of LUSH by adapting a close-range stimulation assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-vanderGoesvanNaters1">[14]</xref>. Typically, odors are presented to antennae by delivering (and diluting) in an airstream the headspace of a filter paper impregnated with the stimulus odor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton4">[36]</xref>. In our close-range assay, we presented cVA by approaching the antenna (within ∼0.1 mm) with a filter paper strip on which 2 µl of a 10% solution of cVA (or the pure paraffin oil solvent) was spotted. Contact between the filter paper and antenna was completely avoided. For each sensillum tested, we approached twice (for ∼1 s each, separated by a ∼4–5 s interval) with a filter paper containing paraffin oil and twice with a filter paper containing cVA. Wild-type OR67d sensilla responded consistently and strongly to presentation of cVA (24/24 approaches; mean corrected responses upon first stimulus approaches ± SEM = 112.2±8.4 spikes/s, <italic>n</italic> = 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). No responses were observed to paraffin oil indicating that there is no mechanosensory artifact due to close approach of the filter paper. In <italic>lush</italic> mutants, we also observed robust, albeit lower, responses to presentation of cVA but not paraffin oil (24/24 approaches; mean corrected responses upon first stimulus approaches ± SEM = 60.2±6.7 spikes/s, <italic>n</italic> = 12) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g006">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s003">S3</xref>). The existence of these cVA-evoked responses is consistent with observations that delivery of cVA in an airstream can evoke weak activity in OR67d neurons in <italic>lush</italic> mutant flies at the highest stimulus concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>) and suggests that our close-approach assay merely achieves higher stimulus concentrations than those possible by airstream delivery. These observations indicate that while LUSH is important for high sensitivity responses to cVA, it is not essential for cVA-evoked activity in OR67d neurons.</p>

         <p>To demonstrate that LUSH-independent activation of OR67d neurons by cVA is specific and not an artifact of high stimulus concentrations, we also tested mutant flies lacking the neuronal receptors OR67d or SNMP in our close-range assay. Like <italic>lush</italic> mutants, <italic>Or67d</italic> mutant sensilla exhibit low spontaneous firing frequency, but no responses to cVA were observed (0/20 approaches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g006">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s003">S3</xref>). As observed previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Jin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton3">[21]</xref>, <italic>snmp</italic> mutant flies display—for unclear reasons—elevated spontaneous firing of OR67d neurons, but these sensilla also failed to exhibit evoked activity upon close-range stimulation by cVA (0/24 approaches) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g006">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s003">S3</xref>). Together, these results confirm that both neuronal membrane receptors are, in contrast to LUSH, essential for cVA-evoked activity in endogenous OR67d neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Jin1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Ha1">[23]</xref>. Moreover, they indicate that the responses observed in <italic>lush</italic> mutant sensilla are unlikely to be due to non-specific activation of these neurons by high concentrations of pheromone.</p>
         <p>We further verified that close-range stimulation of OR67d neurons by cVA is specific by recording responses in non-OR67d trichoid sensilla. These sensilla can be easily distinguished from those housing OR67d OSNs because they contain two or three different neurons that exhibit multiple distinct spike amplitudes and have higher basal activity levels than OR67d OSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>. While 20/20 OR67d sensilla respond to close approach with cVA, only 1/20 non-OR67d sensilla displayed a detectable response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001546-g006">Figures 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001546.s003">S3</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have tested a model proposing that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pheromone cVA is detected through conformational activation of the OBP LUSH, which then acts as the ligand for pheromone-sensing neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. This model was based upon analysis of the structural and functional properties of several site-directed mutant LUSH proteins that were expressed recombinantly and delivered acutely to cVA-sensing neurons. In this work, using a transgenic-expression system for these LUSH mutant proteins, we have made several observations that are inconsistent with this model. We discuss the basis for these discrepancies and re-consider the role of LUSH in pheromone sensing.</p>

         <title>Functional Differences of Recombinant and Transgenically Expressed LUSH</title>
         <p>The discrepancy between our findings and those previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref> are likely to reflect the difference in how wild-type and mutant LUSH proteins are provided to cVA-sensing sensilla. Recombinant LUSH proteins were expressed (lacking the N-terminal signal peptide) in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, and purified and re-folded from inclusion bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Bucci1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. These proteins were then introduced into individual sensilla via a glass electrode, which was simultaneously used for extracellular recording of action potentials of the OR67d neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. It is presumed that LUSH passes from the electrode to the sensillar lymph by diffusion, although the precise diffusion rate and the final concentration of LUSH in the lymph at equilibrium are difficult to determine. Nevertheless, this method provides a way to assess the effect of acute (i.e., within a timescale of 5–30 min) delivery of LUSH on spontaneous and cVA-evoked activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.</p>
         <p>We provided LUSH via a transgenic genomic rescue construct that appears to contain all necessary transcriptional and translational regulatory sequences to recapitulate endogenous LUSH expression. Importantly, we have compared the function of mutant LUSH transgenes with a wild-type transgene inserted at the same genomic location; these flies are genetically identical except for the desired single amino acid substitutions in LUSH. As transgenically expressed LUSH is supplied both during development and in the mature olfactory system, it is conceivable that tonic exposure of OR67d neurons to mutant versions of LUSH changes their activity. This could account for the higher basal activity observed in OR67d neurons after acute delivery of the presumed constitutively active LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> compared to the effect of the same protein expressed transgenically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Ronderos1">[34]</xref>. We believe that this explanation is unlikely, however, as transgenic LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> fully supports cVA-evoked activity, indicating that OR67d neurons have not adapted to tonic exposure to this mutant protein. Indeed, our finding that LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> rescues the ability of OR67d neurons to respond to cVA conflicts with the previous demonstration that recombinant LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> does not confer cVA sensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>.</p>
         <p>We argue that the transgenically expressed LUSH is more likely to reflect the activity of the wild-type and mutant variants than when provided recombinantly. Like other OBPs, LUSH is expressed in auxiliary cells that flank OSNs and must pass through their endomembrane system before being secreted into the sensillar lymph <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Blomquist1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Leal2">[38]</xref>. During this transit, LUSH presumably forms (like other OBPs) intramolecular disulfide bridges in the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum; it is unknown whether the protein undergoes other post-translational modifications. The transgenic approach allows stable expression of LUSH proteins that are likely to follow this same transport pathway, and avoids the technical challenges of delivering purified, recombinant LUSH.</p>

         <title>The Roles of LUSH in Chemosensation</title>
         <p>Several functions of LUSH have been described since the identification of this OBP gene in an enhancer-trap screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kim1">[33]</xref>. <italic>lush</italic> mutants were initially shown to display behavioral defects in avoidance of high concentrations of short-chain <italic>n</italic>-alcohols <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kim1">[33]</xref>. Subsequently, biochemical and structural studies demonstrated that LUSH binds alcohols, with encapsulation of single alcohol molecules in the binding pocket serving to conformationally stabilize LUSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kruse1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Bucci1">[26]</xref>. Although another study suggested that LUSH binds aromatic compounds and not alcohols in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Zhou1">[28]</xref>, electrophysiological analysis showed that <italic>lush</italic> mutants display defects in alcohol-evoked inhibition of neural activity in certain classes of (non-cVA sensing) trichoid OSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>. However, the identity of these alcohol-sensitive neurons, the role of LUSH in regulating their activity, and how this relates to the alcohol-avoidance defects of <italic>lush</italic> mutants remain unknown.</p>
         <p>The dramatic reduction in cVA-sensitivity in OR67d neurons in <italic>lush</italic> mutants provided the first evidence for a role for this OBP in olfactory transduction in vivo. LUSH is highly expressed in most, if not all, trichoid sensilla in the antenna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Shanbhag1">[39]</xref>, which house nine OSN classes expressing different ORs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Couto1">[40]</xref>. Two of these receptors, OR67d and OR65a, respond to cVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-vanderGoesvanNaters1">[14]</xref> but the ligands for the remaining ORs are unknown. The presence of LUSH in the lymph fluid surrounding these receptors opens the possibility that this OBP—like SNMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Jin1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton3">[21]</xref>—acts in the detection of multiple pheromones. Indirect evidence for this possibility comes from consideration of the behavioral phenotype of <italic>lush</italic> mutants. Loss of LUSH was initially linked to defects in cVA-induced aggregation behavior but not sexual behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>. More recently, cVA (or artificial) stimulation of OR67d neurons has been shown to be necessary and sufficient both to inhibit male courtship behavior and to promote female receptivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kurtovic1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Ronderos1">[34]</xref>. The absence of reported courtship defects in <italic>lush</italic> mutants could be explained, for example, if LUSH was involved in recognition of other pheromones by different ORs with opposite functions in regulating sexual behavior. While cVA is the only volatile pheromone identified so far in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, LUSH can bind other insect pheromones, suggesting its ligand-binding pocket can accommodate structurally diverse, long-chain hydrocarbons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Katti1">[41]</xref>.</p>
         <p>In sum, evidence from behavioral, biochemical, structural, and expression studies suggests that LUSH plays several roles in chemosensation, with a variety of odor ligands and different ORs. According to the proposed model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, the unique ability of a cVA/LUSH complex to activate OR67d neurons is a reflection of the distinct conformation of the complex. However, our re-analysis of the available X-ray crystal structures argues that current data for LUSH do not unambiguously support this possibility for two reasons. First, as previously noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, cVA/LUSH complexes are structurally heterogeneous, and it remains unclear which—if any—structure reflects the in vivo conformation of cVA/LUSH. Second, the presumed D118-K87 salt bridge that was suggested to maintain LUSH in an “inactive” state in OR67d sensilla <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref> is not a consistent feature of either apo LUSH or complexes of this OBP with non-pheromonal ligands. Indeed, because a LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> crystal structure was reported to resemble the cVA/LUSH structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, our demonstration that LUSH<sup>D118A</sup> behaves similarly to wild-type LUSH in vivo questions the functional significance of the observed conformational changes. It is possible that mutagenesis of other (or additional) residues within LUSH may more precisely mimic the pheromone-bound state(s), but it is not obvious which residues should be targeted. It also remains conceivable that cVA binding induces structural alterations in LUSH that are not revealed by X-ray crystallography but which are relevant for pheromone signaling; investigation of this possibility would require new ways of visualizing the interaction of cVA with LUSH.</p>

         <title>Mechanism of LUSH in cVA Detection</title>
         <p>Our genetic, electrophysiological, and structural analyses of LUSH fail to find evidence in support of the conformational activation model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, raising the question of how LUSH participates in cVA detection. The close-approach stimulation assay reveals that cVA can activate OR67d neurons in the absence of LUSH. While the quantity of pheromone entering the sensilla in this assay is likely to be in excess of that encountered in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>, our control experiments show that this stimulation is specific to OR67d neurons and depends upon the neuronal receptor components SNMP and OR67d. Moreover, the LUSH-independent stimulation of OR67d is in accord with several previous analyses of this receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-vanderGoesvanNaters1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Benton3">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref>. Together, these observations argue for a mechanism in which cVA must directly activate OR67d, and indicate that the specificity of pheromone detection resides principally in this pheromone ligand/OR interaction. This proposition is inline with observations that chemically diverse hydrocarbon pheromones in other insects can, with varying degrees of efficiency, activate their cognate ORs in the absence of OBPs in several different in vivo and in vitro heterologous expression systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Nakagawa1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Kurtovic1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Sakurai1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Wanner2">[48]</xref>.</p>
         <p>The major loss of sensitivity to cVA in <italic>lush</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref> indicates an important role for this OBP in pheromone detection, and likely an essential one at ecologically relevant pheromone concentrations. While our experiments do not address how LUSH functions mechanistically, we suggest that encapsulation of cVA by LUSH helps first to solubilize the hydrophobic pheromone molecules in the aqueous sensillar lymph and to protect them from degradation by ODEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Chertemps1">[49]</xref>, but that this OBP must ultimately deliver and release cVA to the neuronal pheromone receptors. The combined effect of these actions of LUSH would be to produce a concentration of pheromone available to bind OR67d that is several orders of magnitude greater than would be achieved without this OBP. These ideas are consistent with the in vivo analysis of cVA detection in wild-type and <italic>lush</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Laughlin1">[29]</xref> and this work), but also derive from studies on pheromone-binding OBPs in heterologous systems. For example, several moth pheromone receptors, when expressed in cultured mammalian cells, can respond to high concentrations of their cognate ligand solubilized in dimethyl sulfoxide but that provision of the pheromone together with an OBP/PBP negates the requirement for this organic solvent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-GrosseWilde1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Forstner1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-GrosseWilde2">[50]</xref>. How LUSH might release cVA to the pheromone receptors is unclear, but would presumably require a reversal of the cVA-evoked conformational change. In other OBPs/PBPs, several lines of evidence support a pH-dependent conformational regulation that controls ligand release, at least in vitro (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Leal1">[11]</xref>). We also suggest that binding of LUSH with one or more of the neuronal membrane receptors (SNMP, OR67d, and/or ORCO) could trigger cVA release.</p>
         <p>OBPs were first identified over 30 years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Vogt1">[51]</xref>. The size of these repertoires in insect genomes and the diversity in their sequences, expression patterns, and in vitro biochemical properties argue for a widespread role in chemical detection in insects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Leal1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Pelosi1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Swarup1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Pelletier1">[53]</xref>. To date, the loss-of-function genetic analysis of LUSH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001546-Xu1">[24]</xref> is the most compelling demonstration of the importance of this role. Defining the precise mechanism by which LUSH and other OBPs act in vivo, however, still awaits.</p>

            <title>Odor presentation in an airstream</title>
            <p>10 µl of odorant were added to a 6×7.5 mm absorbent strip (Sugi, Kettenbach), which was placed inside a 1 ml tuberculin syringe (Becton, Dickinson and Company). A charcoal-filtered airflow (35 ml/s) was used to deliver odors to the preparation through a 10 ml serological pipette that was trimmed to remove the tapered tip, and the cut end positioned 15 mm away from the preparation. Half of this airflow was diverted through the odor syringe during odor stimulation periods (1 s) under the control of the Syntech CS-55 Stimulus controller. cVA (Pherobank; purity 99%) was diluted v/v in paraffin oil as indicated in the figures. We found that the onset of cVA-evoked responses varied slightly (usually 200 ms) between animals of the same genotype recorded on different days, most probably owing to small variations in the position of the odor delivery apparatus relative to the preparation. For quantification of responses, we therefore determined the time of onset of the response of a control wild-type sensillum to 100% cVA for each recording session. Corrected responses for all recordings in the same session were quantified by counting spikes in a 0.5 s window from this time point, subtracting the number of spontaneous spikes in a 0.5 s window before stimulation, and doubling the result to obtain spikes/s. The only exception was made for <italic>lush</italic> mutant flies in which cVA-evoked responses are delayed approximately 800–1,000 ms. In this case, the corrected responses were quantified by counting spikes in a 0.5 s window from the response onset time point, subtracting the number of spontaneous spikes in a 0.5 s window before the response onset, and doubling the result to obtain spikes/s. Peristimulus time histograms (PSTHs) were generated by counting the numbers of spikes in 0.5 s bins from 3 s before to 7 s after stimulation for each trial.
