<article-title>How to Turn On an Ancient Metabolic Enzyme? Add Insulin and Deacetylate</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>Phosphoglycerate kinase 1 (PGK1) catalyzes the reversible transfer of a phosphoryl group from 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (1, 3-BPG) to ADP, producing 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and ATP. PGK1 plays a key role in coordinating glycolytic energy production with one-carbon metabolism, serine biosynthesis, and cellular redox regulation. Here, we report that PGK1 is acetylated at lysine 220 (K220), which inhibits PGK1 activity by disrupting the binding with its substrate, ADP. We have identified KAT9 and HDAC3 as the potential acetyltransferase and deacetylase, respectively, for PGK1. Insulin promotes K220 deacetylation to stimulate PGK1 activity. We show that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation, which promotes HDAC3-PGK1 interaction and PGK1 K220 deacetylation. Our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism for the insulin and mTOR pathway in regulation of glycolytic ATP production and cellular redox potential via HDAC3-mediated PGK1 deacetylation.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Phosphoglycerate kinase (PGK1) catalyzes the reversible phosphotransfer reaction from 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (1, 3-BPG) to ADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and ATP. By controlling ATP and 3-PG levels, PGK1 plays an important role in coordinating energy production with biosynthesis and redox balance. In contrast to the extensive investigation of the transcriptional regulation of PGK1, little is known about its post-translational regulation. Here, we report that PGK1 is acetylated at lysine 220 (K220) and this acetylation inhibits PGK1 activity by disrupting the binding with its substrate, ADP. We have identified KAT9 and HDAC3 as the acetyltransferase and deacetylase, respectively, for PGK1. Moreover, we show there is molecular crosstalk between mTOR-mediated HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation and PGK1 K220 acetylation. Our study uncovers a previously unknown mechanism for the insulin and mTOR pathway in regulating glycolytic ATP production and cellular redox potential via HDAC3-mediated PGK1 deacetylation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Phosphoglycerate kinase (EC 2.7.2.3; PGK) catalyzes the reversible phosphotransfer reaction from 1, 3-bisphosphoglycerate (1, 3-BPG) to ADP to form 3-phosphoglycerate (3-PG) and ATP. The PGK-catalyzed reaction is the first ATP-yielding step of glycolysis and is essential for energy generation by the glycolytic pathway of aerobes and the fermentation of anaerobes in most living cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>]. Besides ATP, the other product of PGK-catalyzed reaction is 3-PG, which can not only serve as a glycolytic intermediate but also be oxidized by phosphoglycerate dehydrogenase (PHGDH) to form 3-phosphohydroxypyruvate and thus enter one-carbon metabolism [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>]. It is known that one-carbon metabolism involving the folate and methionine cycle integrates carbon units from amino acids, including serine and glycine, and creates various outputs, such as the maintenance of redox status by affecting glutathione biosynthesis and NADPH production, the synthesis of lipids, nucleotides, and substrate for methylation reactions [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>]. By controlling ATP and 3-PG levels, PGK therefore plays an important role in coordinating energy production with biosynthesis and redox balance.</p>
<p>Regulation of PGK has been studied extensively, with research mostly focused on the transcriptional level. In yeast cells, <italic>PGK</italic> is one of the most highly expressed genes and accounts for approximately 5% of the total mRNA and protein [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. <italic>PGK</italic> gene expression can be regulated by diverse carbon sources, with glucose induction and pyruvate suppression having been observed in yeast cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. <italic>PGK</italic> gene expression is also up-regulated by oxidative stress [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Overexpression of PGK can suppress the apoptotic phenotypes induced by high ROS and restore normal aging of yeast cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. In humans, PGK has two isoforms (PGK1 and PGK2), which share 87% identity in amino acid sequence and are structurally and functionally similar, but have different expression patterns [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. <italic>PGK1</italic> (Gene ID: 5230) is broadly expressed in most cell types, while <italic>PGK2</italic> (Gene ID: 5232) is uniquely expressed in meiotic and postmeiotic spermatogenic cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. <italic>PGK1</italic> gene as the target of the hypoxia-inducible transcriptional factor HIF-1α has been reported to be selectively up-regulated by oxidants in cultured human colon carcinoma cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] and hepatoblastoma cells [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. In contrast to the extensive investigation on the transcriptional regulation of PGK1, little is known about its post-translational regulation.</p>
<p>Protein acetylation has recently been discovered as an evolutionarily conserved post-translational modification in the regulation of a wide range of cellular processes, particularly in nuclear transcription and cytoplasmic metabolism [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Together with several recent acetylome proteomic studies [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], more than 4,500 acetylated proteins, including human PGK1, have been identified by the mass spectrometric analyses. In this study, we investigate the regulatory mechanism and functional consequence of PGK1 acetylation.</p>

<title>K220 Acetylation Inhibits PGK1 Activity via Blocking Its Binding with Substrate ADP</title>
<p>Previous proteomic studies have identified that PGK1 is acetylated on multiple lysine residues [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>]. Western blotting with a pan anti-acetyl lysine antibody demonstrated that PGK1 was indeed acetylated, and its acetylation was elevated by 3.2-fold in HEK293T cells after treatment with nicotinamide (NAM), an inhibitor of the SIRT family deacetylases [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], and trichostatin A (TSA), an inhibitor of histone deacetylase (HDAC) I and II (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>]. By performing enzyme activity assay in vitro, we found that the specific enzyme activity of PGK1 was decreased by as much as 63% after NAM and TSA treatment (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>), suggesting that acetylation negatively regulates PGK1 activity. Notably, the effect of TSA on increasing PGK1 acetylation and decreasing PGK1 activity was more potent than that of NAM (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">1A</xref>, <xref rid="pbio.1002243.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A and S1B</xref>), implying that a HDAC I and/or II is the major deacetylase for PGK1.</p>

<title>Acetylation of PGK1 K220 blocks substrate ADP binding and inhibits PGK1 activity.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Acetylation inhibits PGK1 enzyme activity. Flag-PGK1 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells followed by treatment with nicotinamide (NAM, 10 mM for 4 hr), trichostatin (TSA, 5 μM for 12 hr), or NAM and TSA (N+T). Acetylation levels and enzyme activity of Flag-bead-purified PGK1 were determined by western blot analysis and enzyme assay, respectively. Acetylation levels were blotted with a pan-anti-acetyllysine antibody (α-Ac). The catalytic activity of affinity purified PGK1 was determined and normalized to protein levels. PGK1 activity under no treatment condition was set as 1. PGK1 acetylation levels were normalized against Flag IB as indicated on the top of each lane. IB and IP denote immunoblotting and immunoprecipitation, respectively. (<bold>B</bold>) Mapping the major regulatory acetylation sites in PGK1. Wild-type (WT) PGK1 and the indicated mutants were each expressed in HEK293T cells. Proteins were purified by IP, and PGK1 activity was determined. Relative PGK1 acetylation levels were normalized against Flag. (<bold>C</bold>) K220 is a major regulatory acetylation site in PGK1. Flag-tagged wild-type and K220 mutant PGK1 were each expressed in HEK293T cells, following treatments with or without NAM (10 mM, 4 hr) and TSA (5 μM, 12 hr). Acetylation levels and enzyme activity of PGK1 were determined. (<bold>D</bold>) Molecular interaction between PGK1 and its substrates. As shown, PGK1 is rendered in cyan-colored illustrations, and ADP is in sticks and colored by atom type with magenta illustrations. The left panel shows that PGK1 in complex with ADP, 3-PG, and ALF (tertrafluoroaluminate) results in an active and fully closed conformation. A gray dashed line represents the hydrogen bond between K220 and ADP. 3-PG and ALF are also rendered in sticks, and colored by atom type, with carbons colored magenta. The right panel shows that the interaction between an acetylated K220 (white carbons) and ADP is disrupted. (<bold>E</bold>) Purification of K220 acetylated PGK1.

<p>Given that PGK1 is a highly conserved protein [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>], we speculated that important regulatory sites in PGK1 targeted by acetylation might also be conserved. Sequence alignments from diverse species revealed that of twenty putative acetylated lysines identified by the different mass spectrometric analyses, fifteen lysine residues (K11, K30, K48, K86, K91, K97, K131, K146, K156, K192, K199, K264, K267, K291, K323) are not conserved, while five (K75, K139, K141, K220, K406) are invariably conserved (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>). To determine which lysine residue(s) plays a major role in the regulation of PGK1, we mutated each of the five conserved putative acetylated lysine residues in PGK1 to arginine (R) or glutamine (Q) and assayed their enzyme activity individually. The K to R mutation is often used as a deacetylation mimetic, whereas the K to Q mutation may act as a surrogate of acetylation [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]. We found that substitution at K220, but not the other four lysine residues (K75, K139, K141, and K406), by arginine substantially reduced PGK1 enzyme activity by 82% (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>), indicating K220 has an important role in controlling PGK1 activity. Moreover, both the K220R and K220Q mutants exhibited a negligible response in changing acetylation level and enzyme activity upon NAM and TSA treatment (Figs <xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">1C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002243.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3</xref>), re-affirming that K220 is a major acetylation site in PGK1.</p>
<p>PGK1 exists as a monomer comprising two nearly equal-sized N- and C-terminal domains. This extended two-domain structure is associated with large-scale “hinge-bending” conformational changes, bringing the two substrates into close proximity, with 3-PG or 1,3-BPG binding to the N-terminal domain and the nucleotide substrate ADP binding to the C-terminal domain of the enzyme [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. PGK1 in complex with 3-PG, ADP, and tetrafluoroaluminate (ALF) results in a fully active and closed conformation [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. Molecular modeling predicts that K220 acetylation disturbs PGK1’s binding with ADP (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), suggesting that K220 acetylation may inhibit PGK1 enzyme activity by blocking the substrate ADP binding.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we employed an expression system genetically encoding N<sup>ε</sup>-acetyllysine to prepare recombinant PGK1 protein that was completely acetylated on K220 in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. Briefly, the K220 codon in PGK1 was mutated to an amber stop codon. An amber suppressor tRNA and a tRNA synthetase that could conjugate the acetyllysine to the amber tRNA suppressor were also expressed in the bacteria. Therefore, in the presence of acetyllysine added in the culture medium, the amber stop codon at the position of K220 was replaced by an acetyllysine when PGK1 was expressed in the genetically engineered <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> strain. This expression system produced PGK1 proteins with 100% acetylation at the lysine residue 220. Moreover, we generated and verified an antibody that specifically recognizes the K220 acetylated PGK1 [α-acPGK1(K220)] (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A, S4B and S4C Fig</xref>). The K220 acetylation of the recombinant PGK1 was confirmed by immunoblotting with the site-specific α-acPGK1(K220) antibody (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>). Consistent with the structural prediction, the recombinant PGK1<sup>K220ac</sup> protein was catalytically inactive when compared to recombinant wild-type PGK1. Importantly, isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC) analysis demonstrated that the recombinant PGK1<sup>K220ac</sup> protein was defective in binding with ADP (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). These results provide direct and unequivocal biochemical evidence to support a model that K220 acetylation in PGK1 inhibits its enzymatic activity by blocking the substrate ADP binding.</p>

<title>KAT9/ELP3 Is a Potential Acetyltransferase of PGK1</title>
<p>The acetylation state of a given protein is controlled by the action of lysine acetyltransferases (KATs) and deacetylases (KDACs), enzymes that catalyze the addition and removal, respectively, of an acetyl group from a lysine residue. To search for potential KAT(s) which are responsible for PGK1 K220 acetylation, we generated a siRNA library with three siRNAs targeting each of the 19 human <italic>KAT</italic> genes [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>].

<p>Our earlier observation that TSA is more potent than NAM to increase PGK1 acetylation and inhibit PGK1 activity (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) led us to search for the HDAC enzyme(s) that mediates PGK1 deacetylation. We found by binding assay that PGK1 interacted with HDAC3 (NP_003874.2), but not the other six HDACs, when co-expressed in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The endogenous protein interaction between HDAC3 and PGK1 was readily detected in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Furthermore, based on the protein amount and the immunoprecipitation efficiency, we found that ~16% of endogenous HDAC3 interacted with endogenous PGK1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). Co-overexpression of HA-HDAC3 with Flag-PGK1 decreased the acetylation level of PGK1 by 75%, and increased PGK1 activity by ~1.6-fold (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). In contrast, co-overexpression of HA-HDAC3 with the K220R/Q mutants of PGK1 did not change PGK1 acetylation or enzyme activity (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). When PGK1 was co-overexpressed with a catalytic inactive mutant HDAC3<sup>Y298H</sup> [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>], neither PGK1 acetylation nor enzyme activity was altered (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3D</xref>).

<p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) PGK1 interacts with HDAC3. Flag-tagged PGK1 was overexpressed in HEK293T cells together with the individual HA-tagged HDAC as indicated. PGK1 protein was purified by IP with Flag beads, following western blot to detect HDACs with a human influenza hemagglutinin (HA) antibody (A). In addition, PGK1 protein was purified by IP with PGK1 antibody, following western blot to detect its interacting endogenous HDAC3 (B). ‘5.7% input’ refers to 5.7% of total proteins for IP experiments were loaded. Based on the protein amount as determined by western blotting and chemiluminescent detection, the protein level of immunorecipitated PGK1 is 3.9 times of PGK1 input, and the protein level of co-immunorecipitated HDAC3 is 0.64 times of HDAC3 input. Thus, the IP efficiency for PGK1 is 3.9 × 5.7% = 22.2%, and the co-IP efficiency for HDAC3 is 0.64 × 5.7% = 3.6%. This indicates that ~16% (3.6%/22.2% = 16%) of endogenous HDAC3 interacting with PGK1. (<bold>C</bold>) HDAC3 deacetylates PGK1 mainly at the site of K220.

<p>Next, we determined the K220 acetylation level of endogenous PGK1 in HEK293T cells. By using the recombinant PGK1<sup>K220ac</sup> protein purified from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> as the standard, we found that ~37% of endogenous PGK1 was acetylated at K220, and that insulin treatment decreased PGK1 acetylation to 11% (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4C</xref>).

Protein kinase CK2 has been reported to be responsible for HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. Mutation of serine (S) 424 to alanine (A) (mimics dephosphorylation) inhibits HDAC3 enzyme activity without affecting its expression or subcellular localization [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>]. In accord, we found that the HDAC3<sup>S424A</sup> mutant displayed a ~50% reduction in enzyme activity (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>).

To provide further evidence to support this notion, we transfected HEK293T cells singularly with plasmid expressing Flag-PGK1 or with plasmids co-expressing Flag-PGK1 and HA-HDAC3. Lysates from transfected cells were first immunoprecipitated with Flag antibody and then the remaining supernatant was precipitated with HA antibody. We found that HA-HDAC3 was co-precipitated with Flag-PGK1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D</xref>). Importantly, HA-HDAC3 in the PGK1 immune complex was highly phosphorylated on Ser424, whereas the free HDAC3 was weakly phosphorylated. These results suggest that Ser424 phosphorylation of HDAC3 may enhance its interaction with PGK1.</p>

<title>The mTOR Pathway Regulates HDAC3 S424 Phosphorylation and PGK1 K220 Acetylation</title>
<p>Previous studies have shown that HDAC3 phosphorylation is regulated by phosphoinositide-3-kinase/AKT (PI3K/AKT) pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. In addition, HDAC3 has also been identified as a downstream target of mTOR [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>].

To test this hypothesis, we treated HEK293T cells co-overexpressing Flag-PGK1 and HA-HDAC3 with either LY294002 or Wortmannin, two specific PI3K inhibitors. As expected, either PI3K inhibitor profoundly attenuated AKT S473 phosphorylation (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). Notably, both LY294002 and Wortmannin dose-dependently increased K220 acetylation of ectopically expressed Flag-PGK1 and decreased the interaction between ectopically expressed PGK1 and HDAC3 (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10A and S10B Fig</xref>). In accord, both LY294002 and Wortmannin dose-dependently increased K220 acetylation of endogenous PGK1 and decreased endogenous PGK1-HDAC3 association in HEK293T cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A and 6B</xref>). In addition, MK-2206 2HCI, a specific AKT inhibitor, produced similar effects on changing PGK1 K220 acetylation and PGK1-HDAC3 association as the PI3K inhibitor LY294002 or Wortmannin (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6C</xref>). Furthermore, we observed that the mTOR inhibitor Rapamycin profoundly attenuated S6K T389 phosphorylation as expected, reduced HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation, impaired endogenous PGK1-HDAC3 interaction, and increased PGK1 K220 acetylation (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D</xref>). Collectively, these findings demonstrate that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway can regulate PGK1 K220 acetylation, possibly through controlling HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation and HDAC3–PGK1 protein interaction.</p>

<p>(<bold>A, B</bold>) Inhibition of PI3K increases the K220 acetylation level of endogenous PGK1. HEK293T cells were treated with two PI3K inhibitors, LY294002 (A) and Wortmannin (B), at the indicated concentrations for 4 hr and 2 hr, respectively. PGK1 protein was purified by IP with PGK1 antibody, following western blot to detect the K220 acetylation level of endogenous PGK1 and its interacting endogenous HDAC3.

HEK293T cells were treated with MK-2206 2HCI (a specific AKT inhibitor) at the indicated concentrations for 2 hr. PGK1 protein was purified by IP with PGK1 antibody, following western blot to detect the K220 acetylation level of endogenous PGK1 and its interacting endogenous HDAC3.

(<bold>D</bold>) Inhibition of mTOR decreases HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation and increases PGK1 K220 acetylation. HEK293T cells were treated with Rapamycin for 2 hr. Endogenous HDAC3 and PGK1 were immunopurified with HDAC3 and PGK1 antibodies, respectively, followed by western blotting to detect HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation and PGK1 K220 acetylation. S6K protein and S6K T389 phosphorylation levels were detected with anti-S6K antibody as well as anti-pS6K(T389) antibody. The phrase “9.5% input” refers to the fact that 9.5% of total proteins for IP experiments were loaded. (<bold>E</bold>) HDAC3 Ser424 is required for insulin to promote HDAC3-PGK1 interaction. Flag-PGK1 was co-overexpressed with HA-tagged wild-type or S424A mutant HDAC3 in HEK293T cells. The transfected cells were treated with insulin (0 or 50 nM, 2 hr). HA-HDAC3 protein was purified by HA beads and the co-precipitated Flag-PGK1 was detected by western blot.

<p>The PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway is regulated by a wide variety of cellular signals, including insulin [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>]. We then studied the role of the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway in mediating insulin signal to control PGK1 K220 acetylation. As shown, insulin increased HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation and enhanced the interaction between ectopically expressed proteins of HDAC3 and PGK1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>). The dephosphorylation-mimicking HDAC3<sup>S424A</sup> mutant exhibited weak binding to PGK1 even upon insulin treatment (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6E</xref>), supporting the notion that HDAC3 S424 is a key site for regulating HDAC3-PGK1 association upon insulin stimulation. Rapamycin treatment decreased HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation, impaired protein interaction between endogenous HDAC3 and PGK1, and increased PGK1 K220 acetylation (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). Moreover, rapamycin abolished the effect of insulin on changing HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation, HDAC3-PGK1 association, and PGK1 K220 acetylation (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>). Besides insulin, other growth factors, such as EGF, may also enhance the PI3K/mTOR pathway [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref041" ref-type="bibr">41</xref>]. We found that EGF stimulation increased ERK1/2 phosphorylation, but not S6K T389 phosphorylation, in HEK293T cells, suggesting that EGF cannot potently activate mTOR in our experiment. As a result, EGF treatment did not change HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation and PGK1 K220 acetylation (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Fig</xref>). Collectively, these data suggest that the mTOR pathway regulates PGK1 K220 acetylation through controlling HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation.</p>

<title>K220 Acetylation of PGK1 Regulates Substrate ADP Binding</title>
<p>The current study uncovers a biochemical mechanism for how acetylation controls the activity/function of PGK1. We have identified KAT9 and HDAC3 as the potential acetyltransferase and major deacetylase of PGK1, respectively. To the best of our knowledge, we show for the first time that acetylation of PGK1 plays an important role in modulating glycolytic energy production and cellular oxidative response.</p>
<p>We have identified K220 as an important regulatory acetylation site within the PGK1 protein. Human PGK1 exists as a monomer containing two nearly equal-sized domains corresponding to the N- and C-termini of the protein [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>]. 1, 3-BPG binds to the N-terminal domain whereas ADP binds to the C-terminal domain of PGK1 [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Though the binding of either substrate 1,3-BPG or ADP triggers a conformational change, only through the binding of both substrates does domain closure occur, bringing the two substrates into the proper vicinity for phosphotransfer [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>]. Of note, K220 locates in the C-terminus of PGK1 and interacts with the nucleotide substrate ADP [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref048" ref-type="bibr">48</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. Our data show that acetylation mimetic K220Q substitution significantly reduces PGK1 catalysis. This is best illustrated by the observation that the recombinant PGK1<sup>K220ac</sup> protein is defective in ADP binding, implying that neutralization of the positive charge of K220 by acetylation may disrupt ADP binding and thus inhibit PGK1 catalysis. It has to be noted that both acetylation mimetic K220Q substitution and deacetylation mimetic K220R substitution can significantly reduce PGK1 activity. This raises another possibility, that is, the steric hindrance that occurs when K220 is mutated to Q or R, and this will generate different interaction force and/or steric hindrance, thereby abolishing ADP binding and inhibiting PGK1 catalysis.</p>

<title>Crosstalk between HDAC3 Phosphorylation and PGK1 Acetylation Links Extracellular Physiologic Stimuli to Intracellular Metabolic Flux</title>
<p>Our study has provided novel insights into the role of K220 acetylation in controlling PGK1 activity/function in response to insulin. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence linking the regulation of PGK1 to mTOR downstream of PI3K/AKT and insulin. In addition, we show a molecular crosstalk between mTOR-mediated HDAC3 S424 phosphorylation and PGK1 K220 acetylation.</p>
<p>We have identified HDAC3 as the major deacetylase of PGK1. HDAC3 can form multi-protein complexes with the co-repressors SMRT and N-CoR and deacetylates histones, thereby regulating the transcription of a plethora of genes [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>]. In addition, many non-histone substrates of HDAC3 have been identified, including the NF-ƘB protein RelA [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>], sex-determining region Y (SRY, a master regulator of testis organogenesis) [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], and several transcription factors such as p53 [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>], myocyte enhancer factor-2 (Mef2) [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>], and glial cell missing (GCMa) [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>]. Very recently, it was reported that HDAC3 deacetylates methionine adenosyltransferase IIα (MAT IIα) in the methionine cycle [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>], indicating that HDAC3 can deacetylate a metabolic enzyme and may play an important role in regulating metabolic pathway(s). Supporting this notion, we show in this study that another metabolic enzyme, PGK1, is a direct substrate of HDAC3 and that HDAC3-mediated PGK1 deacetylation plays a signaling role in regulating PGK1 activity/function upon insulin stimulation. Moreover, we demonstrate that the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway regulates PGK1 K220 acetylation, in part, via affecting HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation, suggesting a potential mechanism for HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation regulating PGK1 K220 acetylation. Upon insulin stimulation, the PI3K/AKT/mTOR pathway induces HDAC3 Ser424 phosphorylation, which increases the deacetylase activity of HDAC3 and/or enhances the protein association between HDAC3 and PGK1, leading to PGK1 K220 deacetylation and enzyme activation (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7I</xref>). mTOR is a central cell growth controller and is potently activated by insulin [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. In addition, mTOR is also regulated by nutrient availability and cellular energy status to control cellular metabolism. Our data provides a direct link of mTOR activation to glycolysis, which is achieved by mTOR-mediated HDAC3 phosphorylation and PGK1 deacetylation, thus leading to PGK1 activation. These results also provide an example illustrating how cells integrate different pathways such as extracellular growth signaling and intracellular metabolic flux by a crosstalk involving different type of protein modifications such as phosphorylation and acetylation.</p>
<p>In addition, we have also identified KAT9 as a potential acetyltransferase of PGK1. KAT9/ELP3, which encodes the catalytic subunit of the histone acetyltransferase elongator complex, has previously been identified as an α-tubulin acetyltransferase in mouse neurons [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>]. Previously, we reported that KAT9 is the potential acetyltransferase of glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD), which is a key enzyme in the pentose phosphate pathway and plays an essential role in the oxidative stress response by producing NADPH [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref060" ref-type="bibr">60</xref>]. In this study, we show that KAT9 as the potential acetyltransferase of PGK1 interacts with and increases PGK1 acetylation, thereby inhibiting PGK1 activity. However, KAT9 may not contribute to cells sensing insulin signal to regulate PGK1 acetylation and function, as neither <italic>KAT9</italic> expression nor KAT9-PGK1 interaction is changed upon insulin treatment.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Acetylation of PGK1 Coordinates Energy Metabolism and Oxidative Stress Response</title>
<p>Our study also links the regulation of PGK1 activity by acetylation to cellular response to oxidative stress. We show that replacement of endogenous of PGK1 with an acetylation-mimetic K220Q mutant results in a significant decrease in NADPH production and higher susceptibility of cells to oxidative stress. The underlying mechanism for PGK1 controlling NADPH production remains unclear. We propose that a general inhibition of glycolysis may at least in part explain the reduction in NADPH production. In addition, we also show that both 3-PG and serine levels are significantly reduced in cells with <italic>PGK1</italic> knockdown and put-back of the acetylation mimetic K220Q mutant as compared to wild-type rescued cells (<xref rid="pbio.1002243.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7B</xref>). 3-PG is essential for de novo serine biosynthesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>]. Serine can be converted to glycine by serine hydroxymethyl transferase, a reaction that yields one carbon units, which enter the tetrahydrofolate cycle and are critical for NADPH production [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref061" ref-type="bibr">61</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>]. Whether PGK1 K220 acetylation inhibits PGK1 catalytic activity, leading to reduced production of 3-PG, disturbed serine biosynthetic flux, and subsequently reduced NADPH production, still needs further investigation.</p>
<p>Recent work has suggested a critical role of serine metabolism in cancer pathogenesis [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. Supporting this notion, <italic>PHGDH</italic> gene expression is up-regulated in diverse cancer cells, such as esophageal adenocarcinoma, triple-negative breast cancer, and melanoma [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>]. Moreover, cancer cells with <italic>PHGDH</italic> amplification were found to exhibit increased metabolic flux into serine biosynthesis, which is known to play a dual role in redox balance and providing nucleotide units to support cancer cell proliferation [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref067" ref-type="bibr">67</xref>]. As noted above, K220 acetylation inhibits PGK1 activity/function and reduces the 3-PG and serine levels, implying that modulation of PGK1 activity/function by acetylation may serve as a promising anti-cancer strategy through regulating serine metabolism.</p>
<p>Moreover, the clinical implication of PGK1 dysfunction has been highlighted by chronic haemolysis with progressive neurological impairment in PGK1-deficient patients [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref068" ref-type="bibr">68</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref070" ref-type="bibr">70</xref>]. Two metabolic alterations, a decreased steady-state level of ATP and an increased 2,3-BPG, in red blood cells with human PGK1 deficiency have been proposed to cause hemolytic anemia [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref071" ref-type="bibr">71</xref>]. It is known that hemolytic anemia also contributes to the inability of erythrocyte cells to produce NADPH and withstand harmful oxidants [<xref rid="pbio.1002243.ref072" ref-type="bibr">72</xref>]. Likely, PGK1 dysfunction-associated chronic haemolysis and neurological impairment are in part caused by oxidative stress due to increased levels of oxidative damage and decrease levels of antioxidants, such as reductant NADPH. In this study, we have provided evidence showing that HDAC3-dependent acetylation regulates the function of PGK1 in both glycolytic ATP production and NADPH redox. Therefore, future therapeutic intervention(s) to modulate PGK1 activity via HDAC3-mediated deacetylation may serve as a potential target for treating related diseases, such as hemolytic anemia and brain disorders associated with PGK1 dysregulation.</p>

<p>All the animal experiments were carried out in accordance with the National Institutes of Health guidelines for the Care and Use of Laboratory Animals and the regulations of Fudan University for animal experimentation. MaleBALB/c mice (6–8 wk old, 20–25 g body weight) were purchased from the Fudan Animal Center. Animals were given unrestricted access to a standard diet and tap water. Blood was collected from tail vein at different time points post intraperitoneal injection of insulin (5 U/kg body weight), and blood glucose levels were determined by using a glucose detection kit (Roche). Before being humanely killed, mice were anesthetized with sodium pentobarbital (25 mg pentobarbital/kg body weight, ip). After that, mouse livers and kidneys were harvested and then homogenized using the Tissuelyser-24 (Shanghai JingXin) in 0.5% NP-40 buffer containing protease inhibitor cocktail, and lysed on ice for 30 min. To determine the acetylation level of endogenous Pgk1, tissue lysates were incubated with the Pgk1 antibody (Santa Cruz) for 1 hr, followed by incubating with Protein-A beads (Upstate) for another 2 hr at 4°C.</p>

<title>Determination of the glycolytic function in <italic>PGK1</italic> knockdown and put-back stable cells.</title>
<p>Extracellular acidification rate (ECAR) was determined in HEK293T cells with <italic>PGK1</italic> knocking-down and putting-back using a Seahorse Bioscience XFe 96 analyzer system as described in <xref rid="pbio.1002243.s020" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Text</xref> (as shown in <bold>A</bold>). The glycolytic function of rescued cells expressing wild-type PGK1 (blue circle), K220Q mutant PGK1 (red circle), and K220R mutant PGK1 (green circle) was compared (<bold>B</bold>). The parameters reflecting glycolysis, glycolytic capacity, and glycolytic reserve were determined by calculating Rate Measurement Equation (<bold>C</bold>). Shown are average values with standard error of the mean (S.E.M.) of triplicated experiments.
