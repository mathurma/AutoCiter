<abstract>
<p>Cell polarization is a prerequisite for essential processes such as cell migration, proliferation or differentiation. The yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> under control of the GTPase Cdc42 is able to polarize without the help of cytoskeletal structures and spatial cues through a pathway depending on its guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) Rdi1. To develop a fundamental understanding of yeast polarization we establish a detailed mechanistic model of GDI-mediated polarization. We show that GDI-mediated polarization provides precise spatial and temporal control of Cdc42 signaling and give experimental evidence for our findings. Cell cycle induced changes of Cdc42 regulation enhance positive feedback loops of active Cdc42 production, and thereby allow simultaneous switch-like regulation of focused polarity and Cdc42 activation. This regulation drives the direct formation of a unique polarity cluster with characteristic narrowing dynamics, as opposed to the previously proposed competition between transient clusters. As the key components of the studied system are conserved among eukaryotes, we expect our findings also to apply to cell polarization in other organisms.</p>

<p>Cell polarization is a fundamental cellular process that defines a single orientation axis within prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells and is a prerequisite for developmental processes such as cell migration, proliferation or differentiation. In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> cell polarization determines the position of a new growth or bud site. Although many studies have focused on identifying polarity regulators and their interactions, the fundamental mechanisms and features of cell polarity still remain controversial. Here, we develop a detailed mathematical model of diffusion-driven cell polarization, which we verify experimentally. We show that this polarization mechanism provides precise spatial and temporal control of signals, which determine the place of a new growth site. Changes induced by the cell cycle allow simultaneous switch-like regulation of polarization and activation of the GTPase Cdc42, the central polarity regulator which initiates formation of a new bud. This regulation drives direct formation of a unique Cdc42 cluster with characteristic narrowing dynamics and robustly narrow spatial focus. Hence, our analysis reveals fundamental design principles that allow cell polarization to reliably initiate developmental processes at a specific time and place. As the key components of the studied system are conserved among eukaryotes, we expect our findings also to apply to cell polarization in other organisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Establishment of cell polarity is a fundamental cellular process that defines orientation axes within prokaryotic or eukaryotic cells and is often referred to as ‘symmetry breaking’. Polarity axes are a prerequisite for many developmental and pathogenic processes such as cell migration, maintenance of epithelial tissue integrity, asymmetric stem cell division, or tumor development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Wodarz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Florian1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Stengel1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the GTPase Cdc42 regulates cell polarization to determine the position of a new growth or bud site. A collection of different proteins under control of Cdc42 accumulates within a restricted region of the plasma membrane to initiate morphogenetic downstream events at the desired position. These clusters arise even in the absence of spatial cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Irazoqui1">[4]</xref>, and are characterized by a dynamic equilibrium where clusters remain stable although individual proteins rapidly exchange between plasma membrane and cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref>. Two pathways for Cdc42 localization have been identified that independently generate cell polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Irazoqui1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref>. One pathway involves targeted exocytosis of membrane-bound Cdc42 along actin cables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Yu1">[7]</xref>, while the other one relies on fast recycling of Cdc42 through the cytosol by the guanine nucleotide dissociation inhibitor (GDI) Rdi1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Slaughter1">[8]</xref>. Constitutively active or inactive Cdc42 cannot polarize without actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref> indicating that the ability of Cdc42 to cycle between its active GTP-bound and inactive GDP-bound state is crucial for actin-independent polarization. Moreover, polarization has been shown to rely on a positive feedback loop of Cdc42-GTP recruiting its activator, the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Cdc24, to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Bose1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Butty1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Irazoqui1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Kozubowski1">[11]</xref>. Although many studies have focused on identifying polarity regulators and their interactions, the fundamental mechanisms responsible for spontaneous polarization still remain controversial. Altschuler and colleagues put forward a conceptual model for yeast polarity establishment relying on a single positive feedback loop of a polarity protein locally enhancing its own membrane attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Altschuler1">[12]</xref>. The model predicts stochastic unstable polarization with reduced polarization efficiency at higher particle numbers where stochastic effects become smaller. This prediction was questioned by experiments showing that expression levels of Cdc42 did not influence polarization efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>. In a more mechanistic approach Goryachev and Pokhilko developed a mathematical model for cell polarization in yeast, including putative molecular interactions for which experimental evidence is lacking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Goryachev1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>. The proposed Turing-type mechanism for GDI-mediated polarization actively produces several macroscopic transient clusters upon polarization that then merge into a single cluster due to competition for limited amounts of proteins. Consistent with this prediction, multiple transient caps could be detected in a small subpopulation of wild-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell1">[13]</xref>. The model of Goryachev and Pokhilko was in subsequent studies extended or readjusted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Savage1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Jose1">[18]</xref>. However, in a recent study we showed that formation of multiple stable polarization clusters depends on actin, and that GDI-mediated polarization rather counteracts the formation of these multiple clusters as long as it generates a single polarization site before actin structures have formed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>. Given these findings it remains unclear at present how the GDI- and actin-dependent polarization mechanisms polarize independently, and how they contribute to the wild-type polarization dynamics. In addition, the role of the cell cycle in polarity regulation and the features of this regulation remain incompletely understood.</p>
<p>The coexistence of two independent polarization pathways with unresolved interactions and unclear polarization dynamics prompted us to investigate the fundamental features of GDI-mediated polarization in more molecular detail, and to address how polarity is established at first. Going beyond our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref> we developed a detailed mechanistic model for the GDI pathway including a full three-dimensional description of the cell geometry as well as all relevant protein species and biochemical reactions, which then enabled us to identify characteristic properties of this polarization mechanism. Our model differs from other previous models in several critical aspects. Importantly, the core feedback underlying cell polarization in our model differs from those used previously, and all reactions and parameters in our mechanistic model are backed up by experiments. The ensuing predictions for the polarization dynamics are fundamentally different to previous models. Our new results provide strong evidence that GDI-mediated polarization is mainly driven by deterministic reaction-diffusion dynamics. The model provides a unified and comprehensive understanding of known mutant phenotypes and predicts several so far unknown phenotypes, which we could verify experimentally. In addition, we identify the enhancement of positive feedback loops in Cdc42 activation and recruitment as the molecular mechanism, which facilitates cell cycle control of GDI-mediated polarization. A detailed analysis of the polarization dynamics as well as systematic parameter variations reveal that GDI-mediated polarization provides precise spatial and temporal control of Cdc42-GTP production. Taken together, our combined theoretical and experimental analysis reveals the fundamental design principles that allow GDI-mediated cell polarization to reliably initiate developmental processes at a specific time and place.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>For our theoretical analysis we first developed a detailed mechanistic model of GDI-mediated polarization. We considered a yeast cell as spherically-shaped cytosolic volume surrounded by a plasma membrane boundary. Proteins were allowed to either attach to the inner face of the plasma membrane or to remain in the soluble cytosolic pool. Cdc42, its GEF Cdc24 and effector Bem1 have been shown to act together to locally amplify the activation and accumulation of Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Bose1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Butty1">[10]</xref>. We therefore explicitly included the concentrations and spatial distributions of these polarity proteins as model variables. We allowed the peripheral membrane proteins Cdc42, Cdc24, and Bem1 to freely diffuse with a diffusion constant of D<sub>2</sub> = 0.03 µm<sup>2</sup>/s on the membrane as measured for Cdc42 and prenylated GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Marco1">[19]</xref>, and with a diffusion constant of D<sub>3</sub> = 11 µm<sup>2</sup>/s in the cytosol as measured for cytosolic GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Slaughter2">[20]</xref>. To estimate the amount of cellular Cdc42 we took into account that GDIs and GTPases form stoichiometric complexes in the cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Ugolev1">[21]</xref>. With an average number of 1650 molecules of the yeast Rho GDI per cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Ghaemmaghami1">[22]</xref> and a cytosolic fraction of Cdc42 of roughly 50% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref> we estimated the total cellular amount of Cdc42 to <italic>N<sub>42</sub></italic> = 3000. Note that previous modeling approaches may have used an unrealistically high estimate of Cdc42 concentration derived from cultured mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Goryachev1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Savage1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Michaelson1">[23]</xref>. We determined the average cell radius for G1-arrested cells used in this study to <italic>R</italic> = 3.95±0.05 µm (n = 63) and used the previously determined protein numbers per cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Ghaemmaghami1">[22]</xref> of Bem1 (<italic>N<sub>B</sub></italic> = 6500) and Cdc24 (<italic>N<sub>24</sub></italic> = 1000).

<p>While Cdc42 is anchored to the membrane via a prenylation site and polybasic region irrespective of the bound nucleotide, extraction by the GDI preferentially occurs for the inactive GDP-bound form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Koch1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Johnson1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>, which we implemented in our model with rate <italic>β<sub>3</sub></italic>. Next we included a set of reactions describing a positive feedback loop recruiting the GEF Cdc24 towards Cdc42-GTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Bose1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Butty1">[10]</xref>. Details of this feedback loop still remain controversial <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Kozubowski1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Li1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Wai1">[27]</xref>. However, Bem1 and p21-activated kinase Cla4 likely contribute to the feedback loop as they interact with Cdc42, Cdc24 and each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Gulli1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Bose1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Wild1">[29]</xref>. Thus one would generically expect the Cdc24 concentration on the membrane to be proportional to the amount of Cdc42-GTP at the respective site. However, a previous modeling approach relied on a Cdc24 distribution with an effectively quadratic dependence on Cdc42-GTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Goryachev1">[15]</xref>, which would result in a more focused Cdc24 distribution compared to Cdc42-GTP on the membrane. Yet, Cdc24 was not found to be more focused compared to Cdc42 or other polarity regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Slaughter1">[8]</xref>. In addition, the model of Goryachev and Pokhilko predicts that increased Cdc42 activity would lead to slower Cdc24 turnover in polarity clusters, which we could also not confirm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>. We therefore implemented the positive feedback loop by including a Bem1-mediated recruitment of Cdc24 towards active Cdc42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g001">Figure 1A</xref>): Cytosolic Bem1 attaches to the membrane with a rate equal to the local Cdc42-GTP concentration times a constant <italic>γ<sub>1</sub></italic>. This reaction effectively describes targeting of Bem1 to the membrane by interaction with Cdc42-GTP or other Cdc42-GTP-bound proteins such as Cla4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Bose1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Butty1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Kozubowski1">[11]</xref> and subsequent binding of Bem1 to the membrane using its PX domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Kozubowski1">[11]</xref>. Cytosolic Cdc24 then binds to membrane-bound Bem1 with a rate <italic>δ<sub>1</sub></italic> and forms a complex on the membrane; this accounts for the observation that Bem1 recruits Cdc24 to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Bose1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Butty1">[10]</xref>, activates it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Shimada1">[30]</xref> and maintains it there <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Toenjes1">[31]</xref>. The corresponding reverse detachment reactions of Bem1 and Cdc24 are included with rates <italic>γ<sub>2</sub></italic> and <italic>δ<sub>2</sub></italic>, respectively, as both proteins rapidly exchange between polarity cluster and cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref>. We implemented hydrolysis of GTP on Cdc42 by GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Zheng1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Stevenson1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Marquitz1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Smith1">[35]</xref> with a constant rate α<sub>3</sub>. Nucleotide-exchange of membrane-bound Cdc42-GDP takes place with a constant intrinsic rate <italic>α<sub>2</sub></italic>, and in addition with a rate proportional to the local concentration of membrane bound Cdc24 times a constant <italic>α<sub>1</sub></italic>, representing GEF-catalyzed nucleotide-exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Zheng1">[32]</xref>. Cytosolic Cdc42-GDP attaches to the membrane with a low constant background rate <italic>β<sub>2</sub></italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Johnson1">[25]</xref>. Moreover, it attaches in GTP-bound form with a rate equal to the local membrane-bound Cdc24 concentration times a constant <italic>β<sub>1</sub></italic>. We included the latter reaction to effectively describe a GEF-mediated displacement of Cdc42 from its GDI Rdi1 and subsequent nucleotide-exchange based on experimental evidence of GEF-mediated displacement of the GTPases Rac1 and Rab from their GDI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Ugolev1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Wu1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>. A competition between GEF and GDI is also supported by the lack of membrane extraction when observing the dominant-negative Cdc42<sup>D57Y</sup> mutant, which is supposed to sequester its GEF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Stowers1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Jung1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>. To conclude, the key mechanism of our model is a Cdc24-mediated positive feedback loop of Cdc42-GTP locally enhancing the activation and recruitment of additional Cdc42. A detailed description of all model reaction rates is given in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section.</p>
<p>Mathematically, the spatio-temporal protein dynamics in the plasma membrane and the cytosol resulting from a combination of all above reactions and protein diffusion can be cast in the form of a set of partial differential equations (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We employed analytical as well as numerical methods to solve these equations and thereby quantitatively determined the polarization efficiency and cluster dynamics for different genetic backgrounds. Importantly, we included a full three-dimensional description of membrane and cytosol to avoid approximations which qualitatively affect our conclusions on the dynamics (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003396.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Stable cell polarization with continuous exchange of proteins</title>
<p>Initially we set out to characterize the properties of control cells. To this end we numerically simulated the protein dynamics starting from an unpolarized state and found that the system was able to efficiently evolve into a polarized steady state. Cdc42, Bem1 and Cdc24 accumulate in a cluster on the plasma membrane while the corresponding cytosolic concentrations remain almost homogeneous due to the rapid cytosolic diffusion similar to previous polarity models (e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Mori1">[39]</xref>). An example for the simulated spatial Cdc42 distribution in control cells is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g001">Figures 1B,C</xref>. Directly below the cluster a volume with slightly reduced cytosolic concentrations is flanked by regions with slightly higher cytosolic concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Both deviations are caused by a continuous exchange of proteins from and into the cluster. A net flux of proteins from the cytosol to the membrane is established at the center of the cluster which is balanced by an opposite flux of proteins at the periphery keeping the total amount of proteins in the cluster constant. Hence, proteins are continuously redistributed to the cluster center to counteract lateral diffusion along the plasma membrane (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) similar to other mass conserved polarity models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Otsuji1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Goryachev1">[15]</xref>.</p>

<title>Polarization initially emerges as a single broad cap which narrows over time</title>
<p>The initial emergence of polarity can be effectively studied in terms of a linear stability analysis of our model. To this end we extended a previously developed approach for systems with protein exchange between membrane and cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Levine1">[41]</xref> to include the spherical symmetry of the cell and the catalyzed membrane attachment of polarity factors. In a linear stability analysis one introduces a small random perturbation to an unpolarized homogenous state of polarity proteins and calculates the time evolution of this protein distribution. Such perturbations represent small concentration fluctuations in protein levels which arise from the Brownian movement of proteins in the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Frey1">[42]</xref>. Growth of the perturbation implies that the unpolarized state is unstable and that an inhomogeneous pattern arises.</p>
<p>For control cells the linear stability analysis predicted that small random perturbations of the unpolarized state grow and directly evolve into a unique polarity cluster (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003396.s001">Figure S1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003396.s008">Text S1</xref>). This was in contrast to the previously made prediction of multiple emerging clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Goryachev1">[15]</xref>. Importantly, the stability analysis also predicted that random perturbations always directly evolve towards a single growing cluster when we modified each individual model parameter over more than two orders of magnitude (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003396.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>In general, two qualitatively different patterns can arise as the growing perturbation reaches a macroscopic size. If the initial perturbation is sufficiently small, the emerging pattern will be determined by the linear stability analysis. Conversely, if the initial perturbation is too large, a random pattern emerges that depends on the initial perturbation. By numerical evaluation of the full polarization dynamics we found that even considerable perturbations with an amplitude of 1% of the corresponding average concentration (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) directly evolved into a single cluster as we varied each model parameter between 1/3 and 3 times its control value. Only for parameter values that were well outside this physiologically relevant range we observed that small perturbations could also evolve into multiple clusters before coalescing into a single polarization site due to competition for limited amounts of proteins similar to previous models (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Otsuji1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Goryachev1">[15]</xref>). An example for formation of multiple caps is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003396.s001">Figure S1B</xref>. In summary, our model predicts that small random perturbations robustly induce the direct formation of a single polarity cluster as opposed to coarsening dynamics.</p>
<p>Given the complex circuitry underlying GDI-mediated polarization we sought to identify characteristic properties of the process which could be verified experimentally. When we examined the temporal evolution of polarization sites in our simulations (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) we could identify two distinct phases. Initially, the random protein distribution was gradually replaced by a single broad cap with exponentially growing amplitude consistent with the prediction from the linear stability analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003396.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). In the second phase, the single broad cluster narrowed until it reached a final steady state distribution. To better quantify the narrowing of the cluster we performed simulations with a faint broad cap as an initial perturbation. A single cluster emerged, which showed the same dynamics and shape as those started from random perturbations, confirming that polarization was robust to considerable changes of the initial conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As expected, only the time to reach the final state did depend on the amplitude of the initial perturbation. The time to polarize was consistent with the polarization delay observed after release in synchronized polarization assays indicating that our model provides polarization on physiologically relevant time scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref>. The numerically obtained cluster shape and growth rate corresponded to the predicted ones from the linear stability analysis (black lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003396.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Nonlinear effects enhanced the growth rate when the cluster reached a threshold size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The time frame where these nonlinear effects are significant coincided with the regime where most of the narrowing of the cluster occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In addition, this was accompanied by most of the absolute increase of the cluster height (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In summary, our model predicts that one characteristic property of direct single site polarization without multiple macroscopic intermediate clusters is the steady narrowing of emerging polarity clusters.</p>

<p>To validate our prediction in experiments, we released a synchronized population of latrunculin B-treated yeast cells expressing GFP-Cdc42 from G1 arrest and compared their cluster widths at early and late time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>). In accordance with our model prediction the clusters were significantly broader shortly after release, compared to the much more focused caps at later points in time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We also directly monitored the establishment of polarity clusters in latrunculin B-treated cells expressing GFP-Cdc42 or Bem1-GFP. Polarity clusters first emerged as single and faint broad caps, which then progressively became narrower and brighter in the time course of several minutes, in agreement with the model prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g002">Figures 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g003">3D–G</xref>). Note that the high contrast of Bem1-GFP caps allowed the observation of very early broad-caped states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g003">Figure 3F,G</xref>) that were not detectable with the weaker Cdc42 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g003">Figure 3D,E</xref>). The vast majority of cells directly developed a unique polarization site. Only in 3.8% of 209 latrunculin B-treated cells expressing GFP-Cdc42 we observed intermediate states with multiple clusters during polarization. Hence, our findings suggest that the observed narrowing of clusters is a characteristic signature for the direct emergence of a unique polarization site. The formation of narrow caps did neither depend on the presence of actin structures nor on the formation of a septin diffusion barrier as they also arise in the absence of septin structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Orlando1">[43]</xref>. Moreover, our findings suggest that the previously described narrowing of caps in untreated wild-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell2">[16]</xref> may arise from the dynamics of the GDI-dependent polarization mechanism.</p>

<p>The two-stage process of GDI-mediated polarization identified above allows yeast cells to directly and robustly generate a unique localized Cdc42-GTP cluster, and provides an efficient mechanism to initiate processes downstream of Cdc42 like actin reorganization at a desired position with a minimum risk of transmitting the signal at wrong or multiple positions. Without the direct formation of a single cluster GDI-mediated polarization would instead actively generate several transient clusters with high Cdc42-GTP concentration, and enhance the risk to initiate irreversible processes such as budding at several places on the membrane. For example, the increased occurrence of transient multiple caps in cells strongly overexpressing Bem1 is accompanied by an occasional formation of multiple buds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell2">[16]</xref>.</p>

<title>Cell cycle induced changes provide temporal control over GDI-mediated polarization</title>
<p>We next asked how changes of system parameters influence GDI-mediated polarization. We focused on parameters, which were experimentally accessible and which directly affected the regulation of Cdc42, such as the rates of GTP hydrolysis and membrane extraction rates of Cdc42 as well as concentrations of Cdc24 and Bem1. Note that we limited our study to moderately increased protein concentrations in order to avoid the generation of unspecific protein-protein interactions that might occur at non-physiological densities.</p>
<p>Our analysis showed that reduced values for any of the chosen parameters prevented polarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Importantly, a distinction can be made with regard to the fold change needed to induce this loss. The polarization efficiency was sensitive to a reduction of Cdc24 or Bem1 expression levels but robust to an increase of both. In contrast, we found that while polarization was sensitive to moderately increased Cdc42 hydrolysis and extraction rates, a high fold reduction of both rates was necessary to cause loss of polarization. These results shed new light on previous observations on polarization of mutants in the absence of actin. Cells expressing non-hydrolysable Cdc42 and cells without the GDI Rdi1 represent limiting cases of cells with low Cdc42 hydrolysis and membrane extraction rates, respectively. As predicted by our model, cells cannot polarize in either case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figures 4A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Slaughter1">[8]</xref>). Moreover, yeast cells without Bem1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref>, with reduced amounts of available Cdc24 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Nern1">[44]</xref>, or overexpressing the GAP Bem3 (increased Cdc42 hydrolysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Knaus1">[45]</xref>) were not able to polarize. To further validate our model we experimentally tested the predicted sensitivity of polarization efficiency to changes in Bem1 expression or Cdc42 membrane extraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In agreement with the model prediction we found polarization efficiency to be sensitive to even small reduction of Bem1 levels, when expressing Bem1 from the weak Cdc24 or Abp140 promoters in latrunculin B-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). In addition, we studied polarization of yeast cells overexpressing the GDI Rdi1 in the presence of latrunculin B. Even moderate overexpression of Rdi1 resulted in reduced polarization efficiency, in line with the prediction of our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Hence, our model provides an accurate description of various mutant phenotypes, which arise from disturbed GDI-mediated polarization.</p>

<p>An important feature emerging from our simulations is the ability of yeast cells to regulate polarization in a switch-like manner when crossing a threshold in Cdc24 concentration or Cdc42 hydrolysis rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). These two parameters are also regulated during the yeast cell cycle: On the one hand, Cdc24 is sequestered in the nucleus in unpolarized G1 cells and released into the cytosol at the G1-S transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Nern1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Shimada2">[46]</xref>. Inhibition of this relocation process leads to inhibition of cell polarization. On the other hand, reduction of Cdc42 hydrolysis at the G1-S transition by phosphorylation of the Cdc42 GAPs Bem2 and Bem3 has been shown to be crucial for polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Knaus1">[45]</xref>. Hence, our results indicate that GDI-mediated polarization is switched on during the cell cycle by a simultaneous increase in GEF concentrations and reduction of the Cdc42 hydrolysis rate. Given these findings, we wanted to better understand the choice of parameters in control cells and the cell cycle-dependent regulation of polarity. In the following sections we therefore studied the features defining polarized and unpolarized states in more detail.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Enhancing the positive feedback loops provides simultaneous switch-like regulation of polarization and Cdc42 activation</title>
<p>To reveal the mechanism for how GDI-dependent polarization is disabled we next investigated the membrane-cytosol ratio of Cdc42 in unpolarized cells for different parameter regimes and asked whether failure to polarize is correlated with loss of active Cdc42 on the cell membrane. Interestingly, we found that the regimes with significant amounts of active Cdc42 overlapped but did not coincide with the polarization regimes identified above (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4C,D</xref>). For hydrolysis rates much lower and GEF concentrations much higher than the control cell values, there were significant amounts of active Cdc42 even in cells which were unable to polarize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In this regime the positive feedback loops were still active but the protein transport to the membrane was too slow to counter lateral diffusion on the plasma membrane, and therefore unable to cause cap formation. Consistent with these results, non-hydrolysable Cdc42 has been shown to accumulate on the plasma membrane but is unable to polarize through the GDI-mediated polarization mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4C</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner1">[5]</xref>). A similar behavior is found for increasing Bem1 concentrations at low extraction rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>These findings stand in contrast to the behavior close to the control cell values at the upper boundary of the polarization regime, where cell cycle induced parameter changes switch cells into an unpolarized state with very low Cdc42-GTP levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4C,D</xref>). To further analyze the cell's properties at this boundary we calculated the final concentration of active Cdc42 for changing Cdc24 expression levels and Cdc42 hydrolysis rates in the vicinity of the control cell values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Our results show that the production of active Cdc42 is almost completely switched off when polarization breaks down. Hence, cell cycle induced changes simultaneously regulate polarity and the ability for Cdc42-GTP production in a switch-like manner. The GDI-mediated polarization mechanism not only allows selecting a spatially restricted region for Cdc42 to initiate further downstream processes, it also controls the transmission of the Cdc42 signal itself. This switch-like response is genuinely different from the response in a hypothetical system without feedback loops. In the latter case, instead of an abrupt change at a threshold, one would expect the amount of active Cdc42 to gradually increase with the activator concentration (and decrease with the hydrolysis rate) over the whole parameter range such that much higher changes of regulators would be necessary to effectively suppress Cdc42 activity in unpolarized cells. To better understand the origin of the observed switch-like behavior we systematically varied several system parameters, which we assumed to be essential for the pattern formation process. We have previously shown that polarity clusters are maintained by continuous redistribution of polarity factors to counteract the lateral membrane diffusion. Therefore, we expected that loss of polarity might be rescued by a change of the diffusion constants. However, for large parts of the parameter regions considered above we found that loss of polarization could not be rescued in this way (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). This indicates that loss of polarization in these regimes depends on the nonlinear dynamics of the protein reaction network itself and not solely on insufficient redistribution of proteins. Notably, the diffusion-insensitive parameter regions also coincided with the loss of almost all Cdc42-GTP on the membrane, compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g004">Figures 4C,D</xref>. Hence, we concluded that in these regimes the positive feedback loops of Cdc42 activation and membrane attachment fail and can therefore no longer locally enhance the accumulation of Cdc42-GTP on the membrane as needed for pattern formation. These results provide a unified mechanistic understanding of several mutants causing loss of polarity: Reduced GEF or Bem1 concentrations or enhanced Cdc42 hydrolysis weaken the positive feedback loops of Cdc42 production on the membrane until they fail to operate.</p>
<p>In summary, the GDI-mediated polarization mechanism provides yeast cells with the ability to establish a polarized Cdc42 cluster at a specific membrane position, and at the same time allows an immediate change into an unpolarized state via a ‘feedback switch’ where Cdc42 signaling is suppressed.</p>

<title>Cell cycle regulated temporal control induces a direct and robust change into highly localized polarization</title>
<p>To shed more light on the consequences of the control cell parameter choice, we studied the final shape of polarity clusters under varying system parameters. Starting from unpolarized cells we numerically calculated the polarization dynamics and subsequently determined the final Cdc42 cluster width for different Cdc24 and Bem1 concentrations as well as different Cdc42 extraction and hydrolysis rates. When we increased Bem1 or Cdc24 concentrations towards control cell values we observed that a narrow final steady state cluster was directly produced as polarization set in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). In contrast, if Cdc42 extraction or hydrolysis rates were increased, polarized steady state clusters were initially very broad and only gradually became narrower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>). However, these narrow final clusters were lost when the rates were increased only slightly beyond the control cell values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Remarkably, the control cell values estimated from experiments were all situated in parameter regions that resulted in almost optimal narrow cluster width (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5A–D</xref>). In summary, we find that the cell cycle dependent concomitant increase of cytosolic Cdc24 and decrease of GAP activity allows yeast cells to directly and robustly switch from an unpolarized state into a highly polarized state, thus ensuring the emergence of a narrow polarity cluster.</p>

<p>One quantitative prediction of our model is that a reduction of the Cdc42 hydrolysis or extraction rates would cause polarity clusters to become less focused compared to the control cell situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>). Cdc42 is then expected to spend more time on the plasma membrane and to diffuse over longer distances before Rdi1 extracts it into the cytosol. Numerical solutions of our mechanistic model show the Cdc42 concentration profile on the plasma membrane expected for different hydrolysis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Very low hydrolysis rates were only able to sustain patterns much larger than a yeast cell and therefore resulted in unpolarized cells. With increasing hydrolysis rates initially broad caps appeared that spanned the whole cell. Upon further increase of hydrolysis caps became progressively narrower until a critical value was reached above which polarization disappeared. To verify the predicted broad clusters at low hydrolysis rates we used a yeast strain where the Cdc42 GAP Bem2 was deleted. We then treated these cells with latrunculin B and compared the width of the formed polar caps with those in similarly treated control cells. As predicted, Δ<italic>bem2</italic> cells formed significantly broader caps with nearly twice the width of those in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). A slightly weaker effect on cap width upon <italic>bem2</italic> deletion was also observed in cells not treated with latrunculin, suggesting that GDI-mediated polarization also contributes to the broadening of caps in the presence of actin-mediated Cdc42 recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). In addition, the G60A mutant of Cdc42, which exhibits intrinsically reduced hydrolysis rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Caviston1">[47]</xref>, also formed broader caps, which is consistent with our prediction on Cdc42 polarization with reduced GTP hydrolysis rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003396-g005">Figure 5G</xref>).</p>
<p>These results show that the cell cycle induced reinforcement of the positive feedback loops enables yeast cells to directly and robustly form a highly localized cluster out of an unpolarized state with only slight changes in parameter values. The finding that reduced hydrolysis broadens polarity clusters suggests that the polarity reaction network is optimized by rapid GTPase cycling to achieve maximally focused polarization. This focusing in turn might help to optimally organize morphogenetic processes downstream of Cdc42, such as actin reorganization or septin ring formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Yu1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Orlando1">[43]</xref>.</p>

The mechanistic model introduced in this work belongs to the class of reaction-diffusion driven pattern-forming systems, and robustly provides direct emergence of a unique polarization site with characteristic narrowing dynamics as confirmed by our experiments. In contrast to our findings, a previous model predicted GDI-mediated polarization via multiple transient competing clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Goryachev1">[15]</xref>. However, such polarization dynamics would increase the risk to accidentally initiate downstream signaling through Cdc42 at several places before competition is finished, e.g. budding at several places on the membrane. Our findings suggest the following function of the GDI-mediated polarization pathway: It directly forms a unique polarization site and thereby counteracts the formation of multiple clusters, which might arise from actin-dependent polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-WedlichSoldner2">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref>, strong particle fluctuations, or due to protein interaction with spatial cues. This does not exclude the occasional emergence of transient multiple clusters at random membrane positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Howell1">[13]</xref>. However, our findings show that the GDI-mediated polarization mechanism itself does not actively form multiple clusters but, in contrast, acts to suppress them and hence reduces the risk of misguided Cdc42 signaling in yeast.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we have shown that enhancement of the positive feedback loops is the key mechanism that initiates polarization. Its characteristic feature is a switch-like change from an unpolarized state to a highly localized polarization site. For example, slight changes in Cdc24 or Bem1 protein concentration are sufficient to directly and robustly induce the formation of a narrow final polarity cluster. The origin of this switch lies in an abruptly gained or lost ability of the positive feedback loops to maintain a state with large amounts of proteins on the membrane, and is not related to the ability to counteract lateral membrane diffusion. In addition, the switch to the polarized state is accompanied by a strong increase of activated Cdc42 levels.</p>
<p>Both release of the GEF Cdc24 from the nucleus and reduction of Cdc42 hydrolysis by phosphorylation of GAPs have been shown to contribute to activation of Cdc42 and subsequent polarity establishment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Knaus1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Shimada2">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Nern1">[44]</xref>. Our results provide strong evidence that these changes are used for temporal control of GDI-mediated cell polarity as both parameter changes can induce polarization by enhancement of the positive feedback loops. Hence, our findings give a mechanistic understanding of how polarity establishment in yeast is regulated by the cell cycle. The GDI-mediated polarization mechanism fulfills a two-fold function. On the one hand, it generates a highly polarized cluster of Cdc42-GTP on the membrane. On the other hand, it is characterized by a strong decrease of active Cdc42 levels in unpolarized cells compared to polarized cells, meaning that Cdc42 is effectively kept inactive independent of the exact choice of hydrolysis rates and GEF concentrations in unpolarized cells. Thereby yeast cells acquire the ability to initiate Cdc42 signaling in a controlled switch-like manner in a spatially confined region of the plasma membrane. This has to be distinguished from other perturbations of the system where a loss of GDI-mediated polarity does not necessarily abolish Cdc42 signaling. For example, within our model we predict that a reduction of the Cdc42 membrane extraction rate (e.g. by deletion of the GDI RDI1) induces a loss of GDI-mediated polarity but still allows the production of significant amounts of active Cdc42 on the plasma membrane. This is reaffirmed by recent experiments with Δ<italic>rdi1</italic> cells which cannot polarize via the GDI-dependent pathway but still produce sufficient amounts of active Cdc42 to trigger polarization via actin structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Slaughter1">[8]</xref>. In light of our findings it would be interesting to determine both Cdc42 activity and GDI-dependent polarity establishment in different mutant yeast strains with high temporal resolution. Cells with active Cdc42 and disturbed GDI-mediated polarization are then expected to be prone to the formation of multiple buds. Our model also predicted that polarity clusters would broaden if the Cdc42 extraction or hydrolysis rates were reduced. Consistently, we found that deletion of the GAP Bem2 led to significant broader clusters in latrunculin-treated cells indicating that the biochemical reaction network is indeed adjusted to robustly provide a narrow final cluster.</p>
<p>By combining all results of our study we find that the following key features characterize the polarization process under physiological conditions: (i) GDI-mediated polarity operates in a parameter regime where polarization is accompanied by a significant fold change in Cdc42-GTP amounts. (ii) The pattern-forming mechanism directly produces a single cluster and not several intermediate clusters which then merge into a single cluster. (iii) Cell cycle induced changes in Cdc42 activation directly lead to the robust formation of a narrow final cluster with only very small changes in Cdc24 concentrations or hydrolysis rates. Our results indicate that under typical physiological conditions in yeast cells all of the listed features enable precise control of Cdc42 signaling with a minimized risk of accidentally initiating further processes downstream of Cdc42 at the wrong time or position.</p>
<p>The precise control of Cdc42 signaling induced by the aforementioned features provides evidence for the GEF-mediated positive feedback loops of Cdc42 activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Butty1">[10]</xref> and membrane attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Ugolev1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Wu1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Freisinger1">[14]</xref> to be the key molecular mechanisms of GDI-mediated cell polarization suggesting a new perspective on how cell polarity can be established with a minimum set of polarity factors. Our modeling approach for spherical cells can also be extended to other geometries to study pattern formation in similar systems as for example for Min-protein oscillations in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Halatek1">[48]</xref>.</p>
<p>Given the high evolutionary conservation of all involved players we expect GDI-mediated polarization throughout the animal kingdom to show a similar behavior as in yeast. The characteristic finding that reducing the hydrolysis of the polarity GTPase broadens polarity clusters in yeast provides an easily testable prediction to identify similar polarity mechanisms in other eukaryotes. As one example, deletion of the Rop (plant Rho GTPase) GAP Ren-1 defocused polarization of GTPase ROP1 in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> pollen tubes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Hwang1">[49]</xref>.</p>

We estimated the hydrolysis and extraction rates α<sub>3</sub> and β<sub>3</sub> to 1s<sup>−1</sup>. To fit our model we used an estimate for the fraction of Cdc42 present in the cluster of 10–20% taken from literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Slaughter1">[8]</xref>. Given that 50–70% of all Cdc42 are found in the inner compartments of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Slaughter1">[8]</xref>, we estimated the amount of Cdc42 on the plasma membrane outside the cluster to be equal to the amount inside the cluster.

<title>Simulations</title>
<p>Simulations were performed using Comsol Multiphysics 3.5a.</p>
<p>To generate random initial perturbations we took a random number from the interval [−1,1] for each site of a cubic lattice in space with a spacing of 1 µm. This lattice was then used to produce a continuous perturbation function f(x,y,z) using Comsol's interpolation routine to define functions from a set of random data points. We assumed that pattern formation in our simulations is initiated by small random perturbations with an amplitude of ∼1% of the corresponding unpolarized protein concentration. The perturbations were generated by multiplying the initial unpolarized concentration of all membrane-bound proteins with (1+0.01*f(x,y,z)). Broad caps as initial perturbations were generated by adding a function with linear dependence on one spatial direction to the unpolarized initial concentration of all membrane-bound proteins assuming that the function changes sign at the center of the cell.</p>

The 488 nm (Coherent Saphire) laser was directed through an AOTF and directly coupled into the iMic. A galvanometer-driven 2-axis scan head was used to adjust the TIRF angle and an additional galvanometer was used to switch between regular fluorescence and TIRF mode. Images were collected with a cooled AndoriXON DU-897 EM CCD camera. Acquisition was controlled by the Live-Acquisition software package. Oblique illumination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003396-Tokunaga1">[51]</xref> was used for time lapse microscopy.
