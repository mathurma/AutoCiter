In a stem cell–niche scenario, sampled methylation patterns are the stochastic outcome of a complex interplay between niche structural features such as the number of stem cells within a niche and the niche succession time, the methylation/demethylation process, and the randomness due to sampling. As a consequence, methylation pattern studies can reveal niche characteristics but also require appropriate statistical methods. The analysis of methylation patterns sampled from colon crypts is a prototype of such a study. Previous analyses were based on forward simulation of the cell content of the whole crypt and subsequent comparisons between simulated and experimental data using a few statistics as a proxy to summarize the data. In this paper we develop a more powerful method to analyze these data based on coalescent modelling and Bayesian inference. Results support a scenario where the colon crypt is maintained by a high number of stem cells; the posterior indicates a number greater than eight and the posterior mode is between 15 and 20. The results also provide further evidence for synergistic effects in the methylation/demethylation process that could for the first time be quantitatively assessed through their long-term consequences such as the coexistence of hypermethylated and hypomethylated patterns in the same colon crypt.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The dynamics of the stem cell populations in human colon crypts are of interest to cancer researchers and stem cell biologists alike. One approach to studying stem cell divisions would be to adopt methods from population genetics: cells are sampled from crypts, DNA markers such as single nucleotide polymorphisms are identified, and a model of how these mutations arose is used to infer aspects of the ancestry of the sample. Because cells within an individual are being studied, mutations of this sort are extremely rare, and an alternative marker has to be used. Methylation patterns provide a feasible alternative, containing information similar to that obtained from short DNA sequences. The present study shows how such data can be used to infer aspects of stem cell dynamics, including inference about the likely number of stem cells in a crypt. In addition, biological aspects of methylation and demethylation are also studied.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>PN and ST were supported in part by US National Institutes of Health (NIH) grant P50 HG02790, and ST by a grant from Cancer Research UK.

Genetic and epigenetic somatic variations having long-term consequences are believed to preferentially affect these cell lineages. Besides its intrinsic interest, understanding the structure of the stem cell populations is therefore expected to help gene therapy, cancer therapy, and aging research. Our knowledge about the adult tissue-specific stem cells is still sparse, but the experimental results accumulated during the past decades on several tissues from a few organisms suggest the existence of stem cell niches [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b002">2</xref>]. Each niche contains a small self-renewing population of proliferating cells, the stem cells, whose progeny commit to differentiation processes that span several rounds of cell division. In some tissues, such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary and testis, cells that enter differentiation processes have been shown to be the result of asymmetric stem cell divisions giving rise to one stem cell and one cell committed to differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b003">3</xref>]. In this context, rare symmetric stem cell division events producing either two cells committed to differentiation or two stem cells may compensate for occasional gain or loss of one stem cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>Cell turnover is particularly fast in the gastrointestinal epithelium where the mature differentiated cells live only a few days. In this epithelium, the self-renewing unit is a small and morphologically well-identified structure known as the intestinal crypt. Probably owing to this relatively simple anatomical structure and its rapid cell turnover, the intestinal epithelium is one of the tissues where the stem cells have been the most studied in mammals. Results have been recently reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b007">7</xref>].</p><p>Each crypt contains about 2,000 cells in Human and exhibits a strong polarity with mature epithelial cells located at the extremity of the crypt opening onto the gastrointestinal tract. Phenotype markers allowing an accurate identification of intestinal stem cells are still lacking, although some progress is being made [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b008">8</xref>]. Staining experiments of cell lineages in mouse using tritiated thymidine show that cells migrate away from the base of the crypt toward the lumen while they differentiate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b010">10</xref>]. The stem cell niche is therefore believed to be located at the base of the colon crypt. In the small intestine, the situation is slightly different as Paneth cells occupy the very base of the crypt (a type of mature differentiated cell absent in the colon crypt) and the stem cell niche is believed to be located just above the Paneth cells.</p><p>Gastrointestinal stem cells have a short cell cycle: they seem to divide daily in the mouse small intestine and may divide about weekly in the human colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b011">11</xref>]. Staining experiments with tritiated thymidine in mouse reveal asymmetric segregation of the DNA between daughter cells during stem cell division: stained template strands are retained through rounds of cell divisions at the likely location of the stem cell niche [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b012">12</xref>]. This suggests that mechanisms reducing the probability of mutations in the stem cell lineages may exist. It also provides strong support for a central role of asymmetric stem cell division in the stability of the intestinal stem cell populations. Experiments with chimeric mice and with mutagen agents have shown that crypts initially polyclonal for one marker eventually become monoclonal, which suggests that symmetric division occasionally occurs and leads to a niche succession by stochastic extinction of stem cell lineages. The time needed for a single stem cell lineage to replace all other lineages, or “clonal stabilization time,” was measured as approximately 24 weeks in the mouse small intestine but only four weeks in the mouse colon. Studies are much harder in human where mutagenesis experiments cannot be undertaken. Making use of radiotherapy-induced mutations, one study suggested that a significant fraction of the somatic mutations in human colon stem cells are lost within one year [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>Most of the insights we have about the number of stem cells in intestinal crypts come from mouse studies where the number of crypts surviving increasing doses of radiation is measured. The underlying hypothesis of these studies is that the number of stem cells can be estimated assuming a simple model for dose-dependent cell death if crypts regenerate, as long as one stem cell survives the treatment. However, the estimated number of stem cells increase from about six to 36 as higher doses of radiation are used. It may be that a cell that would differentiate in a normal context can be recruited to regenerate the crypt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b005">5</xref>], but alternative explanations cannot be ruled out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b014">14</xref>]. This also emphasizes the difficulty of estimating the actual number of stem cells in normal physiological conditions by this approach. Another limitation of this approach is that it cannot be used in humans.</p><p>We recently proposed to investigate the properties of the human intestinal stem cell populations through the analysis of methylation pattern polymorphism that occurs naturally within the crypts in some CpG islands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b016">16</xref>]. Methylation at CpG sites serves as cell lineage markers in these analyses as inheritable methylation changes occur somatically [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b017">17</xref>]. Compared with genetic DNA sequences that are widely used in population studies at the organism level, epigenetic methylation patterns have the advantage of evolving much faster. Even a small number of CpG sites can carry information about the underlying genealogy of cells sampled from closely related lineages. Several aspects of the approach make it particularly attractive: it does not require any treatment that could disturb the normal self-renewal dynamic of the crypt; it provides accurate discrete data richer than binary phenotype polymorphism; and it is practicable in humans.</p><p>Our previous analyses of the methylation pattern polymorphisms were based on forward simulations of the whole crypt content under a simple stem cell–niche model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b016">16</xref>]. Although it provided support for a stem cell–niche model with multiple stem cell lineages whose genealogy shows coalescent events leading to stochastic niche succession during life, this approach allows only rather crude estimate of the model parameters. In particular, it did not give us an estimate of the number of stem cells. This study further analyzes these data in light of the simple stem cell–niche model using a more sophisticated methodological framework. We present a full probabilistic model of the methylation patterns sampled from a crypt together with a Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) algorithm allowing Bayesian inference of its parameters that include the number of stem cells, the depth of the genealogical tree (niche succession time), and the rate of the methylation/demethylation process. The fit of the model is assessed by comparing the observed values of several statistics summarizing the data with their posterior distribution under the model. We compare the estimates of the model parameters in either an unconstrained model or a model with short niche succession time.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Polymorphic Methylation Patterns within the Crypts</title><p>In this study, we analyze methylation at nine CpG sites in a 77-bp locus within a CpG island upstream of the human biglycan (BGN) gene on chromosome X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b015">15</xref>].

The 24-pattern data are new, and correspond to the sequences of between 20 and 24 methylation patterns for another 20 crypts sampled from three patients (one patient is common to both the eight-pattern and 24-pattern datasets).

We propose a probabilistic model of the observed polymorphism in terms of biologically meaningful parameters that govern both the shape of this genealogy and the methylation process. Events taking place in stem cell lineages are believed to play a crucial role in the generation of the observed patterns, and we first present how the model accounts for the genealogy of those lineages along with their methylation process. We next explain how the model relates the sampled patterns to the patterns of the stem cell lineages.</p><p>The shape of the stem cell genealogy is described by two parameters, <italic>N</italic> and τ. <italic>N</italic> is the number of stem cells in a crypt and τ corresponds approximately to the average number of years before niche succession within a crypt. Formally, τ/2 is the average waiting time for the coalescence of a pair of lineages, whereas, from a biological point of view, τ/(<italic>N</italic>−1) is the average lifespan of a stem cell.</p><p>Methylation and demethylation in the stem cell genealogy is modelled as a point process whose rates ν are expressed in terms of expected number of events per CpG site in time τ (before niche succession time). In agreement with experimental observations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b015">15</xref>], CpG sites at the BGN locus are modelled as initially unmethylated at the birth of the patient. Two models were compared for the somatic methylation/demethylation process. In a first model, we distinguish methylation and demethylation rates, but sites are independent. In a second, more complicated, model we allow for interactions between sites through rates that depend on the current level of methylation of the locus. We later refer to this model as the <italic>context-dependent model</italic>.</p><p>Sampled methylation patterns are related to those found in the stem cell lineages through three parameters, <italic>g,</italic> α, and ɛ. The parameter <italic>g</italic> can be interpreted as the number of cell cycles of the cell differentiation process. It describes the shape of the genealogy of cells sampled from the progeny of the same stem cell (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030028-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Higher values of <italic>g</italic> correspond to genealogies that tend to have longer terminal branches (and so are more star-like). The parameter α reflects the ratio between the amount of methylation and demethylation in a cell lineage during the cell differentiation process and in a stem cell lineage in time τ. More precisely, α = η/ν, where η is expressed in terms of the expected number of events in a single lineage during the few cell divisions of the differentiation process. The parameter ɛ corresponds to the rate of sequencing error per site per sequence.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030028-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030028.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Modelling Differentiation Lineages</title><p>(Upper panel) Shows the genealogical structure of a crypt subpopulation made of the progeny of the same stem cell.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b018">18</xref>] served to assess the model adequacy. It consists in checking, through a set of statistics, the extent of the discrepancies between the data and datasets simulated with the model using parameters sampled from their posterior. Here data are summarized by the intercrypt average and standard deviation of five within-crypt statistics. These summary statistics are the number of distinct patterns, the number of polymorphic sites, the average pairwise distance between patterns (the average number of sites with distinct methylation status between pairs of patterns), the number of entirely unmethylated patterns, and the number of singletons (those patterns that appear only once in the crypt).</p><p>Expected distributions and empirical values of the five statistics are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030028-g003">Figure 3</xref>. The fit of the model with context-dependent methylation rate is much better than the fit of the model with independent sites. This can be seen for instance in the average and standard deviation of the number of distinct patterns per crypt; in the standard deviation of the average distance between patterns of the same crypt; or in the average number of unmethylated patterns.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030028-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030028.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Assessment of Model Fitness</title><p>(Left) Model with independent sites.

Statistics that fall within their expected distributions indicate good fit of the model for the particular characteristics of the data measured by those statistics. The blue dashed lines show values computed for the eight-pattern-s (37 crypts) dataset, whereas black solid lines correspond to computations for the 24-pattern dataset (left and middle: 20 crypts; right: 13 crypts).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030028.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>However, the model with a context-dependent methylation rate still shows some lack of fit. In particular, intercrypt variation in the number of singletons is higher than expected for the 24-pattern datasets. A detailed patient-by-patient analysis of the summary statistics (Table S1.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>) reveals that this discrepancy may be explained by variability between patients: the observed intercrypt average of the number of singletons by patient falls above the upper limit 99% confidence interval of its expected distribution for patient X (4.0 singletons in average) and appears just at the lower limit of the 95% interval for patient X (0.86 singletons in average) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030028-g001">Figure 1</xref> for visual inspection).</p><p>This observation encouraged us to ignore data from patient X. The results then show a remarkable match between observed and simulated values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030028-g003">Figure 3</xref>, right, and Table S1.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Such fit could not be achieved by exclusion of either patient Y or M (Table S1.2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>). Besides, data from patient X were found to shift the posterior of number of stem cells to higher values of <italic>N,</italic> probably due to the high number of singletons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030028-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The consequences of excluding either patient Y or patient M on the posterior of <italic>N</italic> were also explored (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sg001">Figure S1</xref>.1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>), and patient X was found to impact the most on the posterior of <italic>N</italic>. Ignoring patient X actually softens our conclusions on the number of stem cells and can therefore be regarded as a conservative choice which further illustrates the relevance of a careful assessment of the model fit. We were also able to show that enhanced rates of methylation/demethylation are a possible hypothesis to explain the data from patient X (Figure S1.2 and Table S1.3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd001">Protocol S1</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030028-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030028.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption><title>The Impact of Data from Patient X on the Posterior of <italic>N</italic></title><p>Comparison between posterior of <italic>N</italic> obtained with (dashed line) and without data from patient X (solid line).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030028.g004" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Posterior Suggests Many Stem Cells and Long Niche Succession Time</title><p>The marginal posterior of each parameter of the model with context-dependent methylation rate obtained after removing data from patient X is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030028-g005">Figure 5</xref> (<italic>N</italic> and ν) and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030028-g006">Figure 6</xref> (τ, <italic>g</italic>, α, and ɛ).

Parameter ν reveals synergistic methylation/demethylation across the sites of the BGN locus. The methylation rate is found to be highly dependent on the number of already methylated sites. The rate is very low when no sites are methylated and shows a more than fivefold increase when one site is already methylated (the median of ν moves from 0.05 to 0.35 methylation events per site in time τ). It is then relatively constant up to seven methylated sites and then increases again. In contrast, demethylation dynamics does not seem to depend on the current level of methylation. The posterior distribution of the parameter α suggests that methylation/demethylation events during cell differentiation contribute little to the observed polymorphism: its density decreases sharply between zero and 0.04, where it becomes negligible. Finally, the posterior distribution of ɛ indicates that sequencing errors are extremely rare (rate smaller than 0.004 and more likely between zero and 0.002).</p><p>It is worth emphasizing the overall coherence of the picture that emerges of this posterior inference: the genealogical trees of the stem cell lineages up to their most recent common ancestor are rather deep (high τ), and most methylation/demethylation events occur in those lineages (small α). Furthermore, the value of α seems compatible with the same probability of methylation/demethylation events per cell cycle during differentiation and in the stem cell lineages. A value of τ of about 20 years suggests about 1,000 rounds of cell divisions in the stem cell lineages before these lineages find their most recent common ancestor (stem cells are thought to divide about weekly in the human colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b011">11</xref>]), whereas the number of rounds of cell divisions during differentiation is certainly smaller than ten.

A relatively high value of α is particularly realistic in a scenario with short niche succession time (small τ). As an illustration, we investigate here what could be the consequence of a niche succession time of about one year (τ = 1).

In a stem cell–niche scenario, sampled methylation patterns are the stochastic outcomes of a complex interplay between niche structural features such as the number of stem cells within a niche and the niche succession time, the methylation/demethylation process, and the randomness due to the sampling. As a consequence, methylation pattern studies can reveal niche characteristics but also require appropriate statistical methods. The analysis of methylation patterns sampled from colon crypts is a prototype of such a study. Previous analyzes were based on forward simulations of the whole cell content of the crypt and subsequent comparisons between simulated and experimental data using a few statistics as a proxy to summarize the data (number of distinct patterns per crypt, average methylation, and intracrypt distance). In this paper we develop an alternative inference framework based on likelihood computations that make full use of the data rather than making use of the values of a few summary statistics.</p><p>Our assumptions about the biological mechanisms underlying the methylation patterns we observe are essentially the same as in previous works but we reformulate the model backward in time as a coalescent process. Coalescent modelling is a starting point for carrying out likelihood inference that makes use of the full data. It is also interesting by itself as it permits direct simulations of the small part of the whole crypt history that is relevant for explaining observed samples of methylation patterns, the history of the sampled cell lineages.</p><p>We developed an MCMC algorithm that allows inference of all the parameters of the model. It is worth emphasizing that the inference relies on a number of model assumptions that we can summarize in four points: (1) the stochastic process generating the methylation pattern we sample is the same in all crypts, except for the age of the crypts, which differ among patients; (2) the number of stem cells is stable and the loss of a stem cell is compensated by the symmetric division of one of the other stem cells. This justifies modelling the stem cell genealogy as a simple coalescent process (this supposes, for instance, that stem cell losses are not compensated by new stem cells originating from another layer of stem cells); (3) the genealogy of differentiation is star-like when branch lengths are measured through the accumulation of methylation/demethylation events; (4) appropriate modelling of methylation/demethylation can be achieved using a simple continuous-time point process across lineages.</p><p>These assumptions are intended to be as reasonable as possible, and the demonstration that the data are compatible with this simple model is one merit of this work. Careful assessment of the model fit, nevertheless, revealed the need for partial relaxation of hypotheses (1) and (4). Data from patient X were ignored owing to too high a number of singletons, and a context-dependent model allowing methylation and demethylation rates to vary with the number of already methylated sites was introduced. In the future, additional data may reveal the need for further refinement of the model, and we can envision modelling parameter variation across crypts and patients or introducing distinct parameters for the methylation processes in stem cell and differentiation lineages.</p><p>The need for a context-dependent model of the methylation process brings another piece of evidence for synergistic methylation processes that are also supported by a number of experimental studies. However, this seems to be the first study that directly assesses those effects on the basis of their long-term consequences such as the transition between hypomethylated and hypermethylated sequences that translate into the coexistence of both types of sequences within the crypt. These effects are likely to rely on interactions between maintenance methyl-transferase (Dnmt1) and de-novo methyl-transferase (Dnmt3a/b). It is believed that de-novo methylation by Dnmt3a/b (de-novo methyl-transferase) is stimulated by Dnmt1 (maintenance methyl-transferase) acting to maintain the methylation status through the methylation of the newly synthesized DNA strand at hemimethylated sites after replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b023">23</xref>]. This mechanism could explain the increase in the rate of methylation while the rate of demethylation remains stable.</p><p>Development of models that can effectively account for both dependencies between sites and variation in methylation/demethylation rates across CpG sites will be an interesting challenge. Our results show that the average distance between patterns and the number of distinct patterns unambiguously call for context-dependent effects. These statistics are known to be important indicators of the effective population size in population genetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b025">25</xref>]. However, examination of the level of methylation at each site of the BGN locus suggests the existence of some differences between sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b015">15</xref>].</p><p>The main challenge in the estimation of the number of stem cells from methylation patterns is to distinguish polymorphism due to methylation/demethylation events in stem-cell lineages and the polymorphism due to events during cell differentiation. The framework proposed here allows us to address this issue in a quantitative manner. The results suggest that the methylation changes in differentiation lineages are rare while the number of stem cells is higher than eight and reaches its posterior mode between 15 and 20. The small contribution of the events taking place in differentiation lineages to the diversity of methylation patterns is coherent with our estimate of a relatively long niche succession time of more than 15 years. This “high <italic>N</italic>–high τ” scenario can account for the rapid decline in the number of partially mutant crypts reported by Campbell et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b013">13</xref>], as it is compatible with a short life of individual stem cells (average τ/(<italic>N</italic>−1)). The almost negligible amount of methylation events in the few cell divisions of the differentiation process is also in agreement with small rates of methylation/demethylation experimentally measured in some human cell lineages around 0.001 change/site/generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b028">28</xref>], but contrasts with the high rates found in other lineages or other loci where errors in the replication of the methylation pattern attain 0.01 to 0.15 change/site/generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b030">30</xref>]. Changes are believed to occur when sites are hemimethylated at the time of DNA replication after either de novo or incomplete maintenance methylation. In the future, experimental assessment of the frequency of those hemimethylated sites by double-strand DNA methylation pattern sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b028">28</xref>] in cells sampled from the crypt may help to further calibrate the amount of methylation changes in the differentiation lineages.</p><p>Sequence redundancy artifacts caused by bisulfite treatment and PCR amplification have been detected in the context of bisulfite sequencing, although in a distinct experimental setting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b031">31</xref>]. In this study we limited our analysis to a short 77-bp locus, sampled a relatively small number of times (fewer than 24) compared with the number of copies available from the biological sample (more than 1,000), and amplified in four independent PCRs. All these precautions certainly decrease the chances of artifacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b033">33</xref>]. In addition, we have previously reported pattern redundancy at the BGN locus between samples from both parts of bisected crypts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b015">15</xref>], and this suggests that a substantial fraction of the pattern redundancy reported here reflects genuine biological redundancy. Finally, our main biological conclusions are probably robust against limited sequence redundancy artifacts. Little is known about those artifacts, but intuitively we think they are more likely to decrease than to increase the apparent number of stem cells, and they can hardly be invoked in place of synergistic methylation to explain the coexistence within the same crypts of a substantial proportion of fully unmethylated patterns and a diversity of related methylation patterns. We nevertheless acknowledge the need for better verified data; molecular barcoding will be the method of choice for this purpose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b031">31</xref>].</p><p>The inference framework proposed in this study will be an invaluable tool to address questions related to the design of future experiments. We could, for instance, wonder whether it will be better to assess more cells or to get higher resolution in the description of the cell lineages by sequencing more CpG sites. As sequencing longer patterns could prove technically hard, an intermediate route could consist in sequencing additional loci sampled from the same crypt but from independent cells. Our approach could rather easily be extended to handle this kind of multilocus data as well as diploid locus data. We also envision the development of less computationally demanding inference methods based on summary statistics, for which our work provides both a simulation tool and a benchmark.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Colonic assays.</title><p>Individual crypts were isolated from fresh colectomy specimens, and, after extracting the crypt DNA content, unmethylated cytosines were converted into uracil by bisulfite treatment.

A stem cell is said to die if it gives birth to two cells committed to differentiation. The death of one stem cell is assumed to be instantly compensated by a symmetric division of one of the remaining stem cells (chosen at random) that produces two stem cells. We model the lifespan of a stem cell as an exponential random variable with rate γ (mean 1/γ). Under these assumptions, when looking backward in time the stem cell genealogy follows a particular coalescent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b034">34</xref>], a version of the Moran model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b035">35</xref>].

In a first simple model, we assume that every CpG site evolves independently at the same constant rate. Such a model has two parameters μ = (μ<sub>+</sub>,μ<sub>−</sub>), where μ<sub>+</sub> is the rate of methylation per site and μ<sub>−</sub> is the rate of demethylation per site.</p><p>We also introduce a second, more sophisticated, model that accounts for context-dependent effects on the evolution rate. In this model, the rate of methylation and demethylation is allowed to vary with the number of already methylated sites. To avoid introducing a number of parameters as large as twice the number of CpG sites, we consider only four sets of methylation/demethylation rates that apply on four distinct ranges of numbers of methylated sites. Range boundaries will be estimated. In the general case, the use of models where sites do not evolve independently requires prohibitively heavy computation. However, when all sites are supposed to evolve according to the same model, we show how to take advantage of the model symmetry to considerably speed up the computations (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd002">Protocol S2</xref>, section 1, “Calculations in the context-dependent model”).

The timescale of this process is expressed in arbitrary units that we do not try to compare with the timescale of the genealogy of the stem cell lineages. Rather, the methylation/demethylation process across the branches of this genealogy has its own rate denoted η = (η<sub>+</sub>,η<sub>−</sub>) that is proportional to μ = (μ<sub>+</sub>,μ<sub>−</sub>), the rate of the methylation/demethylation process in the stem cell lineages.

The Bayesian statistical framework provides a straightforward approach to account for this uncertainty by allowing us to compute the posterior distribution of the parameters given the available data. However, the choices of a parametrization and a prior distribution of the parameters are important issues in the Bayesian context. Without reliable a priori information, it is natural to look for an uninformative prior. To our knowledge, current Bayesian methodology provides few guidelines that may be useful in the context of our study. The approach we decided to adopt consists of finding a parametrization that minimizes the dependencies between the parameters according to the posterior distribution. Several motivations justify this approach: it makes reasonable the use of independent priors for each parameter, it facilitates the interpretation of the posteriors, and it helps in designing efficient MCMC algorithms to explore the posterior.</p><p>We chose a uniform distribution for the number of stem cells, <italic>N,</italic> which is the primary focus of our interest. <italic>N</italic> is also the only parameter that impacts on <italic>M,</italic> the random number of stem cell lineages sampled in a particular crypt.</p><p>The speed of the coalescent process modelling the stem cells genealogy is a function of the ratio γ/(<italic>N−</italic>1). We denote the inverse of this ratio by τ = (<italic>N−</italic>1)/γ, which corresponds approximately to the expected number of years before the entire stem cell population finds a common ancestor (without considering the truncating effect of the birth on this coalescent), and chose a uniform prior on (0.5,200) for it. This seems a better choice than direct modelling of γ, the expected lifespan of a stem cell, as when <italic>n</italic> is small enough compared with <italic>N</italic> then <italic>M</italic> is equal or close to <italic>n</italic> and the only effects we observe are those of the ratio γ/(<italic>N</italic>−1). Under these conditions, the posterior distribution of γ (but not τ) will be highly correlated with that of <italic>N</italic>. The parameter <italic>g</italic> that accounts for the star-likeness of the genealogy of the cells sampled from the progeny of the same stem cell was chosen from a uniform density on the interval (5,10).</p><p>Concerning the methylation process, it is worth mentioning that the rate of the coalescent and the overall speed of the methylation process are distinguishable only if the methylation pattern in the most recent common ancestor of the stem cell population does not follow the stationary distribution of the methylation process. When the stationary distribution of the methylation process is reached in this ancestor, the data carry information only about the relative speed of the methylation compared with the depth of the genealogical tree (μτ). As a consequence, μ and τ can be highly correlated under their joint posterior while ν = μτ and τ would be relatively independent. We therefore preferred a prior that models ν independent of τ rather than μ independent of τ. Looking for an uninformative prior on ν, we chose a log-normal distribution such that log(ν<sc>)</sc> is normally distributed with mean zero and standard deviation σ. The potential difficulty of the choice of σ was bypassed by modelling σ as an exponential random variable with mean one (a strategy known as hyper-prior modelling). The rate η of the methylation process relative to the arbitrary timescale of the genealogy of the differentiation lineages was chosen as η = αν where α follows an exponential distribution with mean one. The parameter α corresponds to the relative amount of methylation/demethylation events taking place before a sampled cell finds its stem cell ancestor, compared with the number of events occurring in the lineage of this stem cell up to the most recent common stem cell ancestor.</p><p>Finally, we modelled the probability of sequencing errors, ɛ, as a continuous uniform on (0,1).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>MCMC algorithm and software.</title><p>The posterior distribution of the parameters has been investigated using an MCMC algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b037">37</xref>]. Denoting <bold><italic>X</italic></bold> the observed methylation patterns, the purpose of the algorithm is to sample from the joint posterior distribution of the parameters θ = (<italic>N</italic>,τ,<italic>g</italic>,σ,ν,α,ɛ) given <bold><italic>X</italic></bold> (we use bold fonts to emphasize where there is a random variable per crypt analyzed). An MCMC algorithm creates a sample of dependent realizations from the target distribution by updating in turn the components of θ, each update preserving the target distribution. For practical reasons, the MCMC algorithm samples an augmented space much larger than θ. It consists of (θ,Λ,<bold><italic>Y</italic></bold>), where Λ denotes the genealogies of the methylation patterns (topology and coalescent times) and <bold><italic>Y</italic></bold> stands for the methylation patterns in the nodes of Λ.</p><p>Updating <italic>N</italic> in our model is difficult and we propose an original strategy to solve the problem. As explained in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd002">Protocol S2</xref> (section 3, “A slightly modified model for the number of stem cells”), our approach consists of embedding our model in a slightly more general model that allows <italic>N</italic> to differ by one between crypts. Another challenging task of the algorithm is to explore the huge space of possible genealogies Λ. This is performed efficiently using the “branch-swapping” strategy introduced by Wilson and Balding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030028-b038">38</xref>]. In this scheme, the sequences <bold><italic>Y</italic></bold> at the nodes of Λ serve to propose relevant modifications of the genealogy. Further details of the algorithm are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030028-sd002">Protocol S2</xref> (section 4, MCMC algorithm).</p><p>We obtained all the results presented here by running the algorithm for 5,000,000 iterations and recording (<italic>N</italic>,τ,<italic>g</italic>,ν,σ,α,ɛ,Λ,<bold><italic>Y</italic></bold>) every 100 iterations once past the first 500,000 iterations.
