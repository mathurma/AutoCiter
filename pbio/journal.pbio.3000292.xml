<abstract>
<p>Despite the broad-spectrum antimicrobial activities of silver, its internal usage is restricted, owing to the toxicity. Strategies to enhance its efficacy are highly desirable but rely heavily on the understanding of its molecular mechanism of action. However, up to now, no direct silver-targeting proteins have been mined at a proteome-wide scale, which hinders systemic studies on the biological pathways interrupted by silver. Herein, we build up a unique system, namely liquid chromatography gel electrophoresis inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LC-GE-ICP-MS), allowing 34 proteins directly bound by silver ions to be identified in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>. By using integrated omic approaches, including metalloproteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and systemic biology, we delineated the first dynamic antimicrobial actions of silver (Ag<sup>+</sup>) in <italic>E. coli</italic>, i.e., it primarily damages multiple enzymes in glycolysis and tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle, leading to the stalling of the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle and an adaptive metabolic divergence to the reductive glyoxylate pathway. It then further damages the adaptive glyoxylate pathway and suppresses the cellular oxidative stress responses, causing systemic damages and death of the bacterium. To harness these novel findings, we coadministrated metabolites involved in the Krebs cycles with Ag<sup>+</sup> and found that they can significantly potentiate the efficacy of silver both in vitro and in an animal model. Our study reveals the comprehensive and dynamic mechanisms of Ag<sup>+</sup> toxicity in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells and offers a novel and general approach for deciphering molecular mechanisms of metallodrugs in various pathogens and cells to facilitate the development of new therapeutics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Silver compounds have been historically used for the treatment of burns, ulcerations, and infected wounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref002">2</xref>]. Silver (Ag) and silver nanoparticles (AgNPs) are nowadays widely used in healthcare, food industry, hard surface materials, and textiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref003">3</xref>]. In particular, silver nitrate (AgNO<sub>3</sub>) has been recently demonstrated to boost antibiotic efficacy against gram-negative bacteria and restore susceptibility of a resistant bacterial strain to antibiotics in animal models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref004">4</xref>]. This has aroused great interests for reuse of metal-based antimicrobials to cope with current crisis of antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref008">8</xref>], which has put public health at an enormous risk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref009">9</xref>]. However, the toxicity of silver is the main concern for its internal usage. Identification of molecular targets of silver could allow deeper understanding of its molecular mechanism of action, which in-turn extends its therapeutic applications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref010">10</xref>].</p>
<p>Enormous efforts have been made toward understanding the molecular mechanism of action of silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref014">14</xref>]. Most studies, however, were hypothesis driven, as no direct binding targets of silver could be uncovered systematically. Such studies also failed to provide a global view on the mode of action of silver. Although proteins and enzymes have long been believed as potential targets of the antimicrobial activity of silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref010">10</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref015">15</xref>], proteome-wide identification of such targets have not been achieved until now, owing to technical challenges. Quantitative proteomics only allows profiling up- and down-regulated proteins induced by silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref018">18</xref>], which might not serve as direct targets of silver. Several approaches, e.g., laser ablation inductively coupled plasma mass spectrometry (LA-ICP-MS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref019">19</xref>], synchrotron X-ray fluorescence spectrometry (SXFS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref020">20</xref>], and liquid chromatography (LC) combined with ICP-MS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref022">22</xref>] have been applied to detect metal-associated proteins in gels/tissues or explore unknown metalloproteomes in microbes. However, these methods suffer from either limited sensitivity or accessibility of the facility, which restrains extensive exploration of direct silver-targeting proteins in bacteria.</p>
<p>To depict a complete cellular response of an organism exposed to drugs, integration of multiple-omics approaches is necessary. As a complementary technique to transcriptomics and proteomics, metabolomics has been widely used to explore the cellular response of an organism toward stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref025">25</xref>]. Metabolomics involves identification, quantification, and comparison of the metabolome, the total repertoire of small molecules in different biological systems, thereby allowing delineation of the overall dynamic metabolic alterations associated with drug exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref025">25</xref>]. Metabolic response is a strategy, by which host mounts to attenuate the alterations from the internal or external environment. The responsive metabolites can be used to reprogram the metabolome, leading to a targeted metabolic strategy to adapt or suppress such alterations, namely, reprogramming metabolomics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref025">25</xref>]. Metabolome reprogramming represents a novel and pivotal strategy to enhance the therapeutic effects of antibiotics in recent years [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref029">29</xref>].</p>

<title>Development of LC-GE-ICP-MS</title>
<p>We have previously developed a continuous-flow gel electrophoresis hyphenated with ICP-MS (GE-ICP-MS), allowing simultaneous separation and detection of bismuth and its associated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref031">31</xref>]. However, the approach is limited by rather poor separation resolution, owing to the fact that only 1D gel column was used. Herein, we advance the approach by combining LC with GE-ICP-MS (LC-GE-ICP-MS), thereby proteins could be finely separated by LC and GE according to the differences on isoelectric points (pIs) and molecular weights (MWs), respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s003">S1 Fig</xref>). Using this approach, major Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins in the model microorganism <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> treated with AgNO<sub>3</sub> were separated, identified, and validated. With a sensitivity for detection of Ag<sup>+</sup> bound to proteins at the picomole level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s004">S2A and S2B Fig</xref>), the LC-GE-ICP-MS enabled the MWs, pIs of proteins, as well as silver contents contained in proteins to be mapped out simultaneously with high resolution.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether LC-GE-ICP-MS could achieve better resolution for protein separation than GE-ICP-MS, five proteins with distinct pIs and MWs were labeled with iodine (<sup>127</sup>I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref032">32</xref>] and examined by both systems. Three metal-bound proteins, i.e., platinum-bound lysozyme (Pt-LZM), ruthenium-bound carbonic anhydrase (Ru-CA), and indium-bound transferrin (In-TF), were used as internal standards to calibrate the MWs of <sup>127</sup>I-labeled proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Certain overlaps between proteins with similar MWs were observed in the analysis by GE-ICP-MS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), while the peaks corresponding to the <sup>127</sup>I-labeled proteins were clearly and finely separated in the 3D graph of the LC-GE-ICP-MS analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), verifying the enhanced resolution of protein separation by this method.</p>

<title>Mapping silver proteome in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic></title>
<p>To explore the direct Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, we first evaluated the bactericidal activity of AgNO<sub>3</sub> against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in the Luria-Bertani (LB) medium and found 4 μg/ml as a sublethal concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Time-dependent uptake study showed that silver was up-taken rapidly in 5 mins, and the intracellular concentration of silver increased up to 1 h of exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), consistent with previous studies that Ag<sup>+</sup> infiltrates the interior of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> shortly and interacts with cytoplasm primarily [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref034">34</xref>]. We then measured the distribution of silver in different cellular components of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Accumulated silver was mainly distributed in proteins compared to that in nucleic acids (approximately 15%) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref035">35</xref>], with 39.2% ± 4.4% and 25.9% ± 3.6% in soluble and membrane proteins, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1E</xref>), whereas around 5-fold higher Ag/protein ratio was found in the membrane protein fraction than in the soluble protein fraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>
<p>The signals of <sup>107</sup>Ag peaks in 1D GE-ICP-MS increased with treatment time of silver up to 1 h when same amounts of extracted protein samples from both fractions (soluble and membrane proteins) were analyzed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s005">S3A Fig</xref>). We then applied LC-GE-ICP-MS to explore Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cytosol. As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1G</xref>, we detected 28 <sup>107</sup>Ag peaks corresponding to Ag<sup>+</sup>-associated proteins, mainly with MWs less than 50 kDa and pIs lower than 6.5. The protein eluates corresponding to each of the peaks were further fractionized, collected, and subjected to identification via peptide mass fingerprinting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s030">S13 Table</xref>) after separation by 1D slab-gel electrophoresis. As the first dimensional separation is based on pI, proteins with similar or identical MWs but different pIs were well separated by LC-GE-ICP-MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s020">S3B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s019">S2 Table</xref>), such as GrcA (MW 14.3 kDa, pI 5.1) and ZraP (MW 15.2 kDa, pI 9.2); FabA (MW 19.1 kDa, pI 6.1) and RplF (MW 18.9 kDa, pI 9.7); Ppa (MW 19.8 kDa, pI 5.0) and RplE (MW 20.3 kDa, pI 9.5); RplD (MW 22.1 kDa, pI 9.8) and GrxB (MW 22.3 kDa, pI 6.3); RplB (MW 29.9 kDa, pI 10.9), Tsf (MW 30.5 kDa, pI 5.2), and SucD (MW 30.0 kDa, pI 6.1). Likewise, proteins with similar pIs but different MWs were well separated by the column GE system in the second dimension as well. Compared with the 1D GE-ICP-MS, by which only about 10 peaks were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s005">S3A Fig</xref>), the LC-GE-ICP-MS achieved higher resolution for protein separation. Moreover, proteins with relatively low abundance could be enriched during the first dimensional separation by LC, allowing these proteins to be subsequently detected by GE-ICP-MS. Thus, our newly established LC-GE-ICP-MS exhibits the advantages of enhanced resolution and pre-enrichment capability. For the membrane proteins, five Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins were resolved by 1D GE-ICP-MS (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s005">S3A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s019">S2 Table</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s031">S14 Table</xref>). For <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> without treatment of AgNO<sub>3</sub>, no silver peak was observed in the GE-ICP-MS profiles for both soluble and membrane proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s005">S3C and S3D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Among the 34 identified proteins, only GrxB (PDB, 2MZC) and TnaA have been implicated to be bound by silver ions or nano-silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref036">36</xref>], the rest proteins are newly identified binding targets. To verify whether LC-GE-ICP-MS could precisely track Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins, we extracted soluble proteins from gene knockout strains (Δ<italic>zraP</italic>, Δ<italic>sucD</italic>, Δ<italic>mdh</italic>, Δ<italic>icd</italic>, Δ<italic>aceB</italic>, and Δ<italic>sodA</italic>) after treatment with AgNO<sub>3</sub> and examined whether the signals of Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins in the corresponding MW window were still present. The results showed that the peaks corresponding to Ag<sup>+</sup>–Zrap, Ag<sup>+</sup>–SucD, Ag<sup>+</sup>–Mdh, Ag<sup>+</sup>–Icd, Ag<sup>+</sup>–AceB, and Ag<sup>+</sup>–SodA disappeared (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). When we introduced plasmids containing the wild-type (WT) <italic>zrap</italic>, <italic>sucD</italic>, <italic>mdh</italic>, <italic>icd</italic>, <italic>aceB</italic>, and <italic>sodA</italic> into Δ<italic>zraP</italic>, Δ<italic>sucD</italic>, Δ<italic>mdh</italic>, Δ<italic>icd</italic>, Δ<italic>aceB</italic>, and Δ<italic>sodA</italic> mutants, respectively, the signals of Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins in the corresponding MW window appeared again (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4E and S4F Fig</xref>). In contrast, no peak was observed at the corresponding MW window when the mutant plasmids containing <italic>zrap</italic><sup>CS</sup>, <italic>mdh</italic><sup>3CS</sup>, and <italic>icd</italic><sup>6CS</sup> (cysteine to serine) were transformed into corresponding gene knockout strains of Δ<italic>zraP</italic>, Δ<italic>mdh</italic>, and Δ<italic>icd</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>), confirming that mutation of silver-binding residues abolished silver-binding capability of these proteins <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we overexpressed and purified three proteins (Zrap, Mdh, and GapA) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s020">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s021">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s022">S5 Table</xref>) and examined their silver-binding capability upon incubation with 4 molar equivalents (eq.) of Ag<sup>+</sup> by GE-ICP-MS. <sup>107</sup>Ag peaks were observed at the MW around 15, 33, and 36 kDa, corresponding to Ag<sup>+</sup>–Zrap, Ag<sup>+</sup>–Mdh, and Ag<sup>+</sup>–GapA, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4H and S4I Fig</xref>). However, no <sup>107</sup>Ag peaks were observed at the MW around 15, 33, and 36 kDa in the GE-ICP-MS profiles upon incubation of purified mutants of Zrap<sup>CS</sup>, Mdh<sup>3CS</sup>, and GapA<sup>3CS</sup> with 4 eq. of Ag<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s006">S4H and S4I Fig</xref>). These results collectively corroborated that the newly developed approach can uncover authentic Ag<sup>+</sup>-bound proteins.</p>
<p>The abundance (presented by number of mRNA molecules/cell) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref037">37</xref>] ranges from 0.69 to 54.6 for the identified 34 silver-binding proteins, and their Cys and His residues range from 1 to 10 and 1 to 13, respectively, suggesting that our method is not biased to only abundant proteins or those proteins with high Cys or His contents. Nonetheless, the method is not without limitation. It is unable to track [4Fe-4S] cluster–containing dehydratases that have been previously implicated as the targets of silver poisoning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref038">38</xref>], as silver poisoning leads to destruction of the [4Fe-4S] cluster and generation of the apo-enzyme. However, this does not hamper our understanding of silver toxicity. Indeed, combining the two sets of silver targets allows a comprehensive elucidation of the dynamics of Ag<sup>+</sup> poisoning in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells (<italic>vide infra</italic>).</p>
<p>We next explored the biological insight of the identified Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding targets by Gene Ontology (GO) analysis with the Database for Annotation, Visualization, and Integrated Discovery (DAVID) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref039">39</xref>]. In total, eight biological processes, six metabolic pathways, and four cellular components were significantly enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s007">S5A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s007">S5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s007">S5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s007">S5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s007">S5E and S5F Fig</xref>). These Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins are mainly involved in TCA cycle (or Krebs cycle), glyoxylate cycle, glycolysis, translation, response to oxidative stress, and regulation of intracellular pH. We further calculated silver distribution in proteins involved in different biological processes and found the highest silver content in TCA cycle enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s007">S5G and S5H Fig</xref>). Analysis of protein–protein interaction (PPI) by Search Tool for the Retrieval of Interacting Genes/Proteins (STRING) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref040">40</xref>] showed that these Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins are enriched in four functional categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). The largest numbers of Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins were found in the network of translation, followed by TCA cycle, acid resistance, and glycolysis, suggesting that Ag<sup>+</sup> targets multiple pathways in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Our results are in line with a recent report that Ag-resistant and -sensitive genes were found in multiple cellular systems using a chemical genetic screen. The common pathways (i.e., translation, acid resistance, TCA cycle, and oxidant detoxification) and genes (i.e., <italic>mdh</italic>, <italic>gadA</italic>, <italic>sodA</italic>, and <italic>ompA</italic>) confer silver cytotoxicity to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were found both in our study and this report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref041">41</xref>].</p>

<title>Metabolomics study</title>
<p>To validate our findings, an NMR-based metabolomics study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref042">42</xref>] was carried out as a complementary approach to examine the systemic metabolic alterations of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> exposed to AgNO<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s023">S6 Table</xref>). Multivariate data analysis revealed changes in 23 metabolites out of 37 being unambiguously identified, and exposure of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to a high dose of AgNO<sub>3</sub> (4 μg/ml) resulted in more substantial metabolic changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s023">S6 Table</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s024">S7 Table</xref>). Consistent with the metalloproteomics analysis, levels of several metabolites in the glycolic pathway and TCA cycle were altered upon exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup>. In addition, the decline of glutathione (GSH) was observed, indicative of an elevated cellular oxidative stress induced by Ag<sup>+</sup>. The levels of adenosine monophosphate (AMP), inosine-5'-monophosphate (IMP), hypoxanthine, guanosine, and uridine, which are involved in nucleic acid degradation or synthesis, also decreased after Ag<sup>+</sup> exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Metabolite Set Enrichment Analysis (MSEA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref043">43</xref>] elaborated that over 10 enrichments were achieved (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g002">Fig 2B</xref>), with glutathione metabolism, glycolysis, and TCA cycle being the metabolic pathways significantly altered upon exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup>.</p>

<title>Silver primarily targets enzymes in glycolysis and the oxidative branch of TCA cycle</title>
<p>Three enzymes involved in glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase (GapA), phosphoglycerate kinase (Pgk), and dihydrolipoyl dehydrogenase (LpdA), were found to be bound by Ag<sup>+</sup> in our metalloproteomics analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). We examined the in vivo activities of GapA and Pgk in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> after treatment with 4 μg/ml AgNO<sub>3</sub> at different time points. We found that Ag<sup>+</sup> inhibited over 50% activity of Pgk from 30 mins to 1 h, while inhibition on GapA to similar extent was observed at 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). To further confirm that GapA and Pgk are real targets of Ag<sup>+</sup> toxicity, we examined the activities of these two enzymes in the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cell lysates with or without treatment of AgNO<sub>3</sub>.

To examine the primary targets of Ag<sup>+</sup> amongst these targets, we further measured the in vivo activities of identified enzymes at different time points post treatment of 4 μg/ml AgNO<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). The activity of isocitrate dehydrogenase (Icd) was inhibited by over 80% from 5 mins up to 1 h. A similar inhibition of malate dehydrogenase (Mdh) was observed but with slightly less extent (approximately 50%). The activity of succinyl-CoA synthetase (SucD) increased briefly upon Ag<sup>+</sup> exposure but decreased afterward and displayed an overall trend of slight decrease. Collectively, these data indicate that the enzymes in the TCA cycle act as the primary targets of Ag<sup>+</sup>, with Icd and Mdh being inhibited most rapidly. We then constructed the corresponding gene knockout mutants in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, i.e., Δ<italic>icd</italic>, Δ<italic>sucD</italic>, and Δ<italic>mdh</italic>, and examined their susceptibility to Ag<sup>+</sup>. Compared to the WT strain, variable and moderate growth defects were observed in these mutants in the early exponential phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s025">S8 Table</xref>). Higher minimum inhibitory concentration (MIC<sub>50</sub>) values in Δ<italic>icd</italic> and Δ<italic>mdh</italic> cells (6.0 and 5.7 μg/ml, respectively) than the WT <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (4.0 μg/ml) were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s025">S8 Table</xref>), demonstrating that Icd and Mdh are more prominent targets of silver ions. The observation of only moderate growth defect and increase of MIC<sub>50</sub> in these individual deletion mutants is in well agreement with our metalloproteomics data that multiple targets are simultaneously inhibited by Ag<sup>+</sup> during its poisoning of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells.</p>
<p>We further examined the dynamic alterations in the abundance of TCA cycle metabolites of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells following the exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup> at different time points. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3H</xref>, significant depletion of citrate, 2-oxoglugarate, and isocitrate was observed upon exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup> for 1 h. Since these intermediates belong to the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref044">44</xref>], these data suggest that this branch of the TCA cycle is primarily damaged by Ag<sup>+</sup>. On the other hand, inconsistent with the significant inactivation of Icd and Mdh activities shown above, we did not observe the accumulation of the corresponding substrates, i.e., isocitrate and malate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). This is not unexpected, since proteins containing Fe-S clusters were implicated as a class of Ag<sup>+</sup> targets previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref038">38</xref>], and the enzyme catalyzing isocitrate formation, aconitase (Acn2), and two consecutive enzymes upstream of malate formation, fumarase (FumA) and succinate dehydrogenase (Sdh), are [Fe-S] cluster proteins, and their damages can stall the production of isocitrate, fumarate, and malate. The pattern of succinate is distinct, as its level was reduced in the first 30 mins but was elevated afterward; such a pattern was also observed in the metabolomics analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>
<p>To eliminate the indirect growth inhibition effect, we selected two antibiotics (ampicillin and kanamycin) and compared the metabolic changes of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> after treatment with Ag<sup>+</sup> and antibiotics at the concentrations that inhibit <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> growth by 50%. As our metalloproteomic study demonstrated that silver-bound proteins are enriched in glycolysis and TCA cycle, we therefore selected nine metabolites involved in these two pathways for comparison. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s009">S7 Fig</xref>, significant depletion of all the metabolites tested (except succinate) was observed upon exposure <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to Ag<sup>+</sup> for 1 h. In contrast, a general increase in the examined metabolites was noted after treatment of the bacterium with ampicillin and kanamycin, in agreement with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref045">45</xref>]. Such a discrepancy suggest that metabolic changes upon treatment of Ag<sup>+</sup> are not due to indirect growth-related effects; instead, they are silver specific. Different from conventional antibiotics, silver kills <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> through targeting multiple proteins and disrupting multiple pathways accordingly.</p>

<title>Silver induces metabolic divergence from TCA cycle to glyoxylate cycle</title>
<p>Although we identified isocitrate lyase (AceA) and malate synthase (AceB) as silver-bound proteins, the in vivo activities of AceA and AceB were increased in the first 30 mins following exposure to 4 μg/ml AgNO<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3I</xref>). Notably, the concomitant decrease of Icd activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) and increase of AceA and AceB activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3I</xref>) suggests a metabolic divergence in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> from the TCA cycle to the glyoxylate cycle in response to Ag<sup>+</sup> toxicity, which is further verified by the significant up-regulation of <italic>aceA</italic> and <italic>aceB</italic> genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3J</xref>) as well as the accumulation of succinate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3H</xref>). We further measured the expression levels of <italic>aceA</italic> and <italic>aceB</italic> as well as the enzyme activities of AceA and AceB in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> after treatment with a series of concentrations of AgNO<sub>3</sub> for 1 h. An Ag<sup>+</sup>-mediated dose-dependent increase of the expression levels of <italic>aceA</italic> and <italic>aceB</italic> were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3J</xref>). However, the in vivo activities of AceA and AceB were not proportionally increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3J</xref>), suggesting that although an adaptive metabolic divergence to the glyoxylate cycle occurred in response to initial Ag<sup>+</sup> exposure, enzymes in this pathway are also damaged by Ag<sup>+</sup> in the continuous Ag<sup>+</sup> toxicity, resulting in a largely futile metabolic divergence. This is further supported by the activity tests in cell lysates in which addition of Ag<sup>+</sup> abolished the activities of AceA and AceB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s009">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether the metabolic switch from TCA cycle to glyoxylate shunt could contribute to the cell’s tolerance to silver, we examined the growth of WT, Δ<italic>aceA</italic>, and Δ<italic>aceB</italic> strains after treatment of 4 μg/ml AgNO<sub>3</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3K</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s010">S8 Fig</xref>, the WT, Δ<italic>aceA</italic>, and Δ<italic>aceB</italic> strains display nearly identical growth curves in the absence of Ag<sup>+</sup>. However, addition of Ag<sup>+</sup> resulted in clearly different growth curves for the three strains after addition of Ag<sup>+</sup>, with Δ<italic>aceA</italic> and Δ<italic>aceB</italic> cultures displaying a longer lag phase and a slower growth than the WT in the early log phase, demonstrating that the deletion of <italic>aceA</italic> and <italic>aceB</italic> affects the metabolic adaptation that contributes to the silver tolerance of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in these growth phases. The fact that the mutant cultures reached almost the same optical density (OD<sub>600</sub>) values as the WT cells after 600 mins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3K</xref>) further supports the ultimate futility of the metabolic divergence in the late stage of continuous Ag<sup>+</sup> toxicity. Collectively, these results demonstrate that the glyoxylate cycle provides an alternative pathway for metabolism of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> during Ag<sup>+</sup> stress, which contributes to the silver tolerance of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells in the early stage but ultimately is futile to counteract Ag<sup>+</sup> toxicity.</p>
<p>Taken together, we demonstrate a dynamic poisoning process in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> by Ag<sup>+</sup>, i.e., Ag<sup>+</sup> first damages multiple TCA cycle enzymes, which leads to serious damage to the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle and then induces a metabolic divergence to the reductive glyoxylate pathway. The glyoxylate pathway contributes to the alleviation of Ag<sup>+</sup> stress transiently but eventually is futile for <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells exposed to continuous Ag<sup>+</sup> toxicity. Among the enzymes involved in TCA cycle, three (Icd, SucD, and Mdh) are newly identified protein targets of Ag<sup>+</sup> by LC-GE-ICP-MS, and silver-induced impairment of their functions are validated in this study. Together with the previously identified [4Fe-4S] cluster-containing targets Acn2, FumA, and Sdh, a rather complete and dynamic Ag<sup>+</sup> poisoning of the central metabolic process of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is unveiled for the first time.</p>

<title>Silver targets oxidative stress defense system in a later stage of its toxicity</title>
<p>Induction of oxidative stress has been widely deemed to contribute to bactericidal activity of silver [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref017">17</xref>]. We observed an elevated level of succinate post exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup> for 60 mins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s008">S6 Fig</xref>); this could lead to a hyperactivation of respiration and facilitate the electron flow in the electron transport chain (ETC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref046">46</xref>]. However, our metalloproteomics identified another target of Ag<sup>+</sup> in this pathway: the terminal oxidase cytochrome BD oxidase subunit II (CydB) whose inactivation could trap electrons and induce reactive oxygen species (ROS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref046">46</xref>]. Indeed, we found that Δ<italic>cydB</italic> strain is more sensitive to Ag<sup>+</sup> than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3O</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref004">4</xref>], confirming the deleterious effect of Ag<sup>+</sup> on this protein. Furthermore, two proteins, i.e., SodA and Dps, which are involved in eliminating ROS or sequestration of Fe<sup>2+</sup> and subsequently protecting DNA from oxidative damages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref047">47</xref>], were identified to be bound by Ag<sup>+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3L</xref>). We then measured the ROS levels in Ag<sup>+</sup>-treated and untreated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> at different time points using chloromethyl derivative of 2′, 7′-dichlorodihydrofluorescein diacetate (CM-H<sub>2</sub>DCFDA), a general oxidative stress indicator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref048">48</xref>]. No obvious increase of ROS was observed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> treated with Ag<sup>+</sup> for 5 mins, but a burst of ROS was noted from 30 mins to 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s011">S9A Fig</xref>). We further examined the GSH/GSSG ratio, for which the decreased ratio indicates cells being exposed to increased oxidative stress. A significant decrease in the GSH/GSSG ratio occurred after treatment with Ag<sup>+</sup> for 30 mins, confirming that Ag<sup>+</sup> induced ROS in a later stage of its toxicity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3N</xref>). It is conceivable that binding of Ag<sup>+</sup> to antioxidant proteins SodA, Dps, and GrxB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3L</xref>) disrupts their functions, resulting in a further accumulation of ROS and consequently cell death. Consistent with this, Δ<italic>sodA</italic> and Δ<italic>dps E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells were more sensitive to Ag<sup>+</sup> than the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g003">Fig 3O</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>Real-time quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref049">49</xref>] analysis revealed that the metalloproteomics findings and metabolomics changes were correlated with the gene expressions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s011">S9B Fig</xref>). We found that most of the genes coding for enzymes in the glycolysis and TCA cycles, e.g., <italic>pgk</italic>, <italic>lpdA</italic>, <italic>mdh</italic>, and <italic>sucD</italic>, were down-regulated immediately upon treatment with Ag<sup>+</sup>, and the down-regulation remained up to 1 h, whereas the expression of glyoxylate cycle genes <italic>aceA</italic> and <italic>aceB</italic> were up-regulated, reflecting an adaptive strategy employed by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to decrease the glycolysis and TCA cycles and divert the metabolism to glyoxylate cycle. In contrast, there were no significant changes in the expression levels of <italic>sodA</italic>, <italic>dps</italic>, and <italic>grxB</italic> at 5 mins upon exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup>, but a sharp up-regulation of <italic>sodA</italic>, <italic>dps</italic>, and <italic>grxB</italic> was observed afterward, reflecting a defense strategy of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to the elevated ROS levels.</p>

<title>Metabolites potentiate the bactericidal efficacy of silver against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> in vitro and in an animal model</title>
<p>These newly discovered Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins represent new targets that could be harnessed to enhance the bactericidal efficacy of Ag<sup>+</sup>. Given that Ag<sup>+</sup> inhibits key enzymes in glycolysis and TCA cycles and down-regulates cellular respiration, thus promoting the respiration by supplementation of exogenous metabolites, should enhance the antimicrobial activity of Ag<sup>+</sup> to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Since Ag<sup>+</sup> disrupts the carbon and energy catabolism at different points along the TCA cycle and glycolysis, the potentiation effects should correlate with the level of inactivation of those enzymes.</p>
<p>To test our hypothesis, we screened 15 metabolites involved in the TCA cycle, glycolysis, as well as other metabolites whose levels are decreased in our metabolomics study following Ag<sup>+</sup> treatment for their ability to enhance the antimicrobial activity of Ag<sup>+</sup> against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. We examined the survival rates of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> after treatment of Ag<sup>+</sup> together with each of the metabolites for 8 h in M9 minimal medium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref029">29</xref>]. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, compared with the control (only Ag<sup>+</sup>-treated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> without addition of metabolites), the cell viability was significantly reduced by around three orders of magnitude when Ag<sup>+</sup> was coadministered with selective metabolites involved in the TCA cycle, i.e., acetate, citrate, 2-oxoglutarate, succinate, fumarate, malate, and glutamate. Generally, combination of Ag<sup>+</sup> and metabolites in the oxidative branch of TCA cycle showed more rapid and significant killing to <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), with citrate exhibiting the highest potentiation effect, followed by 2-oxoglutarate, glutamate, and succinate, consistent with our findings that Ag<sup>+</sup> exhibits the strongest inhibition or alteration to the enzymes or intermediates in the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Meanwhile, the metabolites alone had negligible inhibition on the growth of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s012">S10 Fig</xref>). In contrast, the metabolites involved in late steps of the TCA cycle exhibited less potentiation effect, with oxaloacetate showing no significant enhancement. However, malate exhibited over 1,000-fold potentiation, which could be explained by Ag<sup>+</sup> binding and inhibition to Mdh and FumA in the TCA cycle. Besides, around two orders of magnitude reduction on the viability of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were observed when metabolites that enter glycolytic pathway (alanine, pyruvate, and lactate) were supplemented. The fact that pyruvate has similar potentiation effect as citrate supports that the metabolic disruption by silver could be attributed to the pyruvate cycle, which has been recently identified as the energy-generated cycle in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref026">26</xref>]. In contrast, a higher viability of the cell treated with Ag<sup>+</sup> and glucose together than the control was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). Such a protective effect mediated by glucose might be attributed to glucose-induced efflux of Ag<sup>+</sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref051">51</xref>].

<p>It has been reported previously that treatment of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells with different antibiotics (ampicillin, kanamycin, and norfloxacin) led to higher levels of TCA cycle intermediates, such as citrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref045">45</xref>]. However, in this study, significant depletion of citrate was observed in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> upon exposure to Ag<sup>+</sup>. Despite that reprograming metabolomics has been employed to combat antibiotic resistance, metabolites are selected based on the metabolic response of the bacteria under stress, as the exogenous metabolites are used to reprogram the metabolome to adapt or suppress the metabolic changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref025">25</xref>]. For instance, metabolites that enter the upper glycolysis and pyruvate are able to induce rapid killing of persisters by gentamicin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref028">28</xref>] while alanine, glucose, and glutamate exert higher potentiation effects for kanamycin to kill antibiotic-resistant bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref029">29</xref>]. In our study, metabolites from the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle (or pyruvate cycle) generally show higher potentiation effect, whereas glucose exerts a protective effect when coadministrated with silver. Such discrepancies between silver and antibiotics clearly demonstrate that both the metabolic responses and metabolite-dependent potentiation strategy in our study are silver specific.</p>
<p>We further examined the time- and dose-dependent potentiation effects of these metabolites on Ag<sup>+</sup>. We found no recovery of the growth of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> after 24 h of cotreatment with Ag<sup>+</sup> and effective metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s013">S11 Fig</xref>). The metabolites within certain dose ranges exhibited a dose-dependent increased efficacy of Ag<sup>+</sup> toward eradication of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>; specifically, citrate at a concentration as low as 0.1 mM could still potentiate the killing of Ag<sup>+</sup> against <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s014">S12 Fig</xref>). Consistently, we found that metabolites such as citrate and 2-oxoglutarate could reduce the MIC<sub>90</sub> of AgNO<sub>3</sub> from 0.3 μg/ml to 0.1 μg/ml, while acetate, succinate, glutamate, fumarate, malate, pyruvate, alanine, lactate, and glycine were less effective in this regard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>We then measured the uptake of silver by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> after coadministration of metabolites and Ag<sup>+</sup> for 1 h via ICP-MS. The highest uptake was found in the cells cotreated with citrate, followed by 2-oxoglutarate and other metabolites with a metabolite dose-dependent increase of Ag<sup>+</sup> uptake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s015">S13 Fig</xref>). The Ag<sup>+</sup> uptake is generally in positive correlation with the potentiation ability of the metabolites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>), implying that the increased uptake of Ag<sup>+</sup> is partially responsible for the enhanced bactericidal efficacy. However, how different metabolites exert distinct potentiation effects on Ag<sup>+</sup> still warrants further investigation.</p>
<p>We further evaluated the potential cytotoxicity of Ag<sup>+</sup> in combination with different metabolites on human epithelial (HeLa) and human hepatoma G2 (HepG2) cells by the standard serial dilution method. Our results showed that all the metabolites at the concentration up to 50 mM exhibited no obvious cytotoxicity to HeLa and HepG2 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s016">S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s017">S15 Fig</xref>). Moreover, no synergistic cytotoxicity of the combination of metabolite and Ag<sup>+</sup> was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s016">S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000292.s017">S15 Fig</xref>). These data collectively indicate that the combination of Ag<sup>+</sup> and metabolites exhibits significantly selective toxicity to bacteria over mammalian cells.</p>
<p>We finally examined whether metabolites could potentiate bactericidal activity of Ag<sup>+</sup> in a mouse urinary tract infection (UTI) model, one of the most commonly occurring clinical infections of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref004">4</xref>]. Citrate was selected as a representative metabolite for the animal study, owing to its highest potentiation effect among the 15 metabolites in the in vitro study. The infection was performed by inoculating 2 × 10<sup>8</sup> CFU of uropathogenic <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> (UPEC) cells into the bladder of each mouse via transurethral catheterization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g005">Fig 5</xref>). The infected mice received vehicle, monotherapy of AgNO<sub>3</sub>, sodium citrate, or combined therapy of AgNO<sub>3</sub> and sodium citrate 0.5 h after infection. Animals were observed for another 24 h before sacrificed for colony counting. The treatment with sodium citrate alone resulted in slightly increased cell counts, whereas treatment with Ag<sup>+</sup> reduced the cell counts by <italic>ca</italic>. 5-fold compared with the control group. Significantly, the combination of Ag<sup>+</sup> and sodium citrate exhibited an enhanced bactericidal effect, with bacterial load reduced by <italic>ca</italic>. one order of magnitude over the Ag<sup>+</sup>-alone group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g005">Fig 5</xref>).

<p>Silver has long been deemed to bind thiols in enzymes and thereby inactivate their functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref052">52</xref>]; however, no direct binding protein targets have been identified and characterized systematically. Owing to the complexity of metal–protein interactions in cells, the lack of appropriate techniques to explore drug targets appears to be the main obstacle that hinders the understanding of molecular mechanism of silver as well as other metallodrugs. Using our homemade LC-GE-ICP-MS, we mapped out Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins (Ag<sup>+</sup>-proteome) in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> for the first time. With the combined metalloproteomics, metabolomics, bioinformatics, and bioassays, we demonstrate that Ag<sup>+</sup> disrupts multiple cellular processes in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>, particularly the TCA cycle, glycolysis, and oxidative stress defense systems. Further kinetic studies allow the first snapshot on how silver kills <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to be captured at the molecular level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000292.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Ag<sup>+</sup>, once uptaken inside <italic>E. coli</italic> cell, primarily targets glycolysis and the oxidative branch of the TCA cycle (or pyruvate cycle) via functional disruption of the key enzymes, followed by adaptive glyoxylate cycle, and then abolishes bacterial oxidative defense capability through binding and inactivation of key antioxidant enzymes.</p>
<p>With broad-spectrum antimicrobial activity and less likelihood of resistance, silver has been thought to be an excellent candidate to tackle antimicrobial resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref004">4</xref>]. However, its toxicity retards its wide application. Based on the molecular mechanism derived from our investigation, therapeutic effect of Ag<sup>+</sup> could be enhanced by supplementation of metabolites from TCA cycle and glycolysis, thereby reducing its dosage. Our mouse model of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> infection successfully demonstrates a proof-of-principle that fundamental knowledge and molecular understanding of silver stress can be translated into new antibacterial approaches in clinic. Our study resolves long-standing questions on how Ag<sup>+</sup> exerts its antimicrobial activity at the molecular level and may also open up new horizons for in-depth exploration of silver (and nanosilver) toxicology in other bacteria. Our initial data on Ag<sup>+</sup>-associated proteins in the gram-positive bacterium <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> reveal that Ag<sup>+</sup> has distinct targets in gram-negative and gram-positive bacteria. The integrated omic approaches we describe here can be widely applied to explore the molecular targets and mechanisms of action of other metal-based antimicrobial and anticancer drugs, thereby facilitating the development of new therapeutics.</p>

<title>Materials and experimental design</title>
<p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli K12 MG 1655</italic> is from our laboratory collection. Chromatography columns (Mono P 5/50 GL) and the FPLC system were from GE Healthcare. The column gel electrophoresis separation system was modified from a commercially available Mini Prep Cell system (Bio-Rad) by using the newly designed gel column (Φ = 2.5 mm) and replacing the solution-transferring tubing (PEEK tubing with Φ of 0.25 mm). Metal contents were determined by ICP-MS (Agilent 7700x). Peptide mass fingerprinting was performed on an LTQ Orbitrap VelosTM mass spectrometer (Thermo Fisher Scientific). All chemical reagents and standard proteins were purchased from Sigma-Aldrich, unless otherwise specified. All solutions were prepared from Milli-Q water (Milli-Q Ultrapure water systems, Millipore).</p>

<title>Standard protein iodination</title>
<p>The iodination of standard proteins (ribonuclease A [RA], carbonic anhydrase [CA], ovalbumin [OVA], bovine serum albumin [BSA], and conalbumin [OTF]) were carried out according to a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref032">32</xref>]. In brief, for the iodination reaction, a 50 mM potassium iodide solution in Tris buffer (100 mM NaCl, pH 7.5) saturated with elemental iodine was used (termed as KI<sub>3</sub>). Protein solution was adjusted to a concentration of 1 mg/ml and incubated with KI<sub>3</sub> at a final concentration of 5 mM for 10 mins at room temperature. The reaction was stopped by addition of sodium dithionite with a final concentration of 10 mM. The samples were washed with Tris buffer for three times to remove free iodide and then applied to SDS-PAGE and GE-ICP-MS to confirm the iodination. The molecular masses of iodinated proteins were recalibrated through the 1D slab gel electrophoresis to avoid the apparent mass shift resulted from any modification.</p>

<title>Preparation of metal-bound proteins</title>
<p>Lysozyme (LZM) and CA at a concentration of 5 mM were incubated with cisplatin (<italic>cis</italic>-Pt(NH<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>Cl<sub>2</sub>) and RuCl<sub>3</sub>, respectively, at a molar ratio of 1:10 (protein:metal ions) at 4°C overnight [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref053">53</xref>]. Identical conditions were used to prepare Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding LZM. For preparation of indium (III)-bound human serum transferrin (TF), indium standard solution for ICP-MS supplemented with 50 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub> was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref054">54</xref>]. Unreacted In(III) were removed from the solutions with 3 kDa cut-off filters (Amicon) by centrifugation (Eppendorf) at 14,000 × g and 4°C for 20 mins, followed by two washing steps with Tris buffer. The successful labeling of metals to proteins (termed as Pt-LZM, Ru-CA, and In-TF) was further validated by GE-ICP-MS. The molecular masses of metal-bound protein makers were recalibrated through the 1D slab gel electrophoresis to avoid the apparent mass shift resulted from any modification.</p>

<title>First dimensional separation</title>
<p>Five <sup>127</sup>I-labeled proteins were mixed and changed into starting buffer. Conditions utilized for LC were referred to standard procedures provided by the manufacture and further optimized. Polybuffers (GE Healthcare Life Sciences) were diluted 10-fold with milli-Q water before adjustment of pH. For pH in the range of 4–7, iminodiacetic acid was used to adjust pH. Bis-Tris (25 mM, pH 7.1) and polybuffer 74 (pH 4.0) were used as starting buffer and eluent, respectively. For pH in the range of 6–9, acidic acid was used to adjust pH of starting buffer (75 mM Tris) and eluent (polybuffer 96) to 10.0 and 6.0, respectively. The fractions of FPLC were collected and concentrated to the same volume for each 0.5 pH range and subsequently applied to GE-ICP-MS for further separation and detection.</p>

<title>Second dimensional separation</title>
<p>The apparatus and operation procedures were described in our previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref030">30</xref>]. In this part, a reverse multilayer native resolving gel (13%→10%, with lengths of 1.2 and 1.8 cm, respectively) and 4% stacking gel of 0.5 cm were utilized to separate fractions from FPLC. A two-step voltage program with a stacking procedure of 60 min at 200 V and the resolving at 600 V was applied for the separation. The elemental detection by ICP-MS was started in the beginning of the second step. All conditions for GE-ICP-MS were kept the same for all samples. For each GE-ICP-MS experiment of <sup>127</sup>I-labeled proteins, the same amounts of Pt-LZM, Ru-CA, and In-TF were added as internal standards for MW calibration. Ru-CA was selected for the calibration of intensity of iodine-labeled proteins.</p>

<title>Media and growth conditions</title>
<p><italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells from frozen stock were inoculated on Luria-Bertani (LB) agar plate and cultured at 37°C overnight. Single colonies were grown in LB broth for 16 h at 37°C. Cells were then diluted by 1:100 to LB media and grown for around 2 h to OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3. Different concentrations of AgNO<sub>3</sub> were then added into culture. The viability of Ag<sup>+</sup>-treated and untreated cells was determined by counting CFUs followed by plating on LB agar plates and incubation overnight at 37°C. Cells after treatment of AgNO<sub>3</sub> at different times were harvested and washed with cold phosphate-buffered saline (PBS) three times and subjected to further physiological tests.</p>

<title>Silver uptake measurement</title>
<p>The culture of the bacteria was identical, as described in the growth conditions. Cells (OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.3) were harvested after treatment with 4 μg/ml AgNO<sub>3</sub> for 5, 30, and 60 mins. Bacterial pellets with same amounts of cell numbers (5 × 10<sup>8</sup>) were collected and digested with 100 μl 69.0% HNO<sub>3</sub> (Fluka, 84385) overnight, which was diluted to a final volume of 1 ml with 1% HNO<sub>3</sub>. Samples were further diluted when the measured signals exceeded the liner range of standard curve. The standard curve of silver was prepared from multielement standard solution (90243, Sigma-Aldrich) for ICP-MS. Silver contents in bacteria were calculated according to the standard curve and normalized to number of atoms in single cells.</p>

<title>Protein extraction and silver content measurement</title>
<p>AgNO<sub>3</sub> of 4 μg/ml was used to treat <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic>. Ag<sup>+</sup>-treated cells were harvested at different time points by centrifugation (4,500 × g, 15 mins at 4°C) and washed with cold PBS three times. Collected pellets were resuspended in PBS buffer and then lysed through sonication (amplitude: 20%, 5 secs on, 20 secs off, in total 5 mins on the ice water bath). The mixed suspension after sonication was centrifuged to get the supernatant. The supernatant was further centrifuged (10 mins, 100,000 × g, and 4°C) and fractionated. Cytosolic proteins were collected from the supernatant, while the membrane proteins were dissolved from the pellets with PBS buffer containing 1% (w/v) SDS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000292.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>Protein concentrations and silver contents in cytosolic and membrane were detected by Pierce BCA Protein Assay Kit (Thermo Fisher Scientific) and ICP-MS, respectively. Silver content was normalized to protein concentration to yield the ratio of Ag/protein. For the distribution of silver in cytosolic and membrane fractions, same amounts of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells were prepared for measurement of total silver content; the percentages were obtained by dividing the silver content in different fractions to total silver content.</p>

<title>Silver-binding protein separation and identification</title>
<p>For the first dimensional separation of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> proteins, conditions without specification were the same as the separation of <sup>127</sup>I-labeled standard proteins but with several minor modifications to achieve higher resolution. In detail, 2% glycerol (v/v) was added to all starting buffers and eluents to increase the solubility of proteins. The polybuffers were diluted by 16-fold and the buffer with pH ranging from 3.5 to 6.5 was used, as the pIs of most proteins of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> were less than 6. The fractions of FPLC were collected and condensed to the same volume for each 0.5 pH range and subsequently applied to GE-ICP-MS for further separation and detection.</p>
<p>For the second dimensional separation with GE-ICP-MS, the concentration and lengths of freshly prepared column gel were optimized and all fractions from FPLC were subjected to the same separation conditions. Specifically, the lengths of 15% and 12% gels were increased to 1.7 and 2.0 cm, respectively, and the lengths of 4% stacking gel was increased to 1.2 cm. To avoid the interference of metals from the metal-bound proteins, <sup>127</sup>I-labeled proteins were selected as internal standards for the calibration of MWs and the intensity of Ag<sup>+</sup>-binding proteins. For each GE-ICP-MS experiment, 0.5 μg I-RA, 1 μg I-CA, 2 μg I-OVA, 1 μg I-BSA, and 2 μg I-OTF were added.</p>
<p>To split the protein solutions after column gel electrophoresis, a T-connection connected with additional pump tubing with the same diameter was employed to transfer half of the eluted solutions to an automatic sample collection system. Eluents of 100 μl in each tube were collected. 1D slab gel electrophoresis was applied to separate the collected fractions after reducing the sample volume with an ultrafiltration device with a molecular weight cut-off of 3 kDa.</p>
<p>An additional silver determination procedure was applied to verify the associated silver in each band if multiple protein bands appeared in PAGE gel. The verified single band in the 1D SDS-PAGE gel was cut and digested for MS identification.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec023">
<title>Protein identification</title>
<p>The proteins in the collected fractions after gel electrophoresis separation were identified through peptide mass fingerprinting. In general, the proteins in gel pieces were extracted twice using 5% formic acid (FA)/50% acetonitrile (ACN) and then extracted once with 100% ACN. After purification by Ziptip (Millipore), the desalted peptides were mixed in a 1:1 ratio with 10 mg/ml α-cyano-4-hydroxycinnamic acid matrix (Fluka) dissolved in 0.1% FA/50% ACN.</p>
<p>The samples were injected via a nanospray chamber equipped with a gold-coated nanospray tip (New Objective). Protein identification and characterization were performed by using the 4800 MALDI TOF/TOF Analyser (ABSciex), which was equipped with a Nd:YAG laser that operates at 355 nm to ionize the samples. All mass spectra were acquired in positive-ion reflector mode using the 4000 series explorer version 3.5.28193 software (ABSciex). Each sample was analyzed with MALDI-TOF MS to create the peptide mass fingerprinting (PMF) data (scanning range of 900–4,000 m/z). The peak detection criteria for MS/MS used were an S/N of 5 and a local noise window width of 250 (m/z) and a minimum full-width half maximum (bins) of 2.9. The combined PMF and MS/MS search was then performed using GPS Explorer algorithm version 3.6 (ABSciex) against the nonredundant NCBInr database using the in-house MASCOT search engine version 2.2. The criteria for protein identification were based on the probability score of each search result. Significant matches had scores greater than the minimum threshold set by MASCOT (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.05).
