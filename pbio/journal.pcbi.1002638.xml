        <p>An essential component of genome function is the syntax of genomic regulatory elements that determine how diverse transcription factors interact to orchestrate a program of regulatory control. A precise characterization of <italic>in vivo</italic> spacing constraints between key transcription factors would reveal key aspects of this genomic regulatory language. To discover novel transcription factor spatial binding constraints <italic>in vivo</italic>, we developed a new integrative computational method, genome wide event finding and motif discovery (GEM). GEM resolves ChIP data into explanatory motifs and binding events at high spatial resolution by linking binding event discovery and motif discovery with positional priors in the context of a generative probabilistic model of ChIP data and genome sequence. GEM analysis of 63 transcription factors in 214 ENCODE human ChIP-Seq experiments recovers more known factor motifs than other contemporary methods, and discovers six new motifs for factors with unknown binding specificity. GEM's adaptive learning of binding-event read distributions allows it to further improve upon previous methods for processing ChIP-Seq and ChIP-exo data to yield unsurpassed spatial resolution and discovery of closely spaced binding events of the same factor. In a systematic analysis of <italic>in vivo</italic> sequence-specific transcription factor binding using GEM, we have found hundreds of spatial binding constraints between factors. GEM found 37 examples of factor binding constraints in mouse ES cells, including strong distance-specific constraints between Klf4 and other key regulatory factors. In human ENCODE data, GEM found 390 examples of spatially constrained pair-wise binding, including such novel pairs as c-Fos:c-Jun/USF1, CTCF/Egr1, and HNF4A/FOXA1. The discovery of new factor-factor spatial constraints in ChIP data is significant because it proposes testable models for regulatory factor interactions that will help elucidate genome function and the implementation of combinatorial control.</p>

        <p>The letters in our genome spell words and phrases that control when each gene is activated. To understand how these words and phrases function in health and disease, we have developed a new computational method to determine what word positions in our genomic text are used by each genome regulatory protein, and how these active words are spaced relative to one another. Our method achieves exceptional spatial accuracy by integrating experimental data with the text of our genome to find the precise words that are regulated by each protein factor. Using this analysis we have discovered novel word spacings in the experimental data that suggest novel genome grammatical control constructs.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Genomic sequences facilitate both cooperative and competitive regulatory factor-factor interactions that implement cellular transcriptional regulatory logic. The functional syntax of DNA motifs in regulatory elements is thus an essential component of cellular regulatory control. Appropriately spaced motifs can facilitate cooperative homo-dimeric or hetero-dimeric factor binding, while overlapping motifs can implement competitive binding by steric hindrance. Cooperative and competitive binding are an integral part of complex cellular regulatory logic functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Wolberger1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Ponticos1">[2]</xref>. The binding of regulatory proteins to the genome cannot at present be predicted from primary DNA sequence alone as chromatin structure, co-factors, and other mechanisms make the prediction of <italic>in vivo</italic> binding from sequence empirically unreliable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Farnham1">[3]</xref>. Thus it is not possible to use primary DNA sequence to determine the aspects of genome syntax that are employed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
      <p>To discover novel pair-wise factor spatial binding constraints <italic>in vivo</italic>, we have developed a new method called GEM that simultaneously resolves the location of protein-DNA interactions and discovers explanatory DNA sequence motifs with an integrated model of ChIP-Seq or ChIP-exo reads and proximal DNA sequences. We define a binding event location as the single base position at the center of a protein-DNA interaction. GEM reciprocally improves motif detection using binding event locations, and binding event predictions using discovered motifs. In doing so, GEM offers a more principled approach than simply snapping binding event predictions to the closest instance of the motif, and indeed, GEM does not require that all binding events are associated with strong motifs. GEM offers both improved spatial accuracy of binding event predictions and improved motif discovery in ChIP-Seq and ChIP-exo datasets.</p>
      <p>GEM's unbiased computational approach has enabled us to discover novel binding constraints between transcription factors from sequenced ChIP experiments. These spatial constraints directly suggest biological regulatory mechanisms that will be useful in future studies. Other methods to resolve binding events in sequenced ChIP data identify statistically enriched regions of ChIP-Seq read density and the peak points of enrichment within those regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Zhang1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Feng1">[9]</xref>, and binding calls can be offset from the bound site by dozens of bases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Park1">[10]</xref>. Recent studies have integrated peak detection and motif discovery by including motif occurrences to score the significance of predicted binding events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Boeva1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Wu1">[12]</xref>, or by using ChIP-Seq read coverage as a positional prior to improve motif discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Hu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Kulakovskiy1">[14]</xref>. However, no study has yet used the motif position information to reciprocally improve the spatial accuracy of binding event prediction. SpaMo studied the motif spacing using ChIP-Seq events to infer transcription factor complexes but the predicted motif spacing does not necessarily indicate <italic>in vivo</italic> binding in the specific cellular conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Whitington1">[15]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we review our GEM derived results, discuss these results in the context of current data production projects, and detail our methods.</p>

        <title>GEM improves the spatial resolution of binding event prediction</title>
        <p>We compared GEM's spatial resolution to six well known ChIP-Seq analysis methods, including GPS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Guo1">[8]</xref>, SISSRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Jothi1">[6]</xref>, MACS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Zhang1">[4]</xref>, cisGenome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Ji1">[7]</xref>, QuEST <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Valouev1">[5]</xref> and PeakRanger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Feng1">[9]</xref>. We used a human Growth Associated Binding Protein (GABP) ChIP-Seq dataset for our evaluation because GABP ChIP-Seq data were previously reported to contain homotypic events where the reads generated by multiple closely spaced binding events overlap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Valouev1">[5]</xref>. Thus the GABP dataset offers the opportunity to test if integrating motif information and binding event prediction improves our ability to deconvolve closely spaced binding events with greater accuracy. We also evaluated the methods using ChIP-Seq data from the insulator binding factor CTCF (CCCTC-binding factor) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Chen1">[16]</xref>, as it binds to a stronger motif than GABP. These two factors are representative of relatively easy (CTCF) and difficult (GABP) cases for ChIP-Seq data analysis. They are also used by other studies as benchmarks allowing for the direct evaluation of our results. GEM performance on other factors may vary.</p>
        <p>We found that GEM has the best spatial resolution among tested methods. Spatial resolution is the average absolute value difference between the computationally predicted locations of binding events and the nearest match to a proximal consensus motif. From all observations, spatial resolution is corrected for a fixed offset by subtracting the mean difference before averaging the absolute value differences. To ensure a fair comparison, we used 428 shared GABP binding sites that are predicted by all seven tested methods and which contain an instance of the GABP motif within 100 bp. GEM exactly locates the events at the motif position in 56.5% of these events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For a dataset with a stronger consensus motif, ChIP-Seq data from CTCF, GEM exactly locates the events at the motif position in more than 90% of the shared events, significantly improving the spatial accuracy of predicted binding events over other methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Alternative evaluations with all the binding sites that have a motif at a distance less than 100 bp are also performed for both GABP and CTCF data, and the results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s004">Figure S1</xref>) are similar to those above. Thus, GEM's joint model of ChIP-Seq read coverage and sequence is able to more accurately predict the location of binding sites than other approaches, which do not use motif information in their binding event predictions.</p>

        <p>GEM is also better at resolving closely spaced binding events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Gotea1">[17]</xref> in the GABP data than the other methods we tested. For example, GEM uniquely detects two GABP events over proximal GABP motifs that are 32 bp apart on chromosome 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). To evaluate binding deconvolution on a genome-wide scale, we identified 477 candidate clusters of closely spaced binding events. Each candidate cluster was detected as bound by all seven tested methods and contained two or more proximal GABP motifs separated by less than 500 bp. GEM identified two or more closely spaced events in 144 of the candidate clusters, significantly more than GPS(108), SISSRs(77), QuEST(77), PeakRanger(36), MACS(4)and cisGenome(5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>GEM accurately discovers DNA-binding motifs in ENCODE ChIP-Seq data</title>
        <p>We tested GEM's ability to discover biologically relevant DNA-binding motifs in data from the ENCODE project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Birney1">[18]</xref>. We chose this large collection of experiments because we expected they would be representative of the typical range of ChIP-Seq data noise and sequencing depth. Noise can be caused by low antibody affinity and deviations from ideal experimental procedure. We used a set of 214 ChIP-Seq experiments and associated controls comprising 63 distinct transcription factors that were profiled in one or more cell lines by the ENCODE project and for which validated DNA-binding motifs exist in public databases (Dataset S1). GEM analyzed these ChIP-Seq data, and the most significant GEM-discovered motifs from each analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s018">Table S1</xref> and Dataset S2) were compared to corresponding known binding preferences of the same transcription factors using STAMP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Mahony1">[19]</xref>. A motif alignment with E-value less than 1e-5 was considered a match. For comparison, we also used four popular traditional motif discovery tools covering a range of computational techniques, including MEME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Bailey1">[20]</xref>, Weeder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Pavesi1">[21]</xref>, MDScan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Liu1">[22]</xref>, and AlignACE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Hughes1">[23]</xref>, and three ChIP-Seq oriented tools, POSMO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Ma1">[24]</xref>, HMS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Hu1">[13]</xref> and ChIPMunk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Kulakovskiy1">[14]</xref> on the same data. A set of 100 bp sequences extracted from the 500 most highly ChIP-enriched GPS peaks calls are examined by the motif-finders MEME, Weeder, MDScan, AlignACE, or POSMO. For HMS and ChIPMunk, a set of 100 bp sequences and corresponding read coverage profiles are extracted from the 500 most highly ChIP-enriched GPS peaks calls.</p>
        <p>We found GEM outperforms all of the compared motif discovery approaches, even when allowing each method to make multiple motif predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s019">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s020">S3</xref>). Therefore, the GEM approach to integrating ChIP-Seq event detection with motif analysis not only improves the spatial resolution of binding events, but also more accurately finds the expected binding motifs present at those events. We note that GEM sometimes failed to find the known motif in datasets where one of the other algorithms succeeds. The complete evaluation is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s019">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s019">S3</xref>.</p>

        <p>We then tested GEM on ENCODE ChIP-Seq experiments for 9 distinct transcription factors with no publically described DNA binding motif. For 6 of these transcription factors, GEM discovers novel motifs that are consistent with expected binding sequences based on a small number of binding sites characterized in the literature, or similarity to the known binding preferences of related proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s021">Table S4</xref>). For example, GEM confirms that BATF has a similar binding preference to other members of the AP1 family of transcription factors. The similar TGAC/G binding preference has previously been supported by EMSA assays on regions upstream potential BATF regulated genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Ise1">[25]</xref>.</p>

      <sec id="s2c">
        <title>GEM improves the spatial resolution of ChIP-exo binding event prediction</title>
        <p>ChIP-exo aims to improve transcription factor binding spatial resolution by extensively digesting ChIP fragments down to the DNA that is protected by the bound protein complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Rhee1">[26]</xref>. While ChIP-exo experiments provide high-resolution binding information, typical peak-finding methodologies may fail to achieve single-base resolution binding event predictions if they do not account for the properties of the ChIP-exo experiment. An example is provided by the published CTCF ChIP-exo experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Rhee1">[26]</xref>, where ChIP-exo reads are bimodally distributed around binding sites on both strands because CTCF is cross-linked at two distinct sites of DNA. The published event predictions did not account for this characteristic distribution, and are thus often offset from CTCF binding motif instances. Since GPS and GEM automatically learn a model of sequence reads around binding events, GPS and GEM may be directly applied to ChIP-exo data without modification. We first verified that GEM's model of binding events is able to automatically adapt to the read distribution produced by the ChIP-exo protocol. We compared GEM's final computed read distribution to the expected empirical distribution of ChIP-exo and found that they were consistent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s005">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>GEM improves upon the spatial resolution of binding event detection over other methods for ChIP-exo data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To investigate the performance of GEM on ChIP-exo data, we compared the binding event predictions of GEM and GPS on ChIP-exo CTCF binding and the “middle of peak-pair” method from the original ChIP-exo study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Rhee1">[26]</xref>. To ensure a fair comparison, we used 5074 shared binding sites that are predicted by all tested methods and that contain a strong CTCF motif match within 100 bp of the binding positions. The original ChIP-exo study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Rhee1">[26]</xref> had 5.4% of the binding event calls centered on the motif match position, 40.3% of the calls within 10 bp, and an average spatial resolution of 15.85±15.29 bp. Applying GPS to the ChIP-exo data improved the spatial resolution, with 8.8% calls at 0 bp positions, 59.7% of calls within 10 bp, and average spatial resolution of 10.38±11.26 bp. Applying GEM to the ChIP-exo data located 76.5% calls exactly at the motif match positions, 89.7% of calls within 10 bp, and an average spatial resolution of 3.35±9.71 bp. These results demonstrate that GEM can significantly improve the spatial accuracy of ChIP-exo binding event predictions.</p>

        <title>GEM reveals known Sox2-Oct4 distance-constrained transcription factor binding distances</title>
        <p>We examined if GEM could detect pairs of transcription factors that bind to the genome with characteristic pair-wise spacing, beginning with the well-known hetero-dimeric pair Sox2-Oct4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Chew1">[27]</xref>. In general, distance-constrained transcription factor binding cannot be predicted based solely on sequence motifs as motif presence does not guarantee binding. Such spatial binding constraints may be caused by combinatorial binding, alternative binding, binding that is orchestrated by multimeric protein complexes, or the spread of constrained enhancer syntax.</p>
        <p>We were able to discover Sox2-Oct4 transcription factor spatial binding constraints by combining GEM binding calls from Sox2 and Oct4 ChIP-Seq data. We applied GEM independently to mouse ES cell Sox2 and Oct4 ChIP-Seq data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Whitington1">[15]</xref> to call the respective binding sites, and then computed the distance between Oct4 sites from Sox2 sites within a 201 bp window. The sequence strand of the GEM binding predictions is oriented using the Sox2 motif when a match to the motif is present. As expected, GEM predicted Oct4 binding sites are predominantly (630 sites out of 2525 in the 201 bp window) located at −6 bp position relative to GEM predicted Sox2 sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g004">Figure 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s006">Figure S3</xref>). However, this spacing cannot be observed from the binding calls of GPS or other event discovery methods alone because of their more limited spatial accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). An alternative approach is to snap binding calls to the nearest instance of the transcription factor's binding motif. We tested this approach using GPS binding calls as the starting points and found that the alternate approach captures fewer (277 sites out of 2753) instances of Oct4-Sox2 spatial binding constraints (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), presumably because some of the bound motifs do not pass the motif scoring threshold or because some unbound motif instances are located closer to the binding calls than the true motif instances.</p>

        <title>Enhancer grammar elements deduced from transcription factor binding sites predicted by GEM</title>
        <p>We next studied pair-wise binding relationships between 14 sequence-specific transcription factors (Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Klf4, STAT3, Smad1, Zfx, c-Myc, n-Myc, Esrrb, Nr5a2, Tcfcp2l1, E2f1 and CTCF) and two transcriptional regulators (p300 and Suz12) in mouse ES cells by applying GEM to a large compendium of ChIP-Seq binding data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Chen1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Heng1">[28]</xref>. Binding prediction by GEM enables the detection of 37 pairs of statistically significant spatial binding constraints, involving Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, Klf4, Esrrb, Nr5a2, Tcfcp2I1, E2f1, c-Myc, n-Myc and Zfx (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s007">Figure S4</xref>, the full list of TF pairs are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s023">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s024">S7</xref>, motifs are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s022">Table S5</xref> and Dataset S3). Interestingly, we found that Klf4, one of the ES cell reprogramming factors, exhibits strong distance-specific binding with many other factors, including Nanog, Sox2, Zfx, c-Myc, n-Myc, E2f1, Esrrb, Nr5a2 and Tcfcp2l1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s008">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>The discovered pair-wise spatial binding constraints reveal complex relationships among the factors. For example, Klf4 exhibits constrained binding with Sox2 but much less significantly with Oct4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s008">Figure S5</xref>). However, we did observe strong distance-specific binding between Oct4-Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This raises the question of whether the detected Klf4-Sox2 and Oct4-Sox2 spatial binding constraints are on the same genomic regions. We therefore studied all Sox2 bound regions that are co-bound with Klf4. Out of a total of 5609 Sox2 bound regions with a Sox2 motif instance that can be oriented, 123 regions are co-bound by Klf4 at position +25 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, only four regions show co-binding of Klf4 at position +25 bp and Oct4 at position −6 bp. More surprisingly, the distance-constrained Sox2/Klf4 regions are co-bound by 6 ES cell factors within a 70 bp window, including Sox2 (at 0 bp), Nanog (at 1 bp), Klf4 (at 25 bp), Esrrb (at 56, 59 bp), Nr5a2 (at 55, 58, 61 bp) and Tcfcp2I1 (at 66, 69 bp). Inspecting the underlying sequences of these regions, we found that the binding motifs of these factors are embedded at the positions consistent with the binding positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In addition to the consistent spatial arrangement of motifs, these sequences (spanning from −70 bp to 100 bp) exhibit a high degree of similarity. A subset of the sequences is shifted 3 bases by some insertion/deletions, consistent with the 3 bp shift of some of the factor binding positions. Comparing with p300 and H3K27ac ChIP-Seq datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Creyghton1">[29]</xref>, we found that almost all (119 out of 123) of these regions are bound by p300, a histone acetyltransferase and transcriptional coactivator that predicts tissue-specific enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Visel1">[30]</xref>; the majority of these regions are also marked by H3K27ac, a histone modification associated with active enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Creyghton1">[29]</xref>, suggesting that they may be active enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002638.s009">Figure S6</xref>). These results demonstrated that GEM analysis enables detection of coordinated binding of multiple factors that are driven at least partly by the underlying sequences.</p>

        <p>Observed novel genome wide spatial binding constraints include c-Fos:c-Jun/USF1, CTCF/Egr1, HNF4α/FOXA1.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that it is now possible to reveal aspects of functional genome syntax by surveying <italic>in vivo</italic> binding relationships between transcription factors at high spatial resolution. Our analysis has been made possible by sequenced ChIP data and a new computational method, GEM, which provides exceptional spatial resolution.</p>
      <p>GEM makes binding predictions and observes spatial constraints by discovering significant events utilizing both motifs and observed read coverage information. Prior work has documented specific genomic regions extensively targeted by multiple transcription factors (TFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Chen1">[16]</xref>. However, we have shown that the functional syntax of DNA motifs in regulatory elements cannot be fully elaborated with the imprecise ChIP-Seq event calls provided by previous methods. Motif analysis approaches such as SpaMo discover enriched motif spacing by scanning a list of known motifs in sequences anchored by ChIP-Seq data of a single factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Whitington1">[15]</xref>. Since the existence of motif instances does not guarantee condition specific <italic>in vivo</italic> binding, SpaMo cannot confidently determine the spacing between binding events and the factors involved, especially for motifs that are shared by a family of TFs. Furthermore, SpaMo excludes repetitive sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Whitington1">[15]</xref>. In contrast, GEM predicts binding based on uniquely-mapped reads and is able to detect spatial binding constraints in transposable elements. Such elements have been implicated in rewiring the core regulatory network of human and mouse ES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Kunarso1">[32]</xref>.</p>
      <p>We expect that the genome grammatical rules that are suggested here will be examined in further studies to elucidate mechanisms of transcriptional control, and potential protein-protein interactions that have regulatory consequences. Exploration of other genome grammatical constructs can be accomplished with the use of further ChIP experiments and GEM.</p>

        <p>After finding the primary k-mer equivalence class, GEM searches for other classes. To accomplish this, the previous seed k-mer is removed from the enriched k-mer pool and PWM motif occurrences are masked in the sequences. The process of building new k-mer equivalence classes is repeated until no more significantly enriched PWMs can be constructed. Rarely, a secondary motif PWM can become more significantly enriched than the primary motif. If this happens, the motif finding process is restarted using the seed k-mer of this secondary motif.</p>

        <title>Binding event prediction with a positional prior</title>
        <p>GEM employs a generative mixture model that describes the likelihood of a set of ChIP-Seq reads being generated from a set of protein-DNA interaction events originating at specific DNA sequences. The model generates protein-DNA interaction events that are biased to occur at explanatory DNA sequences by a k-mer based positional prior. Each event then independently generates reads following an empirical read spatial distribution that describes the probability of reads given the distance from the event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Guo1">[8]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g003">Figure 3B</xref> for an example).</p>

        <p>The probability of a read <italic>n</italic> is based on a mixture of possible binding events:</p>

        <p>where <italic>M</italic> is the number of possible events; <bold><italic>π</italic></bold> denotes the parameter vector of mixing probabilities, and <italic>π<sub>m</sub></italic> is the probability of event <italic>m</italic>; <italic>p</italic>(<italic>r<sub>n</sub></italic> | <italic>m</italic>) is the probability of read <italic>n</italic> being generated from event <italic>m</italic> and can be determined from the empirical spatial distribution of reads given the event <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Guo1">[8]</xref>.</p>

        <p>We make two prior assumptions about the binding events: 1) binding events prefer to occur at the sequence specific DNA motif positions; 2) binding events are relatively sparse throughout the genome. To incorporate these assumptions, we place a negative Dirichlet prior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Guo1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Figueiredo1">[46]</xref> <italic>p</italic>(<bold><italic>π</italic></bold>) on binding event probabilities <bold><italic>π</italic></bold>:</p>

        <p>The rationale is that if the k-mers mapped to position <italic>m</italic> have more occurrences at binding events genome wide, it is more likely to cause a binding event at that genome position. The parameter <italic>α<sub>m</sub></italic> is scaled such that all the values of possible <italic>α<sub>m</sub></italic> will be less than <italic>α<sub>s</sub></italic>. Therefore the k-mer based prior will not force the model to predict a binding event at a motif position when the observed reads do not provide sufficient evidence of a protein-DNA interaction event.</p>
        <p>Since the k-mers underlying the possible binding event positions and their counts are known, the value of term −<italic>α<sub>s</sub></italic>+<italic>α<sub>m</sub></italic> remains constant when we estimate the parameters in the mixture model. Therefore, we can solve the mixture model using Expectation-Maximization (EM) algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Dempster1">[47]</xref>.</p>

        <p>where <italic>N<sub>m</sub></italic> is the effective number of reads assigned to event <italic>m</italic>, or the binding strength of event <italic>m</italic>. Intuitively, the effective read count of an event is decreased by a pseudo-count <italic>α<sub>s</sub></italic> for the sparseness penalty, and is increased by a pseudo-count <italic>α<sub>m</sub></italic> for the k-mer motif at position <italic>m</italic>. If for event <italic>m</italic>, the value of <italic>π<sub>m</sub></italic> becomes zero, the model is restructured to eliminate it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Figueiredo1">[46]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The EM algorithm is deemed to have converged when the change in likelihood falls below a small value, for example 1e−5.</p>
        <p>Since the value of term −<italic>α<sub>s</sub></italic>+<italic>α<sub>m</sub></italic> is negative, a binding event supported by enriched k-mers may still be eliminated if it is not sufficiently supported by read data. In addition, a binding event not supported by enriched k-mers may still survive if it is sufficiently supported by the read data.</p>
        <p>The predicted binding events are tested for significance as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Guo1">[8]</xref>. Briefly, if a control dataset is available, we compare the number of reads in the ChIP event to the number of reads in the corresponding region in the control sample using a Binomial test. If control data is not available, we apply a statistical test that uses a dynamic Poisson distribution to account for local biases. To correct for multiple hypothesis testing, a Benjamini-Hochberg correction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002638-Benjamini1">[48]</xref> is applied. It is worth mentioning that we only use read counts of events to test for significance.</p>

        <p>To study the <italic>in vivo</italic> binding spatial relationship between a pair of transcription factors A and B in the certain cell type and condition, we apply GEM independently to ChIP-Seq data from A and B to predict the respective binding sites. To compute the distribution of spacing between A relative to B, we compute the offsets of A binding sites from B binding sites within a 201 bp window. The sequence strand of the binding predictions is oriented using the B motif when a match to the motif is present, and B is placed in the middle of the window. The occurrences of A at each offset position are summed over all the B sites to produce the empirical spatial distribution. In this study, we evaluate three different methods to call binding sites: GEM binding calls, GPS binding calls, and GPS binding calls that are snapped to a motif within 50 bp if one is present. Another motif distance for snapping binding calls, 100 bp, was also tested and the result was very similar to the 50 bp distance.</p>
        <p>To determine if a specific spacing is significant, we compute the p-value of the number of occurrences of factor A at that offset position using a Poisson test. The parameter of Poisson distribution is set as the mean number of occurrences across all the positions in the [−400 bp −200 bp] and [200 bp 400 bp] windows, assuming there are no significant spatial binding constraints in these windows. The p-value is corrected for multiple hypotheses testing using Bonferroni correction by multiplying the p-value by the number of positions in the window and the total number of pair wise tests across all cell types. The significance threshold for corrected p-value is 1e−8. Because the strand orientation of bound sequences cannot be oriented consistently when comparing multiple factor pairs, we report the absolute distance between the most significant interacting factor pairs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002638-g006">Figure 6</xref>.</p>
