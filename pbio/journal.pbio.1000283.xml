<p>The neuronal protein GRASP-1 is shown to be a key molecule controlling endosomal trafficking and thereby regulating synapse integrity and synaptic plasticity.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The endosomal pathway in neuronal dendrites is essential for membrane receptor trafficking and proper synaptic function and plasticity. However, the molecular mechanisms that organize specific endocytic trafficking routes are poorly understood. Here, we identify GRIP-associated protein-1 (GRASP-1) as a neuron-specific effector of Rab4 and key component of the molecular machinery that coordinates recycling endosome maturation in dendrites. We show that GRASP-1 is necessary for AMPA receptor recycling, maintenance of spine morphology, and synaptic plasticity. At the molecular level, GRASP-1 segregates Rab4 from EEA1/Neep21/Rab5-positive early endosomal membranes and coordinates the coupling to Rab11-labelled recycling endosomes by interacting with the endosomal SNARE syntaxin 13. We propose that GRASP-1 connects early and late recycling endosomal compartments by forming a molecular bridge between Rab-specific membrane domains and the endosomal SNARE machinery. The data uncover a new mechanism to achieve specificity and directionality in neuronal membrane receptor trafficking.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Neurons communicate with each other through specialized structures called synapses, and proper synapse function is fundamental for information processing and memory storage. The endosomal membrane trafficking pathway is crucial for the structure and function of synapses; however, the components of the neuronal endosomal transport machinery are poorly characterized. In this paper, we report that a protein called GRASP-1 is required for neurotransmitter receptor recycling through endosomes and back to the cell surface, as well as for the normal morphology of dendritic spines—the projections that form synapses—and for synaptic plasticity. We show that GRASP-1 coordinates coupling between early and later steps of the endocytic recycling pathway by binding to Rab4, a regulator of early endosomes, and to another endosomal protein found later in the pathway called syntaxin 13—a so-called SNARE protein involved in membrane fusion. GRASP-1 binds Rab4 with its N terminus and syntaxin 13 with its C terminus, suggesting that these interactions could structurally and functionally link early endosomes to those later in the recycling pathway. We propose a model in which GRASP-1 forms a molecular bridge between different endosomal membranes and the SNARE fusion machinery. Our study thus provides new mechanistic information about endosome function in neurons and highlights GRASP-1 as a key molecule that controls membrane receptor sorting and recycling during synaptic plasticity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In order to receive, process, and transmit information, neurons need substantially regulated mechanisms to locally redistribute membranes and proteins to synaptic sites. Multiple lines of evidence suggest that the endosomal pathway plays a crucial role in synaptic function and plasticity. At excitatory synapses, the postsynaptic membrane composition is subject to continuous and activity-dependent endocytic cycling of postsynaptic molecules. Based on uptake of extracellular gold particles, visualization of clathrin assembly in living neurons and pre-embedding immunogold electron microscopy, it was shown that endosomal compartments are present in the dendritic shaft and spines and that endocytosis occurs at specialized endocytic zones lateral to the postsynaptic density (PSD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Sheng1">[1]</xref>. Using live-cell imaging and serial section electron microscopy, it was demonstrated that recycling endosomes are required for the growth and maintenance of dendritic spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park1">[2]</xref>. Membrane recruitment from recycling endosomes is a common mechanism that cells employ to expand the plasma membrane and targets proteins in a polarized manner in such distinct processes as cytokinesis, cell-cell adhesion, phagocytosis, and cell fate determination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Maxfield1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Gould1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Perhaps the strongest evidence for the importance of endocytic recycling in synaptic function originates from the analysis of alpha-amino-3-hydroxy-5-methyl-4-isoxazolepropionic acid (AMPA)-type glutamate receptor (AMPAR) trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Bredt1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Shepherd1">[8]</xref>. AMPARs are the major excitatory neurotransmitter receptors in the brain, and redistribution of AMPARs in and out of the synapse has emerged as an important mechanism for information storage in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Malinow1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Shepherd1">[8]</xref>. Increased delivery of AMPARs to the postsynaptic membrane leads to long-term potentiation (LTP), whereas net removal of AMPARs by internalization from the surface through endocytosis seems to underlie long-term depression (LTD) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Bredt1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Shepherd1">[8]</xref>. Like any other internalized membrane protein, endocytosed AMPARs undergo endosomal sorting; they can be degraded in lysosomes or recycled back to the surface membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ehlers1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Gruenberg1">[11]</xref>. A popular model holds that the recycling endosomes provides the local intracellular pool of glutamate receptors for LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park2">[12]</xref>. Neuron-enriched endosomal protein of 21 kD (Neep21) and its interacting protein syntaxin 13 are endosomal proteins implicated in regulating AMPAR trafficking during synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner1">[13]</xref>. However, it remains unclear how endocytic receptor sorting and recycling is organized and coordinated in neuronal dendrites.</p>
<p>Multiple proteins identified as regulators of endosomal traffic in non-neuronal cells are also important in neuronal endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Maxfield1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Cai1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Deneka1">[16]</xref>. Dendritic spines contain the basic components of the endocytic machinery, postsynaptic receptor endocytosis occurs through a dynamin-dependent pathway, and Rab GTPases and their effectors regulate endosomal traffic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Murthy1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Kennedy1">[19]</xref>. The classic endosomal Rab proteins, Rab5, Rab4, and Rab11, have all been implicated in endosomal receptor and membrane trafficking in dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Kennedy1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Gerges1">[23]</xref>. Rab5 controls transport to early endosomes (also called sorting endosomes), whereas Rab4 and Rab11 are involved in the regulation of endosomal recycling back to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Snnichsen1">[24]</xref>. The endosomal pathway can be considered as a mosaic of discrete but overlapping domains that are generated and controlled by Rab proteins and their interacting effector protein networks. The communication and transport between sequentially organized Rab domains is thought to be mediated via proteins that are “shared” by both domains. Bivalent effectors, such as Rabenosyn-5 and Rabaptin-5, have been found that connect proximal Rab5 and distal Rab4 domains on early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-deRenzis1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Deneka2">[26]</xref>. However, how Rab4 and Rab11 recycling endosomal domains are coupled is poorly understood.</p>
<p>To gain a better mechanistic understanding of endosome recycling in neurons, we searched for neuronal interacting partners of Rab4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-vanderSluijs1">[27]</xref>. Using a pull-down and mass spectrometry approach, we identified GRASP-1 as a neuron-specific effector of Rab4 and key component of endocytic recycling in dendrites. GRASP-1 was originally found to interact with glutamate receptor interacting protein (GRIP) and shown to be involved in regulating AMPAR distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref>. We show that GRASP-1 is necessary for AMPAR recycling and synaptic plasticity, essential for maintenance of spine morphology and important for endosomal trafficking. GRASP-1 segregates Rab4 from EEA1/Neep21/Rab5-positive early endosomal membranes and coordinates the coupling to Rab11-labelled recycling endosomes via the interaction with t-SNARE syntaxin 13. These results describe a molecular mechanism for regulating recycling endocytosis by GRASP-1.</p>

<title>GRASP-1 Is a Rab4-GTP-Binding Protein</title>
<p>To identify Rab4-interacting proteins, we performed glutathione S-transferase (GST) pull-down assays with pig brain extracts using GTPγS-loaded GST-Rab4 affinity columns and analyzed the isolated proteins by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Among the proteins that were highly enriched in the GST-Rab4-GTPγS pull-downs but were not detected by mass spectrometry in the pull-down assays using GST-Rab4-GDP or GST alone, we found known binding partners of Rab4, such as the bivalent Rab effectors Rabaptin-5 and Rabenosyn-5 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000283-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-deRenzis1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Vitale1">[29]</xref>. The most significant novel hit was GRASP-1, which was originally identified as a GRIP/AMPAR interacting protein. GRASP-1 has been shown to regulate AMPAR targeting and Jun-N-terminal kinase (JNK) signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye2">[30]</xref>. The association between GRASP-1 and Rab4 was confirmed by immunoblotting with an antibody against GRASP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Binding of GRASP-1 to Rab4 was direct and specific since GRASP-1 associates with GST-Rab4 but not with the other tested Rab proteins, such as Rab3, Rab5, and Rab11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Some weaker binding was detected with Rab7 in this assay. Immunoprecipitation experiments from COS-7 cells co-expressing myc-GRASP-1 and Flag-Rab4 or Flag-Rab5 further confirmed the interaction of GRASP-1 with Rab4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Fluorescence microscopic analysis of Hela cells transfected with myc-GRASP-1 and GFP-Rab4 showed that the distribution of GRASP-1 fully coincided with GFP-Rab4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Analysis of the endosomal compartment in the same cells, as visualized by internalized Alexa594-Transferrin (Tf-594), indicated that GRASP-1 localizes to the Rab4-positive domain of the early endosomal recycling system. These immunofluorescence data are in line with the reported endosomal localization of GRASP-1 in Hep-2 cells, detected with an autoimmune GRASP-1 serum from a patient with recurrent infections and a presumed immune deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Stinton1">[31]</xref>.</p>

<p>GRASP-1 has an extensive propensity to form coiled-coils and contains a caspase-3 cleavage site, a PDZ-like GRIP binding domain, and a central glutamate-rich stretch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). To define the minimal Rab4 binding domain on GRASP-1, we generated a series of myc-GRASP-1 truncations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). GST-Rab4 pull-down assays with COS-7 cell extracts expressing GRASP-1 mutants showed that the N-terminal domain of GRASP-1 binds to Rab4 and that the coiled-coil region between amino acid 280–300 is required for this interaction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). However, full-length GRASP-1 lacking amino acid 280–300 partially retained Rab4 binding (unpublished data). These data argue for an important role of the N-terminal coiled-coil region in Rab4 binding but show that other regions might also be involved.</p>
<p>It has been reported that GRASP-1 may serve as a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for H-ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref>. We tested whether GRASP-1 might be a GEF for Rab4 by analyzing recombinant GRASP-1(1–594) in a GEF assay using fluorescent mantGDP. GRASP-1 did not act as GEF for Rab4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). However, unlike the positive control cdc25, GRASP-1 also did not exhibit noticeable GEF activity towards H-ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Full-length GRASP-1 also failed to increase GTP-loading of H-Ras in vivo as measured in pull-down assays with the recombinant ras binding domain of Raf-1. The bona fide GEF Ras-GRP markedly increased the amount of H-Ras in the GTP state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), which was further enhanced through its membrane recruitment via a phorbol myristate acetate (PMA)-controlled pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ebinu1">[32]</xref>. In line with these results, careful sequence analysis of GRASP-1 did not reveal significant homology to any known rasGEF. Together these data suggest that GRASP-1 is not a rasGEF but a Rab4 effector.</p>

<title>GRASP-1 Localizes to a Sub-Domain of Rab4-Positive Early Recycling Endosomes in Neurons</title>
<p>We examined GRASP-1 expression in mouse tissues and cell lines and showed by Western blot that GRASP-1 is highly expressed throughout the central nervous system, including cortex, cerebellum, midbrain, and spinal cord, and in primary cultured hippocampal neurons but is absent in non-neuronal tissues and cell types with the exception of neuroendocrine insulinoma cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

<p>Immunofluorescence labeling in mature hippocampal neurons (&gt;days in vitro 17; DIV 17) revealed that endogenous GRASP-1, although present in axons, is predominantly localized within the somatodendritic compartment, as evidenced by its labeling pattern and the codistribution with the dendritic marker MAP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). GRASP-1 is associated with punctate structures that occasionally extend beyond the dendritic shaft (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), overlap with the synaptic markers PSD-95 (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) and Bassoon (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), and localize within the dendritic spines visualized in β-galactosidase (β-gal) filled neurons (unpublished data). In line with the immunohistochemistry data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s001">Figure S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref>, colocalization of endogenous Rab4 and GRASP-1 is observed in primary hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Immunoelectron microscopy showed that endogenous GRASP-1 and Rab4 localize on an extensive tubular network that appeared to emanate from endosomes with a morphology that is characteristic of recycling tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The ability of GRASP-1 to associate with Rab4 positive endosomes was further confirmed by simultaneous dual color live imaging of mRFP-GRASP-1 and GFP-Rab4: GRASP-1 was observed on mobile Rab4-positive vesicles and tubular structures which dock and fuse with larger GRASP-1/Rab4 endosomal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3H</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s011">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s012">S2</xref>). Overexpression of GFP-Rab4 in hippocampal neurons increased the size of the endosomal structures where GRASP-1 and Rab4 coincide (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Close inspection of these structures revealed that endogenous GRASP-1 localizes to a sub-domain of the large Rab4-positive endosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g003">Figure 3G</xref>, inset), suggesting that GRASP-1 might regulate a particular step in the endosomal recycling pathway. To test whether endosomal GRASP-1 localization depends on Rab4 activity, neurons were transfected with dominant negative Rab4 (Rab4S22N). Expression of Rab4S22N redistributed GRASP-1 away from punctate endosomes, while other endosomal proteins were unaffected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Although it is likely that Rab4S22N inhibits membrane localization of its effector GRASP-1, we cannot exclude that overall levels of GRASP1 are also affected by Rab4S22N. Together these data indicate that GRASP-1 is selectively expressed in neurons, where it is partially localized to Rab4-positive endosomes in dendrites and present in spines near postsynaptic structures.</p>

<title>GRASP-1 Is Required for Dendritic Spine Morphology</title>
<p>To explore the function of GRASP-1, we used RNA interference to knock down expression of GRASP-1 in mature hippocampal neurons. We found two independent GRASP-1-shRNA sequences (#2 and #5) that specifically inhibited expression of GRASP-1 in hippocampal neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s003">Figure S3</xref>). GRASP-1 antibodies detected more than ∼80% reduction of GRASP-1 staining intensity in the cell body as well as in dendrites in GRASP-1-shRNA transfected neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), while other antibody staining, such as of MAP2, were unaffected (unpublished data). Both GRASP-1-shRNAs constructs produced similar phenotypic effects.</p>
<p>In view of previous observations that inhibition of endosomal recycling by dominant negative forms of Rab4 and Rab11 alters the morphology of dendritic spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park1">[2]</xref>, we first examined the effect of GRASP-1 knock-down on dendritic spines. In neurons co-expressing GRASP-1-shRNA and β-gal, we observed a marked decrease in the total number of protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The remaining dendritic protrusions were classified as filopodia-shaped protrusions and mushroom-shaped spines based on the ratio of spine head width to protrusion length. Quantification revealed that knock-down of GRASP-1 decreased the number of mushroom-headed spines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>). Neurons expressing GRASP-1* (which is resistant to GRASP-1-shRNA#2 knock-down) largely reversed the spine phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>). A similar spine phenotype was observed by expressing dominant negative forms of Rab11 (Rab11S25N) and Rab4 (Rab4S22N) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>). We next tested whether GRASP-1 knock-down could inhibit LTP-induced spine growth by glycine stimulation, a protocol used to induce chemical LTP in cultured hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park1">[2]</xref>. In control neurons, glycine treatment induced new spine formation and preexisting spine growth, while in the absence of GRASP-1 spine growth is blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Together these data indicate that GRASP-1 plays an essential role within the recycling endosomal pathway to maintain dendritic spine morphology and regulate LTP-induced spine growth.</p>

<p>Next, we transfected hippocampal neurons either with GFP and control vector or GFP with GRASP-1-shRNA and analyzed internalization and recycling of endogenous AMPAR following AMPA stimulation by immunolabeling for surface GluR1 and GluR2.

<title>GRASP-1 Regulates Synaptic Plasticity</title>
<p>Next we examined the role of GRASP-1 in excitatory transmission and LTP and recorded excitatory synaptic responses from CA1 pyramidal neurons in organotypic cultures of hippocampal slices. Simultaneous recordings were obtained from both transfected neurons (identified by cotransfected GFP) and a neighboring untransfected neuron. Both control luciferase-shRNA and GRASP-1-shRNA expressing cells had no effect on basal AMPAR-mediated excitatory postsynaptic currents (EPSCs) (GRASP-1 shRNA#5: 0.93±0.09-fold relative to untransfected cells, luciferase shRNA: 1.21±0.18) and NMDAR-EPSCs (GRASP-1 shRNA#5: 0.86±0.09-fold, luciferase shRNA: 1.03±0.32) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>). The importance of GRASP-1-mediated AMPAR recycling in slices became more evident by testing for synaptic plasticity. After induction of LTP, cells expressing GRASP-1 shRNA induced comparable levels of potentiation to that of neighboring untransfected cells up to 20 min after the LTP induction protocol. Subsequently, however, the response from GRASP-1 shRNA transfected cells started to fall and eventually returned to the baseline level at 30 min after LTP induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, untransfected neuron: 1.75±0.18-fold enhancement of EPSC at 29–30 min after LTP induction, transfected neuron: 1.17±0.10).

These data indicate that GRASP-1 is important for synaptic plasticity and particularly for the phase of LTP after the first 20 min. The results suggest that delivery of AMPAR from recycling endosomes might be important for this later phase of LTP.</p>

<p>To determine whether the endosomal domain organization is regulated by GRASP-1, we knocked down the expression of GRASP-1 and then assayed the co-distribution of EEA1 and GFP-Rab4. Hippocampal neurons transfected with GRASP-1-shRNA showed a strong increase in colocalized EEA1 and GFP-Rab4 (∼80%) compared to control neurons (∼40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g008">Figure 8C,E</xref>). In contrast, in neurons transfected with myc-GRASP-1, the overlap between EEA1 and GFP-Rab4 was significantly decreased (∼20%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g008">Figure 8C,E</xref>). Similar results were obtained in Hela cells, where myc-GRASP-1 strongly reduced colocalization between GFP-Rab4 and EEA1, while the co-distribution of GFP-Rab5 and EEA1 was not affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s007">Figure S7</xref>). To confirm our results we tested the effect of GRASP-1 on the localization of other early endosomal markers, such as Neep21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner1">[13]</xref>. Endogenous Neep21 staining strongly coincides with Rab5 and EEA1 (∼80%) and to a lesser extent with Rab4 (∼40%) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s008">Figure S8</xref> and unpublished data). However in neurons transfected with myc-GRASP-1 the overlap between Neep21 and GFP-Rab4 was significantly reduced (∼20%), consistent with the effect on EEA1 distribution (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s008">Figure S8D</xref>). In contrast, GRASP-1-shRNA enhances Neep21/Rab4 colocalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s008">Figure S8D</xref>).

We found little GRASP-1 colocalization with the Rab7 endosomal domains, whereas GRASP-1 labeling coincided extensively with Rab11-positive compartments (∼70%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g009">Figures 9A,C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s006">S6</xref>). These data strongly suggest that GRASP-1 is localized to distal aspects of the endosomal recycling pathway and might serve to couple Rab4 and Rab11 domains. This observation was confirmed by simultaneous dual color live imaging of mRFP-GRASP-1 and GFP-Rab11: GRASP-1 and Rab11 colocalize on larger endosomal domains, while dynamic Rab11-positive structures segregate into distinct tubular or vesicular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g009">Figure 9B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s013">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s014">S4</xref>). Most motile Rab11-positive tubules only transiently overlap with GRASP-1-positive endosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s013">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s014">S4</xref>). Rab4, Rab11, and GRASP-1 largely localized to overlapping regions on these large endosomal structures in the neuronal cell bodies and dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g009">Figure 9E</xref>). We further explored a possible role for GRASP-1 in coupling Rab4 and Rab11 domains by determining the Rab4/Rab11 co-distribution when GRASP-1 was knocked down as well as after overexpression of myc-GRASP-1. In absence of GRASP-1 we observed a significant decreased Rab4/Rab11 colocalization (15%), compared to control neurons (30% Rab4/Rab11 colocalization), while transfected myc-GRASP-1 robustly enhanced the coalescence of Rab4 and Rab11 domains (80% Rab4/Rab11 colocalization) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g009">Figure 9D,F</xref>). Importantly, the observed decrease in EEA1/Rab4 and Neep21/Rab4 domain coupling after myc-GRASP-1 transfection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g008">Figure 8C,E</xref>) is consistent with an increase in Rab4/Rab11 domain coupling, while the reverse occurred after GRASP-1 knock-down. These data therefore show that GRASP-1 is a positive regulator of endosomal recycling membrane maturation, via coupling of Rab4- and Rab11-positive endosomal domains.</p>

<title>Syntaxin 13 Binds to GRASP-1 and Connects Recycling Endosomal Domains</title>
<p>GRASP-1 colocalized with endogenous Rab11 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s006">Figure S6</xref>) and GFP-Rab11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g009">Figure 9A</xref>) in neurons but did not directly bind to Rab11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).

GFP-GRASP-1 precipitated syntaxin 13 and not myc-syntaxin 1 and myc-syntaxin 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g010">Figure 10A</xref>).

Moreover, overexpression of GRASP-1 strongly accumulates syntaxin 13 in GRASP-1/Rab4/Rab11 positive structures in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g011">Figure 11A</xref>) and Hela cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). Immunogold EM of neurons showed that syntaxin 13 colocalized with GRASP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and with Rab4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g004">Figure 4C</xref>) on endosomal tubulovesicular recycling structures, reminiscent of the Rab4-GRASP-1 organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Triple label immuno EM of endogenous Rab4, GRASP-1, and syntaxin 13 indeed revealed partial co-distribution to the endosomal tubulovesicular recycling structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). This suggests that the three proteins might be engaged in a complex on endosomal membranes. In agreement with this hypothesis, myc-syntaxin 13 could be isolated from COS-7 lysates on GST-Rab4 beads, only if GRASP-1 was co-transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g010">Figure 10C</xref>). The interaction required the PDZ-like domain containing C-terminal region of GRASP-1, but not the N-terminal Rab4 binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g010">Figure 10B,D</xref>), and could be recapitulated with purified GST-syntaxin 13 and <sup>35</sup>S-labeled GRASP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g010">Figure 10E</xref>). Since syntaxin 13 has a transmembrane domain, it could be an anchor for GRASP-1 on endosomal membranes.

<p>Previously, syntaxin 13 was found in complexes with early endosomal proteins EEA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-McBride1">[36]</xref> and Neep21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner1">[13]</xref>. To better understand the role of syntaxin 13 in both early and recycling endosomes, we first investigated the distribution of syntaxin 13 in dendrites of hippocampal neurons and found ∼40% overlap between Neep21 and syntaxin 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g011">Figure 11D,F</xref>), ∼40% colocalization between GRASP-1 and endogenous syntaxin 13 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g011">Figure 11B</xref>), while no co-distribution of Neep21 with GRASP-1 was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g011">Figure 11C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s006">Figure S6</xref>). These data suggest that GRASP-1/syntaxin 13 and Neep21/syntaxin 13 are associated with distinct endosomal structures. Since expression of GFP-GRASP-1 strongly accumulates endogenous syntaxin 13 in the cell body and dendrites without recruiting Neep21 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000283.s006">Figure S6</xref>), we examined whether GRASP-1 influences the Neep21/syntaxin 13 complex. Overexpression of GRASP-1 strongly reduced the colocalization between syntaxin 13 and Neep21 (∼15%) compared to control neurons (∼40%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g011">Figure 11D,G</xref>), suggesting that GRASP-1 competes with Neep21 for binding to syntaxin 13, thereby affecting the integrity of the Neep21/syntaxin 13 complex. These data are consistent with the observation that GRASP-1 separates Rab4 from Neep21 endosomal domains.</p>
<p>To evaluate whether syntaxin 13 is important for GRASP-1 association with Rab11 domains, we triple transfected GFP-Rab4, HA-Rab11, and a myc-tagged dominant negative syntaxin 13ΔTM mutant lacking the transmembrane domain. Hippocampal neurons transfected with syntaxin 13ΔTM showed a strong decrease in Rab4/Rab11 colocalization (∼10%) compared to control neurons (∼30%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g011">Figure 11E,H</xref>), while the co-distribution of Rab4 and GRASP-1 was not affected (unpublished data). These data indicate that syntaxin 13 regulates Rab4/GRASP-1 association with Rab11 endosomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Complex processes that govern neuronal function have adapted basic cellular pathways to perform the elaborate information processing achieved by the brain. Some of these processes, such as cargo trafficking, require additional layers of control and fine-tuning. Here, we describe a new molecular mechanism for regulating endosomal membrane and receptor recycling by GRASP-1 in neuronal cells. GRASP-1 is a neuronal effector of Rab4, binds syntaxin 13, and couples Rab4 and Rab11 endosomal domains. This mechanism has two distinct roles in neuronal function; first, it is required for AMPAR recycling, and second, it is critical for dendritic spine morphology.</p>

<title>Regulation of Recycling Endosome Maturation by GRASP-1</title>
<p>Each organelle carries its own set of Rabs which ensures the specificity of intracellular membrane transport. Ample examples show that Rab GTPases and their effectors can confer directionality to membrane traffic and couple different traffic steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Stenmark1">[37]</xref>. Here, we show that GRASP-1 is a new component of the molecular machinery that regulates directionality in endosomal trafficking in neurons. First, GRASP-1 is a novel Rab4 effector and binds specifically to its active GTP-bound state. Second, knock-down of GRASP-1 separates Rab4 and Rab11 domains and moves Rab4 in EEA1/Neep21 positive early endosomal structures. Accordingly, knock-down of GRASP-1 mimics the effects of dominant-negative Rab4 and Rab11 on dendritic spine morphology. Third, GRASP-1 overexpression strongly increases Rab4/Rab11 colocalization in both neurons and Hela cells. We propose a model in which GRASP-1 coordinates recycling endosomal maturation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g012">Figure 12</xref>). The term <italic>recycling endosome maturation</italic> is used here to discern it from the other endosomal exit routes, such as the degradative multivesicular body/endosome maturation pathway, the retrieval route of mannose 6-phosphate receptors to the trans Golgi network, or the pathway for melanogenic enzymes to melanosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Bonifacino1">[38]</xref>.</p>

<title>Model for the role of GRASP-1 in endosome recycling.</title>
<p>Endosomes can be viewed as mosaic distribution of Rab4, Rab5, and Rab11 domains that dynamically interact via effector proteins and SNAREs. The Rab5 domain allows entry into the early/sorting endosome, whereas the Rab4 and Rab11 domains contain the machinery that is necessary for sorting and recycling membranes and receptors back to the plasma membrane. (A) GRASP-1 binds to Rab4 and syntaxin 13 and couples Rab4 and Rab11 recycling endosomes. The complex formed between GRASP-1 and t-SNARE syntaxin 13 might mediate fusion between Rab4 and Rab11 endosomes. (B) Absence of GRASP-1 interferes with complex formation at the recycling step, causing cargo accumulation in early endosomes, impairment of receptor expression, and changes in spine morphology. (C) Overexpression of GRASP-1 leads to recruitment of syntaxin 13 and strongly couples Rab4 and Rab11 domains, causing accumulation of internalized receptors in recycling endosomes. Consistent with the observed decrease in AMPAR clusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref>, Caspase-3 cleavage of GRASP-1 might separate the N-terminal Rab4 domain from the C-terminal syntaxin 13 binding site and disrupt the coupling between Rab4 and Rab11 domains.</p>

<p>How does GRASP-1 couple specific Rab domains? Along the endosomal pathway, bivalent effectors have been found that connect proximal Rab5 and Rab4 domains on early endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-deRenzis1">[25]</xref>. Since GRASP-1 binds directly to Rab4 but not to Rab11, additional factors are needed. We found that GRASP-1 binds to endosomal SNARE protein syntaxin 13. Overexpression of GRASP-1 separates syntaxin 13 from Neep21 positive structures and strongly recruits syntaxin 13 to Rab4 positive membranes. Previous studies have shown that syntaxin 13 is involved in recycling of endosomal domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Prekeris1">[35]</xref> and is enriched in Rab11 endosomal fractions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Trischler1">[34]</xref>. Syntaxin 13 also has a function together with syntaxin 6 in the fusion of early endosomes in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Zwilling1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ohya1">[40]</xref>. We found that mutant syntaxin 13 separates Rab4/GRASP-1 and Rab11 positive endosomal domains, suggesting a novel function of syntaxin 13 in the coupling of Rab4 and Rab11 domains by GRASP-1. Since syntaxin 13 is a constituent of the SNARE core complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Prekeris1">[35]</xref> and involved in membrane fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-McBride1">[36]</xref>, it is tempting to speculate that the binding between GRASP-1 and syntaxin 13 recruits the fusion machinery necessary to connect with Rab11 positive membranes. Additional studies are required to determine the precise functional relationship between GRASP-1 binding to syntaxin 13 and the SNARE function of syntaxin 13.</p>
<p>The property to bind Rab4 via the N terminus and syntaxin 13 via the C terminus of GRASP-1 supports the model that membrane bound active Rab4 retains or recruits GRASP-1 on endosomes and forms a complex with syntaxin 13. This sequence of interactions could then structurally and functionally link Rab4 to Rab11 membrane domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g012">Figure 12</xref>). Subsequent recruitment of the other factors on to Rab4-defined membrane domains could strengthen the interaction with Rab11. It has been speculated that the GTPase-activating proteins (GAPs) that act on the upstream Rabs might be effectors of the downstream Rabs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Grosshans1">[41]</xref>. These Rab cascades and conversions might serve as a positive feedback loop to specifically concentrate activated Rab4 on Rab11 positive endosomes. Additional regulation of GRASP-1 by caspase-3 cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref> could separate the N-terminal Rab4 binding domain from the C-terminal syntaxin 13 binding site, potentially disrupting the interaction between Rab4 and Rab11 endosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g012">Figure 12</xref>).</p>

Here, we provide an alternative model for the role of GRASP-1 in AMPAR traffic and show that GRASP-1 is part of the molecular machinery that controls endosomal membrane receptor recycling in dendrites. Indeed, we show that GRASP-1 colocalizes with internalized AMPARs and that knock-down of GRASP-1 decreases recycling of GluR subunits after AMPA application. Moreover GRASP-1 regulates synaptic plasticity, especially the late phase of LTP in hippocampal slices. Previous results show that Rab11 and syntaxin 13 dominant negative mutants were critical for the entire time course of LTP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Brown2">[22]</xref>. We propose that GRASP-1 regulates a particular step in the endosomal trafficking and is important for a specific phase of AMPA receptor recycling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g012">Figure 12</xref>). In addition to supplying AMPARs, membrane trafficking from recycling endosomes also mediates the growth of dendritic spines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Brown2">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Wang1">[42]</xref>. In accord, GRASP-1 knock-down decreased the total number of protrusions and mushroom-shaped spines and regulates endosomal mobility into dendritic spines. As discussed above, the coupling of endosomal Rab4 and Rab11 domains by GRASP-1 is an attractive possibility to explain the effects on AMPAR recycling and spine morphology.</p>
<p>GRASP-1 binds to the seven PDZ domain-containing scaffolding protein GRIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref> that transports and stabilizes GluR2 containing AMPAR at synapses and intracellular compartments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Bredt1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Hoogenraad1">[43]</xref>. Rab4 dominant negative and GRASP-1 knock-down had no effect on GRIP-1 distribution and Rab4/GRASP-1 positive endosomal structures did not recruit endogenous GRIP (unpublished data), suggesting that GRIP functions in an alternative trafficking pathway independent of GRASP-1 or the interaction with GRASP-1 is transient and highly regulated. Interestingly, GRIP also binds to the early endosomal protein Neep21, which is crucial for AMPAR sorting through endosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Kulangara1">[45]</xref>. Since neuronal activity determines the phosphorylation status of GRIP and enhances the binding of GRIP and GluR2 with Neep21 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Kulangara1">[45]</xref>, it is possible that GRIP is under tight control of specific phosphorylation signaling mechanisms in order to allow for consecutive protein binding and temporal receptor interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Kulangara1">[45]</xref>. Additional studies are required to determine the precise role of GRIP in endosomal receptor trafficking.</p>
<p>In contrast to AMPA stimulation, GRASP-1 staining strongly decreased by bath application of NMDA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Lee1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Ye1">[28]</xref>. It has been shown that AMPA and NMDA stimulation induce differential AMPAR sorting; AMPA stimulation allows AMPARs to enter the normal recycling pathway, whereas NMDA stimulation diverts AMPARs to Neep21-positive endosomes and the lysosome degradation pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Lee1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Steiner1">[13]</xref>. It is tempting to speculate that GRASP-1 in AMPA stimulated neurons allows sorting of internalized AMPARs to the recycling endosomes, while in response to NMDA, absence of GRASP-1 drives receptors to the lysosomes. It is possible that different neuronal stimulatory inputs dynamically control activity of effector complexes and endosomal trafficking pathways. In this model, GRASP-1 might be part of the machinery on endosomes that senses and reacts on NMDA receptor-mediated Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx, which is of key importance to understanding internalized AMPAR and membrane sorting during plasticity and neuronal circuitry remodeling.</p>

<p>The mouse spinal cord was sectioned at 40 µm with a freezing microtome. Sections were processed free floating, employing double-labeling immunofluorescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Jaarsma1">[65]</xref>. The antibodies were diluted in Tris-Buffered-Saline (TBS, pH7.6) containing 1% normal horse serum and 0.2% Triton X-100. Sections stained for immunofluorescence were analyzed with a Zeiss LSM 510 confocal laser-scanning microscope.</p>

<title>Time-Lapse Live Cell Imaging</title>
<p>During imaging, neurons were maintained at 37°C in standard culture medium in a closed chamber with 5% CO2 (Tokai Hit; INUG2-ZILCS-H2). To visualize mRFP-GRASP-1 and GFP-Rab4 or mRFP-GRASP-1 and GFP-Rab11 in neurons, near-simultaneous dual color (green and red) time-lapse live cell imaging was performed using Total Internal Reflection Fluorescence microscopy (TIRFM) on a Nikon Eclipse TE2000E (Nikon), equipped with Nikon TIRF arm, CFI Apo TIRF 100×1.49 N.A. oil objective (Nikon), Coolsnap camera (Roper Scientific), and controlled by MetaMorph 7.1 software (Molecular Devices). For excitation, the 488 nm laser line of an argon laser (Spectra-Physics Lasers) and a 561 nm laser (Spectra-Physics) were used in combination with a ETGFP/mCherry filter cube (Chroma). A filterwheel (Sutter instruments) with GFP and Cherry emission filters (both Chroma) and synchronized with laser emission alternatingly exposed the camera to GFP or Cherry emission. For glycine treatments, the same microscope was used with regular widefield illumination by a mercury lamp. Glycine treatments were performed as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park1">[2]</xref>. Images of live cells were processed and analyzed using MetaMorph, Adobe Photoshop, or LabVIEW (National Instruments) software.</p>

<title>Image Analysis and Quantification</title>
<p>Confocal images of transfected neurons were obtained with sequential acquisition settings at the maximal resolution of the microscope (1,024×1,024 pixels). Each image was a z-series of 6–8 images, each averaged 2 times and was chosen to cover the entire region of interested from top to bottom. The resulting z-stack was “flattened” into a single image using maximum projection. Images were not further processed and were of similar high quality to the original single planes. The confocal settings were kept the same for all scans when fluorescence intensity was compared. Morphometric analysis, quantification, and colocalization were performed using MetaMorph software (Universal Imaging Corporation).</p>
<sec id="s4n1">
<title>Morphometric analyses of hippocampal neurons</title>
<p>To visualize the dendritic protrusions, we used β-gal or GFP as an unbiased cell-fill. Because protrusions often crossed several z planes, we took series of stacks from the bottom to the top of all dendrites and used the LSM software to generate image projections for quantitative analyses. All morphological experiments were repeated at least three times with an <italic>n</italic>&gt;7 for individual experiments and were analyzed in a double-blind manner. Between 150 and 300 protrusions were scored for every neuron and expressed per 10 µm length of dendrite. Measurements of length and width of the protrusions were performed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Jaworski2">[66]</xref> and were classified based on the ratio of spine head width to protrusion length according to the following ratios: the spine whose width was equal to or more than half the size of its length was judged as standard mushroom spine. The protrusion whose width was smaller than half the size of its length was judged as filopodia or thin spine. In those cases where the total length of the spine could not be adequately seen or its length was &gt;5 µm, protrusions were excluded from analysis.</p>

<title>Quantification of TfR-GFP distribution in spines</title>
<p>Measurements of TfR-GFP localization in spines and dendrites was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Park1">[2]</xref>. Confocal images of hippocampal neurons filled with β-gal (red) and labeled for TfR-GFP were analyzed using Metamorph software. The dendritic localization of TfR positive structures relative to spines was categorized according to the presence of GFP signal at the base (a), in the neck (b), or in the head (c) of spines.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4n3">
<title>Colocalization of fluorescent signals in dendrites and cell body</title>
<p>Colocalization of two fluorescent signals was determined using “colocalization” module in Metamorph software as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Lee1">[10]</xref>. The colocalization module provides intensity measurements of the region overlap between signals in red and green channels of image projections. To minimize random overlap due to projection of confocal images, a single optical section from the z series stack that showed the largest amount of fluorescent signals was used to determine the degree of colocalization in the cell body. Statistical analysis was performed with Student's <italic>t</italic> test assuming two-tailed distribution and unequal variation. <italic>n</italic> was defined as the number of transfected cells.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4n4">
<title>Quantification of surface and internalized AMPARs</title>
<p>To measure AMPAR internalization and recycling, images for all conditions in individual experiments were analyzed by using identical microscope settings. Images from each experiment were thresholded, and total staining intensity of surface and internalized GluR1 and/or GluR2 was measured along selected dendritic areas using Metamorph. The internalization index refers to intracellular fluorescence divided by surface fluorescence normalized to untreated control neurons. For experiments comparing internalized and surface staining of AMPARs, dendritic areas were manually drawn and staining intensity in the same selected area was measured in the different channels. The recycling index was calculated as the ratio of surface fluorescence divided by the internalized fluorescence and normalized to unstimulated wild-type control neurons.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4n5">
<title>Analysis of morphological changes upon glycine treatment</title>
<p>For each protrusion, length and maximum width were measured in MetaMorph. Only protrusions longer than 7 pixels (450 nm) were included in the analysis. Protrusions were identified as spines if their width was greater than half their length or greater than 10 pixels (645 nm). Spine growth was probed as the change in sum of spine widths per 10 um and comprises both addition of new spines and growth of pre-existing spines.</p>

<title>Electrophysiology</title>
<p>Electrophysiological recordings were carried out from organotypic slice cultures as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000283-Futai1">[68]</xref>. Neurons were transfected using a biolistic gene gun (Bio Rad) at DIV 3–4 (100 µg DNA; 90% of the construct to test; 10% pCAG-EGFP). Electrophysiological recordings were performed at 5–6 d after transfection. Recordings were carried out in solution containing NaCl, 119 (mM); KCl, 2.5; CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 4; MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 4; NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 26; NaH<sub>2</sub>PO4, 1; glucose, 11; picrotoxin, 0.15; and 2-chloroadenosine, 0.01 for measuring AMPAR- and NMDAR-EPSC and 0.002 for LTP experiments with 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% O<sub>2</sub>, at pH7.4. Whole-cell recordings were made simultaneously from a pair of CA1 pyramidal neurons, one transfected and one untransfected, and synaptic responses were evoked by tungsten bipolar electrode placed in CA1 stratum radiatum area with the frequency of 0.2 Hz. AMPAR-mediated EPSCs were measured at −60 mV and NMDAR-EPSCs were recorded at −40 mV in the presence of NBQX (0.01 mM). AMPAR-EPSCs for LTP experiment were measured at −80 mV and LTP was induced by pairing 2 Hz stimulation with depolarization of the postsynaptic cell to 0 mV for 100 s. Statistical significance was evaluated with the Mann-Whitney test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>) and <italic>t</italic> test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000283-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>).</p>
