<abstract>
<p>Phenotypic plasticity is a vital strategy for plants to deal with changing conditions by inducing phenotypes favourable in different environments. Understanding how natural selection acts on variation in phenotypic plasticity in plants is therefore a central question in ecology, but is often ignored in modelling studies. Here we present a new modelling approach that allows for the analysis of selection for variation in phenotypic plasticity as a response strategy. We assess selection for shade avoidance strategies of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> in response to future neighbour shading signalled through a decrease in red:far-red (R:FR) ratio. For this, we used a spatially explicit 3D virtual plant model that simulates individual Arabidopsis plants competing for light in different planting densities. Plant structure and growth were determined by the organ-specific interactions with the light environment created by the vegetation structure itself. Shade avoidance plastic responses were defined by a plastic response curve relating petiole elongation and lamina growth to R:FR perceived locally. Different plasticity strategies were represented by different shapes of the response curve that expressed different levels of R:FR sensitivity. Our analyses show that the shape of the selected shade avoidance strategy varies with planting density. At higher planting densities, more sensitive response curves are selected for than at lower densities. In addition, the balance between lamina and petiole responses influences the sensitivity of the response curves selected for. Combining computational virtual plant modelling with a game theoretical analysis represents a new step towards analysing how natural selection could have acted upon variation in shade avoidance as a response strategy, which can be linked to genetic variation and underlying physiological processes.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Plants are able to respond to changes in the environment. Particularly, plants can show different structural traits (e.g. stem height and leaf size) in different planting densities. These trait changes are the result of so-called plastic responses that can be induced by changes in the light spectrum. Although a great part of the physiological processes underlying these plastic responses have been identified, it remains unclear how these plastic responses, and variations therein, can be the result of selection. In this paper we analyse selection on different plastic responses within different dynamic competitive environments. We use a 3D virtual plant model that simulates realistic plant growth based on light absorption, photosynthesis and specific light signals that induce changes in leaf growth. The 3D model simulated various competitive vegetation stands consisting of plants with different plastic responses at different planting densities. We conclude that selection in different densities results in different plastic responses. We advocate that our modelling approach allows for analyses related to selection on plastic responses itself, instead of on specific trait values in different environments, and is therefore an important new step forward in understanding the role of plastic responses for plant performance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In the course of evolution, plants have evolved traits often specific to a certain environment. When growth conditions change, the selection pressure on trait values change, which subsequently can change selection on genotypes. However, due to phenotypic plasticity one genotype can exhibit multiple phenotypes (i.e. multiple trait values) depending on environmental conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref003">3</xref>], which helps a plant to survive across different environments. The extent to which plasticity is adaptive depends on the environmental conditions, the reliability of the cues that signal the (change in) environmental conditions, and the costs related to phenotypic changes and plasticity itself [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref007">7</xref>]. Although considerable genetic variation in plasticity has been documented in various species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref011">11</xref>], it remains unclear how variation in plasticity is the result of direct evolutionary selection processes on a certain trait or a consequence of selection for other traits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Evolutionary and ecological population models are widely used to explain genetic variation and species composition in different environments, and these models are often based on evolutionary game theoretical principles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref017">17</xref>]. These models implicitly assume that variation in trait values is entirely due to genetic variation among genotypes. This implies that these models essentially predict selection for different genotypes in different environments when these environments select for different trait values. However, if plasticity would be considered in evolutionary game theoretical models as the ability of a genotype to change its trait value in response to environmental conditions, selection for different trait values in different environments would not necessarily lead to selection for different genotypes. In this paper we take the first step in exploring how variation in phenotypic plasticity could be the result of natural selection in different environments. Phenotypic plasticity is the result of plastic responses that are driven by physiological processes, and these responses are directly the result of environmental cues. To this end, the physiological processes underlying the plastic responses to environmental cues have to be quantitatively linked to trait values and to the performance of individual plants in various environments. Considering plasticity as a trait in itself and considering variation in plasticity across genotypes is required to analyse to which extent natural selection may have acted on variation in plastic responses.</p>
<p>In this study we focus on plastic responses to light competition in vegetation stands of varying planting density and associated neighbour-plant proximity. Plants growing at high density (close proximity to neighbour plants) typically exhibit greater elongation rates of leaf-supporting structures (i.e. internodes and/or petioles), reduced branching and greater leaf inclination angle than plants growing at low density [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref022">22</xref>]. One of the primary signals that induces these shade avoidance responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref023">23</xref>] is a reduction of the red to far-red ratio of light (R:FR), as plants selectively absorb red and reflect far-red light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref020">20</xref>]. The reduction in R:FR light perceived by an individual plant is therefore considered a cue for neighbour proximity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref024">24</xref>], reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref023">23</xref>]; a low R:FR ratio signals that neighbours are close (high density) and a high R:FR ratio indicates that neighbours are farther away (low density). In addition, R:FR light conditions are also affected by the 3D structure of the canopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref026">26</xref>] and by self-shading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>]. These alternative causes of changes in the R:FR ratio may decrease the reliability of R:FR as cue for neighbour proximity and future light availability.</p>
<p>To be able to analyse to which extent natural selection may have acted on variation in shade avoidance responses to R:FR, it is required to consider the feedback between the R:FR cue and the plant phenotype. Changes in R:FR induce responses at the organ-level that cause changes in plant architectural phenotype, which in turn affects light capture for growth. The changed phenotype, in turn, changes the light environment and associated R:FR conditions, inducing new sets of responses and this continues throughout plant development. This feedback can be captured in so-called functional-structural plant models ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref028">28</xref>], also called virtual plant models) that can mechanistically simulate the interaction between plant 3D structure, growth, and the light distribution within the canopy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref030">30</xref>]. While taking into account the phenotype-environment feedbacks created by the vegetation itself, R:FR induced organ-level plastic responses and variation within these responses can be realistically scaled up to whole-plant performance at vegetation level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref032">32</xref>]. We utilize a recently developed and validated virtual plant model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>] that simulates Arabidopsis (<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>) rosette growth based on light absorption for photosynthesis and growth and induces phenotypic changes via a plastic response curve allowing plants to dynamically change their phenotype during growth. The current model simulates the consequences of specifically petiole and lamina plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref033">33</xref>] for whole-plant performance in different environmental conditions based on an organ level plastic response curve that describes the sensitivity of the relative petiole and lamina response to R:FR. The response curve is treated as a trait itself, and different shapes of the curve represent different plasticity strategies with the value <italic>α</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Petiole plasticity entails petiole elongation in response to decreasing R:FR and can put the leaves in a higher strata of the canopy to increase light capture. Lamina plasticity entails lamina growth reduction in response to decreasing R:FR and can negatively affect light capture because it reduces the total lamina area. Therefore these two organ-specific plasticities are considered antagonistic.</p>

<title>Visualization of different plasticity strategies.</title>
<p>Plasticity strategies are presented with different values of α, and illustrate different shapes of the curve describing the relative organ response at various R:FR values (see <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007253.e001">Eq 1</xref> in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref>). Different plasticity strategies tested within this study are created by increasing the value α from 0 to 0.7 with steps of 0.1 (see legend). Petiole and lamina responses are simulated by multiplying the organ (or organ growth) with this relative response value (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref> for details). Plasticity strategy with α = 0 is a horizontal line at 1 (not visible in the graph) and indicates no plastic response to R:FR because a relative value of 1 does not change the organ size of growth rate. As the plasticity strategy α increases, strategies are referred to as being more sensitive to R:FR decrease.</p>

<p>We combine this virtual plant modelling approach with evolutionary game theory (<xref ref-type="boxed-text" rid="pcbi.1007253.box001">Box 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g002">Fig 2</xref>) to analyse the extent to which variation in plastic responses could be the result of natural selection in different competitive environments. Different planting densities represent different competitive environments. Specifically, we search for convergence stable evolutionary stable strategies (cESS, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref034">34</xref>]) at five different planting densities. A cESS (with strategy value α*) is a strategy that is evolutionary and convergence stable, which means that i) a resident population with trait α* cannot be invaded by a rare mutant with a trait value of α (both locally and globally) and ii) a mutant that has a trait value closer to α* than the trait value of the resident, can invade the resident population, if the resident population has any other value than α* [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref035">35</xref>]. In theory, the cESS definition also often requires the resident population to reach carrying capacity before invasion of a rare strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref037">37</xref>]. However, in this study we assume that the resident population is at carrying capacity in the density tested as planting density is the environmental factor of interest.</p>

<p>Virtual plant canopies are simulated using a virtual plant model (previously described in ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>] and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]). From every canopy, the simulated total biomass (proxy for performance) of the middle plant of the canopy is used for analysis to simulate the invasion of a rare individual within a big population and to avoid edge effects. If the mutant has the same strategy as the surrounding population (the ‘resident’ population), the performance of this mutant represents the performance of the resident population (A). If the mutant has a different strategy as the resident population, the performance represents the performance of the mutant within the resident population (B). Within this study, we tested a range of plasticity strategy values α from 0 to 0.7 (0, 0.1, 0.2, 0.3, 0.4, 0.5, 0.6 and 0.7), that represented different shapes of the relative organ response to the R:FR signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A full matrix of combinations regarding the plasticity values for mutant within the resident population is simulated, resulting in 64 different canopies (C); eight canopies in which the mutant and resident population have the same plasticity strategy (green cells) and 56 canopies in which the mutant has a different plasticity strategy than the resident population (green cells with red dot). The 64 canopies representing this matrix are simulated for each planting density and for three scenarios (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref>). The performance of each mutant-resident combination is used to construct pairwise invasibility plots, based on the invasion exponent of the mutant in each cell (D). The invasion exponent of the mutants is calculated by log (mean(mutant performance)/mean(resident performance)).</p>

<p>To summarise, we ask the question to what extent natural selection may have acted on, or resulted in, variation in plastic responses by selecting different plastic shade avoidance response curves at different planting densities. We hypothesize that different plastic response curves will be selected at different planting densities if a given R:FR ratio signals a different level of future neighbour shading across these planting densities. In addition, we also explore the extent to which selection for plastic response curves depends on the cost trade-off associated with the petiole versus lamina responses to R:FR. The latter is expected to influence the selected plastic response curves because petiole and lamina responses have opposite effects on light capture and therefore influences plant performance.</p>

<title>Plant growth in monomorphic populations without petiole or lamina plastic responses</title>
<p>To illustrate how plant growth in the virtual Arabidopsis model depends on planting density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g003">Fig 3</xref>), we simulated the growth of plants within monomorphic vegetation stands consisting of plants that do not exhibit R:FR induced plasticity related to petiole elongation or lamina growth reduction (plasticity strategy <italic>α</italic> = 0 in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007253.e001">Eq 1</xref>) at different densities. During canopy development, interaction between leaves of neighbour plants (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref> and ref. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]) resulted in increased leaf angles and lamina growth resulted in increased total leaf area index (Supporting Information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Together these processes decreased the average R:FR ratio perceived by the plants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In addition to the decreasing R:FR ratio, light availability per individual plant also decreased during canopy development due to the presence of neighbour plants. Therefore, individual plant growth, represented by total accumulated biomass, was, at the end of canopy development, lower at high than at low densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Biomass allocation to different organs varied over time and varied with density because allocation of carbon to growing organs depended on the total available carbon due to light capture, and on the relative growth rates and the total number of growing organs at any time step (for model description see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref>). Under weak competition for light (low densities), the percentage of biomass allocated to the petioles decreased near the end of canopy development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) because sufficient carbon was available to reach potential growth of petioles and laminas and leftover carbon was additionally stored in laminas and the root. On the other hand, under strong competition for light (e.g. at high densities of 1600 and 6400 plants m<sup>-2</sup>) there was relative low carbon available for growth of all organs. From this low available carbon, a higher fraction was invested in petioles and relative little in laminas and the root, by which the percentage of carbon allocated to the petiole increased (although slightly at 6400 plants m<sup>-2</sup>).</p>

<title>The role of plastic responses in biomass allocation patterns and total plant biomass</title>
<p>To illustrate how the plasticity strategy (shape of the plastic response curve) affects the total plant biomass and the organ specific biomass allocation, monomorphic vegetation stands with different plasticity strategies were simulated (according to the Average scenario). Total plant biomass decreased, in general, with increasing plasticity strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), generally being highest for non-plastic individuals. This suggest that monomorphic populations (all individuals having the same plasticity) with low or no levels of plasticity generally perform better than populations with high levels of plasticity. There were exceptions to this trend, especially being that at the highest density (6400 plants m-2) biomass was higher at 0.2 plasticity level than for the 0 level (non-plastic plants). This result suggests that at very high densities some level of plasticity may have a benefit for population level light capture and performance.</p>

<p>During canopy development the plasticity strategy influenced the biomass allocation to petioles and laminas, which resulted in finally different percentages of biomass invested in petioles and laminas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g004">Fig 4B &amp; 4C</xref>). Plants with a high plasticity strategy (high α value) allocated relatively more biomass to the petioles and less to the laminas because these plants induced petiole and lamina plasticity at a relatively high R:FR earlier during canopy development. The differences between plasticity strategies on organ biomass allocation are represented in the organ-rank specific sizes, which embody the rosette phenotype of the plant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). The final percentage of biomass allocated to the petioles or laminas was different between planting densities because the dynamically changing R:FR influenced the plastic responses on top of the differences in light availability during growth and the organ specific growth rates, as illustrated previously (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g003">Fig 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Selection for cESS at different densities (Average lamina responses scenario)</title>
<p>To determine how natural selection may have acted on variation in the plastic response curve, and how this selection may depend on the competitive environment, we performed an evolutionary game theoretical analysis in which we searched for cESS (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec001">introduction</xref> for the definition) at five planting densities. The virtual plant model simulated the performance of a mutant within a resident population for different combinations of plasticity strategies for the mutant and the resident population (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) at five planting densities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These values were used to calculate the invasion exponents of the mutants, which were used to construct pairwise invasibility plots: positive and negative values of the invasion exponent relate to positive (blue) and negative (red) invasibility (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">5A–5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6A–6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6K–6O</xref>). To aid the interpretation of these pairwise invasibility plots and help identifying possible cESS, the values of the performance of the mutant within a resident population were interpolated with a non-linear smoother after which the invasion exponent of the mutant was calculated (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">5F–5J</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6F–6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6P–6T</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref> for details).</p>

<p>By definition, the identity line in the invasibility plots represents the case where the performance and strategy value of the mutant are identical to the performance and strategy value of the residents (1:1 line). A second isocline (if present) represents the plasticity values where the performance of the mutant equals that of the resident but without the mutant and resident having the same plasticity value. The point where the identity line and the isocline intersect corresponds to a singular strategy that could represent a cESS. In graphical terms the singular strategy is a cESS (with value a*) when moving up or down from the identity line no mutant has higher performance compared to the resident performance (positive invasion exponent of the mutant); and when starting with a resident population that is left of a*, a mutant closer to a* should have a higher performance than the resident population (the same holds for residents right from a*). The extent to which the mutant can be closer to a* is determined by the second isocline. If the region between the isocline and the identity line does not include the horizontal line through a*, a singular strategy cannot invade all resident populations directly, but only through a series of stepwise mutations. Alternatively, the singular strategy could represent a branching point or evolutionary repeller (see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref034">34</xref>] for an accessible treatment).</p>
<p>The pairwise invasibility plots based on the average petiole and lamina responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">Fig 5</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s004">S4 Fig</xref> for the confidence intervals) show possible cESS at all densities, except for 6400 m<sup>-2</sup>. The cESS per density corresponds with different plasticity strategy values; higher plasticity values were selected at higher planting densities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">Fig 5</xref>). This represents selection for plastic response curves with increased sensitivity for R:FR at higher densities. At the highest density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">Fig 5J</xref>) a second isoclines is not present, by which a possible cESS could not be determined within our tested values. However, both the discrete and smoothed invasibility plots suggest that selection would result in plants with a high plasticity strategy (high R:FR sensitivity) probably beyond the tested values. At 1600 plants m<sup>-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">Fig 5I</xref>) the pairwise invasibility plot has a complex shape around plasticity values of 0.5 and 0.6. The calculated values with their confidence intervals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s004">S4D Fig</xref>) show that the invasion exponents of plants with plasticity 0.5 and 0.6 in resident populations of 0.6 and 0.5 respectively are around zero, which means that more simulations are required to determine the precise value of the invasion exponents at that part of the pairwise invasibility plot.</p>

<sec id="sec008">
<title>cESS affected by the balance between petiole and lamina responses</title>
<p>Finally, we analysed the extent to which the above-mentioned cESS per density depended on the relation between petiole and lamina responses. In two additional scenarios, we either decreased (Weak scenario) or increased (Strong scenario) the lamina responses relative to petiole responses upon perception of R:FR (parameter <italic>n</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007253.e002">Eq 2</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref>). The balance between petiole and lamina responses, although both have the same plasticity strategy, relates to a trade-off regarding light capture during competition; increased light capture due to longer petioles versus decreased light capture due to smaller lamina area. Although not all pairwise invasibility plots identified a single cESS, the balance between petiole and lamina responses did clearly affect the mutant’s invasion exponents at different densities (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6</xref>). When lamina responses were relatively small, there was selection towards plants with a slightly higher plasticity strategy value, evidently at the three lowest densities (compare Weak scenario <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">Fig 6A–6J</xref> with Average scenario <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Higher plasticity strategy values relate to more sensitive plastic response curves. At 1600 plants m<sup>-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">Fig 6I</xref>) there were three intersections between isoclines and the identity line, which suggests that the invasibility environment has a complex shape. However, similar as for the Average scenario, the confidence intervals of the invasibility exponents of plants with plasticity strategy value of 0.3 up to 0.6 included zero (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s004">S4I Fig</xref>), which suggest that strong conclusions about the invasibility of these mutants within their corresponding resident populations cannot be made with confidence based on the data. Invasibility exponent values around zero suggest that not one single plasticity strategy with a narrow range value would eventually dominate the population, but that plants with a broader range of plasticity values could persist together. At 6400 plant m<sup>-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">Fig 6J</xref>) there was no second isoclines, which means that within the tested values no conclusive cESS could be determined. However, the invasibilty plot suggests that a potential cESS lies higher than the 0.7 tested here.</p>
<p>With relatively strong lamina responses there was selection for plants with a lower plasticity strategy compared to weak and average lamina responses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6</xref>). Although at 100 and 400 plants m<sup>-2</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">Fig 6P and 6Q</xref>) there was no conclusive cESS, we expect that plants with a zero or negative plasticity strategy would be selected for. Negative plasticity strategy values would indicate that plants would invest less carbon in petioles and more carbon in laminas in response to lower R:FR. At 6400 plants m<sup>-2</sup>, the second isocline crossed the identity line multiple times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">Fig 6T</xref>). This suggests again that the invasibility environment could be complex, and that not one single plasticity strategy would dominate a population at 6400 plants m<sup>-2</sup>. More simulations of various mutant-resident combinations within our tested range could verify the exact shape of the complex invasibility environment. Additional replication simulations could also verify that the observed complex invasion environments are not due to stochasticity in the model outcomes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we analysed if variation in shade avoidance plasticity could be the result of natural selection in different environments. We did this by testing if different planting densities selected for different plasticity strategies that embodied petiole and lamina responses to a decrease in the ratio between red and far-red light (R:FR). Using a virtual plant model allowed us to scale from organ-level plastic responses and variation therein, to whole-plant phenotype and performance at population level. Organ-level plasticity was induced by changes in the locally perceived R:FR ratio by using a plastic response curve, and allowed plants to dynamically change their phenotype during the growing season, depending on the distance, size and plasticity strategy of neighbour plants. The study shows that different planting densities can select for different response curves, as reflected in the different convergence stable evolutionary stable strategies (cESS); with increasing density more R:FR sensitive plastic responses are selected for. This is in spite of the fact that plants use R:FR variation as a signal of plant density itself. Our findings suggest that variation in shade avoidance responses and variation in signal-sensitivity observed in plants could, in some cases, be the result of selection processes at different planting densities. Since density typically varies over growing seasons and in space and different densities select for different response curves, this could have acted to maintain genetic variation in plastic responses, and could help explain the large variation in plastic responses that is observed within species. In addition, the study shows that the balance between lamina and petiole responses affects the selected plastic responses curves because petiole and lamina responses had antagonistic influences on light capture. Plants with lower signal sensitivity were selected for when inducing plastic responses had relatively high negative consequences for light capture.</p>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Higher R:FR sensitivity selected at higher densities</title>
<p>We hypothesized that different plasticity strategies would be selected at different planting densities if a given R:FR value signals different levels of future neighbour shading across planting densities. Our results show that selection would lead to different response curves at different planting density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">Fig 5</xref>). We argue that this may be partly due to the fact that the severity of future neighbour shading (expressed in reduced photosynthetic active radiation) that is signalled by a given R:FR value, differs between planting densities. The amount of photosynthetic active radiation received by laminas whose petioles perceived a R:FR around 1.0 decreased with density (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). In low density stands, a drop in R:FR during canopy development is mainly caused by self-shading, whereas in high density stands, R:FR reduction is more strongly determined by neighbour-shading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>]. This means that at different plant densities, a given R:FR ratio has different meanings regarding light availability and the level of impending light competition. R:FR is thus not a fully reliable cue for future shading over a range of densities. This prevents selection for one single plastic response curve over a range of densities. In low densities, when light competition is low and R:FR changes are mostly caused by the plant itself, a less sensitive response to a given R:FR is favourable to avoid relative long petioles and small laminas that have negative consequences for light capture and thus plant performance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref019">19</xref>]. In high densities, a more sensitive response curve is favourable to create long petioles that can avoid neighbour shading and increase light interception for plant growth and performance.</p>
<p>Our conclusion, that selection at different densities can result in variation in phenotypic plasticity if the signal is unreliable for future environmental conditions, agrees with previous studies that concluded that signals can have different meanings in different environments, such as R:FR values in open versus closed-canopy forests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref039">39</xref>], which could explain the observed variation in plasticity. Our model approach is different from these studies in that it focussed on a plastic response curve that represented the potential to induce relative trait changes instead of absolute trait values and value differences upon an environmental change. Our plastic response curve could be linked more readily to underlying genetics and physiological processes, as shown for Arabidopsis mutants deficient in transcriptional regulators or hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]. Consequently, our modelling approach represents a step forward in linking selection processes to the genetic basis and physiological processes underlying phenotypic plastic responses.</p>

<title>Balance between antagonistic responses affects plasticity selected for</title>
<p>We explored the extent to which selection for plastic response curves at different densities would depend on the trade-off between petiole and lamina responses that respectively would relate to increased and decreased light capture. Changing the strength of lamina responses relative to petiole responses influenced selection for the response curves over the full range of planting densities. Plants with higher plasticity strategy values were selected for when petiole responses were associated with lower lamina responses (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6</xref>, Weak scenario compared to the other scenarios). This indicates that when inducing plastic responses has lower negative consequences due to lower lamina growth reduction, selection can result in higher R:FR sensitivity. In contrast, plants with lower plasticity strategies were selected for when petiole elongation was associated with a stronger reduction of lamina growth in response to R:FR (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g005">5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g006">6</xref>, Strong scenario compared to other scenarios). Although at the lowest densities no cESS was found within the tested strategies, the pairwise invasibility plots suggest selection in the direction of plants with zero or negative responses to R:FR. A negative value would indicate that plants would invest less carbon in petiole growth and more in lamina growth in response to lower R:FR. However, based on experimental work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref033">33</xref>] we conclude that these inverse petiole and lamina responses to decreasing R:FR are not plausible in Arabidopsis. In general, we conclude that plants without plastic responses to R:FR would be selected for (i.e. plants with low sensitivity for R:FR) when performance consequences of showing plasticity are too negative. This is in accordance with other theories. For example, studies related to the evolution of phenotypic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref040">40</xref>] state that selection would favour non-plastic responses if costs of inducing plastic responses are high. In addition, error management theory [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref041">41</xref>] would predict that when phenotypic responses have high costs, selection would favour less sensitive response curves responsible for the plastic response. Altogether, our results are a quantitative example of the influence of cost trade-offs related to plastic responses on the selection for specific plastic responses.</p>

<title>Modelling choices within the virtual plant model</title>
<p>The 3D virtual Arabidopsis model did not include other light signals than R:FR that can signal neighbour proximity and future shading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref042">42</xref>]. For example the combination of low blue and low R:FR can indicate stronger shading and therefore can induce stronger shade avoidance responses than either light treatment alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref043">43</xref>]. Importantly, low blue and low R:FR signals can be created either by increased vegetation density of plants with roughly similar sizes or by tall trees in a closed-canopy forest. This suggests again that the reliability of an environmental cue to induce a response depends on the competitive environment. The location of signal detection on the plant can also affect reliability. For example, perception of low R:FR at the lamina tip is more reliable as cue for neighbour-proximity than R:FR perception at the petiole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>]. The regulation of multiple signals and their interactions are still poorly understood and need to be further studied to better understand selection for organ-specific plasticity under natural conditions.</p>
<p>In addition, besides petiole and lamina plasticity, our simulations did not consider responses to R:FR other than leaf angle increase (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec015">Methods</xref>). Other responses such as specific leaf area increase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref044">44</xref>], flowering time acceleration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref008">8</xref>], root development reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref045">45</xref>] and defence reduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref046">46</xref>] can also affect plant competition for light [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref048">48</xref>] and can thus influence selection for specific plastic response curves. We also did not consider any form of mechanical penalty on developing longer petioles, which would occur in natural systems and can affect plant performance in a density dependent manner. For example, the vulnerability to mechanical damage or hydraulic limitations for longer petioles can depend on density; in high density canopies, leaves can get mechanical support from surrounding leaves or protection against wind, by which plants have a lower risk of mechanical failure even if investment in supporting tissues is low. In low densities, this protection is low (or absent) and investment in longer petioles requires additional carbon allocation for petiole stability, which may affect final plant performance. If inducing phenotypic changes has higher fitness costs in low than in high planting density, we would expect an even larger effect of planting density on the selected response curves than what we found in the present study.</p>

<sec id="sec013">
<title>Evolutionary and ecological stable strategies</title>
<p>Although we considered a wide range of planting densities (regularly spaced), we did not consider that inter-plant distances within a natural vegetation is normally heterogeneous in space, which would make the light environment even more variable. Our result that different densities select for different plasticity strategies, suggests that when density is more variable in time and space transient evolutionary dynamics may prevail allowing different strategies to persist transiently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref049">49</xref>]. Performing an analysis in which the distance between neighbour plants within the vegetation is heterogeneous or the density between successive generations is variable, could be the subsequent step towards identifying if and how many genotypes could persist over time.</p>
<p>In theory, the definition of an cESS requires a population to reach carrying capacity before invasiveness of a rare mutant is tested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref037">37</xref>]. But in our analyses planting density was the environmental factor in question, and could thus not be changed as part of the analyses. We thus implicitly assumed that the different densities reflected different carrying capacities as determined by the overall environment (e.g. by resource availability). A consequence of the fact that different planting densities resulted in different cESS could be the following: if a given plastic response strategy is a cESS at a specific density, but the carrying capacity is at another density, then one may expect some kind of transience. Eventually it could be expected that different plastic response strategies will persist transiently if density changes strongly between years, or it could be expected that one single strategy would persist if the density stays constant around the carrying capacity of the population. It would be challenging and interesting to consider evolutionary and ecological dynamics while exploring the evolution of plastic responses in future studies.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Our analyses indicate that different planting densities can select for different plastic response curves that represent different R:FR sensitivity for petiole and lamina responses. This is consistent with the considerable genetic variation in shade avoidance responses observed in Arabidopsis and in several other species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref011">11</xref>]. This result seems in part to be explained by the reliability of the R:FR signal as a cue for future neighbour-shading that varies per density. In addition, selection for specific shapes of the plastic response curve is influenced by the trade-off between responses that have generally positive (petiole elongation) versus negative (lamina growth reduction) consequences for light capture and therefore plant performance. Combining virtual plant modelling and evolutionary game theory is a new step toward analysing how phenotypic plasticity, and the underlying sensitivity to an environmental signal, can affect the composition of genotypes over a range of environments. Promising next steps could be including responses to multiple light signals, considering environmental dependence of inducing phenotypic plasticity and regarding environments to be more variable in time and space.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>For this study, a functional-structural plant model of Arabidopsis rosette growth and development was utilised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>], built in the simulation platform GroIMP v1.5 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://sourceforge.net/projects/groimp/" xlink:type="simple">https://sourceforge.net/projects/groimp/</ext-link>). These types of virtual plant models have been proven strongly capable of predicting photosynthetic active radiation and R:FR distribution and plant architecture in stands of different planting densities for various species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref051">51</xref>], including Arabidopsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]. This Arabidopsis model can simulate competitive interactions between Arabidopsis genotypes that differ in sensitivity to R:FR, a key element of this study, and has been validated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]. The essence of this model is that all individual plants within the canopy grow as a function of the light they absorb, but at the same time create the light environment itself. Therefore, simulating various plant types with different phenotypic responses will determine the specific light environment within the canopy, which in turn will have repercussions for plant growth.</p>
<sec id="sec016">
<title>Basic model layout</title>
<p>Here we summarise the model description and specify the most important model components, assumptions and choices. More details can be found in ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]. Simulated Arabidopsis plants emerged from seeds and grew for 46 days into an adult rosette plant with multiple leaves (petiole and lamina) produced in a spiral pattern, and a single root. The leaves captured light for photosynthesis and were also sinks for carbon. The root only functioned as carbon sink and had no effect on aboveground growth. Organ initiation (e.g. time between leaf emergence) and geometric representation such as orientation of the leaves and the shape of the leaves were simulated using empirical relationships. Plant growth was driven by total carbon assimilation and organ-specific carbon allocation and plastic responses induced by the R:FR environment.</p>
<p>The simulated light source emitted photosynthetic active radiation, red and far-red light and in each model time-step (representing 24 hours) these stochastic emitted light rays were reflected, transmitted and absorbed by the petioles and laminas individually according to their wavelength-specific spectral properties. The light source emitted an R:FR ratio of 2.3, photosynthetic active radiation with an intensity of 220 μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>, and total daily light intensity was calculated based on 9 hours light per day, representing growth chamber conditions under which validation experiments had been carried out [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]. Plants were placed in regular places grids with different inter-plant distances to create different planting densities: 100, 400, 711, 1600 and 6400 plants m<sup>-2</sup>, which bracketed the densities in the validation experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]. Border effects were minimized by using the plot replication functionality of GroIMP; canopies were replicated 20 times in the <italic>x</italic> and <italic>y</italic> direction and light conditions were calculated and averaged for these 400 canopies.</p>
<p>The local light environment perceived by the individual plants (at the organ level) was created by the specific 3D structures of all plants within the canopy itself. Every individual organ absorbed light which enabled the model to calculate the light partitioning over all individual plants within the canopy. This way, we did not have to make assumptions about light partitioning over individuals with different trait values, as has been done in most other game theoretical light competition models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref052">52</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref054">54</xref>]. Thus, our model simulates competition for light as an emergent property and not an input parameter. Total accumulated biomass stored in root, laminas and petioles after 46 days of growth was used as a measure of plant performance. The rationale is that seasonal biomass scales with seasonal seed production, which for an annual plant like Arabidopsis equates to life time reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref055">55</xref>]. Generally for light-demanding species like Arabidopsis, under light competition this correlation is very strong [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref056">56</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref057">57</xref>]. Plants could not die during canopy development, they only stopped growing when light capture was insufficient.</p>
<p>The laminas individually absorbed photosynthetic active radiation that was converted into growth substrates via photosynthesis, assuming a negative exponential light response curve [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref058">58</xref>]. Total growth substrates per individual plant were summed into a central pool and subsequently partitioned over all growing organs through the relative sink strength principle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref059">59</xref>]. The relative sink strength of an organ was expressed as a fraction of total plant sink strength, and determined the demand for substrates for each organ in relation to its age. Organ sink strength was defined as its potential growth rate and calculated using the beta growth function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref060">60</xref>]. The beta growth function calculated the growth rate at organ age based on measured maximum organ size and duration of organ growth. Leaves senesced after 40 days of age. Thus primarily, the organs individually grew in time and 3D space based on the allocated substrates they received based on their relative sink strength. This means that when petioles receive more substrates due to an increase in relative sink strength, automatically other sinks such as leaves and roots will receive less.</p>

<title>Lamina and petiole plasticity</title>
<p>Lamina and petiole growth was influenced by shade avoidance responses that were induced by changes in the R:FR ratio. In this study we focus on the petiole elongation and downregulation of lamina growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref033">33</xref>]. Leaves also showed leaf angle responses due to neighbour proximity and R:FR conditions, see ref [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>], but this was not changed in between simulations. Leaves increased their angle with 16 degrees per time-step when the distance between neighbouring leaves was smaller than 2 mm (mimicking touching of leaves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref022">22</xref>]) or when R:FR perception at the lamina was below a threshold of 0.5. These settings were chosen based on wild-type Arabidopsis responses and allowed plants to induce leaf angle increase depending on planting density. Petiole elongation and lamina growth downregulation responses occurred every time-step based on the response curve that illustrates the relationship between relative organ growth and R:FR perception at the organ itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). The response curve was found by fitting an empirical relationship through experimentally obtained petiole elongation data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref031">31</xref>]:

<title>Pairwise invasibility plots to determine cESS</title>
<p>In general, evolutionary game theoretical principles assume that over evolutionary time the strategy of a population can change when a rare individual with a different strategy than the population can invade the standing population. A rare mutant with a different strategy than the standing population (also called ‘resident’ population) can invade the standing population when it has a higher performance than the average performance of individuals of the standing resident population, and in theory this invasion will lead to replacement of the population, provided that the change caused to the resident phenotype by the mutant is sufficiently small. With the virtual plant model we captured this by simulating different canopies in which the middle plant of the canopy has the same strategy or a different strategy (also called mutant) than the surrounding resident population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g002">Fig 2</xref>). Within this study the different strategies were represented by the shape of the plastic response curve with α ranging from 0 to 0.7 (See <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007253.e001">Eq 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g001">Fig 1</xref>). A full matrix of combinations of mutant within a resident population has been simulated, resulting in 64 different canopies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). In total, we replicated these 64 canopies 20 times at five densities and for three scenarios (see below <bold>Model scenarios</bold>), resulting in a total of 19.200 simulations.</p>
<p>The simulated performances of mutants within resident populations were used to calculate the invasion exponents of the mutants, calculated by log(mean(mutant performance)/mean(resident performance)). These invasion exponents resulted in pairwise invasibility plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1007253.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). To smooth out stochastic variation simulated by the virtual model, and to be able to get a more detailed estimation of a possible cESS, the simulated performances of the mutants within the resident populations were interpolated with a non-linear smoother after which the invasion components were calculated (i.e. a general additive model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1007253.ref061">61</xref>] using the ‘mgcv’ package in R <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf" xlink:type="simple">https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/mgcv/mgcv.pdf</ext-link>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1007253.s006">S1 Script</xref> for details).</p>

<title>Model scenarios</title>
<p>To explore if selection at different planting densities would result in different cESS, we simulated a full matrix of mutant-resident canopies with plasticity values ranging from 0 to 0.7 at five densities. In addition, we tested how the estimated cESS at different densities alter when changing the strength of lamina responses relative to petiole responses to R:FR. This was done through varying the parameter <italic>n</italic> (in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007253.e002">Eq 2</xref>), which determined the sink strength of the lamina and therefore the potential lamina growth. In the Average scenario we used the model settings as describe above in which average lamina responses were relatively equal to petiole responses (<italic>n</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007253.e002">Eq 2</xref> is set to 2). In the Weak scenario, we simulated a weak downregulation of the sink strength of the lamina by setting the value of <italic>n</italic> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1007253.e002">Eq 2</xref> to 1, and in the Strong scenario we simulated a strong downregulation of the lamina sink strength by setting <italic>n</italic> to 4. Comparing the three scenarios gives insight in the relative importance of the responses that have antagonistic consequences for light capture and therefore plant performance; petiole elongation has generally beneficial consequences by placing the leaf in a higher strata of the canopy versus lamina growth downregulation has generally negative consequences because the size of the lamina that is responsible for capturing light will decrease.</p>

<title>Simulated petiole length and lamina area of individual leaves of plants with different plasticity strategies after growing 46 days in monomorphic vegetation stands at five densities.</title>
<p>During canopy development the R:FR ratio within the canopy changed dynamically influencing the growth of the petioles (A-E) and laminas (F-J), depending on their plasticity strategy value (colours, see legend J) and the density (panels in columns). Petiole and lamina sizes are different between densities due to the light availability which drives organ growth. Plants with low plasticity strategy values have relative small petioles and big leaf area, while plants with high plasticity strategies have long petioles and smaller lamina area. Data represent the mean ± SD (n = 20).</p>

<title>Perceived light by laminas whose petioles perceived a R:FR ratio between 0.95 and 1.05, at five different planting densities.</title>
<p>Light is quantified as simulated photosynthetic active radiation (μmol m<sup>-2</sup> s<sup>-1</sup>). Data used from plants which grew for 46 days in vegetation stands in which all showed no petiole or lamina plasticity (Using the model settings related to the Average scenario). Per planting density a total of 283, 418, 438, 213 and 157 leaves for respectively densities of 100, 400, 711, 1600, 6400 plants m<sup>-2</sup> were used for this analysis. Triangles illustrate mean, boxplots illustrate median with upper and lower quartile, wiskers at quartile ± 1.5*interquartile range and outliers, created by R v3.2.0.</p>
