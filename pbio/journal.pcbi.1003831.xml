<abstract>
<p>Adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP) is generally regarded as a substrate for energy currency and protein modification. Recent findings uncovered the allosteric function of ATP in cellular signal transduction but little is understood about this critical behavior of ATP. Through extensive analysis of ATP in solution and proteins, we found that the free ATP can exist in the compact and extended conformations in solution, and the two different conformational characteristics may be responsible for ATP to exert distinct biological functions: ATP molecules adopt both compact and extended conformations in the allosteric binding sites but conserve extended conformations in the substrate binding sites. Nudged elastic band simulations unveiled the distinct dynamic processes of ATP binding to the corresponding allosteric and substrate binding sites of uridine monophosphate kinase, and suggested that in solution ATP preferentially binds to the substrate binding sites of proteins. When the ATP molecules occupy the allosteric binding sites, the allosteric trigger from ATP to fuel allosteric communication between allosteric and functional sites is stemmed mainly from the triphosphate part of ATP, with a small number from the adenine part of ATP. Taken together, our results provide overall understanding of ATP allosteric functions responsible for regulation in biological systems.</p>

<p>The endogenous ATP can be regarded as a substrate and an allosteric modulator in cellular signal transduction. We analyzed the properties of allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites and found that the allosteric ATP-binding sites are less conserved than the substrate ATP-binding sites. Allosteric ATP molecules adopt both compact and extended conformations in the allosteric binding sites, while substrate ATP molecules adopt extended conformations in the substrate binding sites. The two different conformational characteristics may be responsible for ATP to exert distinct biological functions in cell signaling. In addition, to our knowledge, this study illuminates the first comprehensive atomic level investigations of ATP access to the corresponding allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites. Specially, both the adenine and triphosphate parts of ATP could be an allosteric trigger to propagate the signal from the allosteric to functional sites. The detailed mechanism presented in this study may apply to other enzymes in complex with allosteric or substrate ATP molecules, and provide important insights for the molecular basis of ATP acting as a substrate and an allosteric modulator in cell signaling.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adenosine-5’-triphosphate (ATP), the naturally occurring nucleotide used in cells as a coenzyme, serves as the “energy currency of the cell” in intracellular energy metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Knowles1">[1]</xref>. In eukaryotes, the majority of ATP is manufactured in the chloroplasts (for plants) or in the mitochondria (for both plants and animals) as a result of cellular processes including fermentation, respiration and photosynthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Campbell1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Bours1">[3]</xref>. The well-known functional role of ATP in cells is the hydrolysis of its high-energy phosphate bond to provide energy for biological processes. In addition, intracellular protein modification via ATP as a substrate, known as phosphorylation, orchestrates a fine-tuned network for the cell to switch on diverse signal transduction processes, such as proliferation, gene transcription, metabolism, kinase cascade activation, and membrane transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Johnson1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although ATP is one of the most productive endogenous ligands in cells, striking evidence from clinical practice demonstrates that intravenous or oral administration of ATP may have pivotal effects on the treatment of pathological processes, including the regulation of diverse processes (coronary blood flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Tokuyama1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Miyagawa1">[7]</xref>, neurotransmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Cao1">[8]</xref>, muscle contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Nyberg1">[9]</xref>, and inflammation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Trautmann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Idzko1">[11]</xref>), the protection of the myocardium and the maintenance of the homeostasis of the cardiovascular system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Cohen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Sollevi1">[13]</xref>. The usage of ATP indicates that ATP could play even more roles in physiological/pathological regulation.</p>
<p>Recently, the determination of allosteric ATP-binding sites provided new evidences that ATP can act as an allosteric modulator regulating protein function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Huang1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Huang2">[15]</xref>. For instance, in the mismatch repair initiation protein MutS, ATP binding to the nucleotide-binding site triggers long-range interactions between the ATPase and DNA-binding domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Lamers1">[16]</xref>. In the chaperonin GroEL, binding of ATP to a unique pocket in the equatorial domains of GroEL allosterically initiates a series of conformational changes triggering the association of the cochaperonin GroES <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Wang1">[17]</xref>. As a extracellular messager, ATP was confirmed to allosterically involve in activation mechanism of transmembrane protein P2X receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-North1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Hattori1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>The role of ATP in cell signaling is known to serve not only as a substrate but also as an allosteric modulator. However, little is understood about this critical behavior of ATP in allosteric binding sites. The dynamic process of ATP access to the allosteric and substrate binding sites and the allosteric mechanism for ATP molecules are also unclear. Here, we addressed these questions by combining bioinformatic analyses, molecular dynamics (MD) and nudged elastic band (NEB) simulations. The results suggest that allosteric ATP-binding sites have evolved along different evolutionary pathways compared to the extremely conserved substrate ATP-binding sites. ATP molecules adopt both compact and extended conformations in the allosteric binding sites but conserves extended conformations in the substrate binding sites, and both compact and extended conformations of ATP are dominant in solution. We follow the preference of ATP access to the allosteric and substrate binding sites at atomic resolution and explore the mechanism of ATP-triggered allostery. Understanding the regulatory mechanism of ATP in biological systems as a substrate and an allosteric modulator in cell signaling is of fundamental importance.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Thirteen proteins that are allosterically modulated by ATP, constituting the ATP allosteric dataset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003831-t001">Table 1</xref>), were selected from the Allosteric Database (ASD v2.0) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Huang2">[15]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). As enumerated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s006">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s007">S2</xref>, the sequence identities and the structural differences (root-mean-square deviation, RMSD) between these allosteric proteins are predominately below 30% and larger than 20 Å, respectively. The phylogenetic tree constructed for the 13 allosteric proteins displayed a wide distribution of these allosteric proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These data indicated their low redundancy. The ATP substrate dataset (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s008">Table S3</xref>), composed of 24 co-crystal structures of protein-ATP complexes that exhibit structural diversity, was derived from the Protein Database Bank (PDB) database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Berman1">[20]</xref>.</p>

<title>Allosteric ATP-binding sites are less conserved than substrate ATP-binding sites</title>
<p>To elucidate differences in the evolutionary characteristics of allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites, we systematically explored the sequence conservation of ATP-binding sites in the ATP allosteric and substrate datasets. Sequence conservation scores for residues in the allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites as well as in the surface of proteins were assessed by means of multiple sequence alignments of homologous sequences (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, residues in the allosteric ATP-binding sites, with the average conservation score of 0.63, were less conserved compared to residues in the substrate ATP-binding sites, with the average conservation score of 0.83 (<italic>P</italic> = 1.2×10<sup>−3</sup>). Yet, the residues in the allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites are markedly more conserved compared to residues in the rest of the surface; the average conservation score of residues in the latter is 0.31 (<italic>P</italic> = 9.9×10<sup>−7</sup>). Furthermore, the average conservation score distributions of residues in the allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites as well as in the surface for each protein sequence were analyzed. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, remarkably, the average conservation score of residues in the allosteric ATP-binding sites show a wide distribution in a range from 0.4 to 0.8. These results are consistent with a previous study, as done by Yang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Yang1">[21]</xref>, that allosteric sites are evolutionarily variable against catalytic sites. Taken together, these data indicate that allosteric ATP-binding sites have evolved along different evolutionary pathways compared to the conserved substrate ATP-binding sites.</p>

<title>Pre-existence of the compact and extended conformations of ATP in solution</title>
<p>Given the significant structural differences between the allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites that may accommodate diverse ATP conformations, we first simulated the ATP in solution to explore its conformational preferences in the unbound state. The landscapes with the reaction coordinates of distance (defined by the distance from the P<sub>γ</sub> atom to the centroid of adenine moiety) and angle (defined by the centroids of triphosphate, ribose and adenine moieties) were calculated on ATP conformations (200,000 snapshots) from the MD trajectory. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g003">Figure 3</xref>, two major conformation regions exist in solution, one region with distance values from 6.5 Å to 8.5 Å and angles between 100° and 130°, the other with distance values from 9.3 Å to 12.8 Å and angles ranging between 90° and 140°. An analysis of the average structures of ATP corresponding to the two conformation regions indicates that the former region represents the compact conformation of ATP, whereas the latter represents the extended conformation. These data suggest the pre-existence of the compact and extended conformations of ATP in solution.</p>

As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s001">Figure S1</xref>, the average RMSD value for the 13 allosteric ATP molecules is 1.83 Å. By contrast, the average RMSD value for the 24 substrate ATP molecules is 1.37 Å (<italic>P</italic> = 7.1×10<sup>−5</sup>), revealing smaller conformational variations of ATP in the substrate binding sites. This distinction could be because of the differences in the evolutionary conservation of the allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites. To further elucidate the structural propensities of ATP molecules in the allosteric and substrate binding sites, we mapped the bound ATP molecules in the allosteric and substrate datasets to the MD-generated ATP conformations. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g003">Figure 3</xref>, ATP molecules in the allosteric binding sites show a wide distribution with the distance values ranging from 5.7 Å to 12.2 Å. Inspection of these ATP molecules reveals that seven cases adopt compact conformations (PDB: 1FA9, 1I2D, 1PFK, 3HWS, 2XCW, 3R1R, and 4DW1), while the remaining six cases adopt the extended conformations (PDB: 1W7A, 4AT1, 4GFH, 2HCB, 2JJX, and 1KP8). These data suggest that allosteric ATP molecules can adopt both the compact and extended conformations in the allosteric binding sites of proteins. However, as for the substrate ATP molecules, the analysis reveals that they adopt the extended conformations in the substrate binding sites of proteins.</p>

<p>The functions of ATP <italic>in vivo</italic> are triggered by the protein transitioning from the free unbound state to the bound state. The uridine monophosphate (UMP) kinase of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> was chosen as a good model to investigate the dynamic process of ATP binding. This kinase not only binds ATP as a substrate in its active site but also has allosteric ATP-binding sites near the center of the hexameric structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Meier1">[22]</xref>. This property of the kinase permits exploration of which site ATP preferentially binds to in solution. The UMP kinase catalyzes the transfer of the γ-phosphoryl group from ATP to UMP in the active site, which is essential for cellular growth in bacteria; the catalytic reaction is regulated by ATP in the allosteric site.</p>
<p>We first examined the sequence conservation of residues in the allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites of UMP kinase family. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s009">Table S4</xref>, allosteric ATP-binding sites (average conservation score = 0.44) are significantly less conserved compared to substrate ATP-binding sites (average conservation score = 0.77) (<italic>P</italic> = 6.1×10<sup>−4</sup>), but more conserved than the rest of surface residues (average conservation score = 0.25) (<italic>P</italic> = 2.2×10<sup>−3</sup>). The structural characteristics of ATP binding at the allosteric and active sites of UMP kinase were then explored using MD simulations.</p>

<title>Structural characteristics of ATP in the allosteric sites of UMP kinase</title>
<p>In the allosteric ATP-binding sites, three identical ATP molecules were bound at the interfaces between neighboring subunits in the homotrimeric structure of the UMP kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Meier1">[22]</xref>, and their conformational behavior was very similar in the MD simulations.

<p>The analysis of interaction energies between UMP kinase and ATP every 10 ns interval trajectories revealed that the interaction energies converged after 50 ns MD simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To elucidate the critical residues for binding the allosteric ATP molecule, the decomposition of interaction energies between each residue in subunits A and B of the UMP kinase and ATP were averaged over the simulation of the ATP-bound state in the last 10 ns MD trajectories. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, major favorable energy contributions come from Arg99, Asn107, Ala110, Arg117 and Tyr126 in subunit A of the UMP kinase and Arg117 and His120 in subunit B. The stabilization energies stem mainly from the positively charged residues Arg99 (A), Arg117 (A, B) and His120 (B). These indicate that the electrostatic interactions are primarily responsible for the binding of the allosteric ATP molecule. To further uncover its binding mode, the most representative structure was extracted from the MD trajectory using a cluster analysis. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, three basic residues, Arg99 (A), Arg117 (A, B) and His120 (B), protrude to interact with the negatively charged phosphate groups. The γ-phosphate group is hydrogen-bonded to the side chain of Tyr126 (A), whereas the guanine moiety interacts through bifurcated hydrogen bonds with backbone atoms of Asn107 (A) and Ala110 (A). The guanine ring is sandwiched by two hydrophobic side chains Glu111 (A) and Ile114 (B). The most prominent feature is the formation of an internal hydrogen bond involving an oxygen atom of the γ-phosphate group and the hydroxyl group of the ribose.</p>

<title>Structural characteristics of ATP in the substrate sites of the UMP kinase</title>
<p>For the substrate binding site, ATP was probed at subunit A of the UMP kinase. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, an analysis of the interaction energy between ATP and UMP reveals that the major favorable energy contributions originate from Lys10, Ser12, Arg57 and Lys161.

The guanine ring is encapsulated by the highly conserved motif 165-DGVFTSDP-172 of the UMP kinase. In the substrate binding site, the polyphosphate group of the ATP molecule points to the phosphate group of UMP in an end-to-end alignment. In this optimal organization, a direct nucleophilic attack by the terminal oxygen atom of UMP on the γ-phosphate group of ATP occurs.

<title>NEB reveals the main pathway for the binding of an allosteric ATP molecule</title>
<p>The pathway ATP takes from the solution to the allosteric binding site in the UMP kinase was investigated by twenty nudged elastic band (NEB) simulations from different initial states of ATP in solution. The energy landscape for the pathway was calculated using the MM/PBSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Hou1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Miller1">[27]</xref> approach based on twenty-two images taken from each NEB trajectory. The dynamic behavior of the ATP binding process in the twenty simulations converged. Thus, one of the twenty trajectories was selected to probe the binding process. Upon examination of the representative snapshots, the process for the binding of allosteric ATP molecule was described by six states which are characterized in three main stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

<title>The energy landscape of ATP binding to the allosteric ATP-binding site of the UMP kinase as a function of the progress of ATP binding.</title>
<p>(A) The six snapshots of the allosteric ATP binding pathway represent the following configurations: A, the unbound state; B, the “encounter complex”; C, an intermediate state featuring unfavorable electrostatic repulsions between Arg117<sup>A,B</sup> and adenine; D, the relatively high-energy state; E; an intermediate state featuring favorable electrostatic interactions between the UMP kinase and ATP; F, the fully bound state.

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003831.g005" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The first stage is relevant to the binding of the triphosphate moiety of ATP and the formation of an encounter complex. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g005">Figure 5A</xref> represents the unbound state, in which no direct contact between ATP and the UMP kinase occurs. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g005">Figure 5B</xref> manifests the encounter complex between ATP and the UMP kinase in which the ATP triphosphate moiety interacts with the positively charged residue Arg99 (A) of the UMP kinase. The binding is a favorable process given the electrostatic attraction.</p>
<p>The second stage is associated with the binding of the nucleoside moiety of ATP and the formation of an intermediate structure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g005">Figure 5C</xref>, as the triphosphate moiety engages in the interactions with Arg99 (A), the adenine base flips inward and participates in an aromatic-aromatic interaction with His120 (B) in the allosteric ATP-binding site. However, because of the rollover of the adenine base, unfavorable electrostatic repulsions occur between the amino group of the adenine ring and the positively charged residue Arg117 (A, B). With further binding of ATP, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, the aromatic-aromatic interaction between the adenine moiety and His120 (B) is abrogated, and the electrostatic repulsions strengthen between the amino group of the adenine moiety and Arg117 (A, B), which results in the highest energy state corresponding to the intermediate structure. In this process, the energy difference between the highest (state D) and lowest energy (state B) states of binding is 30.2 kcal/mol (the energy barrier of each NEB simulation was listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s010">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>The third stage involves further binding of the nucleoside moiety of ATP and the formation of a product structure. With the movement of ATP inward into the allosteric site, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, Arg99 (A) and Arg117 (A) partake in favorable electrostatic interactions with the triphosphate moiety of ATP, and the unfavorable electrostatic repulsions between the amino group of the adenine moiety and Arg117 (A, B) is abolished. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g005">Figure 5F</xref>, further movement of ATP enables the amino group of the adenine moiety to form two hydrogen bonds with Asn107 (A) and Ala110 (A), respectively. This hydrogen bonding is coupled with the basic residues Arg99 (A), Arg117 (A, B) and His120 (B) protruding to interact with the negatively charged triphosphate moiety of ATP, resulting in the lowest energy state corresponding to the product structure.</p>

<p>The first stage encompasses the binding of the adenine moiety of ATP and the formation of the encounter complex. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g006">Figure 6A</xref> depicts the unbound state in which ATP does not interact directly with the UMP kinase. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows the encounter complex between ATP and the UMP kinase in which the 165-DGVFTSDP-172 motif of UMP kinase is involved in the recognition of the adenine moiety of ATP. This conserved motif has been determined in bacterial UMP kinases, and the related aspartate and glutamate kinases also specifically recognize the adenosine nucleobase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-MarcoMartin1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Jensen1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the second stage, the triphosphate moiety of ATP follows the encounter complex and is involved in an intermediate structure. With the adenine moiety of ATP encased by the 165-DGVFTSDP-172 motif of the UMP kinase, the triphosphate moiety moves into the active site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). With further movement of the triphosphate moiety, it participates in polar interactions with Lys10, Ser12 and Lys161. In this process, the loss of the desolvation energy of ATP is larger than the van der Waals and electrostatic contributions from the interactions between ATP and the UMP kinase. This interaction produces an unfavorable binding process and yields the highest energy state corresponding to the intermediate structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In this process, the energy difference between the highest (state D) and lowest energy (state B) states of binding is 22.8 kcal/mol (the energy barrier of each NEB simulation was listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s010">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p>The third stage is pertinent to the further binding of the triphosphate and adenine moieties of ATP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) and the formation of the product structure. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g006">Figure 6F</xref>, the complete binding of ATP enables the amino group of the adenine moiety to interact with the backbone carbonyl group of Phe168 via hydrogen bonding, and the triphosphate moiety displays polar interactions with Lys10, Ser12, Arg57 and Lys161. In this process, the van der Waals and electrostatic contributions from the interactions between ATP and the UMP kinase prevail over the unfavorable desolvation energy of ATP, resulting in a favorable binding process and yielding the lowest energy state corresponding to the product structure.</p>

<title>The allosteric mechanism for ATP molecules</title>
<p>Although the above analyses elucidated the binding sites and the related binding process of allosteric ATP molecules, the mechanism of allostery for these identical ATP molecules in different allosteric sites of proteins remains unclear. According to the structural view of allostery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Tsai1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Lu1">[31]</xref>, allostery works by the propagation of strain energy created at the allosteric site by ligand binding, post-translation modifications, or mutations of the functional site. Guided by this principle, we investigated which part of ATP (the adenine, ribose, or triphosphate) triggers allostery. Therefore, we first analyzed the detailed interactions between each part of ATP and the corresponding protein. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003831-t002">Table 2</xref>, the analysis revealed that the contributions of the interactions stem mainly from the adenine and triphosphate parts of ATP. Subsequently, a comprehensive structural analysis of the identical protein between the allosteric ATP-bound and unbound structures was performed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Nussinov1">[32]</xref>. Ten out of thirteen allosteric ATP unbound structures were retrieved from the PDB. A protein 3D structural alignment of the allosteric ATP-bound and unbound structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g007">Figure 7</xref>) displayed that the local structure of proteins proximal to the adenine portion of ATP shows significant conformational change with limited conformational change proximal to the ribose and triphosphate parts of ATP in two cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g007">Figure 7A–B</xref>). This finding is indicative of an allosteric trigger by the adenine part of ATP. By contrast, the local structure of the proteins shows significant conformational change in the proximity of the triphosphate portion of ATP with limited conformational change in the proximity of the adenine and ribose portions of ATP in the remaining eight cases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g007">Figure 7C–J</xref>). This finding is indicative of a trigger by the triphosphate part of ATP.</p>

<p>For example, in the P2X<sub>4</sub> ion channel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), residues Asn296, Arg298, and Lys316 from both the unbound (PDB: 4DW0) and ATP-bound (PDB: 4DW1) structures engage in hydrogen bonding/electrostatic interactions with the triphosphate in ATP, revealing marginal conformational changes proximal to the triphosphate in ATP. However, the conformation of Arg143 in the two structures shows prominent variation, giving rise to the markedly local conformational change between the head and dorsal-fin domains proximal to the adenine portion of ATP. This local conformational change is transmitted from the lower body domain to transmembrane domains 1 (TM1) and TM2, and leads to the opening of the ion channel pore because of the outward flexing of TM1 and TM2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Hattori1">[19]</xref>. In addition, biochemical experiments demonstrated that GTP and UTP are unable to activate P2X<sub>4</sub> receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Gever1">[33]</xref>, further supporting the notion that the adenine portion of ATP is the trigger of allostery. In the case of human liver glycogen phosphorylase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s004">Figure S4B</xref>), Tyr75 from both the unbound (PDB: 1FC0, inactive state) and ATP-bound (PDB: 1FA9, active state) docked structures forms hydrogen bonding interactions with the adenine in ATP, revealing marginal conformational changes in the proximity of the adenine in ATP. However, residues Glu195, Phe196, and Arg309 proximal to the triphosphate in ATP show pronounced conformational changes, which propagate to the active site to switch the gate (residues 280–289) from the “closed” position to the “open” position, allowing glycogen and pyridoxal phosphate access to the catalytic site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Rath1">[34]</xref>.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>ATP is generally utilized by protein kinases or enzymes as the source of phosphate groups to phosphorylate their substrates. Thus, ATP commonly acts as a substrate by virtue of its hydrolysis. Conversely, compared with the overwhelming number of protein-substrate ATP complexes, the few proteins capitalize on ATP as an allosteric modulator to regulate their functional activity. This may be ascribed to the dearth of ATP allosteric sites in protein surfaces to accommodate ATP binding. Simultaneously, the question arises as to why the co-evolution of ATP and optimized allosteric sites did not occur on a more extensive scale. Evolution seemingly selected for other allosteric regulatory mechanisms such as allosteric post-translational modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Nussinov2">[35]</xref>. The commonality of the allosteric phosphorylation mechanism may indicate the advantages of a covalent linkage which also allows a higher residence time.</p>
<p>According to ASD v2.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Huang2">[15]</xref>, allosteric proteins in which ATP has been biologically confirmed to serve as an allosteric modulator are 78 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s011">Table S6</xref>) regardless of species. Taking into account the species, the available co-crystal structures of proteins-allosteric ATP complexes, and the structural diversity of co-crystal structures, only thirteen distinct co-crystal structures of protein-allosteric ATP or its derivative complexes are available. In humans, all of these allosteric proteins are located inside the cells with the exception of the P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor which is expressed on the cell surface. These data suggest that ATP can also act as an allosteric modulator to regulate protein function inside cells. As to extracellular regulation, all P2X subtypes (P2X<sub>1-7</sub>) are membrane ion channels that allosterically respond to the binding of extracellular ATP (only the crystal structure of the P2X<sub>4</sub> receptor-allosteric ATP complex has been described) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Hattori1">[19]</xref>. The physiological functions of the seven P2X receptor subtypes include modulation of synaptic transmission, contraction of smooth muscle, secretion of chemical transmitters and the regulation of the immune response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-North1">[18]</xref>. ATP drugs, mostly as adenosine disodium triphosphate tablets, are frequently used in the treatment of progressive muscular atrophy, myocardial diseases, hepatitis (as an adjuvant therapy) and heart failure. Based on the present study, we suggest that extracellular ATP molecules, such as ATP drugs, serve as allosteric modulators in extracellular signaling by activating the P2X receptors, a suggestion supported by the functional roles of ATP drugs corresponding to the pharmacology of P2X receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Gever1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>We systematically analyzed the amino acid composition of allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites. In the substrate ATP-binding sites, the amino acid composition is conserved as a consequence of high sequence-similarities of enzymes. However, the composition of allosteric ATP-binding sites varies. The sequence variability in the allosteric ATP-binding sites is likely to be linked to the fine-tuning of allosteric regulation commensurate with function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Huang3">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-General1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>The conformational diversity of allosteric and substrate ATP molecules may reflect the properties of binding sites. Overall, substrate ATP molecules show smaller conformational changes, indicative of the conserved substrate ATP-binding sites of enzymes. In contrast, allosteric ATP molecules show larger conformational changes, indicative of the structural variations of allosteric ATP-binding sites. These differences in structural propensities of ATP may be attributed to the different functional roles of ATP in the allosteric and substrate sites. The structural analysis reveals that all ATP molecules in the substrate binding sites conserve extended conformations whereas ATP molecules in the allosteric binding sites may adopt compact conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Among the thirteen allosteric cases, more than half of ATP molecules regulate protein functions with compact conformations encapsulated in deep hydrophobic pockets (ribonucleotide reductase, P2X<sub>4</sub> ion channel, cytosolic 5’-nucleotidase II, glycogen phosphorylase, phosphofructokinase 1, ATP sulfurylase and ClpX). However, the remaining six ATP molecules in GroEL, MutS, DnaA, DNA Topoisomerase II, UMP kinase and Aspartate carbamoyltransferase function as allosteric modulators with extended conformations, which is similar to ATP conformations in the substrate binding sites. Remarkably, the allosteric binding sites of GroEL, MutS, DnaA and DNA Topoisomerase II have dual effects on allosteric regulation and ATPase activities, ATP molecules in the sites allosterically induce protein functions and then are hydrolyzed to ADP when the allosteric regulations are complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Lamers1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Wang1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Erzberger1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Schmidt1">[42]</xref>. To carry out both allosteric and substrate functions, ATP molecules thus adopt extended conformations in the sites. In UMP kinase, ATP molecules allosterically bind at the protein interfaces between neighboring subunits. The subunits interfaces are narrow, leading to the bound allosteric ATP molecules in extended conformations. Despite the overall extended conformations, the triphosphate moiety of ATP is in the curved conformation in the allosteric binding site, resulting in the formation of internal hydrogen bonds between the γ-phosphate group of triphosphate and the hydroxyl group of ribose. In aspartate carbamoyltransferase, the allosteric ATP binding site is rather flat in the surface of enzyme, with the adenine and ribose moieties of ATP occupying the cavity and the triphosphate moiety of ATP drifting towards the solvent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The feature of allosteric site and the interaction mode between the enzyme and ATP render the allosteric ATP molecule in extended conformation. Overall, the features of allosteric ATP-binding sites in allosteric proteins and the functional roles of allosteric ATP molecules in allosteric proteins determine the conformations of ATP, compact or extended conformations, in allosteric sites. An MD simulation of ATP in solution indicates that the conformational ensemble of ATP in its unbound state is primarily characterized by two states: the compact conformation and the extended conformation. These two states agree with the structural analysis.</p>
<p>The UMP kinase was selected to explore the dynamic process of the access of ATP to the corresponding allosteric and substrate binding sites because this enzyme possesses both the allosteric and substrate ATP-binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Meier1">[22]</xref>. NEB simulations revealed markedly different pathways. Notably, the conformational rollover of ATP was observed in the process of ATP binding to the allosteric site but not to the substrate site. This may reflect the differences in the volume and shape of the allosteric and substrate binding sites of the UMP kinase. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, the UMP kinase substrate ATP-binding sites point toward the solvent, and the cavity is spacious which may facilitate the access of ATP to the UMP kinase substrate binding sites. Conversely, the allosteric ATP-binding sites are located at the subunit interface. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003831-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, the γ-phosphate moiety of ATP points toward the solvent, whereas the nucleoside moiety points toward the cavity interior. As a consequence, the cavity of the allosteric binding sites is narrow, hindering the access of ATP to the allosteric binding sites. The calculated barrier of ATP binding to its substrate site is lower than that to the allosteric site (22.8 kcal/mol versus 30.2 kcal/mol, respectively), and the total interaction energy between the UMP kinase and the substrate ATP molecule is also lower than that between the UMP kinase and the allosteric ATP molecule (−59.3 kcal/mol versus −50.8 kcal/mol, respectively). Collectively, these data suggest that, in solution, ATP preferentially binds to substrate sites of the UMP kinase.</p>
<p>Once an allosteric ATP molecule occupies the allosteric binding site of a specific protein, the source of the allosteric trigger from ATP to fuel allosteric communication between allosteric and active sites may differ. Our structural analysis revealed that a majority of proteins (80%) select the triphosphate in ATP as an allosteric trigger, whereas a smaller number of proteins (20%) opt for the adenine in ATP as an allosteric trigger. The significant difference between the contributions of the allosteric trigger from ATP indicates that the conformational flexibility of the triphosphate in ATP endows ATP with various regulatory mechanisms and may play a crucial role in the initiation of allostery.</p>

<title>ATP allosteric and substrate datasets</title>
<p>We built two types of ATP datasets: allosteric and substrate. First, we constructed an annotated ATP-allosteric dataset collected from a hand-curated dataset.

<title>Simulation systems</title>
<p>In the simulation of ATP in aqueous solution, the structure of ATP in complex with Mg<sup>2+</sup>, [ATP:Mg]<sup>2−</sup>, was extracted from the UMP kinase of <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> (PDB: 2JJX) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Meier1">[22]</xref> as previously suggested by Li <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Li1">[57]</xref> in the simulation of ATP in water solvent.

<p>To perform unbiased simulations of the allosteric and substrate ATP-bound UMP kinase, the bound UMP-ATP complex was modeled on the basis of the crystal structure of the <italic>Bacillus anthracis</italic> UMP kinase (PDB: 2JJX) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Meier1">[22]</xref>.

<title>MD simulations</title>
<p>To remove bad contacts in the solvated systems for the MD simulations, the steepest descent and conjugate gradient algorithm energy minimization methods were used. Energy minimization of the water molecules and counterions with a positional restraint of 500 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> in the complex was first performed; the steepest descent method was applied for the first 2,000 steps, and then the conjugated gradient method was used for the subsequent 3,000 steps. Afterward, the entire system was minimized without any restraints; the steepest descent method was used for the first 4,000 steps, and then the conjugated gradient method was used for the subsequent 6,000 steps. After minimization, each system was heated gradually from 0 K to 300 K within 200 ps. This was followed by constant temperature equilibration at 300 K for 500 ps, with a positional restraint of 10 kcal mol<sup>−1</sup> Å<sup>−2</sup> in the complex in a canonical ensemble (NVT). The structures from the final stage of equilibration were chosen as the initial conformations for subsequent MD simulations.</p>
<p>A total of 2 microsecond (µs) MD simulations were performed for the simulation of ATP in a fully solvated water environment, and each of 100 ns MD simulations was conducted for the ATP bound and unbound UMP kinase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003831.s012">Table S7</xref>). All simulations were performed with periodic boundary conditions using the NPT ensemble. Langevin dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Wu2">[63]</xref> was used to maintain the temperature at 300 K with a collision frequency of 1 ps<sup>−1</sup>, and a Langevin piston was assigned to maintain the pressure at 1 atm. An integration step of 2 fs was set for the MD simulations. The long-range electrostatic interactions were incorporated by using the particle mesh Ewald method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003831-Darden1">[64]</xref> with a cubic fourth-order B-spline interpolation and by setting the direct sum tolerance to 10<sup>−5</sup>.

Minimization of the entire system with the start and the end point structures fixed provides a minimum energy path. Each image between the two point structures is connected to the previous and next image by ‘springs’ along the path that maintain each image from sliding down the energy landscape onto adjacent images.

<p>In all NEB calculations, the end point was selected from the equilibrated ATP bound UMP kinase. The starting point was the source ATP unbound UMP kinase. We placed ATP in the bulk in which the minimum distance between ATP and UMP kinase was larger than 15 Å with different initial positions. Ten different sets of ATP configurations were chosen from the ATP clusters (half from the compact and half from the extended clustering). To further enhance the sampling, two distinct unbound UMP kinase structures were used based on the conformational diversity of the unbound UMP kinase state in the MD simulations for each ATP configuration.
