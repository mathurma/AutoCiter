<abstract>
<p>Alternative transcriptional initiation (ATI) refers to the frequent observation that one gene has multiple transcription start sites (TSSs). Although this phenomenon is thought to be adaptive, the specific advantage is rarely known. Here, we propose that each gene has one optimal TSS and that ATI arises primarily from imprecise transcriptional initiation that could be deleterious. This error hypothesis predicts that (i) the TSS diversity of a gene reduces with its expression level; (ii) the fractional use of the major TSS increases, but that of each minor TSS decreases, with the gene expression level; and (iii) <italic>cis</italic>-elements for major TSSs are selectively constrained, while those for minor TSSs are not. By contrast, the adaptive hypothesis does not make these predictions a priori. Our analysis of human and mouse transcriptomes confirms each of the three predictions. These and other findings strongly suggest that ATI predominantly results from molecular errors, requiring a major revision of our understanding of the precision and regulation of transcription.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Multiple surveys of transcriptional initiation showed that mammalian genes typically have multiple transcription start sites such that transcription is initiated from any one of these sites. Many researchers believe that this phenomenon is adaptive because it allows production of multiple transcripts, from the same gene, that potentially vary in function or post-transcriptional regulation. Nevertheless, it is also possible that each gene has only one optimal transcription start site and that alternative transcriptional initiation arises primarily from molecular errors that are slightly deleterious. This error hypothesis makes a series of predictions about the amount of transcription start site diversity per gene, relative uses of the various start sites of a gene, among-tissue and across-species differences in start site usage, and the evolutionary conservation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements of various start sites, all of which are verified in our analyses of genome-wide transcription start site data from the human and mouse. These findings strongly suggest that alternative transcriptional initiation largely reflects molecular errors instead of molecular adaptations and require a rethink of the precision and regulation of transcription.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The transcription start site (TSS) is the first nucleotide transcribed in a run of transcription, while the surrounding genomic region of the TSS is often referred to as the core promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref001">1</xref>]. Owing to the strong association between TSSs and core promoters, these terms are sometimes used interchangeably [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref001">1</xref>]. Under an appropriate external signal, the core promoter forms a transcription preinitiation complex with a number of accessory proteins including RNA polymerase and transcription factors to initiate transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref005">5</xref>]. Needless to say, regulation of transcriptional initiation is a crucial step in the control of gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The transcription of a gene may start from one of several TSSs, a phenomenon known as alternative transcriptional initiation (ATI); the different core promoters used are referred to as alternative promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref009">9</xref>]. It has been reported that ATI occurs to most eukaryotic protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref012">12</xref>]. For example, over 50% of all human genes have alternative promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref013">13</xref>], and on average, a human gene has four TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>]. ATI allows the production from the same gene of transcripts differing in the 5′ untranslated region (5′ UTR) or even the protein-coding region. ATI-dependent variations of the 5′ UTR may impact the translational efficiency of the transcript [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref014">14</xref>]. One example is the human runt-related transcription factor 1 gene <italic>RUNX1</italic>, which can be transcribed from two different TSSs; the mRNA produced from the distal TSS mediates cap-dependent translation, whereas that from the proximal TSS contains a functional internal ribosome entry site (IRES) and mediates cap-independent translation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref015">15</xref>]. ATI-dependent variations of the coding region may affect protein function. For instance, human <italic>LEF1</italic>, encoding lymphoid enhancer binding factor 1 that regulates the transcription of Wingless/Integrated (Wnt)/β-catenin genes, produces two different protein isoforms by using alternative TSSs; the longer isoform recruits β-catenin to Wnt target genes, whereas the shorter isoform cannot interact with β-catenin and instead suppresses the Wnt regulation of target genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>A number of case studies showed that the TSS choice may vary among tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref017">17</xref>], across developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref019">19</xref>], or during cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref020">20</xref>] and that aberrations in the TSS choice can lead to various diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref023">23</xref>]. Such findings led to the adaptive hypothesis that ATI is a widely used, regulated mechanism to expand the transcriptome and/or proteome diversity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>Nevertheless, alternative TSSs with verified benefits account for only a tiny fraction of all known TSSs, while the vast majority of TSSs have unknown functions. More than 90,000 TSSs are annotated for approximately 20,000 human protein-coding genes in ENSEMBL genome reference consortium human build 37 (GRCh37). Recent surveys using high-throughput sequencing methods such as deep cap analysis gene expression (deepCAGE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref027">27</xref>] showed that human TSSs are much more abundant than what has been annotated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>]. Are most TSSs of a gene functionally distinct, and is ATI generally adaptive? While this possibility exits, here we propose and test an alternative, nonadaptive hypothesis that is at least as reasonable as the adaptive hypothesis. Specifically, we propose that there is only one optimal TSS per gene and that other TSSs arise from errors in transcriptional initiation that are mostly slightly deleterious. This hypothesis is based on the consideration that transcriptional initiation has a limited fidelity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref028">28</xref>], and harmful ATI may not be fully suppressed by natural selection if the harm is sufficiently small or if the cost of fully suppressing harmful ATI is even larger than the benefit from suppressing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref029">29</xref>]. The error hypothesis makes a series of distinct predictions about patterns of ATI that are not expected a priori under the adaptive hypothesis. By analyzing high-throughput mRNA 5′-end sequencing data from multiple cell lines and tissues of humans and mice, we provide unequivocal evidence for the error hypothesis. This finding echoes a number of recent discoveries that mechanisms thought to adaptively increase transcriptomic and/or proteomic diversities, such as alternative splicing, alternative polyadenylation, and RNA editing, are all largely manifestations of molecular errors.</p>

<title>TSS diversity decreases with gene expression level</title>
<p>Under the error hypothesis of ATI, TSS diversity arises from imprecise transcriptional initiation that could be harmful for several reasons. First, the transcript generated may miss certain regulatory sequences for translation, influencing the protein production. Second, the transcript may lack part of the coding sequence, leading to a reduction, loss, or alteration of the protein function. Third, the transcript may have altered upstream open read frames (uORFs), interfering with normal protein synthesis. Because some of these harms, such as the toxicity of the dysfunctional proteins produced or energy waste owing to the synthesis of functionless proteins, increase with the number of protein molecules synthesized, the overall deleterious effect of imprecise transcriptional initiation of a gene is expected to rise (but not necessarily linearly) with its mRNA concentration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref030">30</xref>]. Consequently, natural selection against the transcriptional initiation error intensifies with the rise of the gene expression level. As a result, the error rate and TSS diversity should decline with the rise of the gene expression level. By contrast, this trend is not predicted a priori by the adaptive hypothesis, under which the TSS diversity of a gene depends on the specific function and regulation of the gene. To distinguish between the error hypothesis and the adaptive hypothesis of ATI, we analyzed the TSSs identified by 5′-end sequencing (CAGE-seq and TSS-seq; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>) of numerous cell lines and tissues from humans and mice (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s012">S1 Table</xref>)</bold>.</p>
<p>Following our recent study of alternative polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref031">31</xref>], we used the Simpson index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref032">32</xref>] and Shannon index [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref033">33</xref>] to quantify the TSS diversity of each protein-coding gene in each sample (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>). Both indices are commonly used in biodiversity research and tend to rise with the number of TSSs in a gene as well as the evenness of the relative uses of these TSSs, but the Simpson index gives more weight to the frequently used TSSs than does the Shannon index. Because CAGE-seq is regarded as the best among many different 5′-end RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref034">34</xref>], our analyses mainly used TSSs identified by the CAGE-seq high-throughput data of functional annotation of the mouse/mammalian genome project (FANTOM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>]. Let us define a gene by the DNA segment between its 5′-most TSS annotated and its 3′-most end among all annotated transcripts. We concentrated on so-called permissive TSSs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>), which are located within a gene or within 500 bp upstream of the 5′-most end of the gene. Because TSS diversity is poorly estimated when the number of sequencing reads mapped to a gene is too small, only genes with at least 10 reads in a sample were analyzed. By counting the CAGE-seq reads corresponding to each TSS in a gene, we calculated the gene’s TSS diversity. The gene expression level was measured by the number of CAGE-seq reads mapped to the gene per million reads (RPM) mapped in the entire sample. We started by analyzing the human universal sample, which is a mixture of 10 cell lines originating from different human tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref035">35</xref>]. Consistent with the prediction of the error hypothesis, the rank correlation (ρ) between the expression level of a gene and its Simpson index of TSS diversity is significantly negative, and this negative correlation is apparent across the entire expression range (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold>). The magnitude of ρ appears small, likely because estimates of gene expression levels and TSS diversities have relatively large sampling errors, especially for lowly expressed genes. When the genes are grouped into 100 bins with the same expression range size or the same gene number, the rank correlation between the mean expression level and mean TSS diversity across the 100 bins becomes –0.96 and –0.84, respectively, suggesting that gene expression level is a major determinant of TSS diversity. To rule out the possibility that the observed negative correlation is an artifact of our analysis, we performed a computer simulation. Briefly, we randomly generated genes whose expression level and relative TSS usages respectively follow the gene-expression–level distribution and relative TSS usage distribution of the real genes. We analyzed the simulated genes as if they were the actual data but found a weak, positive correlation between expression level and TSS diversity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s013">S2 Table</xref></bold>), confirming that the negative correlation observed in the actual data is not an artifact of our statistical analysis.</p>

<p>To investigate the robustness of the above results, we performed several additional analyses. First, because annotated TSSs are generally considered genuine, we focused on TSSs that are within 500 bp from each annotated TSS in a gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>], and the obtained result (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s001">S1A Fig</xref></bold>) is highly similar to that from all TSSs. Second, using so-called robust TSSs (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>) should reduce false-positive TSSs. The obtained result, however, remains qualitatively unchanged (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s001">S1B Fig</xref></bold>). Third, because some genuine TSSs identified by CAGE-seq may be far upstream from the most upstream TSS currently annotated for a gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref036">36</xref>], we included TSSs that are located within 1, 5, or 10 kb upstream of the most upstream TSS annotated for the gene. But the results were qualitatively unchanged (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s001">S1C–S1E Fig</xref></bold>). Fourth, while CAGE-seq has been demonstrated to be as reliable as the canonical mRNA sequencing (RNA-seq) in measuring gene expression levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref037">37</xref>], it is valuable to examine whether our observation holds when gene expression levels are measured by RNA-seq. To this end, we replaced the gene expression level in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold> with that obtained from canonical RNA-seq of the same sample [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref038">38</xref>]. As expected, the result is similar (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s001">S1F Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Because sequencing depth and the precision of TSS survey for a gene rise with its expression level, it is possible that the correlation in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1A</xref></bold> originates from unequal TSS surveys of genes of different expression levels. To eliminate this potential bias, we down-sampled our data by randomly picking 10 CAGE-seq reads per gene for all genes with at least 10 reads and then re-estimated the Simpson index. The correlation (ρ′) between the gene expression level and the re-estimated Simpson index remains negative (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>; see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s013">S2 Table</xref></bold> for the simulation result). Similar patterns were observed in other human cell lines and tissues (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s001">S1</xref></bold>). To examine the robustness of our results from the down-sampled data, we down-sampled CAGE-seq reads to as few as 5 and as many as 80 reads per gene from genes with at least that many reads and found our results to remain qualitatively unchanged (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold>). Using the Shannon index to measure TSS diversity similarly yielded a negative correlation between gene expression level and TSS diversity, as shown in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1C</xref></bold> for the human universal sample, <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1D</xref></bold> for the other human cell lines and tissues, and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s002">S2 Fig</xref></bold> for different levels of down-sampling.</p>
<p>To further examine the robustness of the above CAGE-seq–based results, we analyzed two different and independent 5′-end RNA-seq data: TSS-seq and 5′ global run-on sequencing (GRO-cap) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>). We examined 42 human cell line/tissue data (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s012">S1 Table</xref></bold>) generated by TSS-seq and observed significant, negative correlations between TSS diversity and gene expression level in the vast majority of these samples (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s003">S3A Fig</xref></bold>). In addition, we analyzed the GRO-cap data from the human cell line K562, allowing direct comparison of the result with our CAGE-seq–based result from the same cell line. The GRO-cap data show a significantly negative correlation between TSS diversity and gene expression level (ρ = –0.16 for both the original and down-sampled data; <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s003">S3B Fig</xref></bold>), similar to that from the CAGE-seq data (ρ = –0.19 for both the original and down-sampled data; the fourth cell line in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To minimize the influences of potential confounding factors in the above analyses, we compared between human paralogous genes of different expression levels because paralogous genes are similar in gene structure, DNA sequence, regulation, and function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref039">39</xref>]. Consistent with the error hypothesis, Simpson and Shannon indices tend to be lower for the relatively highly expressed gene than the relatively lowly expressed one in a pair of paralogous genes, and this trend generally holds after CAGE-seq reads are down-sampled to 10 per gene <bold>(<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s004">S4 Fig</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>To examine whether the negative correlation between gene expression level and TSS diversity observed in humans also holds in other mammals, we analyzed the CAGE-seq–based TSS data of 11 mouse tissues (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s012">S1 Table</xref>)</bold> available at FANTOM5 phase1.3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>]. The mouse results (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s005">S5 Fig</xref></bold>) resembled the human results, indicating that the negative correlation is not a human-specific phenomenon.</p>

<title>Usages of all but the major TSSs decline with the gene expression level</title>
<p>The above analyses suggest that many TSSs of a gene are suboptimal such that the overall TSS diversity declines with the gene expression level as a result of natural selection against suboptimal TSSs, but how many of the TSSs are suboptimal and which ones are suboptimal are unclear. To address these questions, we ranked all TSSs of a gene by their fractional usages. The fractional usage of a TSS is the number of CAGE-seq reads mapped to the TSS divided by the total number of reads mapped to all TSSs of the gene. For a given gene, the TSS with the highest fractional usage (i.e., ranked #1) is referred to as the major TSS, while all others are referred to as minor TSSs. Intuitively, the major TSS should be a preferred TSS. Because natural selection against transcriptional initiation error intensifies with the gene expression level, the fractional usage of each preferred TSS should increase while that of each unpreferred TSS should reduce as the expression level increases. We first tested this prediction in the human universal sample. Again, we considered only genes with at least 10 CAGE-seq reads to ensure a certain level of accuracy in TSS usage estimation. Indeed, the fractional usage of the major TSS in a gene increases with its expression level (upper-left plot in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). By contrast, each minor TSS examined shows the opposite trend, suggesting that none of them is preferred. For example, among all genes with at least two TSSs, the fractional usage of the second most frequently used TSS in a gene decreases with gene expression level (lower-left plot in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). A similar negative correlation is observed for the third most frequently used TSSs among genes with at least three TSSs (upper-right plot in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>) and for the fourth most frequently used TSSs among genes with at least four TSSs (lower-right plot in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold>). These trends remain unchanged when only TSSs within 500 bp around each annotated TSS of each gene are considered (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s006">S6A Fig</xref></bold>); when only robust TSSs of each gene are considered (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s006">S6B Fig</xref></bold>); when TSSs located within 1, 5, or 10 kb upstream of the most upstream TSS annotated for a gene are considered (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s006">S6C–S6E Fig</xref></bold>); or when gene expression levels are measured by RNA-seq (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s006">S6F Fig</xref></bold>). We also observed a negative correlation when the analysis in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold> is extended to the fifth, sixth, seventh, and eighth most frequently used TSSs among genes with at least five, six, seven, and eight TSSs, respectively. We further verified the results in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2A</xref></bold> by down-sampling the original data to 10 CAGE-seq reads per gene and reranking TSSs using the down-sampled data (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2B</xref></bold>). Computer simulations confirmed that these trends are not statistical artifacts (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s013">S2 Table</xref></bold>). CAGE-seq data from other human tissues and cell lines (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s006">S6</xref></bold>) as well as TSS-seq data from multiple tissues and cell lines (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s007">S7 Fig</xref></bold>) show similar patterns. We also verified that the statistical trends in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g002">Fig 2</xref> </bold>generally hold even when we limited the analysis to the common set of genes with at least four TSSs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s008">S8A Fig</xref></bold>). Analysis of mouse tissues yielded similar results (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s008">S8B</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s008">S8C Fig</xref></bold>). These observations strongly suggest that, for most genes, in any tissue or cell line, only the major TSS is preferred while all other TSSs are unpreferred.</p>

<title>Among-cell–type variations in TSS usage support the error hypothesis</title>
<p>The above analyses of ATI in each tissue or cell line support our hypothesis that there is only one optimal TSS in each tissue or cell line and that all other TSSs are suboptimal. Now, we compare TSS usage among cell types. Because a tissue is usually composed of many different cell types, comparison among tissues is less precise than that among cell lines. We thus analyzed the CAGE-seq data of five human cell lines. Under the error hypothesis of ATI, any difference in TSS usage between cell types is due to the stochastic nature of transcriptional initiation error. Hence, the hypothesis predicts that this difference decreases as the expression level of the gene rises, because of the reduced transcriptional initiation errors of more highly expressed genes. By contrast, no such prediction is made a priori by the adaptive hypothesis because the difference in ATI between cell types would depend on the specific cell types and genes. To this end, we measured the distance in the fractional uses of TSSs of a gene between two cell types (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>) and then correlated the distance with the gene's mean expression level in the two cell types compared. We found that in all 10 pairs of cell lines compared, the correlation is significantly negative (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>), supporting the error hypothesis. To avoid the influence of different sequencing depths of different genes, we sampled 10 CAGE-seq reads per gene from each cell line for all genes that have at least 10 reads in each of the five cell lines and confirmed that all correlations remain negative despite some that become statistically insignificant (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>The error hypothesis further predicts that, when the expression level of a gene varies among cell types, the TSS diversity of the gene in a cell type decreases with the rise of its expression level in the cell type. To verify this prediction, we calculated for each gene the correlation between its expression level and TSS diversity across the five human cell lines. We focused on down-sampled data to guard against the influences of unequal sequencing depths of a gene across cell lines. Indeed, significantly more genes exhibit negative correlations than expected by chance regardless of whether we used the Simpson or Shannon index of TSS diversity (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3B</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>The error hypothesis further predicts a negative correlation across cell types between the expression level of a gene and the fractional use of each minor TSS. To verify this prediction, for each gene, we defined the major and minor TSSs in each cell line separately and then computed the across-cell–line rank correlation between the expression level of a gene in a cell line and the fractional use of a TSS of a certain rank in the cell line (based on down-sampled data). Indeed, 53% of genes show a positive correlation for the TSSs of rank #1, significantly more than the random expectation of 50%, whereas only 45–46% of genes show a positive correlation for each TSS of ranks #2, #3, and #4, significantly lower than the random expectation (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>).</p>
<p>Although our evidence so far suggests that, for most genes, each cell type has only one preferred TSS, it remains possible that the optimal TSS varies among cell types such that the ATI variation among cell types is adaptive. To assess this possibility, we first repeated the analysis in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold> by defining the global major and minor TSSs for each gene using the combined CAGE-seq reads from all five cell lines. Interestingly, the patterns observed are similar to those in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>. For example, 53% of genes show a positive correlation between the fractional usage of the TSS of global rank #1 in a cell line and the expression level of the gene in the cell line, significantly more than the random expectation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>). But for all global minor TSSs examined, only 46–47% of genes show a positive correlation, significantly less than the random expectation (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s010">S10 Fig</xref></bold>). Along with the observations in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3C</xref></bold>, these results suggest that only a small fraction of genes may have different optimal TSSs in different cell types. To estimate this fraction, we first counted the number of different major TSSs observed in each gene across the five cell lines (<italic>N</italic>; <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>) because if all five cell lines share the same major TSS, it is most likely that they all share the same optimal TSS. We found that, of 7,793 genes examined, 6,400 (or 82.1%) have the same major site in all five cell lines (i.e., <italic>N</italic> = 1). We also examined the maximum possible number of different major TSSs in the five cell lines (<italic>M</italic>) for each gene, which would be the smaller of 5 and the total number of TSSs observed in the five cell lines for the gene (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3D</xref></bold>). When <italic>M</italic> ≥ 2, 99.9% of genes show <italic>N</italic> &lt; <italic>M</italic>, suggesting that cell-type–specific optimization of transcription start sites is far less than what ATI could potentially offer, consistent with the hypothesis that among-cell–type variations in ATI are largely nonadaptive.</p>
<p>Even when different cell lines show different major TSSs, the optimal TSS could still be the same in these cell lines because the observation could be due to sampling error caused by limited sequencing depths. To examine this possibility, for each gene, we randomly shuffled its CAGE-seq reads among the five cell lines without altering the number of reads in each cell line and then used the shuffled data to count the number of different major TSSs in the five cell lines. We repeated this process 10,000 times and estimated the mean number of major TSSs for the gene in the shuffled data (<italic>n</italic>) (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>) and the fraction of times (<italic>f</italic>) when the number of major TSSs observed in the shuffled data equals to or exceeds that in the actual data. Here, <italic>f</italic> is an estimate of the one-tailed <italic>P</italic>-value in testing the null hypothesis that all cell lines share the same major TSS. We converted the <italic>P</italic>-values to <italic>Q</italic>-values to control for multiple testing and found that 343 genes have <italic>Q</italic> &lt; 0.05 (red dots in <bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3E</xref></bold>). Thus, approximately 4.4% of genes examined appear to have at least two different optimal TSSs in the five cell lines.</p>
<p>The above analysis assumed that the major TSS of a gene in a cell line is the optimal TSS in the cell line, but this may not always be the case because using the optimal TSS more than any other TSS in every cell type for every gene could be difficult because of the limited power of transcription start regulation. Thus, it is possible that, even after the exclusion of sampling error, the observed major TSS is still not the optimal site for some genes in some cell types. This kind of high usage of suboptimal sites should have a fitness cost that rises with the gene expression level. Consequently, this phenomenon should have lower occurrences in more highly expressed genes as a result of natural selection. To this end, for each gene, we sampled 10 CAGE-seq reads from each cell line and re-estimated <italic>N</italic> and <italic>n</italic> as was done for the original data. We then divided all genes into two groups: those with <italic>N</italic> &gt; <italic>n</italic> (regardless of statistical significance of this inequality) and the rest. The expression level is significantly lower for the former group of 1,582 genes than the latter group of 6,211 genes (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g003">Fig 3F</xref></bold>). This observation supports the idea that a sizable proportion of genes with <italic>N</italic> &gt; <italic>n</italic> do not necessarily have different optimal sites in different cell types; rather, they cannot use the single optimal TSS in all cell types as the major TSS. In other words, the fraction of genes with evidence for adaptive differential ATI among cell types is lower than the above estimate of 4.4%. Notwithstanding, statistical power for detecting differential optimal TSSs among cell types rises with the sequencing depth, and the potential for the existence of at least two different optimal TSSs among cell types increases with the number of cell types examined. Hence, the above value of 4.4% is tentative, and this question should be revisited in the future with a larger and better data set.</p>

<title>Between-species ATI differences are consistent with the error hypothesis</title>
<p>The error hypothesis predicts that the interspecific difference in fractional uses of various TSSs of a gene should decrease as the average expression level of the gene in the two species rises because highly expressed genes have reduced TSS diversity in each species. By contrast, no such trend is predicted a priori by the adaptive hypothesis. To distinguish between the two hypotheses, we measured the distance in the fractional uses of TSSs of one-to-one orthologous genes between human and mouse in the same tissue (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec009">Materials and methods</xref>). In each tissue, we correlated between this distance and the mean expression level of the gene in the two species across genes. We considered only genes with at least 10 CAGE-seq reads in the pair of human and mouse tissues concerned to ensure relatively accurate measures of TSS usage. In support of the error hypothesis, a significantly negative correlation is found in each of the six tissues examined (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>), and these trends hold in down-sampled data (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g004">Fig 4A</xref></bold>).</p>

<p>Because a gene may have different expression levels between human and mouse in a given tissue, the error hypothesis predicts that its TSS diversity should be lower in the species in which its expression level is higher. Indeed, using down-sampled data, we observed this trend in all six tissues <bold>(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g004">Fig 4B</xref></bold>). Furthermore, for most genes, the fractional use of the major TSS identified in a species increases with the expression level of the gene in the species (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>). For each minor TSS, the opposite is true (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g004">Fig 4C</xref></bold>).</p>

<title>Natural selection on the <italic>cis</italic>-elements of core promoters</title>
<p>That a nucleotide site is used as a TSS is because of the existence of a nearby core promoter, which is commonly composed of four well characterized <italic>cis</italic>-elements: the TATA box, the initiator (INR), the TFIIB recognition element (BRE), and the downstream promoter element (DPE) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref002">2</xref>]. These <italic>cis</italic>-elements jointly determine the activity of the core promoter and hence the use of the corresponding TSS (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g005">Fig 5A</xref></bold>). Our finding that, for most human genes, the major TSS is likely optimal while all minor TSSs are likely suboptimal predicts that the <italic>cis</italic>-elements corresponding to the major TSS should be evolutionarily conserved, while those corresponding to minor TSSs should not be conserved and may even be selected against. To test this prediction, we merged all CAGE-seq reads of 15 independent cell lines and tissues of humans to determine the global major and minor TSSs of each gene. For comparison, we identified the <italic>cis</italic>-elements from the corresponding segment of the complementary strand of DNA; they are referred to as pseudoelements because they are not expected to be functional. Because some <italic>cis</italic>-elements of a core promoter may overlap with the coding, intron, or UTR of a transcript corresponding to another promoter, we considered only the <italic>cis</italic>-elements in regions that have never been annotated as coding sequence (CDS), intron, or 3′ UTR in any transcript, as well as the pseudoelements in the corresponding regions. Because the DPE is located in the transcribed region, we could not examine its evolutionary constraint that is purely due to the DPE function. Therefore, we focused on the other three <italic>cis</italic>-elements. We used PhastCons scores across 46 mammals as a measure of evolutionary conservation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref040">40</xref>]. We found that the PhastCons scores are substantially greater for the <italic>cis</italic>-elements of major TSSs than for the <italic>cis</italic>-elements of minor TSSs or pseudoelements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g005">Fig 5B–5D</xref></bold>). As predicted, the PhastCons scores are similar between the <italic>cis</italic>-elements of minor TSSs and pseudoelements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g005">Fig 5B–5D</xref></bold>). Specifically, INRs exhibit a slightly but significantly lower conservation in minor TSSs than in pseudoelements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g005">Fig 5B</xref></bold>), probably reflecting natural selection against the existence of minor TSSs and/or attributable to weak purifying selection on pseudoelements associated with functional antisense transcription. The conservations of BREs and TATA boxes are slightly but significantly higher for minor TSSs than for pseudoelements (<bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref></bold>). Because some minor TSSs are located downstream of the major TSS such that their conservations could be due to their positions in the 5′ UTR of the primary transcript instead of their promoter activities, we further analyzed only the minor TSSs upstream of the major TSS. Now INRs (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s011">S11A Fig</xref></bold>) and TATA boxes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s011">S11C Fig</xref></bold>) both show substantially lower conservations in minor TSSs than pseudoelements, whereas BREs show slightly higher conservations than pseudoelements (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s011">S11B Fig</xref></bold>). These results generally support the prediction of the error hypothesis.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The prevalence of ATI of human and mouse genes has been known for years, and the prevailing view is that ATI is mostly adaptive, although evidence supporting this view exists in only a small number of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref025">25</xref>]. In this study, we proposed that ATI is largely a manifestation of deleterious transcriptional initiation error. By analyzing multiple 5′-end sequencing data and <italic>cis</italic>-elements corresponding to TSSs, we provided strong evidence for the above error hypothesis in mammals. While most of our evidence was based on the tissues and cell lines analyzed (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s012">S1 Table</xref></bold>), the analysis of the evolutionary conservation of <italic>cis</italic>-elements was based on genome sequences, and hence our conclusion that ATI is largely nonadaptive is not restricted to the specific tissues and cell lines examined. Assuming that deleterious ATI has not been selectively purged in genes of the lowest expressions but has been completely removed in those of the highest expressions, we can treat ATI of lowly expressed genes as the total ATI (<italic>T</italic>) and ATI of highly expressed genes as nondeleterious ATI (<italic>ND</italic>). Thus, the fraction of ATI that is deleterious is (<italic>T</italic>-<italic>ND</italic>)/<italic>T</italic> = 1-<italic>ND</italic>/<italic>T</italic>. We used the Simpson index of TSS diversity to measure the amount of ATI because both the number of TSSs and their relative usages are considered. In the human universal sample depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, the 20 most weakly expressed genes have a mean Simpson index of 0.530 (<italic>T</italic>), while the 20 most highly expressed genes have a mean Simpson index of 0.069 (<italic>ND</italic>). Hence, the fraction of deleterious ATI is 1 –<italic>ND</italic>/<italic>T</italic> = 1–0.069/0.53 = 87%. To examine the robustness of the above estimate, we used another method to estimate <italic>ND</italic> and <italic>T</italic>. We divided all genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">Fig 1A</xref> into four equal-interval bins according to their gene expression levels (i.e., all bins have the same log<sub>10</sub>RPM interval). Using the leftmost bin to estimate <italic>T</italic> and the rightmost bin to estimate <italic>ND</italic> yielded 1 –<italic>ND</italic>/<italic>T</italic> = 1–0.05/0.42 = 88%. Note that both of the above estimates of the fraction of deleterious ATI are conservative because <italic>T</italic> is an underestimate of all ATI before selection (because some deleterious ATI could have been removed in lowly expressed genes) and <italic>ND</italic> is an overestimate of all nondeleterious ATI (because some deleterious ATI may not have been removed in highly expressed genes). The above finding is broadly consistent with our estimate that only approximately 4.4% of genes have evidence for different optimal TSSs in different cell types and explains why <italic>cis</italic>-elements of minor TSSs are generally evolutionarily unconserved.</p>
<p>Some authors distinguished between two types of TSSs: sharp and broad TSSs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref041">41</xref>]. Transcription initiates almost exclusively from one of a few neighboring nucleotides at a sharp TSS but from any of a large segment of nucleotides at a broad TSS. In the GRO-cap data of human K562 cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref041">41</xref>] that we analyzed, 53.6% of sharp TSSs and 88.6% of broad TSSs are minor TSSs. Because we found that almost all minor TSSs are nonadaptive, the above numbers suggest that most sharp TSSs as well as the vast majority of broad TSSs are nonadaptive.</p>
<p>Even though ATI arises primarily from molecular error and is thus stochastic, the magnitude of this error does not have to be entirely random. Our results provide unequivocal evidence for multiple forms of regulation of the magnitude. For instance, because of the common <italic>trans</italic>-environment for transcriptional initiation in a tissue/cell line, the negative correlation between the expression level of a gene and its TSS diversity in a tissue/cell line indicates that the magnitude of transcriptional initiation error is regulated by <italic>cis</italic>-factors such as various <italic>cis</italic>-elements analyzed. Because the <italic>cis</italic>-factors for a gene are constant across cell lines, the observation that the same gene has lower TSS diversities in cell lines where its expression levels are higher indicates that the magnitude of transcriptional initiation error is also regulated by <italic>trans</italic>-factors. Because not all genes have lower TSS diversities in one cell line than in another cell line, the magnitude of transcriptional initiation error must also be regulated by interactions between <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-factors. The various trends we observed (<bold>Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000197.g004">4</xref></bold>) strongly suggest that these regulations have been shaped by natural selection against transcriptional initiation error.</p>
<p>The disadvantage of using a particular minor TSS of a gene when compared with the use of the major TSS not only depends on the gene expression level but may also vary by the position of the minor TSS relative to the major TSS. One might think that using minor TSSs upstream of the major TSS is less deleterious than using minor TSSs downstream of the major TSS because using an upstream TSS makes the transcript longer, so it is unlikely to cause a disruption of any regulatory sequence that is supposed to be in the transcript from the major TSS. This prediction, however, may not be correct, because extending the 5′ UTR could cause the appearance of uORFs, which often interfere with the translation of the functional ORF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref042">42</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref043">43</xref>]. In the future, it will be interesting to study how fitness is altered by the use of minor TSSs at different positions. From the FANTOM TSS data, a substantial proportion of TSSs are found in RNA genes or intergenic regions, most of which are at the 5′ ends of genes encoding long noncoding RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref044">44</xref>] or microRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref045">45</xref>]. It will be important to verify whether our results on TSSs of protein-coding genes extend to RNA genes.</p>
<p>Our results on ATI echo recent findings about a number of phenomena that increase transcriptome diversity, including alternative polyadenylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref031">31</xref>], alternative splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref046">46</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref047">47</xref>], and several forms of RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref048">48</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref050">50</xref>]. They have all been shown to be largely the results of molecular errors instead of adaptive regulatory mechanisms. Together, these findings reveal the astonishing imprecision of key molecular processes in the cell, contrasting the common view of an exquisitely perfected cellular life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref051">51</xref>]. Interestingly, protein synthesis, the step of gene expression following transcription, also shows prevalent variations such as the non-AUG translational initiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref052">52</xref>], use of uORFs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref053">53</xref>], and stop-codon readthrough [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref054">54</xref>]. It remains to be seen whether these variations that increase proteome diversity are also largely molecular errors.</p>
<p>That ATI is generally nonadaptive does not preclude the existence of a minority of cases of ATI that are beneficial [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref020">20</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref025">25</xref>]. However, identifying these few beneficial ATI cases will be challenging. Our past studies of RNA editing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref055">55</xref>] suggest that evolutionarily conserved TSSs may be beneficial, and future studies can prioritize those TSSs in the search for adaptive ATI.</p>

<p>The CAGE-seq data from human cell lines and tissues and mouse tissues were downloaded from FANTOM5 phase1.3 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/datafiles/phase1.3/" xlink:type="simple">http://fantom.gsc.riken.jp/5/datafiles/phase1.3/</ext-link>). We analyzed five human cell lines, as well as 11 tissues (10 specific tissues plus a mixed one) from each of the two species (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s012">S1 Table</xref></bold>). FANTOM5 phase 1.3’s TSS annotation already clustered original TSSs into TSS peaks (a peak is a short genomic region that could include more than one original TSS) by the decomposition peak identification (DPI) algorithm upon the removal of technical noise [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>]. For protein-coding genes, we found that only 0.0082% of adjacent peaks are &lt;5 nucleotides apart, and only 0.14% of adjacent peaks are &lt;10 nucleotides apart. The mean distance between adjacent peaks is 1,846 nucleotides, and the median is 135 nucleotides. The permissive and robust CAGE peaks identified by the original authors through rigorous filtering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>] were used in our analyses. Both types of peaks were obtained by removing technical noise followed by applying DPI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>]. As a result, both peaks are reliable, with the only difference being that the tag evidence thresholds are higher for robust peaks. In total, there were 1,048,124 permissive and 184,827 robust peaks identified from 975 human samples and 652,860 permissive and 116,227 robust peaks identified from 399 mouse samples, respectively. Because the robust set misses most TSSs (e.g., &gt;80% in human) identified by high-throughput sequencing, we primarily used the permissive TSSs unless noted. TSS was defined as the position within a CAGE peak region with the highest total number of CAGE tags across all samples in FANTOM5 phase1.3.</p>
<p>Human (hg19 and hg38) and mouse (mm9) genomic annotations were downloaded from Ensembl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://useast.ensembl.org/index.html" xlink:type="simple">http://useast.ensembl.org/index.html</ext-link>). We focused our analysis on protein-coding genes, including 20,745 human genes and 22,745 mouse genes. A CAGE peak whose 5′ end is within 500 bp of the 5′ end of a gene is considered to belong to the gene if the peak is on the same strand as the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref007">7</xref>]. Peaks mapped to more than one gene were removed. The total CAGE tags within a peak were considered as the tags of the representative TSS in that peak. The major TSS of a gene in a tissue or cell line is defined as the most frequently used TSS of the gene in the given tissue or cell line, while all other TSSs are considered minor.</p>
<p>In addition, we analyzed two independent 5′-end RNA-seq data: GRO-cap and TSS-seq. GRO-cap is the global nuclear run-on sequencing method that enriches for 5′-7meGTP-capped RNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref041">41</xref>]. It differs from CAGE-seq in that it can also detect the TSSs of unstable RNAs. We analyzed the GRO-cap data from the human cell line K562 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref041">41</xref>] to allow a direct comparison with the CAGE-seq-based result on the same cell line. To compare CAGE-seq and GRO-cap results fairly, we assigned GRO-cap reads to TSSs annotated in FANTOM5 phase 1.3 before computing TSS diversity. TSS-seq is another independent method for identifying TSSs and measuring their fractional usages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref056">56</xref>]. TSSs and reads from TSS-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref056">56</xref>] for 26 human cell lines and 16 human tissues (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000197.s012">S1 Table</xref></bold>) were downloaded from DBTSS (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://dbtss.hgc.jp/" xlink:type="simple">https://dbtss.hgc.jp/</ext-link>). The analyses of CAGE-seq and TSS-seq reads were the same except that the reference genome hg38 was used in TSS-seq read mapping by the original authors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref056">56</xref>].</p>

<p>Because CAGE-seq sequences only the 5′ end of an mRNA, the expression level of a gene is proportional to the number of CAGE-seq reads mapped to the gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref057">57</xref>]. The expression level of a gene is computed by the total number of CAGE-seq reads mapped to all TSSs of the gene multiplied by 10<sup>6</sup> and then divided by the total number of reads mapped to all TSSs of all genes in the sample. This is referred to as RPM. Although CAGE-seq data are comparable with the canonical RNA-seq in measuring gene expression, we also measured gene expression levels by canonical RNA-seq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref038">38</xref>] for the same human universal sample included in the CAGE-seq data.</p>

Although using original and down-sampled data usually yielded qualitatively similar results, results from down-sampled data are more reliable because of equal surveys of ATI among genes.</p>

When comparing between paralogs, we randomly selected from each gene family only one paralogous pair that has at least a 2-fold expression difference to allow a sufficient statistical power. Because of the expression level variation among tissues or cell lines, the included paralogous pairs in our analysis vary by tissue or cell line. The number of orthologous genes between human and mouse is 16,805.

Following a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000197.ref058">58</xref>], we used the consensus sequences to search three <italic>cis</italic>-elements around TSS (+1); BRE was searched in [<bold>–</bold>50, –1], TATA box was searched in [<bold>–</bold>40, –1], and INR was searched in [<bold>–</bold>6, +7]. Only 12% of TSSs were found to have at least one of the three motifs because most minor TSSs do not have any detected motif. The fraction of TSSs with at least one motif tends to decrease with the TSS usage rank. All detected copies of a motif associated with a TSS were considered. To examine the evolutionary conservation of the <italic>cis</italic>-elements, we downloaded from UCSC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/phastCons46way/placentalMammals/" xlink:type="simple">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenpath/hg19/phastCons46way/placentalMammals/</ext-link>) PhastCons scores computed from genome alignments of 46 placental mammals, including the human (hg19).</p>
