				<article-title>A New Test Detects Selection for Early Flowering in a Much-Studied Weed</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The detection of footprints of natural selection in genetic polymorphism data is fundamental to understanding the genetic basis of adaptation, and has important implications for human health. The standard approach has been to reject neutrality in favor of selection if the pattern of variation at a candidate locus was significantly different from the predictions of the standard neutral model. The problem is that the standard neutral model assumes more than just neutrality, and it is almost always possible to explain the data using an alternative neutral model with more complex demography. Today's wealth of genomic polymorphism data, however, makes it possible to dispense with models altogether by simply comparing the pattern observed at a candidate locus to the genomic pattern, and rejecting neutrality if the pattern is extreme. Here, we utilize this approach on a truly genomic scale, comparing a candidate locus to thousands of alleles throughout the 
					<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Arabidopsis thaliana</named-content> genome. We demonstrate that selection has acted to increase the frequency of early-flowering alleles at the vernalization requirement locus 
					<italic>FRIGIDA.</italic> Selection seems to have occurred during the last several thousand years, possibly in response to the spread of agriculture. We introduce a novel test statistic based on haplotype sharing that embraces the problem of population structure, and so should be widely applicable.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The coordination of flowering time with environmental factors is a major determinant of reproductive success in plants, and numerous experiments in many different species have shown that populations are typically strongly adapted to their local environment. Plants decide when to flower by integrating multiple environmental and endogenous inputs: the underlying pathways are best understood in 
				<italic>Arabidopsis thaliana,</italic> which has become the major model for studying flowering time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b001">1</xref>]. 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> occurs throughout the Northern Hemisphere in a wide range of environments, and shows considerable variation for flowering time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b010">10</xref>]. In particular, many genotypes are extremely late-flowering unless exposed to prolonged cold temperatures—so-called vernalization—which likely functions to ensure a winter-annual habit. Several studies have shown that the locus 
				<italic>FRIGIDA (FRI)</italic> explains much of this variation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b010">10</xref>]. Recessive loss-of-function alleles at this locus essentially eliminate the requirement for vernalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b011">11</xref>]. Two such alleles, 
				<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
				</italic> and 
				<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
				</italic> (originally defined in the common laboratory accessions Columbia [Col] and Landsberg 
				<italic>erecta</italic> [Ler]), account for a large proportion of early-flowering accessions found in Europe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040137-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Given their strong effect on a trait likely to be under strong selection, there is every reason to believe that these alleles have been under selection. Consistent with this, a study of polymorphism in the 
				<italic>FRI</italic> chromosomal region suggested that they were both associated with long haplotypes (i.e., for each allele, most or all individuals carrying that allele also shared identical haplotypes over long chromosomal regions), possibly as a result of selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b012">12</xref>]. However, without a genomic control, there was no way of determining whether the length of these haplotypes was indeed unusual. Here, we evaluate the evidence for recent selective sweeps on 
				<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
				</italic> and 
				<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
				</italic> by investigating patterns of haplotype sharing throughout the genome. Formally, we seek to reject the null hypothesis that the two loss-of-function alleles do not exhibit extremely high haplotype sharing (as would be expected if they had not been affected by recent selection), in favor of the alternative hypothesis that they do [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b013">13</xref>]. We use polymorphism data from 96 individual specimens of 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> for which 1,102 short fragments have been sequenced as part of an ongoing survey of genomic polymorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b014">14</xref>]. The density of our sequenced regions along each chromosome is sufficient to identify unusually long identical haplotypes among subsets of these individuals.

      <p>The rationale behind our approach is that chromosomes that are identical by descent at a polymorphic site must also share a short region surrounding that site. The length of this identical by descent region is influenced primarily by the age of the shared allele at the polymorphic site and the recombination rate in the region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b015">15</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b016">16</xref>]. A mutation that is driven by directional selection will typically have reached its current population frequency much faster than a mutation that reached the same frequency as a result of genetic drift alone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b017">17</xref>]. This leaves less time for recombination and mutation to break up the ancestral haplotype, resulting in a larger region of identity by descent around the mutation than expected given its current frequency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b021">21</xref>]. Several studies have suggested methods for detecting this signature of recent selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b024">24</xref>]. A limitation common to all is that they rely on population genetics models to determine significance, models that are based on numerous assumptions about the demography and geographic structure of the population. In contrast, we take a nonparametric approach to detecting selection, and determine significance by comparing haplotype sharing around 
				<italic>FRI</italic> with what is observed in the rest of the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b025">25</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b026">26</xref>]. Our analysis shows that haplotype sharing around the two major 
				<italic>FRI</italic> loss-of-function alleles is indeed unusually high, thus providing strong evidence for selection on these alleles.
			</p>
    </sec>
    <sec id="s2">
      <title>Results/Discussion</title>
      <p>In order to compare haplotype sharing around the loss-of-function alleles at 
				<italic>FRI</italic> with sharing at thousands of reference loci throughout the genome, we developed a novel haplotype-sharing measure. In particular, we tried to develop a measure that accounts for population structure, because our sample is heavily structured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b014">14</xref>]. Thus, pairs of individuals from the same population are more likely to share long haplotypes because they are more closely related than those from different populations. For a formal definition of our pairwise haplotype-sharing score (PHS), and details on how we calculate it, see 
				<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>. Informally, the basis of this measure is the estimation of the shared length around any allele 
				<italic>A</italic> at position 
				<italic>x</italic> from a simple pairwise comparison between individual haplotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b027">27</xref>]. Thus, haplotype sharing relative to allele 
				<italic>A</italic> can only be measured if this allele is found on at least two haplotypes. Note that, due to inbreeding, comparisons can be made directly between individuals (i.e., haplotypes need not be inferred from genotypes). To account for population structure and increase our power to detect true footprints of selection, we normalized the length of identity of a pair of individuals around each allele by subtracting the mean length of identity found in these two individuals (across all polymorphic loci) and dividing by the standard deviation. Then, we averaged these normalized lengths over all pairs of individuals carrying allele 
				<italic>A.</italic> A final concern is that regions of the genome where we erroneously infer high haplotype sharing due to the low density of our sequenced regions may have incorrectly inflated PHS scores. In order to guard against this possibility, the final step in calculating PHS is the subtraction of the normalized lengths around position 
				<italic>x</italic> averaged over all pairs of individuals, regardless of which allele they carry. As a result, our measure misses a selective sweep that has affected the whole sample, and has reduced power to detect a sweep that has affected most of it: it is geared towards identifying alleles that are present in a minority of individuals.

      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Haplotype Sharing around 
					<italic>FRI</italic> Is Extreme
				</title>
        <p>We calculated PHS for all alleles in our data set where, at the corresponding polymorphic site, the minor allele is found in at least two accessions and we have data from at least 60 accessions. We also calculated the measure for 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> and 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>,
					</italic> which have been genotyped in our sample. The distribution of this measure, plotted against the frequency of each allele, is shown in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040137-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Often, nearby alleles are highly correlated and provide redundant information about a long shared haplotype. Therefore, we eliminated all but the highest-scoring allele from sets of nearby correlated alleles to reduce this redundancy (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The average value of the haplotype-sharing measure decreased with increasing allele frequency as expected. In order to help identify abnormally high values for any given frequency, we plotted lines representing the 95th, 97.5th, and 99th percentile for sliding windows of increasing frequency. The 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> allele is well above the 99th percentile line, providing strong support for a recent selective sweep. Formally, our test rejects the null hypothesis that this allele is consistent with the vast majority of (presumably neutral) alleles in the genome at the 0.01 level. The 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
					</italic> allele also shows extensive haplotype sharing but considerably less so than 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>.
					</italic> A tightly linked allele shared by 12 of the 13 accessions that carry 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
					</italic> lies just above the 97.5th percentile line. Because this allele has a higher PHS score than 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>,
					</italic> the latter is formally eliminated from our analysis. The 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
					</italic> allele itself is included in 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040137-g002">Figure 2</xref> for the sake of comparison: it lies just below the 95th percentile line.

        <p>An implicit assumption in our test that compares two candidate alleles against thousands of alleles throughout the genome, which serve as reference alleles, is that these reference alleles are selectively neutral. This is almost certainly false. However, violation of this assumption in this and related tests should make the test conservative. Examples of recent selection among reference loci will shift the genome-wide distribution of PHS to higher values, making it less likely that an individual candidate locus will reach statistical significance. Only a selective force that systematically decreased PHS values in a sizable number of reference loci would result in inflated 
					<italic>p</italic> values in tests of individual candidate loci. To our knowledge, the only force that might be capable of this is rampant long-term balancing selection maintaining ancient polymorphism (with ancient polymorphism producing low PHS scores, just as young alleles tend to produce high ones). Leaving aside the biological plausibility of this explanation (especially in a highly selfing organism, where heterozygote advantage is unlikely to maintain variation), we do not believe it would have the required effect on the PHS scores. Specifically, due to a number of factors, in particular the density of our polymorphism data and the conservative approach taken to estimate haplotype sharing, we do not believe extremely low values of PHS accurately reflect unusually short haplotype sharing. Thus, we feel that long-term balancing selection has a negligible effect on the distribution of PHS in our reference loci, and we also do not believe that low PHS scores can be used here to identify ancient alleles preserved by long-term balancing selection. It is possible that a haplotype-sharing measure such as ours would perform better with higher-density polymorphism data, but we are skeptical that such an approach would be more powerful than those that use polymorphism-to-divergence ratios. The issue deserves further study.

        <title>EHH and the Effect of Population Structure</title>
        <p>We also calculated haplotype sharing using a modification of the extended haplotype homozygosity (EHH) measure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b023">23</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b028">28</xref>], which makes no correction for population structure. Briefly, for each allele where we have calculated PHS, we calculated EHH at flanking markers of increasing distance. We interpolated the distance at which EHH drops below 0.5 and used this as a score. We similarly removed all but the highest scoring alleles from nearby highly correlated alleles. The distribution of this score against allele frequency is superficially similar to that of PHS (not shown). Again, the 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> allele is above the 99th percentile given its frequency, and the 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
					</italic> allele is just above the 95th percentile.
				</p>
        <p>In general, however, alleles that exhibit extreme haplotype sharing using PHS do not necessarily do so using EHH (and vice versa). Because the PHS measure makes adjustments for some pairs of individuals being more related than others (see 
					<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>), while EHH does not, we would expect the latter measure to sometimes identify haplotype sharing that can be attributed to population structure rather than selection. To investigate this, we compared alleles with extreme values with respect to which individuals carried them. Separately for the PHS and EHH analyses, we clustered all alleles above the 99th percentile using unweighted pair group method with arithmetic averages (UPGMA) and a distance metric that measures whether alleles tend to be carried by the same individuals or not. The distance metric we used, the binary distance, treats each allele as a vector of binary bits (corresponding to the accessions), where the value of each bit (0 or 1) indicates whether the corresponding accession carries the given allele. The distance between two alleles is then the number of bits for which one allele is 0 and the other 1, divided by the total number of bits with at least one 1. To reduce noise, we restricted the analysis to alleles found in more than two individuals, and at frequency less than 0.5. If population structure were responsible for haplotype sharing, we would expect the same individuals to share haplotypes at several loci and the relevant alleles would be clustered. Indeed, in the EHH analysis, we found seven sets of low-frequency alleles that clustered with an average distance less than or equal to 0.5. Three pairs of alleles and one group of five alleles clustered with an average distance of less than 0.4 (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). In one extreme case, two alleles were found in exactly the same set of accessions. The clustered alleles tend to be found in restricted geographic regions. For example, five alleles found exclusively in the United States cluster together, and four pairs and one triplet of alleles found predominantly in northern Sweden cluster together. This is consistent with the high haplotype sharing of these alleles resulting solely from the population structure present in the sample. In contrast, only three clusters of low-frequency alleles resulted from the PHS analysis, and just a single pair of alleles clustered at a distance of less than 0.4. These results demonstrate that, as expected, the EHH analysis is much more susceptible to identifying multiple alleles from the same sets of closely related individuals than the PHS measure when population structure is present in the sample. However, for organisms with a less extensive population structure than 
					<italic>A. thaliana,</italic> such as humans, we expect the methods will yield very similar results.

        <title>The History of the FRI Alleles</title>
        <p>What does the pattern of haplotype sharing and linkage disequilibrium (LD) around 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> and 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
					</italic> tell us about the history of these alleles? Age estimates can be obtained by counting the proportion of chromosomes carrying the allele that retain the inferred ancestral haplotype at linked markers. Following the approach of Stephens et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b029">29</xref>], and treating fragments flanking 
					<italic>FRI</italic> as multiallelic markers, we obtained rough age estimates of approximately 800 generations for 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> and 3,200 generations for 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>.
					</italic> The greater estimated age of 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
					</italic> reflects the fact that haplotype sharing among these alleles is less extreme than for 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> and is consistent with the greater geographic spread of the former allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040137-g001">Figure 1</xref>). More exact estimates are not possible without better estimates of the rates of outcrossing and recombination, and more information on population structure in 
					<italic>A. thaliana,</italic> all of which affect the decay of LD. Our age estimates are inversely proportional to the rates of recombination in this region and historical outcrossing in this species. Therefore, if we assume we have overestimated either of these rates by a factor of two and recalculate age after halving the inflated rate, the ensuing age estimates would double. Nevertheless, assuming at least one generation per year for these rapid-cyclers, our estimates suggest that selection for null alleles of 
					<italic>FRI</italic> may have occurred more recently than the colonization of northern Europe by 
					<italic>A. thaliana,</italic> which necessarily followed the last glacial retreat estimated at approximately 13,000 years ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b030">30</xref>].
				</p>
        <p>It is tempting to speculate that these alleles, the effect of which is to convert an obligate winter-annual plant into one that can have multiple generations per year, have spread as a result of selection for weediness imposed by agriculture. Two other observations support the notion that the 
					<italic>FRI</italic>-null alleles represent an adaptation to some form of human disturbance: first, flowering time variation in 
					<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> seems to be much more strongly correlated with geography (in particular latitude) if individuals carrying 
					<italic>FRI</italic>-null alleles are excluded than if they are not excluded [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b008">8</xref>]; second, while 
					<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">A. thaliana</named-content> accessions in general show strong isolation by distance, accessions carrying 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> found far from Germany (the center of distribution of this allele) generally are genetically similar to other German accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b014">14</xref>], suggesting recent dispersal. More research is required to clarify the exact mechanism of selection.

        <title>Scanning the Genome for Recent Selection</title>
        <p>Thus far we have demonstrated how the genomic distribution of haplotype sharing may be used in a priori tests of selection when strong candidates, such as the 
					<italic>FRI</italic> loss-of-function alleles, exist. We now turn to a fundamentally different application, namely scanning the genome for signs of recent selection. Because we have no a priori candidates, we are simply trying to identify those alleles and regions that exhibit the strongest signals of selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b031">31</xref>,
					<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b032">32</xref>]. However, since we are not assuming any statistical model, we have no way of assessing the significance of our findings. The top 1% is just that. Nonetheless, assuming that some recent selection has occurred in the genome, we expect that this set of alleles and their associated haplotypes will be enriched for regions affected by recent selection, and thus each of these regions can be considered as a candidate for recent selection.
				</p>
        <p>In addition to 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>,
					</italic> 31 alleles found in more than two accessions and at frequency less than 0.8 were identified as clearly above the 99th percentile of PHS (
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="st001">Table S1</xref>). They were found on all five chromosomes, though they were not distributed evenly according to genetic length (χ<sup>2</sup> 4 degrees of freedom, 
					<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005), with an excess found on Chromosomes 2 and 4. Some of these alleles, hereafter referred to as candidate alleles, may be associated with targets of selection; most are probably due to chance. We certainly plan to investigate a few of the more interesting regions further.
				</p>
        <p>A problem when using haplotype sharing to scan the genome for selection is that it is difficult to identify the precise target of selection. Given that our polymorphism data represent approximately 0.5% of the genome, it is likely that the targets of selection reside in the 99.5% of the genome between our sequenced fragments and that most of the 31 candidate alleles merely are in strong LD with them. But even if we had complete sequence information, it would be difficult to identify the targets of selection. This is because selection at a single allele will often generate a complex pattern of increased haplotype sharing around multiple alleles throughout the chromosomal region. We attempted to remove alleles from our analyses that were obviously part of the same event. For instance, alleles in two fragments linked to 
					<italic>FRI</italic> that were in strong LD with the 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> allele had PHS scores that are above the 99<sup>th</sup> percentile, but because these alleles were redundant with 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> and scored lower, they were removed. Yet our criteria for identifying redundant alleles are arbitrary, and will not always work.
				</p>
        <p>Our analysis identified two regions with complex patterns of haplotype sharing, such as those detailed above, involving at least five candidate alleles within a single Mb. The most extreme example is Chromosome 2, where nine candidate alleles were found between positions 9.2 and 11.6 Mb. The other example is the short arm of Chromosome 4, where five candidate alleles were found between 0.2 and 1.2 Mb and a sixth was just short of the centromere at 2.4 Mb. The 
					<italic>FRI</italic> gene is located at 0.2 Mb, and it is illuminating to consider the role of 
					<italic>FRI</italic> in the overall pattern of haplotype sharing in this region. In 
					<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040137-g003">Figure 3</xref>, we have plotted the location and extent of regions of haplotype sharing along Chromosome 4 (for the remaining chromosomes, see 
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg002">Figures S2</xref>–
					<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg005">S5</xref>). On the short arm, four candidate alleles were minor alleles, and two of these, found at 1.1 Mb and 2.4 Mb, shared more than a single accession in common with 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>.
					</italic> The allele at 2.4 Mb is associated with a haplotype that encompasses a reported pericentric inversion between the Columbia and Landsberg accessions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040137-b033">33</xref>]. This inversion, located at the opposite end of the chromosome arm from 
					<italic>FRI,</italic> is expected to interfere with recombination between two haplotype classes, and may result in errors in our estimates of both distance and haplotype sharing in the immediate region. Although the 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> allele was carried by two individuals that have no mismatches in our data through the inversion, the remaining individuals also displayed high levels of haplotype sharing, indicating that the haplotype sharing around 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> cannot be explained by the inversion. For 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> and the alleles at 1.1 Mb and 2.4 Mb, we removed the accessions that carried each allele in turn, and recalculated PHS for the other two alleles. In each case, the remaining two alleles were still extreme given their observed frequency, indicating that haplotype sharing around each allele cannot be explained by the other alleles. The remaining minor frequency alleles appeared to be independent of 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>,
					</italic> but it is impossible to rule out selection on this allele having induced extensive haplotype sharing among other accessions. The final candidate allele in this region, a major frequency allele, was too common to test its independence from other alleles in this region by removing all accessions that carry it. A detailed view of haplotype structure along the short arm of Chromosome 4 is provided in

        <p>Taken together, the effect, frequency, and geographic distribution of the two most common

					</italic> The evidence for selection on the other allele, 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>,
					</italic> is weaker: given that the two alleles have very similar phenotypic effects, the simplest explanation for this is that the selective sweep took place longer ago. Our genome-wide scan for selection has also identified many other regions that are candidates for harboring genes that have been the subject of recent selective sweeps. As we learn more about the genes responsible for natural variation in this organism, it will be interesting to see how many lie in these putatively selected chromosomal regions. The type of scan developed here should be useful in a wide range of species with cryptic population structure, and with some modification for genotype data, could be applied to data collected by the Human International Haplotype Mapping Project.

        <p>LD between nearby alleles is often very high.

          <p>For each alignment in this region, nonredundant (i.e., 
					<italic>r<sup>2</sup>
					</italic> = 1) polymorphisms are indicated in columns and accessions in rows. Minor frequency alleles are black and major frequency alleles are gray, while missing data or spaces between alignments are white. A genetic scale (in cM) is included at the top of the figure, and the position of each alignment on it is indicated. The extended haplotypes surrounding seven alleles that are in the upper 2.5% tail of genome-wide PHS and that are below 15% frequency are boxed, and the fragment where the core allele is located is also boxed. The haplotype surrounding 
					<italic>fri<sub>Col</sub>
					</italic> is boxed in red, and that surrounding the marker allele for 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
					</italic> in blue. Due to topological constraints, one accession belonging to the third group from the top is not shown in this group because it is included with the 
					<italic>fri<sub>Ler</sub>
