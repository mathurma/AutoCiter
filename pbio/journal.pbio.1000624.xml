<p>Using genetic and molecular analyses, the authors identify Zyx as a positive regulator of Hippo signaling and characterize its role within the pathway.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The Hippo signaling pathway has a conserved role in growth control and is of fundamental importance during both normal development and oncogenesis. Despite rapid progress in recent years, key steps in the pathway remain poorly understood, in part due to the incomplete identification of components. Through a genetic screen, we identified the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Zyxin family gene, <italic>Zyx102</italic> (Zyx), as a component of the Hippo pathway. Zyx positively regulates the Hippo pathway transcriptional co-activator Yorkie, as its loss reduces Yorkie activity and organ growth. Through epistasis tests, we position the requirement for Zyx within the Fat branch of Hippo signaling, downstream of Fat and Dco, and upstream of the Yorkie kinase Warts, and we find that Zyx is required for the influence of Fat on Warts protein levels. Zyx localizes to the sub-apical membrane, with distinctive peaks of accumulation at intercellular vertices. This partially overlaps the membrane localization of the myosin Dachs, which has similar effects on Fat-Hippo signaling. Co-immunoprecipitation experiments show that Zyx can bind to Dachs and that Dachs stimulates binding of Zyx to Warts. We also extend characterization of the Ajuba LIM protein Jub and determine that although Jub and Zyx share C-terminal LIM domains, they regulate Hippo signaling in distinct ways. Our results identify a role for Zyx in the Hippo pathway and suggest a mechanism for the role of Dachs: because Fat regulates the localization of Dachs to the membrane, where it can overlap with Zyx, we propose that the regulated localization of Dachs influences downstream signaling by modulating Zyx-Warts binding. Mammalian Zyxin proteins have been implicated in linking effects of mechanical strain to cell behavior. Our identification of Zyx as a regulator of Hippo signaling thus also raises the possibility that mechanical strain could be linked to the regulation of gene expression and growth through Hippo signaling.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Processes that control cell numbers are essential during normal development, when they are required to generate organs of the correct size, and during cancinogenesis, when they influence tumor growth. The Hippo pathway is an intercellular signaling pathway that relays information about cell-cell contact and cell polarity to a signal transduction pathway that regulates the transcription of genes controlling cell numbers. The role of Hippo signaling in controlling growth is conserved from fruit flies to humans, but many aspects of the Hippo signal transduction pathway remain poorly understood. In this article, we identify Zyx as a previously unknown component of the Hippo pathway in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, and characterize its role within the pathway. We show that Zyx plays an essential role in a branch of Hippo signaling that involves the transmembrane receptor protein Fat and its target Dachs, which is a myosin family protein. Our results suggest a model in which Fat regulates the localization of Dachs, Dachs subsequently binds Zyx, stimulating its binding with the kinase Warts/Lats, and thereby regulates downstream signaling events. Zyx is conserved in vertebrates and we suggest that vertebrate Zyx proteins might also be involved in the regulation of Hippo signaling and, thereby, organ growth.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The Hippo pathway has emerged as an important regulator of growth during metazoan development, and its dysregulation is implicated in diverse cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Reddy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Pan1">[3]</xref>. Hippo signaling is effected by transcriptional co-activator proteins, Yorkie (Yki) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and YAP and TAZ in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Oh1">[4]</xref>. Three interconnected, upstream branches of Hippo signaling have been characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic>: Fat-dependent, Expanded-dependent, and Merlin-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Reddy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Pan1">[3]</xref>. These upstream branches converge on the kinase Warts (Wts), which can phosphorylate Yki. Phosphorylated Yki is retained in the cytoplasm, whereas unphosphorylated Yki can enter the nucleus and, in conjunction with DNA-binding partners, promote the transcription of downstream genes. Upstream branches of Hippo signaling regulate both the activity of Wts and its abundance. Our understanding of many steps in Hippo signaling remains fragmentary, in part due to incomplete identification of pathway components. Here, we describe the identification of Zyx102 (Zyx, FBgn0011642) as a novel component of Hippo signaling and characterize its role in the pathway.</p>
<p>Fat is large cadherin that acts as a transmembrane receptor for one branch of Hippo signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Reddy1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Pan1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Sopko1">[5]</xref>. Fat-Hippo signaling influences the levels of Wts protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>. The molecular mechanism by which this is achieved is not understood, but <italic>dachs</italic> is genetically required for the influence of Fat on Wts levels, downstream gene expression, and organ growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho2">[8]</xref>. Fat regulates the localization of Dachs to the sub-apical membrane: when <italic>fat</italic> is mutant, Dachs accumulates on the membrane around the entire circumference of the cell, and when Fat is over-expressed, Dachs is mostly cytoplasmic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Mao1">[7]</xref>. In imaginal discs and optic neuroepithelia, Dachs membrane localization is polarized within the plane of the tissue; this polarization reflects the graded expression of the Fat ligand Dachsous and the Fat pathway modulator Four-jointed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Mao1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Rogulja1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Reddy2">[10]</xref>. The correlation of Dachs localization with Fat activity implicates Dachs regulation as a key step in Fat signaling, but how Dachs localization influences downstream events is unknown.</p>
<p>Zyx is a <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologue of the vertebrate Zyxin, Lipoma preferred partner (LPP), and Thyroid-receptor interacting protein 6 (TRIP6) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Renfranz1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Renfranz2">[12]</xref>. These proteins have three conserved LIM domains at their C-terminus, and they have been implicated in both cytoskeletal and transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Grunewald1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Beckerle1">[15]</xref>. Gene-targeted mutations in murine <italic>Zyxin</italic> or <italic>Lpp</italic> have no significant effect on mouse development, presumably due to redundancy among family members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Vervenne1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hoffman1">[17]</xref>. Translocations involving <italic>LPP</italic> identified it as an oncogene involved in lipomas and other cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Grunewald1">[13]</xref>. In cultured cell assays, Zyxin and its paralogues can affect cell motility and actin polymerization and can localize to focal adhesions and adherens junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Grunewald1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Beckerle1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirata1">[18]</xref>. Notably, Zyxin has been implicated as playing a key role in mechanotransduction, as its localization to focal adhesions can be influenced by the application of mechanical tension to cells in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirata1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>We report here that Zyx is an essential component of the Fat-Hippo signaling pathway, required for normal Yki activity and growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Using genetic epistasis tests, we position the requirement for <italic>Zyx</italic> in between <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>wts</italic>. Binding studies show that Zyx protein binds to Dachs and binds to Wts in a Dachs-regulated manner. Our observations suggest a model in which the regulated localization of Dachs to the membrane regulates Zyx-Wts binding, which then promotes Wts degradation. Dachs is a myosin protein, and its myosin motor domain contributes to interactions with Zyx and Wts, which raises the possibility that additional myosins might regulate Zyx-Wts interactions in other contexts.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>In a screen for additional components of the Fat and Hippo pathways, we examined a collection of transgenic flies expressing UAS-hairpin constructs, which mediate RNAi. We focused on the X and 4<sup>th</sup> chromosomes, which are under-represented in traditional genetic screens, and looked for phenotypes when these RNAi lines were expressed in the notum under <italic>pnr-Gal4</italic> control, and in the wing under <italic>vg-Gal4</italic> control. To enhance the strength of RNAi, the screening was done in flies expressing Dicer2 from a <italic>UAS-dcr2</italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Dietzl1">[19]</xref>. One hundred and forty-eight lines exhibiting either altered tissue growth or lethality were then re-screened for possible effects on Fat-Hippo signaling by assaying the expression of downstream targets of the pathway, Wingless (Wg) and <italic>thread</italic> (<italic>th</italic>, more commonly referred to as <italic>Diap1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Zhang1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Wu1">[21]</xref>, in wing discs in which RNAi lines were expressed in anterior cells under <italic>ci-Gal4</italic> control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s008">Table S1</xref>). The most promising candidates were then taken through four additional tests, involving confirmation of effects on additional downstream target genes, characterization of phenotypes when expressed under additional Gal4 drivers, confirmation of phenotypes with additional, independent UAS-RNAi lines, and characterization of genetic interactions with known pathway components. Based on these experiments, a single gene, <italic>Zyx102</italic> (<italic>Zyx</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Renfranz1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Renfranz2">[12]</xref>, which is located at 102F7 near the tip of the fourth chromosome, was identified as a novel component of the Fat-Hippo signaling pathway.</p>

<p>Many different genes and pathways affect organ growth. To investigate the potential connection between <italic>Zyx</italic> and the Hippo pathway, we examined the expression of downstream target genes in wing discs in which <italic>Zyx</italic> was depleted by RNAi. As downstream targets we employed reporters of <italic>expanded</italic> (<italic>ex</italic>) expression (<italic>ex-lacZ</italic>) and <italic>th</italic> expression (<italic>th-lacZ</italic>, Diap1). When <italic>Zyx</italic> was depleted from posterior cells using <italic>en-Gal4</italic>, <italic>ex-lacZ</italic>, <italic>th-lacZ</italic>, and Diap1were all reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g002">Figures 2A,B, S</xref>2A). Hippo signaling regulates transcription by controlling the sub-cellular localization of Yki: activation of Hippo signaling promotes cytoplasmic localization of Yki, whereas inactivation of Hippo signaling allows nuclear localization of Yki, which corresponds to Yki activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Oh2">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Dong1">[23]</xref>. <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi reduced nuclear Yki. This effect was subtle at late third instar, when levels of Yki in the nucleus are already low, but was evident in younger wing discs, which have higher levels of nuclear Yki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g002">Figure 2C,D</xref>). The decreased expression of Hippo pathway target genes, together with the reduction in nuclear Yki, identifies <italic>Zyx</italic> as a regulator or component of the Hippo pathway. The Hippo pathway is generally thought of as a negative regulator of growth and gene expression, because most genes in the pathway act as tumor suppressors and negatively regulate the activity of Yki. <italic>Zyx</italic>, by contrast, is positively required for Yki activity and organ growth.</p>

<title><italic>Zyx</italic> Acts Genetically Within the Fat-Hippo Pathway</title>
<p>To position the genetic requirement for <italic>Zyx</italic> within the Hippo pathway, we performed a series of epistasis tests. RNAi lines targeted against several different tumor suppressor genes within the pathway (<italic>fat</italic>, <italic>ds</italic>, <italic>ex</italic>, <italic>wts</italic>, <italic>hpo</italic>, and <italic>mats</italic>), each of which phenocopy their respective mutants, were examined in combination with <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi lines. The immediate upstream regulator of Yki is <italic>wts</italic>. Expression of a <italic>wts</italic> RNAi line under <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> or <italic>en-Gal4</italic> control is lethal at late third instar, but imaginal discs can be recovered and analyzed before lethality. Consistent with the expected de-repression of Yki, expression of <italic>wts</italic> RNAi resulted in upregulation of <italic>ex</italic> and Diap1 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). This upregulation of <italic>ex</italic> and Diap1 was not suppressed by <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g003">Figure 3B</xref>); hence, <italic>wts</italic> is epistatic to <italic>Zyx</italic>. Wts activity is directly regulated by a kinase, Hippo (Hpo), and a co-factor, Mats, and <italic>hpo</italic> and <italic>mats</italic> were also epistatic to <italic>Zyx</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–D).

<p>Upstream branches of Hippo signaling have been characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> as Fat-dependent, Ex-dependent, or Mer-dependent. In the developing wing, <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ex</italic> make substantial contributions to Yki regulation, whereas <italic>Mer</italic> has a lesser role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Saburi1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Pellock1">[27]</xref>. Thus, we investigated the relationship between the requirement for <italic>Zyx</italic> and those for <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ex</italic>. Expression of <italic>fat</italic> or <italic>ex</italic> RNAi throughout the wing, under <italic>nub-Gal4</italic> control, results in overgrown wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1E,I,S</xref>). Strikingly, the wing overgrowth phenotype associated with depletion of <italic>fat</italic> was suppressed by <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi, resulting in adult wings of similar size to those of animals that only expressed <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1B,F,S</xref>).

<p>The <italic>ex</italic> RNAi phenotype, by contrast, was only slightly affected by <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi, as the wings of <italic>Zyx ex</italic> double RNAi animals remained overgrown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1J,S</xref>). Moreover, <italic>ex</italic> was epistatic to <italic>Zyx</italic> for effects on downstream target gene expression and Yki localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g004">Figure 4A–D,J,K</xref>). Together, these observations indicate that <italic>Zyx</italic> specifically affects Fat-Hippo signaling and has little effect on Ex-Hippo signaling.</p>
<p>To refine our placement of <italic>Zyx</italic> within Fat-Hippo signaling, we examined requirements for <italic>Zyx</italic> relative to additional pathway components. <italic>dco</italic> encodes a kinase that phosphorylates the Fat cytoplasmic domain and participates in Fat-Hippo signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Sopko2">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Feng1">[29]</xref>. The requirement for Dco within Fat signaling is uncovered by expression of an antimorphic isoform, Dco<sup>3</sup>. Expression of Dco<sup>3</sup> induces wing overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1L</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Feng1">[29]</xref>. This overgrowth is suppressed by <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi, suggesting that <italic>Zyx</italic> acts downstream of <italic>dco</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1P,S</xref>).</p>
<p>Like <italic>Zyx</italic>, <italic>dachs</italic> is required for normal wing and leg growth and acts genetically downstream of <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>dco</italic> but upstream of <italic>warts</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho2">[8]</xref>. To examine the genetic relationship between <italic>Zyx</italic> and <italic>dachs</italic>, we took advantage of the observation that over-expression of Dachs can promote wing overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1Q</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Mao1">[7]</xref>. This overgrowth was completely suppressed by <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figures 1S, S</xref>1G), as was the influence of Dachs over-expression on <italic>ex-lacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s004">Figure S4A</xref>,B). Thus, Zyx is required for Dachs-promoted activation of Yki. Over-expression of Zyx resulted in a mild wing overgrowth on its own (9% increase in wing area, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1H,S</xref>), and synergized with Dachs over-expression, resulting in enhanced wing overgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1R,S</xref>). Together, these observations suggest that the functions of Zyx and Dachs in regulating growth are closely linked. However, the observation that <italic>Zyx</italic> depletion could enhance the small wing phenotype of a putative null allele of <italic>dachs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figures 1S</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s001">S1E,F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Mao1">[7]</xref> implies that Zyx also has some Dachs-independent influence on growth.</p>
<p>Fat exerts a post-transcriptional influence on the levels of Wts protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>. The genetic placement of <italic>Zyx</italic> upstream of <italic>wts</italic> and within the Fat branch of the pathway suggested that <italic>Zyx</italic> might also affect Wts levels. Indeed, <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi completely suppressed the reduction in Wts levels associated with <italic>fat</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g005">Figures 5A,B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s002">S2B</xref>). Thus, <italic>Zyx</italic> is genetically required for the mechanism that links Fat activity to the regulation of Wts protein levels. The influence of <italic>fat</italic> on Warts levels also requires <italic>dachs</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>. <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi did not detectably affect Dachs localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s004">Figure S4D</xref>,E), nor did <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi affect Fat localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s005">Figure S5E</xref>,F).

<p>In addition to regulating transcription, Fat also regulates planar cell polarity (PCP) (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Reddy1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Sopko1">[5]</xref>). PCP in the adult wing is manifest in the orientation of wing hairs, which point distally. The anterior, proximal wing is particularly sensitive to Fat-PCP signaling, and <italic>fat</italic> RNAi results in strong PCP phenotypes in this region, including reversals of hair polarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s001">Figure S1M</xref>). PCP phenotypes have also been described in this region of <italic>dachs</italic> mutant wings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Matakatsu1">[34]</xref>. <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi, by contrast, had no detectable effect on wing PCP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s001">Figure S1N</xref>), and a PCP phenotype was also still detected in <italic>fat Zyx</italic> double RNAi wings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s001">Figure S1O</xref>). Genes previously identified as influencing Fat-PCP signaling (i.e., <italic>fat</italic>, <italic>ds</italic>, <italic>fj</italic>, <italic>app</italic>, <italic>dachs</italic>, <italic>lft</italic>) also influence cross-vein spacing. <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi wings sometimes have extra cross-veins, but by contrast to <italic>dachs</italic> mutants, the anterior and posterior cross-veins remain well-separated in <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi flies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>), and the influence of <italic>fat</italic> on cross-vein spacing is not suppressed by <italic>Zyx</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Our observations suggest that <italic>Zyx</italic> is specifically required for Fat-Hippo signaling, and not for Fat-PCP signaling, although because <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi might not completely eliminate Zyx, we cannot exclude the possibility that low levels of Zyx are sufficient for PCP, but not for Hippo signaling.</p>

<title>Localization of Zyx to the Sub-Apical Membrane</title>
<p>As our anti-Zyx sera did not work for immunostaining, we made use of a V5-tagged UAS transgene that rescues the <italic>Zyx</italic> RNAi phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1</xref>) to investigate the subcellular localization of Zyx in imaginal discs. We also examined a UAS-Ypet:Zyx transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Colombelli1">[35]</xref>. Although our localization studies are subject to the caveat that Zyx protein was over-expressed, the two different tagged Zyx proteins have similar localization profiles, and similar localization profiles were observed using different Gal4 drivers. Zyx was preferentially localized to the sub-apical membrane of disc cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This sub-apical membrane staining was at the same apical-basal position as E-cadherin (E-cad), and just basal to Fat (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6A–D</xref>). This is similar to the membrane localization of Dachs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Mao1">[7]</xref>. Indeed, when we compared Zyx and Dachs localization, using epitope-tagged constructs, we observed that the membrane staining is at the same apical-basal position and that they partially co-localize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6G,H</xref>). A distinguishing feature of Dachs localization is its polarization within the plane of the epithelium, which occurs in response to the Fj and Ds gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6J</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Mao1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Rogulja1">[9]</xref>. Zyx, by contrast, is not planar-polarized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6I</xref>); hence, Zyx and Dachs are expected to overlap on only one side of wing disc cells. A distinguishing feature of Zyx staining is that it often displays puncta of larger, more intense staining at the vertices where three cells meet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). Intriguingly, Ex protein also displays uneven staining, but Ex puncta are partially complementary to Zyx puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6E,F</xref>). These observations suggest that even though Ex and Zyx localize to a similar apical-basal position, they assemble into distinct protein complexes. Dachs localization was not visibly affected by RNAi of <italic>Zyx</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s004">Figure S4E</xref>), nor was Zyx localization affected by mutation of <italic>dachs</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s005">Figure S5B</xref>), which indicates that neither protein depends upon the other for its localization.

<title>Dachs Promotes Zyx-Wts Binding</title>
<p>The similar genetic requirements for <italic>Zyx</italic> and <italic>dachs</italic> in Fat-Hippo signaling, together with their partial co-localization in imaginal discs, raised the possibility that Zyx and Dachs might interact. This was investigated by expressing tagged isoforms in cultured <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells and assaying for physical interactions through co-immunoprecipitation. Indeed, Zyx and Dachs could be specifically co-precipitated from S2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). This observation suggests that Dachs and Zyx can interact directly, although it is also possible that they interact indirectly through a larger complex including endogenously expressed proteins within S2 cells.</p>

Note that in the absence of Dachs, no binding between full-length Zyx and Wts was detected when proteins were precipitated using anti-V5 beads and GFP:V5 was used as a negative control (panel C), but weak binding was detected when proteins were precipitated using anti-FLAG beads and GFP:FLAG was used as a negative control (H).</p>

<p>As Dachs can also associate with Warts in co-immunoprecipitation assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>, and both <italic>Zyx</italic> and <italic>dachs</italic> are required for the <italic>fat</italic>-dependent regulation of Wts levels, we also investigated binding between Zyx and Wts. When tagged full-length proteins were co-expressed in S2 cells, little or no Zyx-Wts co-precipitation was detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7C,H</xref>). However, in addition to their role in Hippo signaling, functions for LATS proteins have also been identified in mitosis, and LATS1 has been localized to the mitotic apparatus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirota1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Nishiyama1">[37]</xref>. In the context of a study of mitotic functions of LATS1, it was reported that the C-terminus of human Zyxin, including the LIM domains, could bind to human LATS1, even though full-length Zyxin did not bind <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirota1">[36]</xref>. When we expressed a C-terminal polypeptide comprising the LIM domains of Zyx (Zyx-LD) in S2 cells, only very low levels of protein could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7B–D</xref>). Nonetheless, this C-terminal polypeptide bound efficiently to Wts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). Thus, the LIM domains of Zyx can associate with Wts, but this association is normally inhibited within full-length Zyx.</p>
<p>The discovery of this latent ability of Zyx to bind Wts, together with our discovery of Zyx-Dachs binding, and previous identification of Dachs-Wts binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>, indicates that Dachs, Zyx, and Wts each have the ability to bind to one another. To gain further insight into complex formation among these proteins, we mapped their interaction domains. Wts bound to the LIM domains of Zyx. Dachs, by contrast, bound most strongly to the C-terminal LIM domains but also bound to the N-terminal half of Zyx (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Dachs contains a large central myosin motor domain and could bind to both Zyx and Wts through this motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7D,G</xref> and unpublished data). Zyx-LD bound to Wts through a region N-terminal to the Wts kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Dachs bound both to this region and also to the Wts kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Thus, Zyx, Dachs, and Wts interact with each other through partially overlapping domains.</p>
<p>To assay for potential sequential, cooperative, or competitive interactions amongst Zyx, Dachs, and Wts, we examined binding interactions when all three proteins were co-expressed together in S2 cells. A key feature of Zyx's interactions with Wts is that full-length Zyx does not bind efficiently to Wts, but the LIM domains do. However, we found that Dachs enhanced the co-precipitation of full-length Zyx with Wts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7H</xref>). Two basic models for this stimulation of Zyx-Wts association by Dachs can be envisioned: (a) Dachs might bridge Wts and Zyx within a Wts-Dachs-Zyx complex, or (b) Dachs might trigger a conformational change in Zyx that reveals the latent Wts-binding activity of the Zyx LIM domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g008">Figure 8A,B</xref>). By employing V5 epitope tags on both Zyx and Dachs, and assaying their co-precipitation with FLAG-tagged Wts, we could directly compare their association with Wts. A simple trimeric complex model (e.g., one subunit each of Zyx, Wts, and Dachs) would predict that Zyx and Dachs should be present within the Wts trimeric complex at equal levels. However, we found instead that Zyx could be much more abundant in Wts complexes than Dachs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g007">Figure 7H</xref>). This suggests that rather than remaining stably associated with Zyx and Wts in a trimeric complex, Dachs is able to stimulate a conformational change in Zyx that exposes the LIM domains and enables them to bind Wts. Consistent with this model, Dachs stimulated Zyx binding to Wts but did not stimulate the binding of Zyx-LD to Wts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s006">Figure S6A</xref>).</p>

<title>Models for Zyx function in Fat-Hippo signaling.</title>
<p>(A) Dachs might bridge Zyx and Wts within a trimeric complex; the simplest version of this model (stoichiometric amounts) would predict that in order for Zyx to be co-precipitated with Wts, Dachs and Zyx levels within the complex would have to be equivalent, which was not observed. (B) Dachs might induce a conformational change in Zyx (either directly through binding as shown or by recruiting other factors), exposing the LIM domains and enabling them to bind Wts. (C) illustrates the distinct roles of the LIM-domain proteins Zyx and Jub in Hippo signaling. Zyx influences the levels of Wts protein, presumably by promoting Wts degradation, whereas Jub inhibits Wts activation. The ability of Zyx to interact with Wts is regulated by Dachs, and Dachs in turn is regulated by Fat.</p>

<p>The determination that <italic>Zyx</italic> and <italic>Jub</italic> are each genetically required for Hippo signaling suggests that they have distinct functional roles, and consistent with this, we observed that over-expression of Zyx could not rescue <italic>Jub</italic> RNAi phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s001">Figure S1H</xref>) and that <italic>Zyx Jub</italic> double RNAi induced an even greater reduction of wing size than when they were expressed individually (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1O,S</xref>). Das Thakur et al. (2010) did not address the relationship of Jub to upstream regulators of Hippo signaling. Intriguingly, we found that depletion of <italic>Jub</italic> suppressed both <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>ex</italic> phenotypes. This suppression was evident upon examination of adult wings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g001">Figure 1G,K,S</xref>), expression of downstream target genes in wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g003">Figures 3F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g004">4E,F</xref>), and the sub-cellular localization of Yki (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g004">Figure 4I,L</xref>). Thus, by contrast to <italic>Zyx</italic>, which functions specifically within Fat-Hippo signaling, <italic>Jub</italic> is required for both Ex-Hippo and Fat-Hippo signaling. This observation confirms that these two LIM-domain proteins have functionally distinct roles within the Hippo pathway.</p>
<p>The distinct genetic role of <italic>Jub</italic> in Hippo signaling is also reflected in distinct binding interactions. By contrast to the crucial role of Dachs in stimulating binding between full-length Zyx and Wts, full-length Jub binds efficiently to Wts, and full-length vertebrate homologues of Jub bind to LATS proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Abe1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-DasThakur1">[40]</xref>. Moreover, Jub bound only very weakly Dachs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000624.s006">Figure S6B</xref>). Thus, although Zyx and Jub share the ability to associate with Wts through their LIM domains, both genetic and biochemical studies indicate that the regulation and consequences of these LIM-domain-Wts interactions are distinct.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our characterization of Zyx identifies a role for it as a novel and integral component of the Hippo pathway, which is required for the Fat branch, but not the Ex branch, of Hippo signaling. Unlike most previously identified components, loss of Zyx reduces the activity of the key transcriptional effector of the pathway, Yki, and consequently its loss reduces organ growth. Genetic epistasis experiments position the requirement for <italic>Zyx</italic> in between <italic>fat</italic> and <italic>wts</italic>, and concordant protein binding experiments identify a Dachs-stimulated ability of Zyx to bind Wts protein. We infer that this association of Zyx with Wts then downregulates Wts, at least in part, by targeting it for degradation.</p>
<p>Zyx localizes to the sub-apical membrane independently of Fat or Dachs. Since Fat regulates the localization of Dachs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Mao1">[7]</xref>, this regulated localization provides a mechanism by which Fat could modulate the interaction of Dachs with Zyx (although we note that Fat might affect the activity of Dachs in addition to affecting its localization). Since Dachs stimulates Zyx-Wts binding, this regulated localization provides a means for Fat signaling to modulate Zyx-Wts binding. We infer that Dachs effects a conformational change in Zyx, as in the absence of Dachs a Zyx LIM-domains polypeptide binds efficiently to Wts, whereas full-length Zyx binds poorly. Intriguingly, the association of vertebrate homologues of Zyx and Warts can also be post-translationally regulated, as the ability of the LIM domains of human LATS1 to bind Zyxin is masked within full-length Zyxin, but uncovered by Cdc2-mediated phosphorylation, presumably due to conformational change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirota1">[36]</xref>. We hypothesize that the ability of Dachs to bind to both the N-terminus and the LIM domains of Zyx enables it to effect a conformational change in Zyx, resulting in an open configuration that can bind to Wts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). It is also possible that Dachs binding stimulates a post-translational modification of Zyx to induce a conformational change.</p>
<p>Prior studies identified two mechanisms by which Fat signaling could influence Yki activity, as <italic>fat</italic> mutation reduces both the levels of Wts protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref> and the amount of Ex at the sub-apical membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Willecke1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Bennett1">[33]</xref>. It has not been possible to completely uncouple these two pathways for Fat-Hippo signaling, although the observation that over-expression of Wts can efficiently suppress <italic>fat</italic> overgrowth phenotypes, but only partially suppresses <italic>ex</italic> overgrowth phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Feng2">[30]</xref>, suggested that the influence of Fat on Wts levels might be more critical. Analysis of the influence of Zyx on Ex is complicated by its influence on <italic>ex</italic> transcription, but our observation that reduction of <italic>Zyx</italic> does not appear to suppress the influence of <italic>fat</italic> on Ex staining, even though it does suppress the influence of <italic>fat</italic> on Wts levels, also suggests that the influence of Fat on Wts levels might be more critical than its effects on Ex. Intriguingly, mutation of <italic>dachs</italic> did suppress the influence of <italic>fat</italic> on Ex levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Feng2">[30]</xref>. Although it is possible that this difference between <italic>dachs</italic> and <italic>Zyx</italic> results from technical differences in the experimental paradigms (e.g., mutant clones versus RNAi), it is also possible that <italic>dachs</italic> can influence Ex levels independently from its association with Zyx.</p>
<p>The discovery of the Fat-specific effect on Wts levels, by contrast to the Hippo-pathway-mediated effect on Wts kinase activity, established the concept of distinct mechanisms for regulating Wts—one that affects Wts levels and another that affects Wts activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Cho1">[6]</xref>. Our identification of distinct genetic requirements for <italic>Zyx</italic> and <italic>Jub</italic> provide further support for this concept. As <italic>Jub</italic> is equally required for both Fat-Hippo and Ex-Hippo signaling and acts genetically between <italic>hippo</italic> and <italic>wts</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-DasThakur1">[40]</xref>, Jub appears to inhibit Wts activation. In our working model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g008">Figure 8C</xref>), the epistasis of <italic>Jub</italic> to <italic>fat</italic> could be explained by an increased activity of residual Wts, which then acts catalytically to repress Yki activity. <italic>Zyx</italic> is required for the influence of <italic>fat</italic> on Wts levels. We note that when measured within a whole tissue lysate, Wts levels are only reduced to approximately half their normal levels. However, as Wts appears to function within multi-protein complexes, including some components that can localize preferentially to the sub-apical membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Yu1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Ho1">[42]</xref>, we hypothesize that Fat signaling affects a discrete pool of Wts within a complex at the membrane that is crucial for Hippo signaling, whereas there might be additional pools of Wts within the cell that are unaffected. We also note that while we clearly see effects on Wts protein levels, our results do not exclude the possibility that Fat signaling also influences Wts activity.</p>
<p>Our characterization of Zyx and Jub also provides new tools for analyzing critical steps in Hippo signaling. For example, in addition to influencing Hpo and Wts kinase activity, it has been observed that Ex can bind directly to Yki and that when Ex is over-expressed it can repress Yki through a mechanism that involves direct sequestration of Yki, rather than regulation of Yki phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Oh3">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Badouel1">[44]</xref>. Because this direct repression mechanism was based on over-expression experiments, the extent to which it contributes to normal Yki regulation in vivo remained uncertain. The observations that <italic>Jub</italic> acts genetically upstream of <italic>wts</italic>, yet is required for <italic>ex</italic> phenotypes, suggests that Ex regulates Yki principally through its effects on Wts activity, rather than through direct interaction with Yki.</p>
<p>The ability of Zyx LIM domains to interact with Wts is conserved in their human homologues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirota1">[36]</xref>. Although the functional significance of this interaction in vertebrates has not yet been established, our observations raise the possibility that the oncogenic effects of human <italic>LPP</italic> mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Grunewald1">[13]</xref> could be due to an ability of these aberrant LPP fusion proteins to negatively regulate LATS proteins, resulting in inappropriate activation of YAP or TAZ.</p>
<p>One of the most intriguing aspects of Zyxin family proteins is their role in mediating effects of mechanical force on cell behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirata1">[18]</xref>. Zyxin family proteins can localize to focal adhesions of cultured fibroblasts, and this localization is modulated by mechanical tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Beckerle1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Hirata1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Smith1">[45]</xref>. The observation that increasing tension on stress fibers stimulates Zyxin accumulation at focal adhesions is intriguing in light of our observation that Zyx tends to accumulate at higher levels at intercellular vertices in imaginal discs, as these could be points of increased tension. As the association of unconventional myosins with F-actin can also be influenced by external force <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Woolner1">[46]</xref>, our discovery of binding between a myosin protein (Dachs) and Zyx raises the possibility that other myosins might also interact with Zyxin family proteins, which could potentially influence either their tension-based recruitment or their activity.</p>
<p>Finally, we note that theoretical models of growth control in developing tissues have proposed that growth should be controlled by mechanical tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Shraiman1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-AegerterWilmsen1">[48]</xref>, and direct evidence for mechanical effects on growth has been obtained in cultured cell models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000624-Nelson1">[49]</xref>. However, a mechanism for how this might be achieved has been lacking. Our discovery that Zyx, a member of a family of proteins implicated in responding to and transducing the effects of mechanical tension, is also a component of the Hippo signaling pathway, a crucial regulator of growth from <italic>Drosophila</italic> to humans, raises the intriguing possibility that Zyxin family proteins might form part of a molecular link between mechanical tension and the control of growth.</p>

Western blots on co-immunoprecipitation experiments, with upper two blots indicating the relative amount of protein in the lysates used for the experiments, and the lower panel indicating the material co-precipitated by the indicated antibody. GFP serves as a negative control. (A) Co-precipitation of V5-tagged Dachs and Zyx-LD with the FLAG-tagged Wts or GFP control, as indicated at top. Addition of Dachs:V5 (3x refers to amounts used in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000624-g006">Figure 6G</xref>) does not increase precipitation of Zyx-LD with Wts. Arrows identify the indicated proteins. (B) Co-precipitation of V5-tagged Dachs with the FLAG-tagged proteins indicated at top.

<p>Primary screening of RNAi lines. All fly lines for the primary screening were obtained from the NIG collection. The first two columns identify the RNAi line and the gene (some genes are represented by two independent RNAi lines). The genes screened included all of the lines targeted against X chromosome genes that were available at the time the screen was initiated, plus a selection of lines for 4<sup>th</sup> chromosome genes, kinases, phosphatases, and myosins. The third column indicates the phenotype when RNAi lines were crossed to a <italic>pnr-Gal4 UAS-dcr2</italic> chromosome. Pnr is expressed in a broad stripe along the center of the notum. A blank entry means that no visible phenotype was detected. The fourth column indicates the phenotype when RNAi lines were crossed to a <italic>vg-Gal4 UAS-dcr2</italic> chromosome. Vg is expressed in a broad stripe along the dorsal-ventral compartment boundary, mostly in the wing but also extending into the hinge and notum tissue. A blank entry means that no visible phenotype was detected. The fifth column indicates the phenotype when RNAi lines were crossed to a <italic>ci-Gal4 UAS-dcr2</italic> chromosome. Ci is expressed in anterior cells. For this cross, we only examined third instar wing imaginal discs, which were stained with antibodies against Diap1 and Wg. For this column, a blank entry means that this genotype was not examined.</p>
