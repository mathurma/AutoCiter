<p>A first indication of the biological role of mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells reveals that this discrete T cell subset is broadly reactive to bacterial infection.

</abstract><abstract>
<p>Control of infection with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb) requires Th1-type immunity, of which CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells play a unique role. High frequency Mtb-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are present in both Mtb-infected and uninfected humans. We show by limiting dilution analysis that nonclassically restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are universally present, but predominate in Mtb-uninfected individuals. Interestingly, these Mtb-reactive cells expressed the VŒ±7.2 T-cell receptor (TCR), were restricted by the nonclassical MHC (HLA-Ib) molecule MR1, and were activated in a transporter associated with antigen processing and presentation (TAP) independent manner. These properties are all characteristics of mucosal associated invariant T cells (MAIT), an ‚Äúinnate‚Äù T-cell population of previously unknown function. These MAIT cells also detect cells infected with other bacteria. Direct ex vivo analysis demonstrates that Mtb-reactive MAIT cells are decreased in peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) from individuals with active tuberculosis, are enriched in human lung, and respond to Mtb-infected MR1-expressing lung epithelial cells. Overall, these findings suggest a generalized role for MAIT cells in the detection of bacterially infected cells, and potentially in the control of bacterial infection.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>About one-third of the world's population is infected with <italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), yet thanks to a robust immune response most infected people remain healthy. CD8 T cells are unique in detecting intracellular infections. Surprisingly, Mtb-reactive CD8 T cells are found in humans with no prior exposure to Mtb. We show that mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells, which have no previously known in vivo function, make up a proportion of these Mtb-reactive CD8 T cells and detect Mtb-infected cells via a specific major histocompatibility molecule called MHC-related molecule 1, which is evolutionarily conserved among mammals. Mtb-reactive MAIT cells are enriched in lung and detect primary Mtb-infected lung epithelial cells from the airway where initial exposure to Mtb occurs. We go on to show that MAIT cells are not specific for Mtb since they can detect cells infected with a variety of other bacteria. Curiously, Mtb-reactive MAIT cells are absent in the blood of individuals with active tuberculosis. We postulate that MAIT cells are innate detectors of bacterial infection poised to play a role in control of intracellular infection.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>Mycobacterium tuberculosis</italic> (Mtb), which causes tuberculosis (TB), remains a leading cause of infectious disease mortality worldwide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-WHO1">[1]</xref>. The majority of TB cases are exclusively pulmonary, suggesting a need for mucosal immunity in the control of Mtb. Th1-type immunity, including strong CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cell and CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell responses, mediates control of Mtb infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Flynn1">[2]</xref>. Though many functions of CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are redundant, CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells contrast with CD4<sup>+</sup> cells in their ability to recognize MHC class II-negative cells and preferentially recognize cells heavily infected with Mtb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn1">[3]</xref>. In humans, Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are present at high frequencies in both Mtb-infected and uninfected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref>. The presentation of peptide antigen bound to HLA-A, B, or C to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells is well characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Grotzke1">[6]</xref> and has been termed HLA-Ia or classical antigen presentation.</p>
<p>Several nonclassical MHC-Ib (HLA-Ib) systems have been described as well. In general, these systems utilize molecules of limited polymorphism to present antigens uniquely characteristic of an infectious pathogen. Examples include presentation of short formylated peptides by mouse H2-M3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Pamer1">[7]</xref>, presentation of lipids and glycolipids by human group 1 CD1 (CD1a‚Äìc) molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Sieling1">[8]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Rosat1">[11]</xref>, and the presentation of bacterial glycolipids by CD1d <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Kinjo1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Behar1">[13]</xref>. In some cases these nonclassically restricted T cells have been found at high frequency prior to pathogen exposure, suggesting an innate role. In our previous studies we have determined that human neonates have high frequencies of innate Mtb-reactive thymocytes that are not restricted by classical HLA-I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Gold1">[14]</xref>. Functionally, such cells could either provide a direct role in the control of intracellular infection or could facilitate the acquisition of adaptive immunity. In humans, Mtb-reactive group 1 CD1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Brigl1">[15]</xref> and HLA‚ÄìE restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Heinzel1">[16]</xref> have been described.</p>
<p>We have observed that all individuals regardless of exposure to TB have CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells capable of recognizing Mtb-infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Gold1">[14]</xref>. Moreover, a proportion of these CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells can be defined as nonclassically restricted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref>. Therefore, to define the relative contribution of classically versus nonclassically (NC) restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we used limiting dilution analysis (LDA) to characterize human, Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in those with TB, those with latent TB infection (LTBI), and those with no evidence of prior exposure to Mtb. We show that CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones from individuals infected with Mtb are primarily HLA-Ia restricted. In contrast, NC restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones that are neither HLA-Ia nor CD1-restricted, predominate in Mtb-uninfected donors but are nevertheless present in all donors. Furthermore, we demonstrate that these NC restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones are restricted by MHC-related molecule 1 (MR1), an HLA-Ib molecule that displays striking evolutionary conservation in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Hashimoto1">[17]</xref>. These human Mtb-reactive T cells recognize Mtb-infected dendritic cells (DCs) and lung epithelial cells. Moreover, we show that Mtb-reactive mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) clones cross react with cells infected with other mycobacteria as well as other bacteria such as <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, <italic>Salmonella typhimurium</italic>, and <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>. These clones express the semi-invariant VŒ±7.2 T cell receptor, are activated in a manner independent of the transporter associated with antigen processing and presentation (TAP), and have a mucosal homing phenotype. These phenotypic data lead us to designate these cells as MAIT cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Treiner1">[19]</xref>, a cell type with no previously known physiological function.</p>
<p>Additionally, we demonstrate that infection with Mtb induces cell surface expression of MR1 on lung epithelium. Furthermore, Mtb-reactive MAIT cells are enriched in human lung and respond to Mtb-infected lung epithelial cells. Finally, we have performed direct ex vivo analysis of Mtb-reactive MR1-restricted MAIT cells, and find they are present at lower frequencies in the blood of those with active TB. These findings suggest that MAIT cells could play a direct role in the control of bacterial infection.</p>

<title>Mtb-Reactive, NC Restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T Cells Predominate in TB-Uninfected Individuals</title>
<p>In humans, direct ex vivo analysis of Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells reveals a strong association of HLA-Ia‚Äìrestricted responses and infection with Mtb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn4">[20]</xref>. Nonetheless, NC HLA-I‚Äìrestricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells comprise a substantial proportion of the overall response to Mtb in Mtb-infected individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn4">[20]</xref>. In individuals with no evidence of infection, we have consistently found high frequency CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell responses against Mtb-infected DCs. To address the hypothesis that NC restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells comprise the dominant response in those without Mtb infection we performed LDA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref> using CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells stimulated with Mtb-infected DCs. LDA was performed on individuals with no evidence of Mtb infection (uninfected controls, <italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää5), individuals with evidence of latent infection with Mtb (LTBI, <italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää5), and individuals with clinical TB (active TB, <italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää6). From each of the 16 individuals, we screened an average of 128 clones per donor (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t001">Table 1</xref>) for their ability to specifically release interferon-Œ≥ (IFN-Œ≥) in response to a panel of Mtb-infected but not uninfected targets.</p>

<p>The antigen presenting cell (APC) target groups were: autologous DCs, HLA-mismatched DCs, or HLA-mismatched macrophages. HLA-Ia restricted clones were defined as those responding only to Mtb-infected HLA matched DCs. DCs were grown in X-Vivo media to ensure expression of cell surface CD1. NC-restricted clones were defined as those responding to all three Mtb-infected APC types. As macrophages do not express CD1, NC CD1-restricted T clones were defined as those responding only to infected DCs. Using this method, we have not observed CD1-restricted T-cell clones, resulting in categorization of all the non-HLA-Ia‚Äìrestricted clones as NC-restricted T cells. None of the T-cell clones were stimulated by uninfected HLA mismatched targets ruling out responses due to alloreactivity.</p>

<p>To facilitate further analysis a representative subset of the NC-restricted T-cell clones from each donor was expanded and further characterized. Phenotypic analysis of expanded clones (<italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää120) revealed uniform expression of CD8Œ± and the Œ±Œ≤ TCR (unpublished data). Additionally, we excluded potential activation by a soluble mediator by successfully using Mtb-infected paraformaldehyde-fixed DCs as stimulators.

<title>Mtb-Reactive NC CD8<sup>+</sup> T-Cell Clones Are Restricted by the HLA-Ib Molecule MR1</title>
<p>To explain the high proportion of NC-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, we considered three hypotheses: presentation by an HLA-Ib molecule, natural killer (NK)-receptor mediated activation, and Toll-like receptor (TLR)-mediated activation. To exclude the possibility that TLR stimulation of DCs would be sufficient to activate the NC clones, we stimulated DCs with agonists to TLR2 (lipoteichoic acid) or to TLR4 (lipopolysaccharide) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Gold1">[14]</xref>, as both TLRs have been associated with Mtb infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Salgame1">[21]</xref>. TLR stimulation of DCs did not result in T-cell activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). To further evaluate the possibility that TLR2 and/or TLR4 stimulation was required for the recognition of Mtb-infected targets, antibody blockade was performed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Neither TLR2 nor TLR4 blockade prevented Mtb-dependent T-cell activation. However, the TLR2 and TLR4 antibodies blocked 100% and 80% of interleukin-6 (IL-6) production by DCs treated with TLR2 and TLR4 agonists respectively (unpublished data).</p>

(D) The pan HLA‚ÄìI (W632) and CD1a, b, c, and d blocking antibodies were added to Mtb-infected DCs prior to the addition of T cells.

<p>NK cells do not utilize a TCR but instead are regulated through opposing signals triggered through inhibitory or activating receptors. Mtb is known to induce the cell surface expression of stress molecules such as ULBP1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Vankayalapati1">[22]</xref> and MICA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Das1">[23]</xref>, which are ligands for the activating NK receptor NKG2D.

<p>We next tested the hypothesis that an HLA-Ib molecule was restricting the NC CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones. We previously isolated Mtb-specific human CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones restricted by the molecule HLA‚ÄìE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Heinzel1">[16]</xref>. Human Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells restricted by the HLA-Ib molecules CD1a, CD1b, and CD1c <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Ulrichs1">[24]</xref> have been extensively characterized. To assess if these HLA-Ib molecules were restricting the NC T cells, we performed antibody blockade experiments. We previously showed that addition of the pan HLA-I blocking antibody W6/32 effectively blocks the HLA‚ÄìE restricted clone (D160 1‚Äì23) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Heinzel1">[16]</xref>. While addition of W6/32 blocked recognition of Mtb-infected targets by the HLA‚ÄìE-restricted clone, three NC-restricted Mtb-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones derived from different donors were unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In addition to blocking all HLA-Ia molecules and HLA‚ÄìE, W6/32 also blocks the HLA-Ib molecule HLA‚ÄìG. As expected, the addition of blocking antibodies previously shown to block responses to CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, or CD1d also had no effect on the clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). We have extended these findings to all 120 NC CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones isolated from the 16 donors listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t002">Table 2</xref>. None of the 120 clones were blocked by the addition of W6/32 or CD1 blocking antibodies (unpublished data). These results suggest that neither CD1a, CD1b, CD1c, CD1d, HLA‚ÄìE, HLA‚ÄìG, nor HLA-Ia molecules restrict the panel of 120 Mtb-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> NC-restricted T-cell clones. These data suggest that a common Mtb-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T subset is present in all individuals regardless of prior exposure to Mtb.</p>

<p>We next postulated that the HLA-Ib molecule MR1 was the restricting allele for the NC clones. MR1 is a nonpolymorphic HLA-Ib molecule genetically linked with the CD1 locus in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Riegert1">[25]</xref> and is the most evolutionarily conserved HLA‚ÄìI molecule among mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Rodgers1">[26]</xref>. MR1 is required for the selection of a subset of T cells found primarily in the gut of mammals and thus named mucosal associated invariant T (MAIT) cells. The expansion of MAIT cells is dependent on the presence of gut flora suggesting that a bacterial derived or induced ligand is required for MR1-restricted T-cell expansion and activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Treiner1">[19]</xref>. Nevertheless, no bacterial or endogenous MR1-restricted antigen has been identified although considerable evidence supports an antigen presentation function by MR1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Hansen1">[27]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang3">[29]</xref>. Furthermore, the biological role of MR1-restricted T cells is unknown, even though several parallels suggest a Natural Killer T-(NKT) cell‚Äìlike regulatory role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Croxford1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Treiner2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, addition of an anti-MR1 blocking antibody (26.5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang2">[28]</xref> prior to the addition of NC clones abolished IFN-Œ≥ production by three different Mtb-reactive NC CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones and an additional 11 clones listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t002">Table 2</xref>. The addition of a different anti-MR1 blocking antibody (8F2.F9) resulted in similar blocking (unpublished data). In contrast, CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones restricted by HLA‚ÄìE (D160 1‚Äì23) or HLA-B08 (D480F6), or a CD4<sup>+</sup> HLA-II restricted clone (D454E12) were unaffected by the addition of the anti-MR1 blocking antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

<title>MR1-Restricted, Mtb-Reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T-Cell Clones are MAIT Cells</title>
<p>We next performed phenotypic analyses of Mtb-reactive MR1-restricted T-cell clones to determine if they shared properties of previously characterized MR1-restricted MAIT cells. We selected a subset of clones representative of TB exposed (active, <italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää5; LTBI, <italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää4) and uninfected donors (<italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää5) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t002">Table 2</xref>). One defining feature of both mouse and human MR1-restricted MAIT cells is the expression of a semi-invariant TCR VŒ± chain: VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33 for humans and the highly homologous VŒ±19/JŒ±33 for mice, respectively. Using an antibody that labels all T cells containing the VŒ±7.2 chain including those that pair with the JŒ±33 region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Martin1">[32]</xref>, the VŒ±7.2 chain was detected by flow cytometry on all 14 MR1-restricted Mtb-specific T-cell clones as well as on an HLA-B08‚Äìrestricted clone, but not on the HLA‚ÄìE, or HLA-II‚Äìrestricted clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g002">Figure 2F</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t002">Table 2</xref>). Given that 14 of 14 randomly selected clones were restricted by MR1, binomial analysis suggests a high prevalence of MR1 restriction among our panel of clones (&gt;95%). Furthermore, we performed an analysis of VŒ±7.2 TCR expression on an additional 28 NC clones. Here all 28 clones expressed the VŒ±7.2 TCR suggesting that the remaining clones are MR1-restricted. The TCR of VŒ±7.2-expressing MAIT cells from the gut has been associated with the expression of the VŒ≤2 or VŒ≤13 TCR Œ≤ chains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Treiner2">[31]</xref>. However, we found at least 10% of the Mtb-specific MR1-restricted T-cell clones did not express either VŒ≤2 or VŒ≤13 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t002">Table 2</xref> and unpublished data). To determine if VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> Mtb-reactive MR1-restricted T-cell clones expressed the canonical VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33 CDR3 region, the TCR alpha encoding cDNA was cloned from six representative Mtb-reactive clones chosen on the basis of their distinct patterns of VŒ≤ TCR usage. All six T-cell clones were found to express the hAV72 segment as expected, and five of six expressed the hAJ33 segment (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t003">Table 3</xref>). Further, all six Mtb-reactive TCRs were found to have VJ junctional heterogeneity with two N additions, as previously reported for VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33 TCRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Porcelli1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Tilloy1">[34]</xref>. Importantly all six TCRs from Mtb-reactive T-cell clones were found to encode CDR3Œ± loops of the same length, which is highly conserved among all mammalian VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33<sup>+</sup> cells studied thus far. And finally, each of the sequences of the CDR3Œ± loops of the five VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33<sup>+</sup> Mtb-reactive T cells matched a sequence from a previously reported VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33<sup>+</sup> cell of undefined restriction and antigen specificity (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000407-t003">Table 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Porcelli1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Tilloy1">[34]</xref>.</p>

<p>Prior work with mouse and human MR1-restricted MAIT cells has demonstrated that neither HLA-II nor TAP are required for thymic selection nor for antigen processing and presentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Tilloy1">[34]</xref>. To determine if TAP transport is required for presentation to Mtb-reactive MAIT cells we used an adenoviral vector expressing the TAP inhibitor ICP47 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g003">Figure 3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-York1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Grotzke2">[37]</xref>. When ICP47-expressing DCs were subsequently infected with Mtb, neither representative MR1-restricted clones, nor an HLA-II restricted clone were affected by TAP inhibition. In contrast, TAP blockade resulted in over 85% inhibition of the response by the CFP-10<sub>3‚Äì11</sub> HLA-B08-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clone. Hence, human Mtb-reactive MR1-restricted T cells, like previously described MAIT cells, do not require TAP for antigen processing and presentation.</p>

<p>DCs autologous to D454 and expressing HLA-B08 were transduced with either a control adenoviral vector or adenoviral ICP47 using lipofectamine 2000. After 16 h, DCs were washed and either left uninfected, infected with Mtb, or pulsed with HLA-B08 specific peptide CFP10<sub>3‚Äì11</sub>. Following overnight incubation, T cells were added (10,000) to DCs (25,000/well) and IFN-Œ≥ production was assessed by ELISPOT. Results are representative of three independent assays.

<title>The Mtb Cell Wall is Able to Stimulate Mtb-Reactive MAIT Cells in an MR1-Dependent Fashion</title>
<p>To determine if an antigen from Mtb could stimulate the NC-restricted T-cell clones, we initially screened the panel of 120 stable NC clones for their ability to recognize autologous DCs loaded with the cell wall (CW) fraction from Mtb. In contrast to HLA-Ia restricted Mtb-specific T-cell clones, we found that all of the NC clones were stimulated by DCs loaded with Mtb CW (unpublished data).</p>
<p>To delineate the antigen recognized by clones we compared the ability of CW to culture filtrate protein (CFP) from Mtb strain H37Rv (courtesy of K. Dobos) to induce a response by a panel of NC-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones (<italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää21 and representative of the 16 donors). As expected, the CW fraction derived from Mtb induced robust responses by all the T-cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas the CFP was not stimulatory. To determine if the presentation of Mtb CW was dependent on MR1 we performed antibody blockade. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows that the CW response by three distinct MR1-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones was dependent on MR1. To further characterize the antigen associated with the CW fraction, we subjected the CW to a variety of treatments and tested the ability of the treated fractions to induce a response by the 21 NC-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). We have found that delipidated CW (dCW), compared to untreated CW, is strongly antigenic. To determine whether or not the MR1 antigen was proteinaceous, dCW was subjected to proteolytic digestion with a panel of proteases. With all but three NC T-cell clones, protease treatment of the dCW abrogated the antigenic activity. The mean and standard error for the respective treatment groups were: (dCW, 298.7+/‚àí31.72); (subtilisin, 69.38+/‚àí20.05); (trypsin, 79.57+/‚àí17.25); (chymotrypsin, 74+/‚àí17.93); (pronase, 33.38+/‚àí10.86); (Glu-C, 113.5+/‚àí27.48).

<title>Mtb-Reactive MAIT Cells Recognize Mtb-Infected Lung Epithelial Cells</title>
<p>Research on TB has traditionally focused on myeloid derived APCs such as macrophages and DCs. However, TB has the capacity to infect a variety of other cell types including epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Bermudez1">[38]</xref>. Moreover, Mtb DNA has been detected in a variety of cell types in the lung including epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-HernandezPando1">[39]</xref>. Furthermore, HLA-Ib molecules are expressed on mucosal epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Blumberg1">[40]</xref>. Because MAIT cells are located in the gut and lung mucosa we hypothesized that MR1-restricted T cells could play a role in the detection of Mtb in lung epithelium. As shown by flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), Mtb infects the human lung epithelial cell line A549 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Bermudez1">[38]</xref>.

Similar results were obtained from four different MR1-restricted T-cell clones. (E) A549 cells were infected with either control vector or adenoviral ICP47. After 16 h, A549 cells were washed and left uninfected or were infected with Mtb (moi 30). Following overnight incubation, T cells were added (10,000) and IFN-Œ≥ production was assessed by ELISPOT. Results are representative of three independent assays. Error bars represent the mean and standard error from duplicate wells.

<p>The ability of anti-MR1 antibodies to block recognition of the Mtb-infected cells implies that T-cell activation is occurring via the cell-surface expression of MR1. Our ability to successfully block DC recognition by MR1-restricted T cells with antibody concentrations lower than 0.5 ¬µg/ml (unpublished data) suggests that low levels of MR1 are sufficient for MAIT cell recognition. Although MR1 mRNA is ubiquitous in all human cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Riegert1">[25]</xref> and MR1 protein detectable in all mouse tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang1">[18]</xref>, cell surface expression of MR1 has not been demonstrated. Mtb infection of A549 cells resulted in the detectable cell surface expression of MR1 while HLA-I expression was unaltered by infection with Mtb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). We have not detected surface MR1 on DCs. We speculate that high levels of Fc receptor expression have made it difficult to discern low-level MR1 expression.</p>
<p>To determine whether or not primary human lung epithelial cells could act as APCs to Mtb-reactive MR1-restricted T cells, we generated human primary large airway epithelial cells from tracheal brushings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Wong1">[41]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g005">Figure 5G</xref>, Mtb-infected large airway epithelial cells elicited a robust response by the MR1-restricted clone D426B1.

We found that Mtb-reactive MAIT cells were uniquely CD8 single positive and CD161 negative. Therefore, subsequently, T cells were selected on the basis of forward and side scatter distribution and then selected on CD8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), such that the numbers presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g006">Figure 6A‚Äì6E</xref> represent frequencies of total CD8<sup>+</sup> cells. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows a representative analysis of Mtb-dependent TNF-Œ± production from VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> and VŒ±7.2<sup>‚àí</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells.

<p>To define the relationship of Mtb-reactive MAIT cells and host infection status, we determined the frequency of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that expressed the VŒ±7.2 TCR as well as the frequency of Mtb-reactive VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> T cells recognizing Mtb-infected APCs in an MR1-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

Nonetheless, a lower proportion of VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> cells was present in those with active TB compared to LTBI. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g006">Figure 6E</xref> demonstrates the frequency CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that were VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> MR1-dependent responses analyzed by donor infection status.

<title>Mtb-Reactive MAIT Cells Are Enriched in the Lung</title>
<p>While MAIT cells have been reported in the gut lamina propria, they have also been described in the lung <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Treiner1">[19]</xref>. To test the hypothesis that MAIT cells resident in the human lung would be reactive to Mtb, the lung and adjacent lymph node (LN) were obtained from two individual organ donors whose lungs were not suitable for transplantation. Single cell suspensions from the LN and lung parenchyma were prepared and T cells were then enriched via magnetic bead positive selection. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g007">Figure 7</xref> represents the results from intracellular cytokine staining assays performed as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g006">Figure 6</xref>. The frequencies of VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> CD8<sup>+</sup> cells in the lungs were similar to those detected in blood. However, the proportion of VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> cells producing TNF-Œ± in response to Mtb-infected APCs was notably higher (donor A, 13%; donor B, 22%) than that seen in the adjacent LN or from the blood of the 19 donors described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000407-g006">Figure 6</xref> (range, 0%‚Äì10.7%; mean, 3.03; median, 2.26). These data therefore demonstrate that a substantial proportion of lung-resident MAIT cells are Mtb-reactive, and that these cells are enriched relative to the adjacent LN and peripheral blood.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Humans both infected and uninfected with Mtb have high frequencies of Mtb-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref>. In this study we demonstrate, by both LDA and direct ex vivo analysis that NC-restricted T cells predominate in TB-uninfected individuals. Moreover, our data suggest that MR1-restricted T cells make up a substantial proportion of the Mtb-reactive CD8<sup>+</sup> NC-restricted T-cell response. Furthermore, we demonstrate that a large panel of Mtb-reactive MAIT clones are broadly reactive with mycobacterial species as well as <italic>E. coli</italic>.</p>
<p>Using LDA, we find that MR1-specific Mtb-reactive clones predominate in individuals without infection with Mtb. Our previous experience with LDA cloning has resulted in the identification of immunodominant HLA-Ia antigens and epitopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn2">[4]</xref>. However, LDA cannot distinguish a proportionate versus absolute reduction in NC responses in individuals with active TB. Here, direct ex vivo analysis confirmed a dramatic reduction in the absolute frequency of Mtb-reactive MAIT cells in individuals with active TB.</p>
<p>CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells restricted by both CD1 and HLA-E have been previously described but were noticeably absent from the LDA and from the resulting CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones. In this regard, it is possible that LDA based on positive selection of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in conjunction with Mtb-infected DCs is not optimal for the selection of these cells. For example, CD1 molecules are downregulated by infection with Mtb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Stenger1">[44]</xref>. Furthermore, CD1-restricted T cells may be less frequent in the CD8<sup>+</sup> population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Brigl1">[15]</xref>. Similarly, we did not isolate Œ≥Œ¥T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-DeLibero1">[42]</xref>. As a result, the relative contribution of different HLA-Ib molecules in the host response to infection with Mtb remains to be determined.</p>
<p>Our findings highlight differences between MAIT cells originally characterized phenotypically, on the basis solely of TCR usage versus those characterized functionally on the basis of reactivity with Mtb. MAIT cells, as defined by the expression of the canonical VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33 TCR, appear to be universally present in humans and range in frequencies from 1% to 4% of peripheral blood T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Martin1">[32]</xref>. Here, we confirm that MR1-dependent, Mtb-reactive MAIT cells are present in the VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> but not the VŒ±7.2<sup>‚àí</sup> population. However, Mtb-reactive MAIT cells represent a relatively small proportion of cells previously defined as MAIT cells. The observation that Mtb-reactive MAIT cells are found exclusively in the CD8 single positive CD161 negative population further defines Mtb-reactive MAIT cells as a subset of all MAIT cells. Our studies do not allow us to distinguish whether or not Mtb-reactive MAIT cells are representative of a uniform population of bacterially reactive MAIT cells or if alternate bacterial specificities exist in the VŒ±7.2 population.</p>
<p>Detailed genotypic characterization of several Mtb-reactive MR1-restricted T-cell clones reveals diversity of TCR usage. Of the six Mtb-reactive VŒ±7.2<sup>+</sup> T cells from which the TCRŒ± sequence was characterized, one does not express the canonical VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33 segment. Furthermore, at least 10% of the Mtb-reactive, MR1-restricted T-cell clones do not express VŒ≤ chains previously found in preferential association with VŒ±7.2/JŒ±33 expressing PBMC of undefined restriction and antigen specificity. Whether or not differences in the TCR reflect antigenic discrimination remains to be addressed.</p>
<p>We speculate that environmental bacteria play a role in the selection and maintenance of human MAIT cells analogous to results previously shown in the mouse model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Treiner1">[19]</xref>. In this regard, TCR heterogeneity could be the result of antigenic selection. We have found that DCs infected with viable mycobacteria (<italic>M. smegmatis</italic> and <italic>M. bovis</italic> bacille Calmette-Gu√©rin [BCG]) can stimulate MR1-restricted Mtb-reactive T-cell clones (unpublished data). Environmental mycobacteria are ubiquitous and therefore may affect MAIT cell selection and maintenance. Nonetheless, we find that cells infected with nonmycobacterial microorganisms such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. typhimurium</italic>, and <italic>S. aureus</italic>, also can elicit a response by the Mtb-reactive MR1-restricted CD8<sup>+</sup> T-cell clones tested thus far. At present, the molecular basis for this cross-reactivity is not known. However, recent studies using limited numbers of mouse MAIT cell hybridomas have implicated antigen presentation in MR1-restricted MAIT cell activation. This conclusion was supported by the fact that an acid eluate of purified mouse MR1 enhanced MAIT cell activation in an MR1-restricted manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang3">[29]</xref>. Importantly, these results were obtained using uninfected cells, suggesting presentation of an endogenous antigen. Thus it is possible that MAIT cell detection of cells infected with various bacteria results from the presentation of an endogenous MR1 ligand induced by infection with various bacteria. Alternatively, it is possible that MR1 presents an exogenous antigen shared by bacteria. However, we note that cell lines overexpressing human MR1 (courtesy Ted Hansen, unpublished data) do not stimulate Mtb-reactive MAIT cells.</p>
<p>Based on analogy with iNKT cells, there is a precedent for recognition of either exogenous antigen or endogenous ligands by CD1d-restricted T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Salio1">[45]</xref>. However, regardless of whether an endogenous or exogenous antigen is being presented by MR1, it seems likely that MAIT cells have only a limited ability to discriminate ligands bound to MR1. Indeed the high level of activation of mouse or human MAIT cells by MR1 of different mammalian species is highly suggestive that all three components (ligand, MR1, and MAIT TCR) were highly conserved in evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang3">[29]</xref>. Again from analogy with CD1d-restricted presentation to iNKT cells, recent structural studies suggest they also have only limited antigen discrimination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Mallevaey1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-ScottBrowne1">[47]</xref>. The identification of physiological MR1 ligands and how they are detected by MAIT cells will clearly benefit from further studies of the extensive panel of human Mtb reactive T cells reported here.</p>
<p>We demonstrate here that infection with Mtb results in a modest induction of surface expression of MR1 on epithelial cells. Failure of past studies to detect surface expression of endogenous MR1 is enigmatic, since MR1 message and ER luminal MR1 protein is ubiquitously expressed in different tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang3">[29]</xref>. Based on these observations, it is attractive to speculate that constitutive expression of MR1 may be deleterious because of inappropriate MAIT cell activation. Such a model would be consistent with studies of induced expression of MICA/B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Bauer1">[48]</xref>. In any case, it is also clear that very little MR1 is likely sufficient for MAIT cell activation based on our antibody blocking and cytofluorometric studies. Alternatively, it is possible that bacterial infection may alter the intracellular trafficking of MR1 and consequently determine which self or bacterial antigens are loaded and presented at the cell surface to MAIT cells. In this regard, it is important to note that in both our studies here and previous mouse studies MAIT cells are activated in a TAP-independent manner. Indeed in the mouse studies trafficking of MR1 to endosomal compartments enhanced MAIT cell activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Huang1">[18]</xref>. In combination, these findings support the model that MR1 trafficking and ligand acquisition are likely altered by bacterial infection.</p>
<p>A surprising finding of this study has been the observation that primary human large airway epithelial cells infected with Mtb can induce a robust response by MR1-restricted MAIT cells. Following inhalation, Mtb is far more likely to encounter airway epithelium than alveolar macrophages. As a result, the capacity of lung resident MAIT cells to respond directly ex vivo to Mtb-infected lung epithelial cells suggests these cells could play a physiological role in directly controlling Mtb in the lung early in infection. Mtb-reactive MAIT cells not only produced IFN-Œ≥ but also TNF-Œ± and granzyme (unpublished data) in response to infected targets. These effector functions could directly inhibit mycobacterial growth. Mtb-reactive MAIT cells, by IFN-Œ≥ conditioning of DCs, could also facilitate optimal priming of Mtb-specific CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 responses that are essential to control the disease in TB-exposed individuals.</p>
<p>Ex vivo analyses of circulating, MR1-restricted, Mtb-reactive MAIT cells demonstrate that subjects with active TB have substantially lower frequencies than those without evidence of infection with Mtb. These data suggest that Mtb-reactive MAIT cells participate in the host response to infection with Mtb. It is also possible that a similar observation would be made in bacterial pneumonia. With regard to Mtb the precise role of MAIT cells remains to be determined. We found that individuals with active TB had reduced Mtb-reactive MAIT cells. One explanation may be a genetic predisposition towards lesser expression of MR1 and/or diminished capacity to process and present bacterially derived ligands. For example, the very limited polymorphisms noted in the MR1 gene, 28 single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) over a region of more than 2 MB, might allow for the delineation of SNPs associated with disease susceptibility. Alternately, it is possible that mycobacterial exposure can elicit and maintain Mtb-reactive MAIT cells. In this regard, it would be interesting to delineate the effect of BCG and/or environmental mycobacterial exposures to the prevalence of Mtb-reactive MAIT cells. Conversely, it is possible that the diminished frequencies reflect either selective migration of Mtb-reactive MAIT cells to disease sites, or their selective depletion through activation-induced cell death.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that MAIT cells, with no previously known in vivo function, recognize bacterially infected cells. Furthermore, we demonstrate an association with Mtb exposure and/or disease status and the prevalence of Mtb-reactive MAIT cells ex vivo. Given these findings and the observation that MAIT cells are broadly reactive to bacterial infection, we postulate that MAIT cells likely play a role in the direct control of bacterial infection and/or in the subsequent acquisition of adaptive immunity to bacterial infections. By virtue of their prevalence, location, and effector functions, MAIT cells are poised to play a significant role in the control of bacterial infection.</p>

<p>Study participants, protocols, and consent forms were approved by the Oregon Health &amp; Science University institutional review board. Informed consent was obtained from all participants. Uninfected individuals and individuals with LTBI were recruited from employees at Oregon Health &amp; Science University as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref>. Uninfected individuals were defined as healthy individuals with a negative tuberculin skin test and no known risk factors for infection with Mtb. Individuals with LTBI were defined as healthy persons with a positive tuberculin skin test, and no symptoms and signs of active TB. Individuals with active TB were recruited via institutional review board-approved advertisement and were self-referred from the Multnomah County TB Clinic, Portland, Oregon, US, or from the Washington County TB Clinic, Hillsboro, Oregon, US. In all active TB cases, pulmonary TB was diagnosed by the TB controller of these counties and confirmed by positive sputum culture for Mtb. Those with active TB were under the care of the local TB controller. At the time of apheresis, subjects were required to be smear and culture negative. PBMCs were isolated from whole blood obtained by venipuncture or apheresis. De-identified lung and LNs were obtained from the Pacific Northwest Transplant Bank (PNTB).</p>

<p>Limiting dilution cloning methodology was performed as previously described with minor modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000407-Lewinsohn3">[5]</xref>. DCs generated for use in cloning and screening T-cell clones were prepared as above with the exception that X-Vivo medium was used (BioWhittaker). Macrophages were generated using a monocyte-isolation kit (Miltenyi) and then grown for 5 d in IMDM (Invitrogen) serum-free medium. When prepared in X-Vivo medium, DCs were CD1a positive and CD14 negative, whereas macrophages grown in IMDM were CD14 positive and CD1a negative. To generate T-cell clones DCs were infected with Mtb (moi 30) overnight. CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were sorted to high purity (&gt;99%) by FACS and were added over a range of dilutions to the infected DCs (20,000/well) in the presence of irradiated autologous feeder PBMC (1‚àíe5/well) and rhIL-2 (10 ng/ml). T cells were screened by ELISPOT 10‚Äì14 d later. All donors from which APCs and T cells were used in these assays were genetically haplotyped (Blood System Laboratory), thereby ensuring a complete mismatch of HLA-Ia alleles when necessary for screening. T-cell clones that retained Mtb specificity were subsequently expanded in the presence of irradiated allogeneic PBMC (25√ó10<sup>6</sup>), irradiated allogeneic lymphoblastoid cell line (5√ó10<sup>6</sup>), and anti-CD3 mAb (30 ng/ml) in RPMI 1640 media with 10% HS in a T-25 upright flask in a total volume of 30 ml.
