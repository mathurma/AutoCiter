        <p>Chromatin insulators/boundary elements share the ability to insulate a transgene from its chromosomal context by blocking promiscuous enhancer–promoter interactions and heterochromatin spreading. Several insulating factors target different DNA consensus sequences, defining distinct subfamilies of insulators. Whether each of these families and factors might possess unique cellular functions is of particular interest. Here, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitations and computational approaches to break down the binding signature of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> boundary element–associated factor (BEAF) subfamily. We identify a dual-core BEAF binding signature at 1,720 sites genome-wide, defined by five to six BEAF binding motifs bracketing 200 bp AT-rich nuclease-resistant spacers. Dual-cores are tightly linked to hundreds of genes highly enriched in cell-cycle and chromosome organization/segregation annotations. siRNA depletion of BEAF from cells leads to cell-cycle and chromosome segregation defects. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses in BEAF-depleted cells show that BEAF controls the expression of dual core–associated genes, including key cell-cycle and chromosome segregation regulators. <italic>beaf</italic> mutants that impair its insulating function by preventing proper interactions of BEAF complexes with the dual-cores produce similar effects in embryos. Chromatin immunoprecipitations show that BEAF regulates transcriptional activity by restricting the deposition of methylated histone H3K9 marks in dual-cores. Our results reveal a novel role for BEAF chromatin dual-cores in regulating a distinct set of genes involved in chromosome organization/segregation and the cell cycle.</p>

          <p>The genome of eukaryotes is packaged in chromatin, which consists of DNA, histones, and accessory proteins. This leads to a general repression of genes, particularly for those exposed to mostly condensed, heterochromatin regions. DNA sequences called chromatin insulators/boundary elements are able to insulate a gene from its chromosomal context by blocking promiscuous heterochromatin spreading. No common feature has been identified among the insulators/boundary elements known so far. Rather, distinct subfamilies of insulators harbor different DNA consensus sequences targeted by different DNA-binding factors, which confer their insulating activity. Determining whether distinct subfamilies possess distinct cellular functions is important for understanding genome regulation. Here, using <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we have combined computational and experimental approaches to address the function of the boundary element-associated factor (BEAF) subfamily of insulators. We identify hundreds of BEAF dual-cores that are defined by a particular arrangement of DNA sequence motifs bracketing nucleosome binding sequences, and that mark the genomic BEAF binding sites. BEAF dual-cores are close to hundreds of genes that regulate chromosome organization/segregation and the cell cycle. Since BEAF acts by restricting the deposition of repressing epigenetic histone marks, which affects the accessibility of chromatin, its depletion affects the expression of cell-cycle genes. Our data reveal a new role for BEAF in regulating the cell cycle through its binding to highly conserved chromatin dual-cores.</p>

      <p>Chromatin insulators/boundary elements (BEs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b002">2</xref>] are defined as sequences able to insulate a transgene from its chromosomal context and to block promiscuous enhancer–promoter interactions or heterochromatin spreading [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b005">5</xref>]. These elements are thought to subdivide the genome into functional chromosome domains, through their ability to cluster DNA loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b002">2</xref>] and to control the deposition of histone epigenetic marks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b008">8</xref>] to regulate chromatin accessibility for gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b013">13</xref>].</p>
      <p>No common signature and/or mechanism of action has been identified among characterized insulators/boundary elements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b002">2</xref>]. Rather, several factors confer insulating activity by targeting different DNA consensus sequences in the known insulators. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, insulating factors include dCTCF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b015">15</xref>], Zw5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b016">16</xref>], boundary element–associated factor (BEAF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b017">17</xref>], and the well-characterized suppressor of Hairy-wing (Su(Hw)) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b019">19</xref>], which targets hundreds of distinct, largely uncharacterized genomic sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b022">22</xref>]. Whether each of these factors and subfamily of insulators might possess distinct cellular functions is of particular interest.</p>
      <p>BEAF blocks both enhancer–promoter communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b023">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>] and repression by heterochromatin, as shown using reporter transgenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>]. This insulating activity of BEAF was also evidenced by a genetic screen in <italic>yeast</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b004">4</xref>], confirming that, unlike de-silencing activity, BEAF binding sites must bracket a transgene for insulation. The hundreds of BEAF binding sites have not been characterized in situ, however, and the cellular function of BEAF remains to be elucidated in vivo.</p>
      <p>Here we have combined computational and experimental approaches to address the function of BEAF binding sites in vivo. We have identified ≈1,720 BEAF <italic>dual-core</italic> elements genome-wide that share an unusual organization conserved over 600 bp. The dual-core signature consists of five to six BEAF binding motifs bracketing 200 bp AT-rich nuclease-resistant spacers. BEAF dual-cores juxtapose to hundreds of genes highly enriched in gene annotations regulating chromosome organization/segregation and the cell cycle. Accordingly, BEAF depletion leads to cell-cycle and chromosome segregation defects. Quantitative RT-PCR analyses further show that dual-cores regulate the expression of key cell-cycle genes including <italic>cdk7</italic> and <italic>mei-S332</italic>. These results are also reproduced in embryos expressing truncated <italic>beaf</italic> mutants, which abolish the proper targeting of BEAF to dual-cores and its insulating activity. Chromatin immunoprecipitation analyses show that BEAF acts by restricting the deposition of methylated H3K9 marks in dual-cores. Our data reveal a new role for BEAF in regulating chromosome organization/segregation and the cell cycle through its binding to highly conserved chromatin dual-cores.</p>

        <title>Breaking Down the Binding Code of BEAF to Dual-Cores</title>
        <p>The DNA-binding activity of BEAF has been well-characterized in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b024">24</xref>]. Each subunit of the BEAF complex targets one CGATA motif. Point mutations within this consensus abolish both its binding and insulating activities. Clusters of three to four CGATA motifs can create high-affinity (K<sub>d</sub> ∼ 10–25 pM) BEAF in vitro binding sites, which we call single elements. A computational scan of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> genome revealed thousands of single elements, yet immunostaining analysis demonstrated that they were not good predictors for BEAF binding in vivo. For example, Chromosome 4 was found to contain hundreds of single elements, yet immunodetection analysis showed only three major BEAF signals on this chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Interestingly, statistical analysis showed that single elements were often organized in a pair-wise configuration. Genome-wide, 988 single elements form 494 so-called “dual-cores,” which harbor two separate clusters of three CGATAs, a statistically significant result (<italic>p</italic>-value ∼ 1e-9). Moreover, 1,226 additional “dual-core–like” elements have a second cluster of two (instead of three) CGATAs. These elements include all characterized BEAF insulators whose activity involves a second, lower-affinity CGATA cluster (K<sub>d</sub> ∼ 400–600 pM) where BEAF binding is abolished when the first high-affinity cluster is mutated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b023">23</xref>].</p>

        <p>Detailed analysis by alignment of all 1,720 dual-core and dual-core–like elements showed a highly organized distribution of their 12,058 CGATAs, which preferentially segregate into two clusters separated by spacers of approximately 200 bp (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). For <italic>scs'</italic> and other characterized BEAF insulators, these spacers were found to be relatively AT-rich [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b026">26</xref>]. Scanning the 1,720 dual-cores for A+T content showed that they all harbor significant AT-rich (&gt;70%) sequences in their spacers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). The remarkably conserved organization of dual-cores indicates that they likely correspond to a highly specific BEAF-binding signature.</p>
        <p>We tested this possibility by assaying BEAF binding to dual-cores by chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and ChIP-on-chip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g002">2</xref>). Based on the signals obtained with anti-BEAF antibodies, dual-cores are expected to be precipitated much more efficiently than single elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Indeed, ChIP analysis confirmed that single elements were not bound by BEAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). In contrast, dual-cores from the 7C locus of the X chromosome were efficiently bound by BEAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, probes 4 and 5), while nearby control sequences or single elements were not (probes 1, 2, 3, and 6). Altogether, 25 out of 25 dual-cores and dual-core–like elements assayed by ChIP were found to be efficiently bound by BEAF in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g002">2</xref>; unpublished data). The <italic>actin</italic> promoter region, which contains six unclustered CGATA motifs, was not bound by BEAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>D; last row), indicating that the distribution of CGATAs in dual-cores, rather than the number of CGATAs <italic>per se</italic>, is important for BEAF binding. Furthermore, ChIP-on-chip analysis over 350 Kbp of the X chromosome strengthens our conclusions, as all major peaks corresponding to regions where BEAF binds in vivo fit into a dual-core or a dual-core–like element (hereafter called “dual-cores”, see black rectangles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g002">Figure 2</xref>; see our database at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.sfu.ca/~eemberly/insulator/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.sfu.ca/~eemberly/insulator/</ext-link> for a complete listing). We note that computer analysis occasionally retrieved minor peaks present in the shoulder of the major BEAF peaks (enrichment &lt;2; red bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g002">Figure 2</xref>) that may be attributed to the cooperative binding of BEAF to additional CGATA motifs present in single elements juxtaposed to dual-cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g002">Figure 2</xref>, see black bars for “single”). However, no peaks were present in regions corresponding to dispersed single elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g002">Figure 2</xref>; see our database), confirming that they are not sufficient for BEAF binding. These results establish that BEAF elements organized into dual-cores indeed define a characteristic in vivo BEAF-binding signature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).</p>

        <title>BEAF Dual-Cores Are Tightly Linked to a Discrete Set of Gene Ontologies</title>
        <p>Analysis of the positioning of dual-cores relative to genes showed that they are preferentially associated with gene-dense regions. 545 dual-cores reside within 500 bp of promoter/transcriptional start sites (TSSs) (<italic>p</italic>-value = 6.7e-119) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), and more than 850 are within 2,000 bp.

However, we could not find any specific enrichment for dual-cores in the 3′ UTR of genes (unpublished data), indicating that the clustering of dual-cores can be attributed to the clustering of genes/TSS rather than the bracketing of genes by dual-cores per se. These features (see our genome-wide database) raise the possibility that dual-cores might exert a function distinct from that of Su(Hw) binding sites, which rarely juxtapose the TSS of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b027">27</xref>].</p>

        <p>Strikingly, genes containing a dual-core near their promoter were statistically enriched in gene-class ontology (GO) groups that include the cell cycle, chromosome organization/segregation, apoptosis, and sexual reproduction (<italic>p</italic>-value &lt; 1e-6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g003">Figure 3</xref>C).

Inspection of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-st001">Table S1</xref> also shows that other cell functions enriched in BEAF dual-cores include GOs that can be linked to phenotypes observed in <italic>beaf</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b029">29</xref>], such as chromosome architecture, germ-cell and imaginal-disc development, and eye morphogenesis defects. We asked whether BEAF might be involved in regulating the cell-cycle and/or chromosome organization by siRNA-mediated depletion of BEAF from cells. Reduction of BEAF levels to background occurred from day 3–4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), when defects in cell growth are first observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). In addition, FACS and microscope analyses showed that BEAF depletion led to a significant and reproducible increase (&gt;3×) in the proportion of cells with 4N DNA content and with phenotypes typical of chromosome segregation defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g003">Figure 3</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g003">3</xref>G). These observations support our conclusion that the selective association of the corresponding GOs with closely linked dual-cores likely reflects a biologically significant localization.</p>

        <p>We next asked whether the phenotypes observed upon BEAF-depletion can be attributed to the loss of activity of BEAF dual-cores associated with 160 genes that control cell-cycle chromosome dynamics.

        <p>To test how BEAF might affect the expression of genes associated with dual-cores that do or do not contain a DREF consensus site, we performed quantitative RT-PCR expression analysis from BEAF-depleted or control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g004">Figure 4</xref>). BEAF depletion did not affect the expression of control genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, left), including those located near a single element (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g004">Figure 4</xref>B; <italic>actin</italic>, <italic>CG9745</italic>) where BEAF does not bind (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The expression of all genes associated with a dual core lacking a DREF element was consistently found to be positively regulated by BEAF by approximately 4-fold to 5-fold (<italic>CG1430, CG10946, CG1444, snf, ras</italic>, <italic>janus</italic>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). These data are in complete agreement with previous work showing that BEAF has a positive effect on gene expression by de-repressing a transgene from surrounding chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b024">24</xref>]. In stark contrast, the expression of all genes associated with a dual-core harboring a DREF consensus, including <italic>cdk7</italic> and <italic>mei-S332</italic>, specifically increased by approximately 4- to 6-fold upon depletion of BEAF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g004">Figure 4</xref>B; <italic>CG32676</italic>, <italic>mei-S332</italic>, <italic>cdk7</italic>, <italic>CG10944</italic>, <italic>ser</italic>). Accordingly, Western blot analysis showed that Cdk7 and Mei-S332 protein levels increased under these conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Therefore, two categories of dual-cores may be found. In those lacking a DREF consensus, BEAF positively regulates gene expression; in those that contain a DREF consensus, BEAF may prevent binding of DREF to its overlapping consensus, thereby controlling the activation of the associated cell-cycle and chromosome organization/segregation GOs.</p>

        <title>Mutagenesis of the DREF Site from DREF Binding Dual-Cores Reveals the Positive Effect of BEAF</title>

Because the <italic>dre</italic> mutant does not modify the CGATA BEAF consensus and still harbors the dual-core signature (2× 3CGATAs separated by the spacer; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg007">Figure S7</xref>B), this construct may be used to reveal the effect of the BEAF dual-core on the expression of <italic>cdk7</italic> independently of DREF.

However, BEAF depletion reproducibly impaired <italic>snf</italic> expression by approximately 6-fold, similar to what we obtained for <italic>cdk7</italic> in the absence of DREF.

        <p>We further tested if BEAF affects the deposition of H3K9me3 marks into dual-cores by performing ChIP analysis using anti-H3K9me3 antibodies on BEAF-depleted, DREF-depleted, or control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g006">Figure 6</xref>C). BEAF-depletion led to a significant and reproducible increase of approximately 8-fold in H3K9me3 levels for the dual-cores linked to <italic>snf-cdk7</italic>, similar to that obtained for <italic>mei-S332</italic> and <italic>CG1430</italic>, and in stark contrast to the stable levels found for the <italic>actin</italic> control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g006">Figure 6</xref>C; unpublished data). In contrast, no variation in H3K9me3 levels could be found upon DREF depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), showing that this increase is specific to BEAF depletion. This result also rules out that the changes we observe overall could be due to off-target effects. Moreover, CDK7 depletion, which severely impaired cell-cycle progression (unpublished data), did not affect the levels of H3K9me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g006">Figure 6</xref>C), indicating that their increase is not due to an indirect perturbation of the cell cycle upon BEAF depletion. Finally, H3K9me3 levels did not vary in control regions located a few kbp away from the dual-core, suggesting that BEAF controls the deposition of this mark locally (unpublished data). These results show that BEAF dual-cores are involved in blocking the deposition of H3K9me3 marks, fully consistent with their ability to positively regulate the expression of dual core-associated genes.</p>

        <p>To confirm that the observed increase in H3K9me3 levels is directly linked to the activity of BEAF, we introduced mutations in two of the CGATA motifs of the dual-core associated with <italic>cdk7</italic> (“<italic>beaf-mut</italic>”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) and transfected this construct or constructs harboring a wild-type dual-core or a dual-core mutated in the DREF site (<italic>dre</italic> mutant, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) into cells.

We sought to determine whether BEAF-regulated deposition of H3K9me3 marks affects the expression of cell-cycle genes. BEAF-depleted or control cells were treated with anacardic acid (AA), a histone acetyltransferase (HAT) inhibitor that globally affects gene expression by altering the accessibility of chromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b040">40</xref>]. AA treatment did not affect the expression of either control genes or dual core-associated genes (compare grey and black bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

        <title>Regulation of Gene Expression Involves the Cooperative Binding of BEAF to Dual-Cores</title>
        <p>Are these variations in gene expression related to the cooperative binding of BEAF to the two clusters of CGATAs present in dual-cores? We sought to answer this question by using transgenic fly lines expressing the C-terminal BEAF self-interaction domain (BID in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g009">Figure 9</xref>A) under the control of a GAL4 activator. BID lacks the BEAF DNA-binding domain, impairing the insulating activity of BEAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>] by preventing its cooperative binding to two nearby CGATA clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g009">Figure 9</xref>B). Importantly, defects in expression of <italic>cdk7</italic>, <italic>snf</italic>, and/or <italic>mei-S332</italic> were highly similar in embryos expressing BID to that observed in BEAF-depleted cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g009">Figures 9</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g004">4</xref>B). This result supports our conclusion that BEAF binding is required to regulate these genes in vivo. It also suggests that the cooperative binding of BEAF to conserved <italic>dual-cores</italic>, which is abolished by BID, may be important for the regulation of gene expression by BEAF. Accordingly, cell functions enriched in BEAF dual-cores include GOs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-st001">Table S1</xref>) that correspond to phenotypes observed following expression of <italic>beaf</italic> mutants, which are lethal to flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>], or to GOs found to genetically interact with these mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b028">28</xref>].</p>

Its C-terminus, required for assembly of BEAF complexes, is called the BEAF self-interaction domain (BID; AA 80–280). As a result, expression of BID under the control of the GAL4-daugtherlesss (da) activator in transgenic flies dominantly competes with the cooperative binding of BEAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>], as represented in (B).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Results of our in silico analysis reveal ∼1,720 BEAF dual-cores in the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> genome that share a striking organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). Genome-wide ChIP-on-chip analysis detects approximately 1,800 significant BEAF binding sites (C. M. Hart, unpublished observations), suggesting that our dual-core database encompasses most in vivo BEAF binding sites. The few (&lt;100) additional peaks not included in our database but detected by ChIP-on-chip analysis may correspond to elements initially scored as single elements but whose organization is close to that of dual-cores. These rare exceptions are in part due to the computer stringency of the dual-core signature. For example, BEAF-1255 can be bound by BEAF in vivo (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg004">Figure S4</xref>), yet this element could not be scored as a dual-core because one out of five of its clustered CGATA motifs lies 3 bp outside the defined 100-bp window (‘out' in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, approximately 10% of the minor BEAF sites are found in regions lacking any CGATA motifs, including the <italic>scs</italic> insulator (unpublished data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b016">16</xref>]. Since this region is not directly bound by BEAF, it is thus possible that some of the minor BEAF peaks are due to indirect interactions between BEAF and other insulator proteins, as previously suggested for the <italic>scs′</italic>–<italic>scs</italic> pair of insulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b016">16</xref>]. Other protein–protein interactions that regulate BEAF binding could also involve the splicing variant of the <italic>beaf</italic> gene itself, called BEAF-32A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b023">23</xref>], which does not harbor the BEAF DNA-binding domain that recognizes clustered CGATA motifs. ChIP-on-chip analysis using antibodies that also recognize this isoform showed no additional major peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg005">Figure S5</xref>, compare ‘−32A' with ‘+32A'), indicating that dual-cores constitute the main binding sites for both BEAF isoforms. Finally, we note that the BEAF-32A isoform is unlikely to play a major role in the activities described here, as its binding is dispensable for the insulating function of BEAF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>], and its expression is not essential for the development of embryos into adult flies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b029">29</xref>]. Taken together, our results show that the BEAF dual-core signature is a bona fide mark that identifies a <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory element that regulates the expression of nearby genes.</p>
      <p>Results of our experiments using both BEAF depletion in tissue culture cells and BID expression in vivo provide clear evidence for specific functions of the BEAF dual-cores, reflected by a selective association with genes that control cell-cycle and/or chromosome organization/segregation. The competition between DREF and BEAF for binding to nested consensus sequences is also supported by ChIP analyses showing that DREF targets' identical sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b034">34</xref>] clearly enriched nearby genes associated with the cell cycle and chromosome dynamic GOs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg006">Figure S6</xref>; unpublished data). Thus, while DREF levels increase at the G1/S transition to activate <italic>mei-S332</italic> and <italic>cdk7</italic> within the appropriate window for cell-cycle progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b032">32</xref>], BEAF may further facilitate this activation by restricting the deposition of H3K9me marks. Indeed, over-expressing BEAF was shown to reduce the phenotypes related to cell-cycle progression in flies that over-express DREF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b033">33</xref>], supporting a role for BEAF in controlling the cell cycle. Such a model is also supported by our observation that AA treatment strongly represses these genes in BEAF-depleted cells and that mutation of the BEAF-binding site in a dual-core results in a local increase in H3K9m3 levels. In addition, computer analysis of micro-array expression data for <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos during early development shows that the 545 genes associated with dual-cores are positively correlated with <italic>beaf</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg007">Figure S7</xref>A), in contrast to genes unlinked to these elements (<italic>p</italic>-value ∼ 3e-17 according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). This strict correlation further indicates that BEAF has a global positive role on gene expression genome-wide, and similar analyses did not reveal any significant correlation change between genes whose TSS is closely juxtaposed (&lt;100 bp) to dual-cores, including <italic>snf</italic> or <italic>cdk7</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg007">Figure S7</xref>B), compared to genes whose TSS is more distant (500 bp). Accordingly, the cell-cycle and chromosome dynamics GOs that include <italic>cdk7</italic> and <italic>mei-S332</italic> are enriched for positively correlated genes (see our database for a detailed list). Taken together, our results show that BEAF could play an important role in chromosome organization during the cell cycle through a regulated switch involving the BEAF–DREF competition: According to such a mechanism, BEAF would restrict the deposition of H3K9me3, allowing dual-core–associated genes to remain in a potentially active state, while controlling the time of activation of cell-cycle GOs by DREF. Accordingly, BEAF depletion leads to down-regulation of genes associated with a dual-core lacking a DREF element (CG10946, <italic>ras</italic>, CG1430, <italic>Janus</italic>, CG1444), but to increased expression of CG32676, <italic>mei-S332</italic>, <italic>cdk7</italic>, CG10944, and <italic>ser</italic>, which are under the control of DREF-associated dual-cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In the latter case, the apparent contradiction between the positive—restriction of H3K9me3 deposition—and negative effects of BEAF can be reconciled by our results showing that BEAF controls the activation of these genes by DREF. BEAF depletion relieves the competition for binding by DREF, leading to the increased expression of <italic>cdk7</italic> or <italic>mei-S3332</italic> in spite of an increased deposition of H3K9me3 marks under these conditions. Mutating the DREF or BEAF binding sites of DREF-associated dual-cores (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g007">7</xref>) allows for distinguishing between these different effects on the expression of linked genes.</p>
      <p>It is intriguing that the spacers of dual-cores are well-conserved. One possibility is that they may be preferentially bound by a nucleosome, as recently shown for CTCF insulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b041">41</xref>]. Supporting this idea, the known dual core-spacers correspond to nuclease-resistant “cores”, between two nuclease-hypersensitive sites (BE76, <italic>scs′</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg008">Figure S8</xref>), where a nucleosome may be present (C. M. Hart, unpublished observations). Indeed, we found that dual core-spacers fall within predicted nucleosome-positioning sequence (NPS) databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b044">44</xref>], as indicated by NPS/dual-core sequence alignments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg008">Figure S8</xref>; not shown), possibly accounting for the conserved organization of dual-cores. Our results further suggest that the cooperative binding of BEAF across these AT-rich spacers may be important for BEAF function. Indeed, expression of BID, which prevents its cooperative binding across the spacers, mimics the effect of BEAF depletion on the expression of dual-core–associated genes, as also found by mutagenesis of two CGATA motifs from one dual-core cluster. However, BEAF still efficiently binds in vivo to the few dual-cores that harbor a shorter spacer (&lt;150 bp; e.g., see Dual-core 1,254, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>; unpublished data), indicating that the conserved dual-core–spacer is dispensable for BEAF binding. Recent reports have shown that gene expression is differentially regulated through nucleosome positioning in several species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b043">43</xref>]. Positioned nucleosomes may restrict promoter accessibility in yeast, and pausing of RNA polymerase II facing the +1 nucleosome may be regulated through nucleosome positioning in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b044">44</xref>]. Similarly, dual-cores are also closely associated with TSSs, and a potential link to nucleosome positioning strengthens the view that BEAF may regulate chromatin accessibility for gene expression through a restriction of the deposition of methylated H3K9 marks into dual-cores.</p>
      <p>Our model whereby dual-cores regulate the deposition of specific epigenetic marks is in agreement with the activity of other known insulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b011">11</xref>].

However, no variation in the deposition of H4Ac could be found in dual-cores compared to control regions after BEAF depletion (unpublished data). This is not surprising, as BEAF has no de-silencing activity on its own [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>]. Computer analysis failed to reveal any enrichment of dual-cores near the 3′UTR of genes, and the activity of dual-cores may thus essentially play a role in regulating chromatin accessibility near promoter regions, but not within the 3′ border of genes. Furthermore, the insulating activity of BEAF was demonstrated in the context of two dual-cores bracketing a transgene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b025">25</xref>], and most likely also involved higher-level chromatin organization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b002">2</xref>]. Although not enriched near the 3′UTR of genes, dual-cores still bracket/separate groups of genes clustered within 5–15 Kbp, a genomic context that may further require insulating activity to block promiscuous enhancer–promoter interactions and involve DNA looping between distant insulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b002">2</xref>]. It has recently been shown for a Su(Hw) insulator that the regulation of gene expression may further depend on its genomic environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b046">46</xref>]. Also, other dual-cores are often found in the vicinity of genes exposed to repression by heterochromatin (see our genome-wide database), and the function of BEAF may be particularly important in this context [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b024">24</xref>]. We propose that the BEAF dual-cores closely linked to a restricted array of several hundred genes define a family of insulators that provide a link between chromatin organization and the cell cycle.</p>

        <p>Each single BEAF element that was not a part of a dual-core element was analyzed for the presence of a “dual-core–like” signature. We define single elements as consisting of three CGATAs within 200 bp, and a dual-core–<underline>like</underline> element as a single BEAF element (three CGATAs) associated with a second nearby (&lt;800 bp) cluster of two CGATA sites within a 100-bp window. 1,226 BEAF elements fit into this classification, including all previously identified dual-cores (BE76, BE28, BE51, Jan/Ser(BE83)). The position of each CGATA site within a dual-core sequence was analyzed relative to the position of the rightmost site of the first BEAF single element. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060327-sg001">Figure S1</xref>, the position of each CGATA motif was measured from the average position (taken as position 0 on the <italic>x</italic>-axis) of all the CGATA locations in the first BEAF single element of the dual-core.

        <title>Statistical significance of the distribution of BEAF dual-cores.</title>

For a given W and DC, we predicted N(W,DC), the frequency of dual-cores for a certain DNA length. To assess the significance of N(W,DC), we compared it to the number of randomly distributed elements for the same DNA length. If the probability of a random dual-core element to occur within a window of size W is p, then the probability that there are ≥DC elements in W is P(W,DC) = B(x &gt; DC,W,p), where B is the binomial distribution. The expected number of domain predictions for these random elements is then E(W,DC) = Nwin(W)*P(W,DC), where Nwin(W) is the number of non-overlapping windows of size W in the entire genome. The <italic>p</italic>-value for N(W,DC) can then be evaluated using the expected number E(W,DC) as a function of W and DC.

Equivalent amounts of chromatin samples were sonicated using a Diagenode Bioruptor and immunoprecipitated with 4 μl of anti-H3K9me3 (Abcam). Precipitated DNA was analyzed by real-time PCR in parallel with genomic DNA using a Roche Light Cycler and a Light Cycler FastStart DNA Master SYBR green kit. The amplified DNA fragments (&lt;250 bp) cover regions corresponding to the indicated elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g007">7</xref>).

The immunoprecipitated DNA was analyzed in parallel with input genomic DNA as a standard. For ChIP-on-chip assays using H3K9 antibodies, precipitated DNA was amplified by ligation-mediated PCR (LM-PCR). 4μg of each amplified sample was used to hybridize on 3 × 385 K tiling microarrays representing the euchromatic, non-repetitive regions of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> genome sequence (Flybase release 4.3) from Nimblegen Systems (GEO accessions: GPL3352, GPL3353, GPL3354). To calculate whether the levels of enrichment are statistically significant for each array, a normal distribution was calculated, with the assumption that the mode and median absolute deviation of the normalized log2 ratios are the average and the standard deviation of the normal distribution, respectively. Assuming that the normal distribution covers the entire background noise (non-significant signals), a <italic>p</italic>-value was calculated for each oligonucleotide signal.

Primers consisted of a complementary template portion, a floating end with a T7 promoter and an EcoR1 site located at the other end. 5 μg of DNA template were transcribed for 2 hours at 37 °C in the presence of 0.5 mM rNTPs, 10 mM DTT, 120 units RNAse inhibitor, 60 units T7 polymerase in its 1× buffer in a 100 μl final volume. cDNA degradation was performed for 30 to 40 minutes at 37 °C in the presence of 4 units RQDNase in a 400 μl final volume of the recommended buffer. dsDNAs were then extracted with phenol/chloroform, ethanol-precipitated, and solubilized in 20 μl TE, pH 7.5. The resulting sequences were checked for potential off-target effects by performing searches with dsCheck [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b048">48</xref>] (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dsCheck.RNAi.jp/" xlink:type="simple">http://dsCheck.RNAi.jp/</ext-link>).

Depletion of <italic>beaf</italic>32 mRNA was assayed by RT-PCR at 1, 3, or 5 days after treatment. Cells were grown for 5–6 days, and samples were recovered for total RNA, immunostaining, or immunoblotting analysis. FACS analyses were performed after resuspending control or BEAF-depleted cells and staining their DNA with propidium iodide. Analysis of gene expression was performed by quantitative RT-PCR on cDNAs prepared by RT-PCR from BEAF-depleted or control cells (+5–6 days), untreated or treated with AA (5 μM) for 24 hours. Each measurement was reproduced three times and in two independent RNA extraction experiments. For gene expression analysis, cDNAs prepared from control or BEAF-depleted cells were quantified in parallel with genomic DNA by RT-PCR using a Qiagen Light Cycler. Transfections of plasmids were performed using Lipofectamine (Invitrogen) for 2 hours according to the manufacturer's instructions, 48 hours before RNA purification. Measurements of gene expression for the transfected (wild-type or mutant) constructs were performed using primers that specifically amplify cDNAs from the tags introduced at the 5′ and 3′ borders (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g005">Figure 5</xref>) and that were unable to amplify cDNAs from untransfected cells (unpublished data). Expression was normalized to the copy number of transfected constructs estimated by quantitative PCR of input genomic DNA. For endogenous genes, the primer sequences were selected from the coding regions (≈1,000 bp 3′ from promoter start) of each gene. For endogenous <italic>cdk7/snf</italic>, the selected primers lie outside (15 bp 5′ or 3′) of the tags. For other analyses, two primer pairs were used alone or in combination to confirm the specific increase/decrease in gene expression, using actin as a control. For quantitative RT-PCR analysis in embryos, males with the BID transgene on Chromosome 2 (CyO/Sp1; BID2B) were crossed with virgin females harboring an embryonic da-GAL4 driver (<italic>daughterless</italic>) on Chromosome 3. The corresponding measurements were compared to those from embryos expressing da-GAL4 alone or from BID2B embryos without a da-GAL4 driver.</p>

Distribution of correlation coefficients between the expression profile of genes with (red) or without (black) BEAF dual-cores (i) in their promoters (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). “+” and “−” signs indicate statistical enrichment for co-regulated and anti-correlated gene expression profiles, respectively. As a positive control, the target genes for DREF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b050">50</xref>] are enriched, as expected, for a minor subpopulation highly co-expressed with DREF (ii), but less significantly (<italic>p</italic>-value of 0.004 according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test) than BEAF, which has a more global positive effect on gene expression (<italic>p</italic>-value ∼ 3e-17 according to the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test).</p>
          <p>(B) Distribution of the BEAF (CGATA, green boxes) and DREF (TATCGATA, red) motifs in the Dual-core 38_D with respect to <italic>snf</italic> and <italic>cdk7</italic> (TSS corresponds to the first colored bp).</p>

          <title>The Spacers of BEAF Dual-Cores Fit into Nucleosome-Positioning Sequences</title>
          <p>(A,B) Relative positioning of CGATA BEAF consensus binding motifs and the position of putative NPSs predicted by submitting dual-core sequences to available databases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060327-b043">43</xref>] in the <italic>cdk7</italic> and <italic>mei-S332</italic> promoter regions (A) as well as in &gt;20 cell-cycle regulatory genes (B) (see our Web site for a list). Predicted NPSs are indicated by purple boxes below dual-cores (A) or as an overlay of predicted NPSs (B). The relative position of nuclease-resistant cores is indicated (N; according to experiments as shown in (C)). These predictions fit with the positions of AT-rich dual-core spacers (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060327-g001">Figure 1</xref>D).</p>
          <p>(C) Mapping of the accessibility of naked DNA control (top photograph) and of chromatin by nuclease digestion of nuclei (MNase,“M”; or DNAase I, “D”; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). To map nuclease-resistant/sensitive regions with respect to CGATA clusters of dual-cores, purified genomic DNA was further digested with a second enzyme (<italic>Pvu</italic>II +<italic>Not</italic>I or <italic>Eco</italic>RI) which cuts into the first CGATA cluster or 50 bp 3′ of the second CGATA cluster, respectively (see dotted lines below the autoradiogram). The dual-core spacer fits into a nuclease-resistant core region bracketed by hypersensitive sites. Note that these features are not found in the naked DNA control, where genomic DNA was first purified before MNase digestion.</p>
