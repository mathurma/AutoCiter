        <p>Advances in high-throughput DNA sequencing technologies have determined an explosion in the number of sequenced bacterial genomes. Comparative sequence analysis frequently reveals evidences of homologous recombination occurring with different mechanisms and rates in different species, but the large-scale use of computational methods to identify recombination events is hampered by their high computational costs. Here, we propose a new method to identify recombination events in large datasets of whole genome sequences. Using a filtering procedure of the gene conservation profiles of a test genome against a panel of strains, this algorithm identifies sets of contiguous genes acquired by homologous recombination. The locations of the recombination breakpoints are determined using a statistical test that is able to account for the differences in the natural rate of evolution between different genes. The algorithm was tested on a dataset of 75 genomes of <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic> and 50 genomes comprising different streptococcal species, and was able to detect intra-species recombination events in <italic>S. aureus</italic> and in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic>. Furthermore, we found evidences of an inter-species exchange of genetic material between <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>Streptococcus mitis</italic>, a closely related commensal species that colonizes the same ecological niche. The method has been implemented in an R package, <italic>Reco</italic>, which is freely available from supplementary material, and provides a rapid screening tool to investigate recombination on a genome-wide scale from sequence data.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The extent to which recombination occurs in natural populations is either unknown or controversial but it is widely accepted that recombination plays a crucial role in the evolution of many bacterial species. Numerous methods have been developed for the investigation of recombination events, but most of them require expensive computations and are applicable only to a limited number of genomes or to short nucleotide sequences. Here we present a new algorithm designed to identify recombination events affecting a group of adjacent genes. The procedure is based on the comparison of gene sequences and requires as input the matrix of gene conservation of a test genome against a group of reference genomes. The method is fast, and has minimal computational requirements. Therefore, it can be applied to datasets composed of a large number of complete genomes, and can be easily adapted to analyze data directly from high-throughput sequencing projects. We applied the algorithm to a dataset of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and streptococcal genomes and we found evidence of yet undetected inter and intra-species recombination events, suggesting that the use of <italic>Reco</italic> will shed new light on the evolution of bacterial species, and provide important information to improve classification criteria of bacterial species.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Recombination, the integration of foreign DNA in the chromosome of an acceptor cell, is one of the major evolutionary forces in bacterial species. Recombination can be mediated by viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Canchaya1">[1]</xref>, direct cell-to-cell contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Chen1">[2]</xref> or transformation, when exogenous DNA is up-taken from the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Claverys1">[3]</xref>. Homologous recombination occurs through the replacement of genomic segments with the homologous DNA from a donor of the same species, or from another, often closely related, species. Since the efficiency of RecA-mediated recombination decreases with increasing sequence divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Spratt1">[4]</xref>, recombination events are far more likely to occur between closely related DNA sequences, although homologous recombination is possible also when the sequence identity between the recipient and donor strains is as small as 70% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Townsend1">[5]</xref>. In general, the incoming DNA must contain regions of high similarity to the recipient genome of length comprised between 25 and 200 bp to initiate DNA pairing and strand exchange <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Thomas1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Homologous recombination may involve whole genes or even larger segments. Whole genome sequencing has shown that homologous recombination is frequent in <italic>Streptococcus pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Donati1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Hiller1">[8]</xref>, with a mean length of the insert of approximately 6.3 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Croucher1">[9]</xref>. Exchanges of much larger DNA fragments occur in several other bacterial species. The distribution of Single Nucleotide Polymorphisms (SNPs) showed that isolates of <italic>Streptococcus agalactiae</italic> and <italic>Clostridium difficile</italic> can recombine DNA segments exceeding 300 kb with unrelated strains of the same species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Brochet1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-He1">[11]</xref>. Evidence of recombination involving the exchange of large chromosomal elements has been found in <italic>Staphylococcus aureus</italic>, involving the acquisition of sequences up to 557 kb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Holden1">[12]</xref>. These processes represent a major source of genomic diversity and are important in driving the emergence of clonal complexes and hypervirulent strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Brochet1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-He1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Holden1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Numerous approaches have been developed to measure the frequency of recombination and to determine the chromosomal locations of the inserted sequences. Parametric methods estimate the recombination rate <italic>ρ</italic> = 4<italic>N<sub>e</sub>r</italic> (where <italic>N<sub>e</sub></italic> is the effective population size and <italic>r</italic> is the per-base recombination rate) from the decline of linkage disequilibrium (the non-random association between alleles at different loci) with increasing distance along the chromosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Awadalla1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Conway1">[14]</xref> by applying Markov Chain Monte Carlo methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Didelot1">[15]</xref> within the framework of coalescent theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Hein1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Hey1">[17]</xref>. Hudson <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Hudson1">[18]</xref> developed a flexible, <italic>ad hoc</italic> method for estimating <italic>ρ</italic> by combining the coalescent likelihoods of each haplotype configuration for all pair-wise comparisons of segregating sites. Comparative methods that take into account the effects of recombination events on base composition, codon usage and base identity are the most common among non-parametric methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Betran1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Smith1">[20]</xref>. Finally, phylogenetic methods infer recombination by comparing phylogenies from different parts of the genome, based on the assumption that high level of congruence among trees correlates with a lower frequency of recombination while little or no congruence is related to a higher rate of recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Feil1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Posada1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Westesson1">[23]</xref>. Many of these algorithms for recombination detection have been combined in a single software package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Martin1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Martin2">[25]</xref>. These methods, although very accurate, are applicable only to relatively short and recently diverged sequences, for which an accurate multiple alignment is available.</p>
      <p>Here, we introduce a novel method that, using a discrete filtering procedure of the gene conservation profiles in a panel of unrelated strains, identifies sets of contiguous genes likely acquired by homologous recombination. Due to its modest requirements in terms of computational resources, the method can be applied to large panels of complete genome sequences. The method was able to confirm known events of recombination involving genomes of <italic>S. aureus</italic>, accurately detecting the donor genomes and the genomic positions of the recombinant sequences. Additionally, the algorithm identified previously undetected recombination events in the genomes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>. The filtering of sequence conservation data makes it feasible to also detect inter-species recombination events, where methods based on multiple sequence alignments are more difficult to apply. The method, implemented in the package <italic>Reco</italic>, provides a rapid and lightweight screening tool to investigate recombination on a genome-wide scale from sequence data.</p>

Clonal Complexes (CCs) are groups of STs that share a recent common ancestor, defined by the eBURST algorithm by partitioning the MLST data set into groups of single-locus variants (SLVs), i.e., profiles that differ at 1 of the 7 MLST loci. This partitioning associates each ST with one CC and identifies the most likely founder ST, which is defined as being the ST with the greatest number of SLVs within the CC. Computed CCs were named after the ST of the predicted founder.

        <title>Gene comparison</title>
        <p>The genes of each strain in the collection of 75 genomic sequences of <italic>S. aureus</italic> and of the 50 streptococci were aligned using FASTA version 3.5 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Pearson1">[29]</xref> against all other strains in the same collection. Orthologs were identified using the reciprocal-best-hit algorithm with lower bounds of 75% identity on 75% of the sequence length. In general, other choices are possible. The only requirement of the method is that there is a 1-to-1 correspondence between the genes in each genomic sequences. In the case of nearly identical reciprocal-best-hits the regions harboring these should be treated separately. Being based on comparison between genes, the algorithm does not distinguish if a gene is located in different regions in the different strains. This feature allows to study recombination events also in cases where a complex series of rearrangements occurred after the recombination event, and to use directly data from Next Generation sequencers, where the assembly of long contigs can be problematic. However, where possible, the user should directly check the position of the genes involved in the putative recombination on the genomic sequences. Using these data, for each genome we computed the identity matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the pair-wise percentage of identity of the <italic>n-</italic>th gene with the homologous gene in the <italic>m-</italic>th genome.</p>

        <title>Recombination detection algorithm</title>
        <p>The purpose of the algorithm is the identification of recombination events affecting groups of adjacent genes in a genomic sequence. In the following, we will define as “recombinant” the strain(s) containing the recombinant segment, as “major parent” the strain(s) contributing the genetic backbone of the recombinant strain, and as “minor parent” the strain(s) contributing the sequence that was inserted into the backbone by the recombination event. The identification of recombination events affecting more than one gene has to face two obstacles, which are related to the age of the event itself, <italic>i.e.</italic> the amount of time since the event occurred, and the subsequent evolution of the sequence. Neighboring genes, coding for proteins with different functions and experiencing widely different selective pressures, can evolve at different rates, progressively erasing the phylogenetic signals of recombination. Moreover, later recombination events can superimpose on older ones, resulting in fragmented patterns, which are difficult to reconstruct. To overcome these difficulties, we designed a digital filter that first performs a smoothing of the conservation data of neighboring genes, and then reduces the smoothed data to a binary scale. Using this filter, the fragmented pattern is averaged out and the signals from the events larger then a given length scale are enhanced. Since this scale is determined by a free parameter of the algorithm (the sliding window size <italic>l</italic>, see below), using different values of the parameters can lead to a clearer picture of the signal present in the data. The discretization is based on the gene-specific distribution of sequence conservation, and is therefore independent from the rate of evolution of single genes. The procedure can be schematically divided into the following steps:</p>
        <sec id="s2e1">
          <title>Step 1: Detection of putative donor genomes</title>
          <p>The purpose of this step was to identify sets of contiguous genes with an anomalous level of conservation compared to one or more reference genomes, independently from the rates of evolution of the individual genes.</p>
          <p>Initially, we selected one test genome, for which we wanted to identify the genes recently acquired by homologous recombination. For this genome, we computed the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the sequence conservation of the <italic>n</italic>-th gene in the <italic>m</italic>-th reference genome (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of genes in the <italic>m</italic>-th reference genome). To eliminate short-range fluctuations in the conservation profile and restrict our search only to recombination events exceeding a given size, for circular genomes we defined <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002668.e007"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e007" xlink:type="simple"><label>(1)</label></graphic></disp-formula>where:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002668.e008"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a weighting function, <italic>l</italic> is the length of the sliding window over which the short range fluctuations are averaged, and mod indicates the modulus function, <italic>i.e.</italic> a mod b is the remainder of the integer division a/b.</p>
          <p>For linear genomes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined as:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002668.e011"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e011" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>In the language of signal theory the sliding window weighted average in (1) or (2) is equivalent to implementing a digital filter, and the effect of the filtering depends on the choice of the size of the sliding window <italic>l</italic> and of the weighting function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Oppenheim1">[30]</xref>. Although any function with a compact support could be used as a weighting function, in the following we have used a modified <italic>rect</italic> function:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002668.e013"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> factor guarantees the normalization, so that the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the average of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over a sliding window of size <italic>l</italic>, a procedure commonly used in signal preprocessing (see, for instance, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Lingjaerde1">[31]</xref>). When a gene is absent, the average is computed only over the present genes, and the normalization factor is modified accordingly. The average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is then used for the whole region. While careless use of this procedure can lead to incorrect conclusions, direct inspection of the putative recombinant region should allow the user to easily identify the absent genes. On the other hand, this procedure allows the identification of recombining regions also in the presence of insertions or deletions that occurred after the recombination event and that could obscure the recombination pattern. This moving average approach is a compromise between the need to reduce the noise affecting the individual points, and the attempt to achieve maximum sensitivity to localized variations in the data.</p>
          <p>Beside the <italic>rect<sub>l</sub></italic> function, other weighting functions (<italic>Gaussian</italic> and <italic>sinc</italic> function) have been tested. The results obtained with these alternative choices were comparable, and these functions can be chosen as alternative filtering methods in the software implementation of <italic>Reco</italic>. The size of the support of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was tuned according to the size of the recombination events that we wanted to identify, and, except where otherwise stated, was set equal to 25 genes. In general, given that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is averaged over a sliding window of size <italic>l</italic>, events involving less than <italic>l</italic> genes are averaged out by this step. Choosing the right value of <italic>l</italic> is essential for the efficacy of the method, and several choices should be tested by the user.</p>
          <p>To visually identify regions of the target genome showing an anomalous pattern of sequence conservation with the reference genomes, we then converted the filtered matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> into a discrete 0–1 matrix by the following rule:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002668.e021"><graphic orientation="portrait" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a gene-specific cut-off value. In general, other strategies to highlight the regions where there is a change in the pattern of sequence relatedness between the sequences of the same size are possible. One possibility would be ranking the sequences according to their similarity to the test strains. However, in the case of highly conserved sequences, this method is very sensitive to random sequence variation due to genetic drift, and could yield a high rate of false positives. The optimal value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is indirectly influenced by the number and genetic relatedness of the genomes included in the analysis. In the following, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is set to the value of the limit of the third quartile of the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> genomes, but a lower cut-off value <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> should be set to correct for the sampling bias when the dataset includes closely related sequences.</p>
          <p>The choice to discretize the data using the gene-dependent distribution of sequence conservation allowed us to correct for differences in the natural rate of evolution between different genes. In this way, while the actual value of the cut-off for sequence conservation was different for each gene and depended on the gene-specific mutation rate, regions of the test genome having an anomalously high level of conservation with the reference sequence were readily identified.</p>

          <title>Step 2: Breakpoints detection</title>
          <p>Breakpoints of putative recombination events could be visually identified in the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> since they corresponded to points where the profile of conservation of the test genome compared with the reference sequences changed sharply. To automatically detect the position of the breakpoints for each position <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> along the test genome and each reference genome <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we computed the proportions <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of values 1 in the intervals <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. The null hypothesis <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was tested using a Fisher exact test (fisher.test function in R <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.r-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.r-project.org/</ext-link>). To minimize the number of parameters, <italic>l</italic> was set of the same size as the sliding window used for the filtering step, although <italic>Reco</italic> allows the user to choose other values.

          <title>Step 3: Selection of the optimal sliding window size</title>
          <p>While many efficient methods exist to identify small recombination events in a set of short aligned sequences, few convenient methods exist to identify on a genome-wide scale large events, including several genes or entire operons. The proposed procedure, using a smoothing of the conservation signal over a window of size <italic>l</italic>, is especially designed to identify large events, including at least <italic>l</italic> genes, and therefore the user should carefully evaluate different values of the parameter. To qualitatively characterize the influence of the size <italic>l</italic> of the sliding window on the sensitivity of the algorithm, we created an artificial genome in which we introduced thirteen recombination events of known lengths and positions. Specifically, the recombinant genome was identical to a major parent (<italic>S. aureus</italic> NCTC 8325) except for thirteen recombination regions of length comprised between 10 and 100 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), that were substituted with the homologous sequences from two distinct donor genomes, donor_1 and donor_2 (<italic>S. aureus</italic> MRSA252 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> MSSA476). We analyzed the matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the recombinant genome against 5 reference genomes, <italic>i.e.</italic> the major parent, donor_1, donor_2 and two test genomes (<italic>S. aureus</italic> JH9 and <italic>S. aureus</italic> RF122), with different value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The full panel of recombination events was visible for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, for this value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> there were few highly conserved areas in the genome of the recipient strain that, due to small fluctuations in the level of sequence conservation, were misclassified as recombinant (data not shown). Increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002668.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> these false positives were eliminated, but also short recombination events remained undetected.

        <title>Recombination in <italic>S. aureus</italic></title>
        <p><italic>S. aureus</italic> is a major cause of nosocomial infections, including bacteremia, metastatic abscesses, septic arthritis, endocarditis, osteomyelitis, and wound infections. However, its pathogenic mechanisms have not yet been fully elucidated. In particular, the factors that render certain strains, such as the methicillin resistant (MRSA) strain TW20, highly transmissible and invasive have not yet been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Holden1">[12]</xref>. Horizontally acquired DNA could represent a critical element of the evolution and acquisition of virulence mechanisms in <italic>S. aureus</italic>. Although the estimated rate of recombination is lower than in other pathogenic bacteria like <italic>Neisseria meningitidis</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Posada1">[22]</xref>, events of recombination involving unusually large portions of the genome have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Robinson1">[32]</xref>. To test the effectiveness of our method, we have analyzed a collection of 75 genomes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> (70 available in the public domain and 5 sequenced for this study, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s006">Table S1</xref>), identifying several recombination events, some of which had not been reported before.</p>

          <title><italic>Reco</italic> identified one large chromosomal recombination event in <italic>S. aureus</italic> ST239 strains</title>
          <p>Strains of Sequence Type ST239 (classified by eBURST into CC8, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s001">Fig. S1</xref>) display evidence of a large recombination event involving a region of approximately 557 kb spanning the origin of replication, that was likely acquired from a CC30 strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Robinson1">[32]</xref>. In order to test the ability of our procedure to identify this event, we analyzed the TW20 (ST239) strain. The degree of conservation of the genes of TW20 compared to all the other genomes of <italic>S. aureus</italic> in our collection is high (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). On the basis of these data we could identify the presence of a region encoding for a phage not shared with other strains. Identifying this feature does not require processing of the data, as it is already visible from the presence/absence profile by using the visualization tool provided by <italic>Reco</italic> (blue box in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g002">Fig. 2a</xref>). However, other recombination events distinguishing TW20 from the other CC8 strains were obscured by noise. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g002">Fig. 2b</xref> we show the data after the filtering step. While, as expected, most genes of ST239 had their closest homologs in CC8 strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s006">Table S1</xref>), we identified two regions located on opposite sides of the origin of replication (red boxes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g002">Fig. 2b</xref>) that were closely related to the homologous regions in CC30 strains (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s006">Table S1</xref>). These two regions are contiguous since the chromosome is circular, and thus are likely to have been acquired in a single event. To determine the borders of the recombinant region (or recombination breakpoint positions), we computed the matrix of the p-values of the Fisher test (see Methods) for the TW20 (ST239) strain against all the other strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g003">Fig. 3a</xref>). Among the p-values, the minima (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s009">Table S4</xref>) identified the exact breakpoint positions as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g003">Fig. 3b</xref>, where we report the p-values against the 552053 (CC30) strain only. The data support the presence of a large recombination event around the origin of replication on both sides of the minima (highlighted in green). Peaks in the p-values near the origin are due to the loss of some genes in strain 552053.</p>

          <p>The strain H19 (ST10, CC10) showed two regions, consisting of about 50 ORFs and encoding for two phages, not conserved in the closely related strain D139 (ST 145, CC10) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). To visually identify the donor strains for the recombination events, in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s003">Fig. S3a</xref> we reproduced the image with a subset of potential donor strains and we found that the two regions were exchanged in two distinct recombination events: strains of CC30 or CC1 were the minor parent in one case (region 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s003">Fig. S3a</xref>), while strains of CC5 were the minor parent in the other (region 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s003">Fig. S3a</xref>). Interestingly, CC30 and CC1 strains contain two more phages, that are closely related to those contained in the homologous regions of strain D139 (region 3 and 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s003">Fig. S3b</xref>, that are homologous to region 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s003">Fig. S3a</xref>, respectively).

        <p><italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is the causative agent of several human diseases, which include chronic otitis media, sinusitis, pneumonia, septicemia, and meningitis. <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> is a naturally competent organism that is known to easily transfer genetic material both within the species and from closely related species. Despite evidences of extensive recombination, it has recently been shown that in a phylogenetic analysis using whole genome sequences, strains of the same ST or CC always form a monophyletic branch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Donati1">[7]</xref>, suggesting that recombination events are not able to destroy the phylogenetic signal contained in whole genome sequences. We analyzed a dataset of 50 genomes including <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, <italic>S. mitis</italic>, <italic>S. oralis</italic> and <italic>S. infantis</italic>, to identify putative recombination events.</p>

          <p>We found two regions of the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> INV104B strain (ST227, CC306) that were not conserved in other CC306 strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g005">Fig. 5</xref> boxes 1 and 2). The region 1 includes about 33 genes that INV104B acquired from either ST217 or ST615 strains, or from a common ancestor of the two. The recombinant region is located upstream of the capsule biosynthesis (cps) locus and includes genes involved in polysaccharide synthesis like, for instance, the SPNINV104_02650 gene, coding for the sugar phosphate isomerase, that is required for capsule formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Tzeng1">[34]</xref>. Interestingly, both the recombinant and the putative minor and major parents are of capsular Serotype 1. Due to the high level of conservation of the cps locus between these strains, it was not possible to ascertain whether the latter was transferred in the same event. The second potential recombination event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g005">Fig. 5</xref> red box 2) consists in about 12 genes that INV104B acquired from D39 or R6, two closely related strains belonging to CC128.</p>

          <p>In order to highlight the specific features of <italic>Reco</italic>, we applied RDP3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Martin1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Martin2">[25]</xref> to the region upstream the capsule biosynthesis locus of the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> INV104B strain (CC306), where <italic>Reco</italic> identified a putative recombination event with the P1031 strain as donor strain. In this region RDP3 found four segments of recombination potentially acquired from P1031 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g006">Fig. 6 a</xref>), while <italic>Reco</italic> identified a single event spanning the entire region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g006">Fig. 6 b</xref>). The different results between RDP3 and <italic>Reco</italic> shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g006">Fig. 6a,b</xref> highlight some of the specific features of the smoothing procedure employed by <italic>Reco</italic>. While RDP3 accurately identifies the borders of the regions containing the signal for homologous recombination, <italic>Reco</italic> extends the signal also to neighboring regions, therefore “averaging out” discordant signals over regions including less than <italic>l</italic> genes (<italic>l</italic> is the sliding window size fixed by the user). This feature, that in some cases can lead to incorrect results, allows <italic>Reco</italic> to recognize events that are artificially split into many smaller events by other algorithms due either to subsequent, smaller recombination events that have superimposed on the original one, or to the presence of highly conserved regions, as in the cases of genes under purifying selection, where there is no signal for recombination. Direct inspection of the multiple alignment of the whole segment considered in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g006">Fig. 6a,b</xref> shows that the regions separating the four recombination events detected by RDP3 are perfectly conserved between the putative major parent, minor parent and recombinant strains. While RDP3 accurately detects the border of the regions where there is direct evidence of recombination, we cannot rule out that also the conserved regions where transferred. In fact, the latter possibility is the most likely assuming parsimony. However, in general only the careful comparison of more than one method can allow to draw definitive conclusions. <italic>Reco</italic> should be considered as a rapid screening tool to identify regions that should later be studied using other, more sensitive tools.</p>

          <p>We found one case of exchange between the antibiotic resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Taiwan19F-14 strain (ST236, CC271) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Huang1">[38]</xref> and the <italic>S. mitis</italic> SK564 strain (red box <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002668-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). The region consists of ∼66 kb including 23 ORFs carried on a transposon (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s011">Table S6</xref>). While most of the ORFs included in the transposon were absent in all <italic>S. mitis</italic> strains, a portion of the transposon, for a total of 4 kb encoding for erythromycin resistance is highly conserved between <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Taiwan19F-14 and <italic>S. mitis</italic> SK564. Interestingly, the gene SPT_1926 annotated as macrolide efflux protein, as well as several of the genes both upstream and downstream of the transposon were highly conserved, but were found to be frameshifted in the genome of SK564 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002668.s011">Table S6</xref>), suggesting that this sequence was transferred from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to <italic>S. mitis</italic>, where the genes not conferring a selective advantage have lost their coding ability due to point mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Tzeng1">[34]</xref>. Some of the genes located upstream and downstream of the transposon in Taiwan19F-14 that were highly conserved in SK564, were found to be not-contiguous, and located in other regions of the SK564 genome, suggesting a complex evolutionary history of this region after homologous recombination from a strain closely related to the antibiotic resistant <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> Taiwan19F-14. A possible explanation could be that the transfer occurred in one step from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> to <italic>S. mitis</italic>, followed by a translocation event mediated by the transposon.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Population genetic studies on many bacterial species, such as <italic>N. meningitidis</italic>, <italic>S. aureus</italic> and <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, have provided extensive evidence of the exchange of genetic material amongst unrelated strains. Knowledge of basic parameters, including the population size, as well as the mutation, recombination and migration rates might help us to predict the extent to which genes are exchanged amongst strains within the same population and between geographically separated populations of a species. In particular, for pathogenic microorganisms this information might help us to understand the dynamics of drug resistance spread, the evolution of vaccine escape mutants, and, more generally, the evolution of pathogenicity. Several methods for the identification of recombination events in sequence data are present in the literature. However, these methods are computationally demanding and difficult to use on whole genome sequences. On the other hand, the rapid diffusion of Next Generation Sequencing technologies requires the development of lightweight, user-friendly algorithms and tools for sequence analysis. Here we presented a new method to identify recombination events in genomic sequences that can be readily applied to large sequence datasets.</p>
      <p>We have applied the algorithm to two pathogens, <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and <italic>S. aureus</italic> that are reported to have widely different propensity to exchange genetic material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Donati1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Feng1">[40]</xref>. Although many studies have indicated that <italic>S. aureus</italic> has a low recombination rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Feng2">[41]</xref>, we found evidences of several recombination events, also involving large portions of the genome. Except for the large chromosomal replacement found in ST239, most of these events involved highly mobile elements, particularly phage encoding islands. Differently, most of the recombinant regions identified in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and its related species contained surface proteins or virulence factors suggesting that these regions are exchanged more frequently than others, possibly due to the selective pressure from the host immune system and confirming that genes involved in DNA replication, transcription and translation are less likely to be horizontally transferred <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Boto1">[42]</xref>. We found one recombination event potentially including the capsular biosynthesis locus of Serotype 1 strains. Interestingly, both the donor and acceptor strains are of Serotype 1. It had already been noted that, differently from other serotypes, the Serotype 1 capsule is found only in a group of clonally related strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Donati1">[7]</xref>. This finding could be due to a general inability of Serotype 1 strains to participate to the exchange of genetic material, either as donor or as acceptor. The event identified here rather suggests the existence of a unknown barrier to recombination with strains of unrelated Serotypes, possibly due to the peculiar lifestyle of Serotype 1 strains, that are very rarely carried and are commonly retrieved only from invasive disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Brueggemann1">[43]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Extending the analysis to the <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>-<italic>S. mitis</italic> complex we identified an example of interspecies recombination that involved contiguous genes that were transferred and maintained in the host genomes. While all genes involved in this event are functional in <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic>, many of them were pseudogenes in <italic>S. mitis</italic>, suggesting that this region was recently imported into <italic>S. mitis</italic> from <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> and that genes that do not confer a selective advantage to the former are in the process of being purged. It has been estimated that as much as 30% of the genetic diversity of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> could be attributed to homologous recombination with <italic>S. mitis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Donati1">[7]</xref>, and the extent of genetic exchange within the <italic>S. mitis</italic>-<italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> complex has lead to the hypothesis that <italic>S. mitis</italic> is the genetic reservoir of <italic>S. pneumoniae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Kilian1">[39]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The rate of homologous recombination varies greatly between different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Fraser1">[44]</xref>, and between different lineages of the same species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002668-Hanage1">[45]</xref>. The effects of homologous recombination on the evolution of bacterial species are profound, and far from being fully understood. The advent of Next Generation Sequencing technologies is providing an unprecedented amount of sequence data that, due to their complexity, cannot be analyzed using available methods. We introduced a simple algorithm that is able to handle large amounts of data and could provide a rapid screening tool to globally investigate recombination from sequence data.</p>
