          <p>Protein aggregation is a process by which identical proteins self-associate into imperfectly ordered macroscopic entities. Such aggregates are associated with several pathological conditions in humans, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and diabetes type II. Furthermore, protein aggregation is a major concern in the biotechnological production of recombinant proteins and the storage of proteins, and is a central mechanism of protein folding. In general, two classes of protein aggregates are classified: first, highly ordered aggregates can be composed of native globular molecules, such as the hemoglobin molecules in sickle-cell fibrils, or reorganized into β-sheet–rich aggregates, termed amyloid-like fibrils; and second, amorphous aggregates that lack any long-range order. Here, we demonstrate that bacterial inclusion bodies, which have been believed to be made up of amorphous aggregates, are in fact amyloid-like, comprising cross-β structure that is dependent on amino-acid sequence. These findings suggest that inclusion bodies are structured, that amyloid formation is a process present in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes, that amino acid sequences can evolve to avoid the amyloid conformation, and that there might be no amorphous state of a protein aggregate.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The conversion of peptides and proteins into aggregates is associated with several dozen pathological conditions in humans, including Alzheimer disease, Parkinson disease, and diabetes type II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b003">3</xref>], and it is also of major concern in biotechnology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b004">4</xref>]. Numerous disease-associated aggregates are composed of elongated filaments, termed amyloid-like fibrils, often comprising intermolecular and in-register β-sheets parallel to the fibril axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b011">11</xref>]. Amyloid fibrils bind thioflavin T (Thio T) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b012">12</xref>] and show birefringence upon Congo red (CR) staining, which is indicative of repetitive structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b013">13</xref>]. Amyloid fibrils, as highly ordered aggregates, have traditionally been distinguished from amorphous aggregates, such as protein precipitates and bacterial inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b015">15</xref>]. The latter present widespread problems in biotechnology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b016">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>The deposition of protein products into electron-dense, apparently amorphous inclusion bodies occurs often during high-level expression of heterologous and some endogenous genes in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b018">18</xref>]. The aggregation is probably caused by the high local concentration of nascent polypeptides emerging from ribosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b004">4</xref>], which are ineffectively protected from aggregation by the insufficient number of chaperones present during recombinant overexpression, or by the lack of eukaryotic chaperones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b019">19</xref>]. Although inclusion bodies have been classified as amorphous aggregates, they are not just clusters of misfolded proteins that stick to each other through nonspecific hydrophobic contacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b016">16</xref>]. Rather, they are often enriched in β-sheet structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b022">22</xref>], bind amyloid-tropic dyes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b021">21</xref>], have a seeding capacity reminiscent of amyloids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b021">21</xref>], form homogeneous aggregates without cross-aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b023">23</xref>], and display aggregation propensities strongly affected by mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b024">24</xref>]. Here, we studied in detail the structure of in vivo-derived bacterial inclusion bodies of three proteins and show that all three inclusion bodies studied are amyloid-like, comprising amino acid sequence-specific cross-β structure.</p>

      <p>To elucidate structural details of inclusion bodies of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>) and compare them with the structure of amyloid fibrils, three inclusion body-forming proteins with distinctive native folds (i.e., β-sheet, α-helix, and mixed α-helix/β-sheet, with and without disulfide bridges) were chosen to cover the fold universe to a certain degree: (1) The α-helical, early secreted antigen 6-kDa protein (ESAT-6, with Protein Data Bank [pdb] accession code 1wa8; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mycobacterium tuberculosis</named-content> folds only in complex with its protein partner CFP-10 (culture filtrate protein, 10 kDa) both in vitro and when overexpressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b025">25</xref>]. (2) The mixed α-helical and β-sheet fragment residues 13–74 of the secretory human bone morphogenetic protein-2 (BMP2, with pdb accession code 3bmp) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b027">27</xref>]. BMP2(13–74) is unable to fold in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> because it lacks the essential structural segment of residues 75–114, as well as the ability to form disulfide links in the cytoplasm of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>. (3) The β-sheet comprising the extracellular domain (ECD) of the human membrane protein myelin oligodendrocyte glycoprotein (MOG(ECD), with pdb accession code 1pko), having one disulfide bridge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b029">29</xref>]. The inclusion body formation of MOG is attributed to the reducing environment of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> cytoplasm.</p>

          <p>(A) Fast [<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H]-HMQC spectra of dissolved, monomeric <sup>15</sup>N-labeled ESAT-6 in d<sub>6</sub>-DMSO containing 0.05 % TFA and 25 mM DTT, corresponding to fully protonated inclusion bodies (left), and to inclusion bodies exchanged for 311 h in D<sub>2</sub>O (right). After 311 h, many cross peaks show a complete loss of intensity indicative of fast exchange. In contrast, cross peaks of residues 8–25 and 36–43 are still present, indicative of slow exchange. Sequence-specific chemical-shift assignment of protein backbone amide cross peaks are indicated by a single-letter amino acid code and the corresponding residue number.</p>
          <p>(B) Ribbon representation of the 3-D structure of soluble ESAT-6 in complex with CFP-10 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b025">25</xref>]. The green-colored segment corresponds to residues 7–23, which experiences slow exchange in inclusion bodies as shown in (C).</p>
          <p>(C) Plots of the observed exchange rates <italic>k</italic><sub>ex</sub>/h, the relative population <italic>P</italic>(F) of the two exchange regimes observed with <italic>P</italic> = 1 for 100% occupancy and <italic>P</italic> = 0 for 0% occupancy, and the predictions of aggregation-prone segments against the amino acid sequence of ESAT-6. The exchange rates of the major population are colored green. If the minor population is present more than 1/3, the corresponding exchange rates are shown in grey. Although some of the residues 36–43 show slow exchange in the HMQC spectrum in (A), their slow-exchanging population is present less than 1/3 and hence not shown in (C). In the third plot of (C) labeled with an “A,” predicted aggregation-prone segments of ESAT-6 are shown using two distinct algorithms: 3DPROFILE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b033">33</xref>] in gray, and TANGO [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b032">32</xref>] (the latter is not shown, since no aggregation-prone segment was predicted). For 3DPROFILE, predictions are shown for segments having energies ≤ −23 kcal/mol. For both algorithms, outstanding relative values (≤ −23 in 3DPROFILE, and &gt;0 in TANGO) within a segment of several amino acid residues are indicative of an aggregation-prone segment. The secondary structures of the soluble conformation shown in (B) are highlighted in red for helix and blue for β-sheet, respectively. The secondary structural elements predicted by the software Jpred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b053">53</xref>] are highlighted by cyan arrows for β-sheet conformation and a yellow helix for helical structure, respectively. An amino-acid sequence-resolved hydrophobicity score plot calculated by the software ProtScale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b055">55</xref>] is shown at the lowest panel labeled with “H,” with positive values indicative of hydrophobicity.</p>
          <p>(D) X-ray diffraction of inclusion bodies of ESAT-6. The two reflections at 4.7 Å and approximately 10 Å consistent with cross-β-sheet structure are labeled.</p>
          <p>(E) Mutagenesis of ESAT-6 and the influence of amino acid substitutions in the formation of inclusion bodies. Coomassie-stained SDS-polyacrylamide gels were obtained from soluble (s) and insoluble (i) fractions of lysates of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> cells expressing wild-type ESAT-6 (WT) or ESAT-6 variants as indicated (i.e., point mutations are indicated by a one-letter code, Δ7–23 stands for the deletion variant, which lacks the slow-exchanging residues 7–23, and “replaced” stands for the mutant for which residues 7–23 were replaced with the helical segment of residues 25–41 of ESAT-6. The 10-kDa molecular weight standard is labeled. The variants that are present in the insoluble fraction are colored blue in the amino acid sequence of (C), and the single amino acid residue variants that are absent in the insoluble fractions are colored red in the amino acid sequence of (C), respectively.</p>

        <title>Inclusion Bodies of ESAT-6 Are Composed of Ordered β-Sheet Structure</title>
        <p>All three proteins studied are present in the insoluble fraction of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figures 2</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">3</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>E) and form homogeneous inclusion bodies as expected (unpublished data). The purified inclusion bodies of all three proteins bind Thio T to a similar or greater extent than aged amyloid fibrils of α-synuclein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g001">Figure 1</xref>) and produce strong birefringence upon CR staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg001">S1</xref>). These findings indicate that inclusion bodies of all three proteins studied comprise highly ordered structures reminiscent of amyloid-like fibrils.</p>
        <p>We found, furthermore, that inclusion bodies of all three proteins contain sequence-specific positions of regular secondary structure, by measuring quenched hydrogen/deuterium (H/D) exchange with solution nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b030">30</xref>] (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This technique allows the identification of solvent-protected backbone amide protons involved in hydrogen bonds. In the case of ESAT-6, the [<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H]-correlation NMR spectrum of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>A (left) contains one assigned cross peak for approximately 90% of all its backbone amides, enabling a residue-specific determination of their hydrogen exchange rates in inclusion bodies. Upon exchange in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer for 311 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, right), many cross peaks show a virtually complete loss of intensity, which is indicative of fast exchange. In contrast, a set of cross peaks of residues 8–25 and 36–43 are still present, which is indicative of slow exchange. The hydrogen exchange was followed over time to get insight into conformational heterogeneity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Individual amides of all residues display a biphasic behavior comprising a very fast and a slow exchanging component (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). However, for most of the residues, only either the fast or the slow exchanging component is highly populated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>C; P &gt; 2/3, where P is the population).</p>
        <p>The detailed sequence-resolved analysis of the hydrogen exchange data of the major population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) shows that, most of the residues (i.e., 2–6, and 24–95) are only weakly or not protected and are therefore considered to be conformationally disordered. This is indicated by exchange rates faster than 10<sup>1</sup> h<sup>−1</sup>. In contrast, residues 7–23 display slow exchange rates of 10<sup>−3</sup> to 10<sup>−4</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> and are therefore considered to be involved in hydrogen bonds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). Because the circular dichroism (CD) spectrum is indicative of β-sheet and “random coil” conformation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), it is likely that the solvent-protected residues 7–23 contain mainly β-sheet secondary structure. The presence of abundant β-structure is strongly supported by the fiber diffraction data of inclusion bodies of ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). The sharp reflection observed at 4.7 Å is interpreted as the spacing between strands in a β-sheet. The diffuse reflection at approximately 10 Å is interpreted as the spacing between β-sheets. These two reflections are typically observed for amyloid-like fibrils. The circular profiles for these reflections, rather than orthogonal positions for the two reflections, show that the directions of the amyloid-like entities in inclusion bodies are not strongly aligned. To confirm the potential of residues 7–23 to be in a cross-β-sheet amyloid conformation, a synthetic peptide E20 corresponding to residues 6–25 of ESAT-6 was tested for in vitro aggregation. Upon incubation for 3 d at physiological conditions, E20 forms amyloid fibrils as evidenced both by electron microscopy (EM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg005">Figure S5</xref>) and Thio T binding (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To verify that the cross-β-sheet–forming segment of residues 7–23 is the dominant component in the formation of inclusion bodies of ESAT-6, the following mutagenesis experiments were carried out: Within the sequence of ESAT-6, aggregation-prone hydrophobic residues were replaced by the aggregation-interfering Arg [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b031">31</xref>]. The substitution of L36R, V54R, or I76R did not alter substantially the formation of inclusion bodies. This finding is expected because these residues are located within the disordered region of the inclusion bodies. In contrast, the substitution of F8R, I11R, I18R, or V22R within the β-sheet–forming segment abolished the formation of inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Similarly, the deletion of the cross-β-sheet–forming segment of residues 7–23 or its replacement by a non–aggregation-prone segment of residues 25–41 of ESAT-6, which forms a helix in the soluble structure of ESAT-6, resulted both in a loss of inclusion body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). The lack of soluble expressed ESAT-6 variants comprising the latter substitutions and deletions is attributed to their fast degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b015">15</xref>]. To confirm that the plasmids of the latter point mutants were functionally conserved, they were mutated back to wild type, which restored the formation of inclusion bodies upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Consistent with all our findings, one of the two applied algorithms that predict aggregation-prone segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b033">33</xref>] indicates residues approximately 7–23 to be the most-aggregation-prone segment of ESAT-6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). In summary, residues 7–23 of ESAT-6 in bacterial inclusion bodies form a cross-β-sheet structure characteristic of amyloid-like fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b010">10</xref>] with the remainder of the amino acid sequence disordered.</p>

        <title>Two Other Inclusion Bodies Also Contain Ordered β-Sheet Structure</title>
        <p>Very similar findings are observed for inclusion bodies of BMP2(13–74) and MOG(ECD). Upon exchange in D<sub>2</sub>O buffer for 185 and 285 h, respectively, many cross peaks of the [<sup>15</sup>N,<sup>1</sup>H]-correlation spectra show a virtually complete loss of intensity, which is indicative of fast exchange (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figures 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>A). In contrast, a set of cross peaks of residues 62–70 of BMP2(13–74) and most of the residues 80–94, 102–105, and 110–117 of MOG(ECD), respectively, are still present, which is indicative of slow exchange. Again, the H/D exchange of all residues displayed a biphasic behavior with a very fast and slow exchanging component (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figures 3</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg002">S2</xref>). The hydrogen exchange data of the major population of inclusion bodies show that residues 14–61 and 68–74 of BMP2(13–74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figure 3</xref>C), and residues 2–84, 96–100, 109–110, and 119–133 of MOG(ECD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) are not protected or only weakly protected and may therefore be conformationally disordered. In contrast, residues 62–67 of BMP2(13–74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) and residues 85–95, 101–108, and 111–118 of MOG(ECD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">Figure 4</xref>C) display slow exchange rates of 10<sup>−2</sup> to 10<sup>−4</sup> h<sup>−1</sup> and are therefore considered to be involved in hydrogen bonds. Since diffraction patterns of both inclusion bodies are indicative of cross-β structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figures 3</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>D), it is likely that the solvent-protected segments contain mainly β-sheet secondary structure of cross-β-sheet nature. These findings are further confirmed by the amyloid-like fibril formation of synthetic peptides B13 corresponding to residues 59–71 of BMP2(13–74), and M11 and M18 corresponding to residues 85–95 and 101–118 of MOG(ECD) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Consistent with these data, the combination of the applied algorithms that predict aggregation-prone segments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b033">33</xref>] indicate residues approximately 62–67 and residues approximately 100–118 to be the most aggregation-prone segments of BMP2(13–74) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figure 3</xref>C) and MOG(ECD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">Figure 4</xref>C).</p>
        <p>A similar mutagenesis experiment as described above was carried out to verify that the cross-β–forming segment residues 62–67 of BMP2(13–74) and the segments 85–95, 101–108, and 111–118 of MOG(ECD) are the dominant components in the formation of inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figures 3</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>E). As expected, the substitutions I32R and L51R of BMP2(13–74) did not alter the formation of inclusion bodies, because the substitutions are located within the disordered segment of the inclusion bodies. In contrast, the substitutions I62R, V63G, V63E, V63R, and L66R of BMP2(13–74) within the β-sheet–forming segment abolished or diminished the formation of inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). Moreover, these variants are present in the soluble fraction of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> lysate upon overexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figure 3</xref>E). In particular, the replacement series at position 63 indicate that all kinds of aggregation-interfering residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b031">31</xref>] (i.e., with or without charge, small or large side chains, positive or negative charged) are able to perturb inclusion body formation, which results in the presence of soluble protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">Figure 3</xref>E).</p>
        <p>To further strengthen the finding that the hydrogen-protected residues 62–67 of BMP2(13–74) are responsible for the formation of inclusion bodies, a plasmid was constructed that codes for residues 61–70 of BMP2(13–74) C-terminally to the protein domain PDZ1 of SAP90, which alone is expressed highly soluble in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Since the BMP2-tag, denoted as B10, is highly aggregation prone, upon overexpression in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>, the fusion protein PDZ1-B10 is present mainly as inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Hence, the hydrogen-protected residues 62–67 appear to be the dominant components in the formation of inclusion bodies.</p>
        <p>In the mutagenesis experiment of MOG(ECD), substitutions within the disordered segments did not alter the formation of inclusion bodies, as expected. However, single point substitutions within one β-sheet–forming segment are not sufficient to abolish inclusion body formation, indicating that the presence of one aggregation-prone segment of β-sheet secondary structure is sufficient for inclusion body formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">Figure 4</xref>E). Diminished inclusion body formation is observed only with the deletion variants MOG(1–73) and MOG(1–83) which lack all the hydrogen exchange-protected segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">Figure 4</xref>E).</p>
        <p>In summary, in bacterial inclusion bodies of BMP2(13–74) and MOG(ECD), residues 62–67 of BMP2(13–74) and residues 85–95, 101–108, and 111–118 of MOG(ECD) form cross-β–structure characteristic of amyloid-like fibrils, whereas the remainder of the amino acid sequence is disordered.</p>

        <title>Inclusion Bodies May Contain Amyloid-Like Protofibrils</title>
        <p>Although the inclusion bodies studied here are amyloid-like, they do not display fibrils under EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The absence of visible fibrils may be attributed to the high protein concentration in inclusion bodies and to the abundant, stained amorphous segments of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>) obscuring the fibrils. An alternative explanation could be that inclusion bodies form too rapidly for fibrils to form from the more immature and flexible protofibrils that have less rigidly linear profiles (see also below). We favor this latter hypothesis because of the following reasons: Varying the amount or time of staining as well as grinding inclusion bodies or treating inclusion bodies with chemical denaturant did not reveal reproducible and significant fibril formation under EM (unpublished data). In contrast, upon incubation of purified inclusion bodies of BMP2(13–74) at 37 °C for 12 h, fibrils appear and grow more prominent with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).The qualitative analysis of EM shows thereby two scenarios: (1) the fibrils appear to grow from the inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g005">Figure 5</xref>A), and (2) the inclusion bodies comprise highly dense bundles of amyloid fibrils (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The apparent growth of fibrils from inclusion bodies can be accelerated by higher temperature (tested up to 50 °C; unpublished data), but is not present in a sample stored for 10 mo at 4 °C (unpublished data). Furthermore, protein overexpression of BMP2(13–74) in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> over a period of 12 h under semi-controlled physiological conditions yields inclusion bodies with fibril-like structural entities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). Similarly, upon incubation of purified inclusion bodies of ESAT-6 at room temperature (∼21 °C) for 14 d, amyloid-like fibrils appear under EM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). We therefore suggest that inclusion bodies are reminiscent of amyloidogenic protofibrils.</p>

        <title>Common Structural Properties of Inclusion Bodies</title>
        <p>Our structural studies of three bacterial inclusion bodies reveal the presence of distinct sequence-specific cross-β-sheet structures surrounded by amorphous disordered segments. The number of cross-β segments is variable (i.e., one to three β-segments in the three proteins studied here). Their lengths are typically around seven to ten residues long, if it assumed that the 16-residue-long solvent-protected segment of ESAT-6 inclusion bodies may be interrupted in the middle. The β-strands in inclusion bodies do not necessary have a β-sheet conformation in the corresponding soluble fold of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figures 2</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">3</xref>B, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>B). In particular, the segments comprising a β-sheet structure in the inclusion bodies of ESAT-6 and BMP2(13–74) are helical in the corresponding soluble folded conformations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figures 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">3</xref>B). However, although the amino acid sequence composition of the various β-strands involved in aggregation are quite heterogeneous, these segments share common properties when compared with nonaggregating sequences. First, they display a low energy when complementing themselves in a pair of β-sheets, as required by the 3DPROFILE algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b033">33</xref>], and second, they have a high propensity to form a β-aggregate, as required by the TANGO algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b032">32</xref>]. Neither algorithm makes predictions in perfect agreement with the NMR results, but the agreement is good considering that the energy models of the two algorithms are entirely different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figures 2</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">3</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>C).</p>
        <p>Hence, in striking contrast to the traditional view of bacterial inclusion bodies as amorphous aggregates, they may contain ordered structural segments of cross-β structure, of which the number, length, and form of its β-sheets are determined by the particular amino acid sequence of the protein. The structures of these regions are thereby probably restricted to one of the possible topologies of cross-β structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b010">10</xref>]. Adjacent to the cross-β-sheet core of the inclusion body aggregates, there may be amorphously disordered segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>), or also folded domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b035">35</xref>].</p>

        <title>Evolutionary Pressure against Amyloid Aggregates</title>
        <p>Under the assumption that the observed amyloid-like nature of inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b021">21</xref>]) holds for most of the hundreds of documented bacterial inclusion bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b036">36</xref>], amyloid aggregation appears to be a common property of protein segments and consequently is observed in both eukaryotes and prokaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b002">2</xref>]. Within the framework of this hypothesis, it has been suggested that there must be evolved strategies against amyloid formation, which include both quality control mechanisms through molecular chaperones as well as sequence-based prevention of amyloid aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b038">38</xref>]. The suggested evolutionary pressure on the protein's amino acid sequence composition against amyloid-like aggregation is evident from our present inclusion body study. The amino acid sequence of over 80% of ESAT-6, 90% of BMP2(13–74), and approximately 75% of MOG(ECD) are disordered in inclusion bodies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g002">Figures 2</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g003">3</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g004">4</xref>C) and hence not aggregation prone. This finding indicates that the majority of residues in the amino acid sequences of all three proteins studied have evolved to disfavor aggregation.</p>

        <title>Bacterial Inclusion Bodies and Human Amyloid Diseases</title>
        <p>The formation of amyloid-like inclusion bodies of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> may also provide insights into fundamental mechanisms of amyloid aggregation-related pathologies such as Alzheimer disease and prion diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b017">17</xref>]. In these so-called amyloid diseases, a soluble protein or peptide alters its state via conformational intermediates into amyloid fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b001">1</xref>]. Some of the intermediates, rather than the amyloid fibrils themselves, have been proposed to be the most toxic amyloid entities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b039">39</xref>]. These intermediates might include protofibrils. The data presented here and by others suggest that inclusion bodies exhibit structural and some biological properties of protofibrillar amyloid aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b041">41</xref>] in that inclusion bodies are amyloid-like in structure, are able to mature into amyloid-like fibrils with time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060195-g005">Figure 5</xref>), and show amyloid-like “cytotoxicity” when administered to an eukaryotic cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b042">42</xref>]. Furthermore, we show in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060195-sg008">Figure S8</xref>, that the amyloidogenic mouse prion protein and fragments thereof form amyloid-like inclusion bodies when expressed in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>. Despite the similar biological and structural properties of inclusion bodies and protofibrils or fibrils associated with pathological conditions, inclusion bodies are not toxic to its host <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> and are believed rather to be a detoxification mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b043">43</xref>]. The lack of toxicity of inclusion bodies is in agreement with the lack of toxicity of amyloid β-protein (Aβ) amyloids and other amyloid fibrils when administered to a dermal cell line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b044">44</xref>]. These findings may support the hypothesis that the toxic species in amyloid diseases is a small oligomer rather than the amyloid fibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b047">47</xref>].</p>
        <p>Our studies suggest a tight structural link between amyloid aggregates associated with human amyloid diseases, inclusion bodies of the aggresome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060195-b048">48</xref>], and inclusion body formation in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>. In addition, these structural studies of bacterial inclusion bodies extend the possible structural landscape of every protein: each protein may exist, not only in an unfolded or folded state, but, by containing at least one amino acid segment that is capable of participating in a sequence-specific, ordered, cross-β-sheet aggregated state, may also exist in an amyloid-like aggregate. The process of protein aggregation can thus be viewed as a primitive folding mechanism, resulting in a defined, aggregated conformation with each aggregated protein having its own distinctive properties.</p>
