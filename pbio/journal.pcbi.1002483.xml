        <p>A decade ago, a team of biochemists including two of us, modeled yeast glycolysis and showed that one of the most studied biochemical pathways could not be quite understood in terms of the kinetic properties of the constituent enzymes as measured in cell extract. Moreover, when the same model was later applied to different experimental steady-state conditions, it often exhibited unrestrained metabolite accumulation.</p>
        <p>Here we resolve this issue by showing that the results of such <italic>ab initio</italic> modeling are improved substantially by <italic>(i)</italic> including appropriate allosteric regulation and <italic>(ii)</italic> measuring the enzyme kinetic parameters under conditions that resemble the intracellular environment. The following modifications proved crucial: <italic>(i)</italic> implementation of allosteric regulation of hexokinase and pyruvate kinase, <italic>(ii)</italic> implementation of <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values measured under conditions that resembled the yeast cytosol, and <italic>(iii)</italic> redetermination of the kinetic parameters of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase under physiological conditions.</p>
        <p>Model predictions and experiments were compared under five different conditions of yeast growth and starvation. When either the original model was used (which lacked important allosteric regulation), or the enzyme parameters were measured under conditions that were, as usual, optimal for high enzyme activity, fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and some other glycolytic intermediates tended to accumulate to unrealistically high concentrations. Combining all adjustments yielded an accurate correspondence between model and experiments for all five steady-state and dynamic conditions. This enhances our understanding of <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism in terms of <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Baker's yeast is widely applied in modern biotechnology, for instance for production of heterologous protein or biofuel. For such applications a thorough understanding of the central energy metabolism of the bug is crucial. Nevertheless, even for this well-known organism, attempts to build models <italic>ab initio</italic>, based on independently measured characteristics of the catalysts (the enzymes), seldom gives reliable results. A key problem in this field is that enzyme characteristics are often studied under non-physiological conditions that do not resemble the environment inside the cell. In this study we measured the enzyme characteristics under physiological conditions and assembled the results into a computational model of yeast energy metabolism. We show that this simple trick greatly improves the predictive value of the computational model. This allowed us to predict correctly how yeast cells adapt to nitrogen starvation, an industrially relevant situation, in which remodeling of the proteome strongly affects cellular energy metabolism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Molecular biology is based on the paradigm that living organisms can eventually be understood in terms of physics, chemistry and organization. Indeed, biochemistry and molecular biology have furnished impressive examples where the precise mechanism of action of individual macromolecules, such as DNA and the proton-translocating ATPase was elucidated. At this stage, however, no functional <italic>network</italic> of macromolecules is understood in the sense of physics and chemistry, such that a computational model made precise predictions that have been validated by the corresponding experiments.</p>
      <p>The best-researched biological network is the breakdown of glucose. The enzymes of yeast glycolysis have been examined qualitatively and quantitatively for almost a century. Since the 1960s many kinetic computer models of yeast glycolysis have been constructed. The early models focused on the mechanisms underlying oscillations in yeast cultures and cell extracts, and were not much concerned with quantitative precision <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Betz1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Boiteux1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Boiteux2">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Hess1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Richter1">[5]</xref>. Developments in Metabolic Control Analysis (MCA) inspired the construction of a new generation of models to study the distribution of flux control in glycolysis. The aim of these models was primarily to amplify or redirect the flux through glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Cortassa1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Delgado1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Schlosser1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Galazzo1">[9]</xref>. Two more recent kinetic models zoomed in on the role of detailed enzyme kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Hynne1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Rizzi1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>. The model of Rizzi <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Rizzi1">[11]</xref> implemented published kinetic mechanisms and affinity constants and fitted the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values to the dynamic response of yeast after addition of excess glucose. Hynne <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Hynne1">[10]</xref> modeled the dynamic characteristics of oscillating yeast suspensions to estimate not only the enzyme capacities (<italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic>) but also their affinity constants (<italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Hynne1">[10]</xref>. Both these approaches used the modeling for estimation of the <italic>in vivo</italic> values of kinetic parameters.</p>
      <p>Heijnen and colleagues have argued that the discrepancy between <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme kinetics precludes reliable modeling based on detailed enzyme kinetic equations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Visser1">[13]</xref>. To overcome this problem they proposed the so-called lin-log approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Visser1">[13]</xref>, a simplified kinetic description that is closely related to mosaic non-equilibrium thermodynamics (MNET) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Westerhoff1">[14]</xref>. The lin-log kinetic framework resulted in accurate model predictions with fewer parameters to be fitted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Kresnowati1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Visser2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Wu1">[17]</xref>. This ‚Äòminimalist‚Äô approach demonstrated the importance of the feedback and feed forward loops for glycolytic dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Nikerel1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Rossell1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> was the first to actually evaluate to what extent biochemical knowledge obtained from <italic>in vitro</italic> studies could be used to predict the glycolytic flux and the concentrations of glycolytic intermediates in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>. They concluded that the <italic>in vitro</italic> kinetics did not quite describe the <italic>in vivo</italic> activity for all of the glycolytic enzymes satisfactorily. In order to obtain a satisfactory description, they had to displace the kinetic parameter values away from their <italic>in vitro</italic> magnitudes, albeit only in a few cases far beyond the standard error of the means.</p>
      <p>The model of Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> was initially only tested for one experimental steady state. Implementation of <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values from cultures grown under other conditions into the Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> model, has not been very successful. Often the model fails to reach a steady state and accumulate intermediate metabolites while the real yeast cultures do reach such a steady state (S. Rossell, personal communication; and this study). Reijenga <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Reijenga1">[20]</xref> used the model by Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> to study spontaneous oscillations. The predicted frequency of the oscillations was close to experimental findings, but the concentrations of the oscillating metabolites predicted by the model did not match the experimental counter parts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Reijenga1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The observed discrepancies between experiments and models could in principle be caused by various regulatory mechanisms, such as enzyme-enzyme interactions, channeling and rapid posttranslational modifications. Another obvious reason might be that, until recently, enzyme kinetic parameters were most often determined under non-physiological conditions that had been optimized for high enzyme activity (but see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>). This was warranted in view of the original goal of such studies to elucidate catalytic mechanisms, but does not fit the newer goal of understanding the <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics of metabolic pathways. So far enzyme kinetics have hardly been studied under conditions that resemble the intracellular environment. Recently, we therefore developed an assay medium that should resemble the yeast cytosol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen1">[21]</xref>. A substantial number of enzyme activities measured in the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like medium differed substantially from the activities in the ‚Äòoptimal‚Äô non-physiological media <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen1">[21]</xref>. These differences might provide a way out of the above impasse.</p>
      <p>Here we therefore revisit the question whether <italic>in vitro</italic> enzyme kinetics can be used to predict <italic>in vivo</italic> yeast glycolysis. To this end the computer model of yeast glycolysis by Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> was revised by including <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values and values of parameters that were measured in the new <italic>in vivo</italic>-like assay medium. In addition, hitherto missing but known allosteric regulators were implemented in the model. We show that if both innovations are combined, accurate model predictions are obtained. In contrast to earlier studies, a single model could be used to describe five different experimental situations.</p>

        <title>Summary of the experimental data used in the glycolytic model</title>
        <p>We validated the revised model of yeast glycolysis by comparing the model predictions to independently measured fluxes and metabolite concentrations in <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> before and after nitrogen starvation. We studied: <italic>(i)</italic> non-starved cells from a glucose-limited chemostat culture grown under respiratory conditions (dilution rate D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>), <italic>(ii)</italic> cells grown under these respiratory conditions and subsequently starved for nitrogen during 4 h, <italic>(iii)</italic> non-starved cells grown under respirofermentative conditions (glucose-limited chemostat, D‚Ää=‚Ää0.35 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>) and <italic>(iv)</italic> 4 h nitrogen-starved cells derived from this respirofermentative culture. From each of the four cultures yeast cells were harvested to measure <italic>(i)</italic> the maximal glycolytic flux and the intracellular metabolite concentrations in an off-line assay under anaerobic glucose-excess conditions (fermentative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen3">[23]</xref>), <italic>(ii)</italic> the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> of the glycolytic and fermentative enzymes, and <italic>(iii)</italic> the kinetic parameters of glucose transport across the plasma membrane. The fluxes and metabolite concentrations have already been reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen3">[23]</xref> and are taken from there. The <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen3">[23]</xref> had been measured under assay conditions that were optimal for each enzyme and that do not resemble the <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s005">Table S5</xref>). We refer to these as ‚Äò<italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> optimized assays‚Äô to distinguish them from the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values that were measured for the present study in the same samples under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions (this study; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s004">Table S4</xref>). In addition, we have redetermined all kinetic parameters of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions and the kinetics of glucose transport in a 5-seconds <sup>14</sup>C-glucose uptake assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s004">Table S4</xref>). Under both growth conditions the transport capacity decreased and the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for glucose increased upon 4 h nitrogen starvation.</p>
        <p>Input data for the model were: <italic>(i)</italic> fluxes to the side-branches that were fixed in the model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002483-t001">Table 1</xref>); <italic>(ii)</italic> external metabolite concentrations that were fixed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002483-t001">Table 1</xref>); <italic>(iii) V<sub>max</sub></italic> values of the enzymes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s004">Table S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s005">S5</xref> for <italic>in vivo</italic>-like and <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> optimized assays, respectively); and <italic>(iv)</italic> other kinetic parameters of the enzymes and the glucose transporter (mostly taken from Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>; as specified in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s001">Table S1</xref>); glucose transport this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s004">Table S4</xref>), and glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase as indicated in the text).</p>

        <title>Glycolysis model</title>
        <p>Our aim was to investigate whether the use of <italic>in vivo</italic>-like enzyme assays rather than <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> optimized assays would bring model predictions closer to measured metabolite concentrations and fluxes. The analysis was limited to glycolysis. Therefore the fluxes to side branches as well as boundary metabolites, such as ATP were fixed (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002483-t001">Table 1</xref>). In its present form, the model is therefore not suitable to study dynamics in which ATP is involved, like glycolytic oscillations. Furthermore, allosteric regulators that were missing in the Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> model, were added. A full set of modifications is listed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p>
        <p>The new model reached a steady state close to the experimentally determined steady state for all conditions studied (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To achieve this, two additional assumptions were needed. First, the expression of the two hexokinase isoenzymes, <italic>hexokinase 1</italic> and <italic>hexokinase 2</italic> was not known. These isoenzymes have a different <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> towards T6P (0.2 mM for <italic>hexokinase 1</italic> and 0.04 mM for <italic>hexokinase 2</italic>), which had a substantial effect on both the flux and the intermediate metabolite concentrations. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g002">Figure 2</xref> the <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> that fitted best was chosen for each condition (model results for both <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s007">Tables S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s008">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s009">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s010">S10</xref>). Second, the kinetic parameters of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase were redetermined under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions. Especially the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values for glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and NAD<sup>+</sup> differed from those in the Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> model <italic>and</italic> affected the model predictions. The measured <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> for NAD<sup>+</sup> was similar between the four conditions (2.84¬±0.15 mM as compared to 0.09 in the Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> model).

        <p>Subsequently, we asked whether the good fit between model and experiment could have been achieved by implementing either the allosteric regulations alone or the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values alone.

The comparison was made for the non-starved cells from the respiratory culture (D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>). The metabolite concentrations measured under these conditions were taken as the initial concentrations. In case of a good fit, the calculated concentrations should therefore stabilize at their initial values. In all cases, the concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate dropped rapidly and then stabilized. Fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, however, increased continuously up to very high levels when either the allosteric regulation was lacking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g003">Figure 3A‚ÄìD</xref>) or when the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values had been measured under non-physiological conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g003">Figure 3E‚ÄìH</xref>). Apparently, the lower part of glycolysis failed to keep up with the flux through the upper part of glycolysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This resembles the ‚Äòturbo‚Äô phenotype described earlier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink2">[24]</xref>, which has been attributed to a lack of product inhibition of hexokinase and phosphofructokinase.

The result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g003">Figure 3M‚ÄìP</xref>) demonstrates that the feedforward regulation of pyruvate kinase hardly affects fructose 1,6-bisphosphate itself, but it is required for homeostatic regulation of the downstream metabolites 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate.</p>

        <title>Simulation of the response to an upshift of the extracellular glucose concentration</title>
        <p>So far we discussed steady-state conditions. A dynamic response, however, contains much more information.

The starting conditions of the experiment are close to the respiratory growth condition (D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>) applied in the present study and therefore we used our dataset to model the response to addition of glucose. There are two differences between the experiment and the model simulation. First, in the experiment a single dose of glucose was added at time zero, while the modeled increase of glucose was sustained. However, within the time frame of the experiment the extracellular glucose concentration did not decrease significantly (most upper graphs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Second, the starting condition of the experiment was a steady-state, glucose-limited chemostat at a dilution rate of 0.05 h<sup>‚àí1</sup> while the simulation was based on the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> data obtained at 0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>.</p>

Since there was no data available for the intracellular concentration of F26BP, we used 0.014 mM, as measured at a dilution rate of 0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>. The model was evaluated at a <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> value of 0.04 mM for the inhibition of hexokinase by trehalose 6-phosphate, like the steady-state calculations for the corresponding culture at D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

The upshift of the glucose concentration caused an increase of the concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate, fructose 6-phosphate, and fructose 1,6-bisphosphate, while the concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate+2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate decreased and then rose slightly to reach a new and different steady state.</p>

        <title>Control and regulation of glycolysis during nitrogen starvation</title>
        <p>In previous studies we analyzed the distribution of regulation between gene expression and metabolism upon nitrogen starvation of the same cultures as studied here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen2">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen3">[23]</xref>. The upregulation of the flux through glycolytic enzymes upon nitrogen starvation of the respiratory culture (D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>) was predominantly regulated by interaction of the enzymes with metabolites. In contrast, the downregulation of the flux upon nitrogen starvation of the respirofermentative culture (D‚Ää=‚Ää0.35 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>) was mostly regulated by gene expression. If we use the <italic>in vivo</italic>-like <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> assay on which the present paper is built, we obtain qualitatively the same results as in the previous study (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g005">Figure 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s016">Table S16</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen3">[23]</xref>. In this analysis the metabolic regulation reflects the cumulative effect of changes in metabolite concentrations on the flux through a specific enzyme. Often these metabolites counteract each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen3">[23]</xref>. We therefore wondered if we could use the glycolysis model to relate the observed flux to measured <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values (gene-expression regulation) and metabolite concentrations.</p>

        <p>At D‚Ää=‚Ää0.35 h<sup>‚àí1</sup> the glycolytic flux (when calculated at the level of phosphoglucose isomerase-alcohol dehydrogenase) decreased by 16% upon nitrogen starvation. This was reproduced by the model (14% decreased flux). Under these conditions the highest flux control was exerted by the glucose transporter (flux control coefficient 0.5 for the flux through upper glycolysis and 0.6 through lower glycolysis; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s014">Table S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s015">S15</xref>). At the measured 52% decrease of the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> of the transporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s004">Table S4</xref>) this should lead to a 26% decrease of the flux. Most of the remaining control was exerted by hexokinase (0.5‚Äì0.6 before starvation), but since the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> of hexokinase was down-regulated by only 12% this contributes only 6% flux reduction. Since other enzymes exert hardly any control, the changes in their <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> do not contribute to the decrease of the flux. The fact that the flux through phosphoglucose isomerase altered not 26 but only 16% is at least partly due to the reversal of the trehalose flux from trehalose production in the non-starved cells to glucose-6-phosphate production the starved cells.</p>
        <p>Under this condition (D‚Ää=‚Ää0.35 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>) metabolic regulation mostly counteracts gene-expression or <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> regulation, with the highest negative metabolic regulation coefficient for phosphofructokinase (<italic>œÅ<sub>m</sub></italic>‚Ää=‚Ää‚àí3.4). When we calculate the metabolic regulation based on the changes in the measured metabolites and the rate equation used in the model, we do not find this negative metabolic regulation coefficient back. However, when we used the modeled values of the metabolite concentrations, the regulation coefficient was ‚àí3.8. This can be explained from the discrepancy between the measured and modeled concentration of fructose 6-phosphate: in the experiment it declined slightly, but in the model it increased 11-fold from 0.4 to 4.4 mM thus counteracting the decrease of the flux through phosphofructokinase. Also for other enzymes with strong metabolic regulation, <italic>i.e.</italic> hexokinase, phosphoglucose isomerase, pyruvate kinase and pyruvate decarboxylase, the metabolic regulation was only reproduced with the modeled concentrations. Again this was caused by (sometimes subtle) discrepancies between measured and modeled concentrations. Nevertheless, from the calculations concerning hexokinase, it became clear that trehalose 6-phosphate plays an important role in the metabolic part of the regulation (<italic>œÅ<sub>m,trehalose</sub></italic><sub> 6-P</sub>‚Ää=‚Ää‚àí1.6).</p>
        <p>For the respiratory culture (D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>) it is less straightforward to link the observed metabolic regulation to specific metabolite concentrations. The reason is that the model underestimates the observed increase in flux upon nitrogen starvation. Again the glucose transporter exerts most of the flux control (0.5‚Äì0.6 before starvation, 0.9‚Äì1.0 after starvation; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s012">Table S12</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s013">S13</xref>), but since the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> of the transporter diminished, it tends to decrease rather than increase the glycolytic flux. The <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> of phosphoglucose isomerase, pyruvate kinase and pyruvate decarboxylase increased, but as none of them exerted flux control, this did not lead to a flux increase in the model. In reality there may be a mechanism that confers flux control to pyruvate kinase or pyruvate decarboxylase, which then would explain the increase of the flux. Not knowing what caused the discrepancy of the flux regulation between model and experiment, we are hesitant to speculate on the precise nature of the metabolic regulation.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we have shown that realistic kinetic modeling of biochemical pathways based on independently measured biochemical parameters is possible, provided that parameters are measured under physiological conditions and known allosteric regulation loops are taken into account. Along these lines we have improved the yeast glycolysis model of Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>, such that it could be validated for a wider range of experimental conditions.</p>
      <p>The key importance of physiological enzyme assays for kinetic modeling of metabolism may seem trivial, but in practice it is not. Until now the effect of <italic>in vivo</italic>-like parameters had never been tested rigorously. Databases are full of parameters measured under a variety of assay conditions, often far from physiological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Schomburg1">[30]</xref>. In order to build metabolic computer models <italic>ab initio</italic>, we will need to redetermine most of the kinetic parameters. It has been doubted if it is possible at all to determine kinetic parameters with sufficient accuracy to simulate the <italic>in vivo</italic> behavior of metabolic pathways quantitatively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Visser1">[13]</xref>. A proposed solution is to simplify the kinetic equations and obtain kinetic parameters by fitting them to the experimentally determined fluxes and concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Heijnen1">[31]</xref>. Although this is likely to yield an accurate description of pathway behavior, it will provide little insight into the importance of the biochemical interactions that give rise to such behavior. Moreover, simplified and fitted models will predict pathway behavior accurately for the conditions in which they have been fitted, but they have no predictive power outside the experimental conditions for which they were developed. The latter will require quantitative insight in the non-linearities of the actual kinetics of the enzymes in the network.</p>
      <p>The original Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> model failed to reach a steady state if applied to glucose-limited cultures when they receive a high glucose concentration. In such a situation the model - but not the real cell - develops a ‚Äòturbo‚Äô phenotype: the ATP-stimulated synthesis of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate in upper glycolysis persistently exceeds its degradation in lower glycolysis. A negative feedback loop at the beginning of the pathway prevents this ‚Äòturbo‚Äô effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink2">[24]</xref>. In yeast glycolysis this role is (at least partially) fulfilled by the inhibition of hexokinase by trehalose 6-phosphate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink2">[24]</xref>. While allosteric regulation of hexokinase was lacking in the original model of Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>, we show that it is required under the experimental conditions of the present study. In particular at D‚Ää=‚Ää0.35 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>, we could demonstrate that it was the main regulator of hexokinase <italic>in vivo</italic>. In addition we show that the feedforward activation of pyruvate kinase by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate is essential to avoid accumulation of metabolites in lower glycolysis, particularly 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g003">Figure 3</xref>, cf. panels K and O). Studying only one steady state, Teusink <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> omitted the positive feedforward regulation of pyruvate kinase by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate and thereby had pyruvate kinase maximally active. The reason was that the measured fructose 1,6-bisphosphate concentration was close to saturation of pyruvate kinase and was supposed to have no effect. The positive feedforward regulation of pyruvate kinase, however, does explain the dynamic downregulation of 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate after a glucose addition to a glucose limited chemostat, because then fructose 1,6-bisphosphate increases from a low to a high concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Visser3">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Theobald1">[32]</xref>. Even though pyruvate kinase has a low elasticity coefficient towards fructose 1,6-bisphosphate under the steady-state conditions of the present study (elasticity coefficients are in between 0.001 and 0.01), it is apparently sufficient to shift the balance from an accumulation of the metabolites of lower glycolysis towards a stable steady state of that lower glycolysis, corresponding to the experimental data.</p>
      <p>The model developed in this study was first applied to four steady-state conditions. In spite of the differences in enzyme and transport capacities, which were the input to the model, the fluxes and metabolite concentrations in the model changed little between the four conditions. However, the doubling of the concentration of fructose 1,6-bisphosphate between D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup> and 0.35 h<sup>‚àí1</sup> (non-starved) was reproduced correctly by the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002483-g002">Figure 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s007">Table S7a</xref>nd <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002483.s009">S9</xref>). Also the homeostasis of the concentrations of 3-phosphoglycerate, 2-phosphoglycerate and phosphoenolpyruvate between all four conditions was predicted by the model. The above-mentioned activation of pyruvate kinase by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate played an important role herein.</p>
      <p>The new model described the dynamic response towards a glucose upshift surprisingly accurately. The only exceptions were the concentrations of glucose 6-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, which qualitatively matched the experiment, but the absolute values of which were 5 times lower in the model than in the experiment. We hypothesized that this might be due to the side branches from glucose 6-phosphate towards trehalose and glycogen. In the model these were fixed for lack of dynamic information, but they are likely to change in time. We explored this hypothesis in the model by modulating the branching fluxes and confirmed that the calculated fructose 6-phosphate and glucose 6-phosphate could be adjusted to their experimental values. However, the good fit for the fructose-1,6-bisphosphate concentration was then lost, suggesting a more complex mechanism in which regulation of phosphofructokinase is also involved.</p>
      <p>In this study we fixed the ATP, ADP and AMP concentrations, since quantitative kinetic information about ATP utilization was lacking. Instead of variable and mutually dependent ATP, ADP and AMP concentrations, we inserted the measured concentrations as fixed parameters. This choice made the model unsuitable to study phenomena in which ATP dynamics are involved, such as glycolytic oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Richard1">[33]</xref>. In the long run this is a limitation. For the purpose of this study, however, to study <italic>in vivo</italic> regulation of the glycolytic enzymes, it was the best option. ATP utilization consists of many processes of which the kinetics are ill-known. Moreover, the sum of ATP, ADP and AMP is not constant during the initial dynamics of glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Walther1">[34]</xref>. Proper modeling of ATP metabolism would have been a study in itself. Future modeling of the dynamics of glycolysis, however, should involve ATP metabolism explicitly. A pragmatic solution to deal with its complexity might be to fit simplified kinetics to the branches of ATP utilization and nucleotide metabolism, thus generating hybrid models in which different levels of detail and explanatory power are combined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Bulik1">[35]</xref>. The same arguments apply to other side branches.</p>
      <p>The <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> values that were used as input to the model were measured at a single pH of 6.8. This was the pH measured in the cytosol of respiratory cells (D‚Ää=‚Ää0.1 h<sup>‚àí1</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-vanEunen1">[21]</xref>. After glucose addition to a glucose-limited chemostat, however, the intracellular pH drops immediately to approximately 5.3, but after 10 seconds the pH increased to pH 5.8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Kresnowati2">[36]</xref>. This may affect the equilibrium constant of the reaction in which protons are involved, <italic>i.e.</italic> glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase and alcohol dehydrogenase. When the <italic>K<sub>eq</sub></italic> of alcohol dehydrogenase was changed 10-fold to correct for the pH drop of one unit (from 6.8 to 5.8) the model simulation showed a only a slight difference. In contrast, a 10-fold decrease in the <italic>K<sub>eq</sub></italic> of glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate dehydrogenase led to accumulation of the intermediates in upper glycolysis. However, besides a change in <italic>K<sub>eq</sub></italic>, the <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> and the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values of the enzymes could also change by a change in pH. The pK<italic><sub>a</sub></italic> values of some of the intermediate metabolites, <italic>e.g.</italic> glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate and fructose 6-phosphate, are around 6.5, which implies that a drop in intracellular pH should affect the apparent affinity of the enzymes towards these metabolites. In addition, the isoelectric point of the glycolytic enzymes is in the range of 5‚Äì8. Thus a change in pH may affect the protonation of the enzymes, which in principle could alter their <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> as well as their <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> values. We did not observe changes in <italic>V<sub>max</sub></italic> of glycolytic enzymes in a pH range from 6.5 to 7 (data not shown).</p>
      <p>We have to stress that even the improved model of yeast glycolysis does not match the experimental fluxes and metabolite concentrations perfectly. The key progress of this study is that being precise about allosteric regulation and <italic>in vivo</italic>-like assay conditions improves the match between experiment and model substantially, and for a number of different conditions. For an even more stringent test of the paradigm that <italic>in vivo</italic> metabolism is understandable in terms of <italic>in vitro</italic> biochemistry, the obvious next step is to reconsider <italic>all</italic> kinetic parameters, including <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values. Apparent <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> and <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values depend strongly on binding equilibria of metabolites to protons and other cations in the cell. Wu <italic>et al.</italic> took such ion-binding equilibria into account and showed that it improved model predictions of mitochondrial bioenergetics substantially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Vinnakota1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Wu3">[38]</xref>. The protonation state and conformation of the active site of the enzyme in the intracellular environment will, however, be equally important for the affinity of a metabolite for an enzyme. For the short-term we therefore suggest that the redetermination of affinity constants under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like conditions will be unavoidable. The next stage will then be the characterization of pure enzymes and insertion of the properties of isoenzymes into integral models. This requires quantitative proteomics of isoenzymes as well as a strict control of enzyme quality during purification, and has been beyond the scope of this study.</p>
      <p>The Silicon Cell philosophy is to construct models of well-defined pathways, which should subsequently be coupled to each other to expand the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Snoep1">[39]</xref>. For this approach to be successful, the use of <italic>in vivo</italic>-like enzyme assay conditions will be essential. This outcome may not be surprising, yet we could not have anticipated that it would have been sufficient to get such a good description of glycolytic dynamics. We must be prepared that other pathways may depend on more complex regulation than yeast glycolysis under the conditions of study. In cases where, for instance, enzyme-enzyme complexes, channeling of metabolites or rapid posttranslational modifications determine the pathway dynamics, we will need new means to analyze the <italic>in vivo</italic> biochemistry quantitatively. This will be the next challenge for molecular systems biology.</p>

This resulted in variable and mutually dependent ATP, ADP and AMP concentrations. Since information about the kinetics of ATP utilization was lacking and moreover not the focus of this study, we decided to remove the ATP utilization from the model and instead inserted the measured concentrations of ATP, ADP and AMP as fixed parameters.</p>

            <p>The known inhibition of hexokinase by trehalose 6-phosphate had not been included in the original model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>. Yet, it is thought to play an important role in the regulation of glycolysis, particularly to prevent an imbalance between the upper and lower part of the pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink2">[24]</xref>. Trehalose 6-phosphate is an inhibitor of hexokinase that competes with its substrate glucose. Different <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values for the different hexokinases of yeast have been reported. Glucokinase was not inhibited by trehalose 6-phosphate, while the <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values of hexokinase 1 and 2 were 0.2 mM and 0.04 mM, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Blazquez1">[44]</xref>. Since the distribution of the isoenzymes is not known for the experimental conditions studied here, both <italic>K<sub>i</sub></italic> values were used as indicated in the text. The kinetic equation of hexokinase was modified to the following:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002483.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula></p>

            <p>Finally, the <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> of pyruvate decarboxylase in the original model (4.3 mM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref> had been obtained from Boiteux and Hess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Boiteux3">[45]</xref> based on an intracellular phosphate concentration of 25 mM. However, we have measured the pyruvate decarboxylase activity at a phosphate concentration of 50 mM, which is likely to be the intracellular concentration under the growth conditions studied here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Wu2">[29]</xref>. Based on the data of Boiteux and Hess <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Boiteux3">[45]</xref> we calculated a <italic>K<sub>m</sub></italic> value of pyruvate decarboxylase for pyruvate of 6.36 mM at 50 mM phosphate and the new value was inserted in the model.</p>

            <p>The known activation of pyruvate kinase by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate had not been included in the original model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Teusink1">[12]</xref>. However, it might play an important role, especially in cases where fructose 1,6-bisphospohate is below the concentration for which the activation of pyruvate kinase is at a maximum. We have implemented this allosteric regulation of pyruvate kinase according to the rate equation of Rizzi <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-Rizzi1">[11]</xref>, in which the activation by fructose 1,6-bisphosphate depended on the ATP concentration.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002483.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>All experimental data were converted to intracellular units (mM¬∑min<sup>‚àí1</sup> for rates and mM for concentrations) by assuming a yeast cytosolic volume of 3.75 ¬µl.mg cell protein<sup>‚àí1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002483-deKoning1">[46]</xref>.
