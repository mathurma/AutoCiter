<abstract>
<p>Amino acid signaling mediated by the activation of mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) is fundamental to cell growth and metabolism. However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely unknown. Here, we show that interaction between 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a subunit of multiple amino acid transporters, and the multifunctional hub protein girders of actin filaments (Girdin) down-regulates mTORC1 activity. 4F2hc interacts with Girdin in mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK)- and amino acid signaling–dependent manners to translocate to the lysosome. The resultant decrease in cell surface 4F2hc leads to lowered cytoplasmic glutamine (Gln) and leucine (Leu) content, which down-regulates amino acid signaling. Consistently, Girdin depletion augments amino acid-induced mTORC1 activation and inhibits amino acid deprivation–induced autophagy. These findings uncovered the mechanism underlying negative regulation of amino acid signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1) protein kinase is a master regulator of cell growth, which senses several extracellular signals, such as growth factors and nutrient levels, to coordinate cell metabolism. The activation of mTORC1 by amino acids requires many proteins such as Rag GTPase, GATOR, and Ragulator. However, how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling remains largely unknown. In this study, we revealed that an endocytosis-related protein called Girdin negatively regulates amino acid–induced mTORC1 activation via the formation of a complex with 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc), a subunit of multiple amino acid transporters. We show that Girdin/4F2h complex formation requires growth factor-induced Girdin phosphorylation and amino acid–induced 4F2hc ubiquitination. We also find that the complex promotes the internalization of 4F2hc from the plasma membrane to the lysosomes. The subsequent decrease of 4F2hc in the cell surface results in a lower cytoplasmic glutamine and leucine content, which then down-regulates amino acid–induced mTORC1 activation. These findings uncover the mechanism underlying negative regulation of mTORC1 signaling, which may play a role in tightly regulated cell growth and metabolism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cells respond to extracellular stimuli through multiple signaling pathways, which govern and coordinate various cellular activities. Because of their vital roles, these signaling pathways need to be precisely controlled so that cells can respond appropriately to the external cues and maintain cell homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref001">1</xref>]. Cells have several negative regulatory mechanisms to adjust their sensitivity to receptor tyrosine kinase (RTK) and G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) pathway signals. For example, cells endocytose and subsequently degrade the receptors in the lysosomes in a process called “receptor down-regulation” that makes the cells less responsive to extracellular ligands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>In recent years, mechanisms by which amino acids function to control several cellular processes have attracted considerable attention [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref004">4</xref>]. Amino acids activate the mechanistic target of rapamycin complex 1 (mTORC1), which is a signaling complex composed of a conserved serine-threonine kinase mechanistic target of rapamycin (mTOR), Raptor, mammalian lethal with SEC13 protein 8 (mLST8), Deptor, and the proline-rich Akt substrate of 40 kDa (PRAS40) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref005">5</xref>]. mTORC1 is essential for multiple biological processes, such as cell growth, anabolism, and autophagy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref006">6</xref>]. Notably, mTORC1 signaling is frequently deregulated in several diseases, including cancer and diabetes, which makes it an attractive target for drug discovery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>The mTORC1 pathway integrates amino acid and growth factor signaling by distinct mechanisms, in which several small guanosine triphosphatases (GTPases) play important roles. For example, growth factor stimulation activates mTORC1 via the GTPase Rheb, whereas amino acids activate mTORC1 through the heterodimeric Rag, adenosine diphosphate ribosylation factor-1 (Arf1), and Rab1 GTPases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref011">11</xref>]. Among these, Rag GTPases, which are tightly regulated by the guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) Ragulator and the GTPase-activating protein (GAP) GATOR downstream of amino acid sensors, including Castor, sestrin2, and SAMTOR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref016">16</xref>], are the most studied. The activated Rag GTPases induce the translocation of mTORC1 to the lysosomes and its activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref017">17</xref>]. Although the mechanisms by which cells transmit amino acid signaling to mTORC1 have been elucidated, it remains largely unknown how cells negatively regulate amino acid signaling as observed for the RTK and GPCR signaling pathways. Although two recent studies identified two RagA E3 ligases, RING finger protein 152 and S-phase kinase associated protein 2, which negatively regulate mTORC1 activity through the ubiquitination of RagA, additional negative regulatory mechanisms remain to be discovered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>We previously identified girders of actin filaments (Girdin) (also known as Gα-interacting vesicle-associated protein) as a substrate for the Akt kinase and an actin-binding protein, which is a multifunctional protein that interacts with several proteins and is involved in cell migration and neuroblast differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref023">23</xref>]. Recently, we found that Girdin regulates endocytosis via its function as a GAP for dynamin 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref024">24</xref>]. Intriguingly, Girdin has also been reported to be involved in cell-size control and the regulation of the phosphatidilinositol-3 kinase/Akt pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref027">27</xref>], both of which are closely related to mTORC1 activity, suggesting that it may participate in the mTORC1 signaling pathway.</p>
<p>Here, we describe the identification of 4F2 heavy chain (4F2hc, also known as CD98 heavy chain), a subunit of multiple heterodimeric amino acid transporters, as a Girdin-interacting protein and the role of this protein complex in the negative regulation of mTORC1 activity. Girdin interaction with 4F2hc is regulated by mitogen-activated protein kinase (MAPK) and amino acid signaling, leading to the translocation of 4F2hc to the lysosome and, eventually, decreases in intracellular content of glutamine (Gln) and leucine (Leu) and mTORC1 activity. We propose that this is one of the negative regulatory mechanisms that render cells less responsive to amino acid signaling.</p>

<title>Identification of 4F2hc as a Girdin-interacting protein</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Girdin in mTORC1 signaling, we employed large-scale co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) to isolate Girdin-interacting proteins in mouse brain lysate. To this end, protein G sepharose beads cross-linked with purified anti-Girdin antibody or normal immunoglobulin G (IgG) were incubated with mouse whole brain lysate. The interacting proteins eluted with acidic buffer (pH 2.8) were visualized by silver staining and further analyzed by a tandem mass spectrometry–based shotgun approach, which identified 4F2hc as one of the Girdin-interacting proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s001">S1 Table</xref>). 4F2hc is a type II transmembrane protein that interacts with several amino acid transporters, including LAT1, y<sup>+</sup>LAT1, and xCT, which constitute the heterodimeric amino acid transporter family that is involved in mTORC1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref032">32</xref>]. Therefore, it was plausible to speculate that the 4F2hc/Girdin interaction participates in amino acid signaling and the regulation of mTORC1 activity.</p>

<p>The interaction of 4F2hc with Girdin as indicated by mass spectrometry was confirmed by reciprocal co-IP in both the HeLa and 293FT cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>). To confirm that Girdin is associated with 4F2hc, protein fractionation by gel filtration was carried out. The elution pattern of Girdin largely overlapped with that of 4F2hc, supporting the hypothesis that Girdin interacts with 4F2hc in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Mapping of the interacting domains indicated that the Girdin amino terminal (NT) domain, but not the carboxyl terminal (CT) domain, was responsible for the association with 4F2hc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>
<p>Interestingly, 4F2hc/Girdin interaction was not observed in both HeLa and 293FT cells cultured in media depleted of either fetal bovine serum (FBS) or amino acids that are essential for the activation of mTORC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). These data suggested that 4F2hc/Girdin interaction is elaborately regulated through stimulation by multiple nutrients, including growth factors and amino acids.</p>

<title>MAPK-induced Girdin phosphorylation is required for 4F2hc/Girdin interaction</title>
<p>Next, we investigated the mechanism underlying the 4F2hc/Girdin interaction downstream of serum and amino acid stimulation. A search through multiple databases, including PhosphoSite (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.phosphosite.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.phosphosite.org</ext-link>), revealed that serines at positions 233 and 237 (S233 and S237) of Girdin, which are surrounded by consensus MAPK phosphorylation motifs x(S/T)P, are conserved among species and are phosphorylated in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Indeed, endogenous interaction between Girdin and MAPK was shown by co-IP using 293FT cell lysate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). An in vitro kinase assay revealed that the Girdin NT domain, but not its alanine mutants S233A, S237A, and S233A/S237A (further termed “AA”), was phosphorylated by recombinant MAPK, indicating that MAPK directly phosphorylates S233 and S237 of the Girdin NT domain in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Girdin phosphorylation was also shown by Phos-tag affinity electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref033">33</xref>], in which Flag-tagged Girdin NT domain (Flag-NT) expressed in 293FT cells migrated as multiple bands, indicating distinct levels of phosphorylation of Flag-NT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). The most slowly migrating band was not observable in the Flag-NT AA mutant, supporting that Girdin is phosphorylated at S233 and S237. To verify that Girdin is phosphorylated by MAPK in vivo, phosphopeptides were enriched from Girdin immunoprecipitates using titanium dioxide (TiO<sub>2</sub>) microparticles, followed by mass-spectrometric analysis. The results demonstrated that Girdin is phosphorylated by MAPK at S233 and S237; a phosphopeptide containing phosphorylated S233 and S237 was detected with high peptide confidence only in cells stimulated with FBS, but not in cells pretreated with the MAPK kinase (MAPKK) inhibitor U0126 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). In addition, co-IP tests showed that all of Flag-NT S233A, S237A, and AA lost the capacity to bind 4F2hc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Consistently, treatment with U0126 or the expression of a constitutively active mutant of MAPKK (MAPKK CA) inhibited or augmented 4F2hc/Girdin interaction, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Taken together, these results indicated that MAPK-mediated phosphorylation of Girdin, which occurs downstream of several growth factors, is critical for its interaction with 4F2hc.</p>

<title>Ubiquitination of 4F2hc by amino acids is essential for its interaction with Girdin</title>
<p>A relevant question is how amino acid stimulation modulates the 4F2hc/Girdin interaction. Several reports have indicated that the components of mTORC1 signaling undergo ubiquitination in response to amino acids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref019">19</xref>]. Therefore, we first tested endogenous 4F2hc ubiquitination by tandem-repeated ubiquitin-binding entities (TUBEs) (also known as ubiquitin traps), which enabled us to measure 4F2hc ubiquitination under a non-denaturing physiological condition (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>). We found that 4F2hc was ubiquitinated in 293FT cells, and ubiquitination was significantly increased in response to amino acid stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Next, we transfected 293FT cells with Flag-tagged 4F2hc and His-tagged ubiquitin and then isolated ubiquitinated proteins using Ni-NTA beads under denaturing conditions. The result showed that amino acid stimulation dramatically promoted 4F2hc ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g003">Fig 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>We identified eight potential ubiquitination sites in the cytoplasmic domain of 4F2hc from the PhosphoSite database, mutated them in various combinations by substituting lysine (K) residues to arginines (Rs), and compared the ubiquitination of wild-type (WT) 4F2hc and the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Simultaneous substitution of five or six potential ubiquitination sites (the corresponding mutant was termed “5KR” or “6KR”) significantly abrogated 4F2hc ubiquitination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Moreover, the ubiquitination of 4F2hc was almost undetectable in 8KR mutant, which means that all or most of these eight K residues are involved in 4F2hc ubiquitination. Consistently, the 5KR mutant showed a weaker interaction with the Girdin NT domain than its WT counterpart, and the interaction between the Girdin NT domain and 6KR or 8KR mutant was almost undetectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). These data suggested that the ubiquitination of 4F2hc plays an important role in its interaction with Girdin.</p>

<title>Girdin negatively regulates amino acid signaling</title>
<p>Considering that 4F2hc is a component of multiple heterodimeric amino acid transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref030">30</xref>], we next asked whether the 4F2hc/Girdin complex regulates mTORC1 activity in 293FT cells. Consistent with a previous study, small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of 4F2hc inhibited mTORC1 activity, as indicated by the decreased phosphorylation of the ribosomal protein S6 kinase beta1 (S6K1) and S6, which were monitored as readouts for mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). In contrast, Girdin depletion by two independent interfering sequences significantly increased the basal level of mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>), which was reciprocally confirmed by the fact that overexpression of WT Girdin, but not its AA mutant that had lost the capacity to bind 4F2hc, significantly suppressed mTORC1 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1C Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). Throughout the study, to achieve equal expression levels of exogenously introduced cDNAs and to exclude interclonal differences among cell lines, we utilized the Flp-In system, in which the cDNAs are inserted by homologous recombination into a single genomic recombination target site introduced into the host Flp-In 293 cells (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and methods</xref>) to generate cell lines. Additionally, we generated Girdin knockout cells by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat/CRISPR-associated 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated genome editing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1D–S1F Fig</xref>). In all of HeLa, 293FT, and Flp-In 293 cells, Girdin knockout cells showed higher basal mTORC1 activity than WT cells. In addition, re-expression of WT Girdin, but not Girdin AA mutant, significantly decreased mTORC1 activity in Girdin knockout Flp-In 293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1F Fig</xref>). Unexpectedly, the overexpression of 4F2hc also inhibited basal mTORC1 activation, which might be due to mislocalization of amino acid transporters or disruption of endogenous amino acid transporter complexes by overexpressed 4F2hc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In addition, 4F2hc knockdown abrogated Girdin depletion-induced mTORC1 activation, indicating that Girdin regulates mTORC1 activity through 4F2hc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).</p>

<p>The significance of Girdin in mTORC1 regulation was further supported by the observation that neuroblasts in the rostral migratory stream (RMS) and the dentate gyrus (DG) of the brain, the development of which have been shown to be specifically regulated by Girdin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref034">34</xref>], exhibited significantly high S6 activity in Girdin-deficient as compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). This result supported the notion that Girdin suppresses mTORC1 activity.</p>
<p>Next, we examined the kinetics of mTORC1 activation in amino acid–stimulated cells. Girdin depletion significantly augmented mTORC1 activity over time upon amino acid stimulation in 293FT cells cultured in the presence of dialyzed serum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1G Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). This was confirmed in primary mouse embryonic fibroblasts isolated from control and Girdin-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1H Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). Overexpression of WT Girdin, but not its AA mutant, significantly inhibited amino acid–induced mTORC1 activation, supporting that Girdin is a negative regulator of mTORC1 in the presence of serum and amino acid signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s003">S1I Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>This notion was corroborated by the fact that Girdin depletion inhibited autophagy induced by amino acid withdrawal, as shown by the reduced lipidation of microtubule-associated protein light chain 3 (LC3) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s004">S2A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). In this experiment, we also tested the effect of the lysosome inhibitor Bafilomycin A1, which inhibits the late phase of autophagy, including autophagosome–lysosome fusion and autolysosome acidification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref035">35</xref>]. In cells treated with Bafilomycin A1, Girdin knockdown still inhibited amino acid starvation–induced autophagy, indicating that Girdin affects the early autophagy phase, as mTORC1 reportedly does (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s004">S2A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref036">36</xref>]. Furthermore, the overexpression of WT Girdin, but not its AA mutant, accelerated autophagy, as indicated by the decreased appearance of green fluorescent protein (GFP)-LC3 puncta (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s004">S2B–S2D Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1</xref> Data). These findings suggested that Girdin does not directly regulate S6K1 and S6 activities but rather affects the entire mTORC1 pathway. Collectively, the data indicated that the 4F2hc/Girdin complex is involved in the negative regulation of amino acid and mTORC1 signaling pathways.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the effects of Girdin and 4F2hc depletion and overexpression on intracellular amino acid contents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s005">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). In cells stimulated with total amino acids, Girdin knockdown led to significantly increased Gln and Leu contents, in contrast to 4F2hc depletion, which led to decreases in the two amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s005">S3A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). Neither Girdin nor 4F2hc knockdown had an effect on intracellular Arg under the same condition. These results were consistent with our finding that Girdin knockdown increased amino acid–stimulated mTORC1 activation, whereas 4F2hc knockdown decreased it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), suggesting that Girdin and 4F2hc modulate mTORC1 activity through the regulation of intracellular Gln and Leu contents. Overexpression of Girdin and 4F2hc led to significant decreases in Gln and Leu, but not Arg, in cells stimulated with total amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s005">S3B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>). Overexpression of Girdin AA mutant also resulted in decreased Gln and Leu contents, but less significantly than WT. These results are consistent with our findings that overexpression of Girdin WT and 4F2hc inhibited mTORC1 activation. In addition, because 4F2hc guides several amino acid transporters to localize on the cell membrane to regulate many amino acids’ uptake, we also found that the knockdown of 4F2hc significantly decreases total amino acid contents in cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s002">S1 Data</xref>), which further verified that our test is reliable.</p>
<p>In these experiments, Gln and Leu were very low in starved cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s005">S3 Fig</xref>), which indicated the significance of uptake of these amino acids across the plasma membrane in determining cellular mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). In addition, although there were some differences in Gln and Arg concentration in starved Girdin or 4F2hc-overexpressing cells, the concentration was also very low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005090.s005">S3 Fig</xref>). Supporting this notion, we found that Girdin and 4F2hc depletion significantly up-regulated and inhibited mTORC1 activation, respectively, in cells stimulated with either Gln or Leu (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Notably, the kinetics of mTORC1 activation induced by Gln and Leu stimulation were different: Leu stimulation activated mTORC1 quickly, whereas Gln-stimulated activation of mTORC1 required about 1 h stimulation, as previously reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref010">10</xref>]. Altogether, the data implied that Girdin down-regulates the cell surface level of 4F2hc via endocytosis, which subsequently decreases intracellular Gln and Leu contents to negatively regulate mTORC1 activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our present study identified a novel negative regulatory mechanism for amino acid signaling. This process is mediated by Girdin–4F2hc interaction, which is regulated by Girdin phosphorylation and 4F2hc ubiquitination downstream of MAPK and amino acid stimulation, respectively. The interaction between Girdin and 4F2hc modulates the cell surface level of 4F2hc through the regulation of 4F2hc endocytosis, which subsequently changes intracellular Gln and Leu contents to negatively regulate amino acid signaling. The involvement of Arg in Girdin-mediated mTORC1 regulation remains unclear. In addition, because the changes of mTORC1 activation by Girdin knockdown were relatively modest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4E–4G</xref>), additional mechanisms apart from Girdin–4F2hc interaction could also play a role in mTORC1 regulation.</p>
<p>An interesting finding from the present study is that the formation of the 4F2hc/Girdin complex required signals from both growth factors and amino acids, both of which are known to be essential for mTORC1 activation. This finding suggested that the 4F2hc/Girdin complex integrates signals from various factors, such as nutrients, to counteract the anabolic and biosynthetic pathways induced by these factors. In accordance herewith, 4F2hc is a hub protein that interacts with not only transporters for essential amino acids such as LAT1 and y<sup>+</sup>LAT1 but also a cystine transporter, xCT, and a glucose transporter, GLUT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref041">41</xref>]. This led us to speculate that the 4F2hc/Girdin complex may also be involved in the control of cystine-mediated intracellular redox balance or glucose metabolism.</p>
<p>We showed that MAPK-mediated Girdin phosphorylation is crucial for the endocytosis and lysosomal localization of 4F2hc. This finding is in accordance with a previous report that Girdin functions to activate dynamin GTPase, which is essential for the pinching off of clathrin-coated vesicles and their endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref024">24</xref>]. However, the upstream mechanism(s) of amino acid–induced 4F2hc ubiquitination, which also has an effect on the formation of the 4F2hc/Girdin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g003">Fig 3</xref>), remains unknown. One obvious candidate for the ubiquitination of 4F2hc is the membrane-associated RING-CH E3 ubiquitin ligase 1 and 8 (MARCH1/8), which was previously shown to ubiquitinate 4F2hc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref042">42</xref>]. Consistent with our finding, one study showed that MARCH1/8-mediated ubiquitination of 4F2hc leads to its translocation from the plasma membrane to the lysosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref043">43</xref>]. In addition, another study reported that 4F2hc translocates to the lysosome through binding to the lysosomal protein, LAPTM4b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref044">44</xref>]. We speculate that Girdin promotes amino acid–stimulated 4F2hc endocytosis, and the internalized 4F2hc may translocate to the lysosome via interaction with LAPTM4b.</p>
<p>To clarify the mechanism of Girdin–4F2hc interaction in regulation of mTORC1 activity, we investigated the role of Girdin and 4F2hc on intracellular amino acids. Although some studies have reported an essential role of lysosomal amino acids in mTORC1 activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref045">45</xref>], a very recent study showed that 1-h amino acid starvation led to a significant decrease in essential amino acids in whole cell lysate but not the lysosome fraction, which implicated that lysosomal amino acids may not be a major driving force for mTORC1 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref046">46</xref>]. This was consistent with the fact that most amino acid sensors identified so far, such as Castor, sestrin2, and SAMTOR, are located in the cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref016">16</xref>]. Therefore, we focused on the effects of Girdin and 4F2hc on cytosolic amino acids, specifically, Leu, Gln, and Arg, all of which regulate mTORC1 activity. Girdin depletion–mediated mTORC1 activation was accompanied by an increase in intracellular Gln and Leu contents, whereas no obvious changes in Arg were detected among control and Girdin or 4F2hc knockdown cells under the given culture conditions. Based on these findings, we speculated that Girdin negatively regulates amino acid signaling via modulating 4F2hc endocytosis and the cytosolic contents of Gln and Leu.</p>
<p>The significance of the negative regulation of amino acid signaling by 4F2hc/Girdin complex in vivo has not been revealed in this study. In embryonic development and homeostasis in adult tissues, mTORC1 activity needs to be tightly controlled; deregulation of mTORC1 leads to stem cell aging, reduced tissue regeneration capacity, and the progression of diseases such as cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref048">48</xref>]. Further studies on animal models should be devoted to clarifying the biological context in which the 4F2hc/Girdin complex functions. One potential role of Girdin-mediated mTORC1 regulation was suggested by our finding that mTORC1 activity is significantly up-regulated in neuroblasts in the RMS and DG in the brain of Girdin-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005090.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). We and others have previously reported that Girdin is essential for the development of postnatal brain and adult neurogenesis, in which it controls the differentiation and migration of newly generated neuroblasts in the RMS and DG [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref034">34</xref>]. We therefore speculate that the negative regulatory effect of Girdin on mTORC1 may contribute to the proper development of those brain regions in the developmental and adult stages. Girdin is expressed in some types of human malignancies, in which it may have a role in maintaining appropriate activation of mTORC1. Further experiments are required to verify the physiological functions of Girdin-mediated mTORC1 regulation.</p>

The lysates were cleared via centrifugation at 37,000 rpm for 1 h and applied to a column of Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads with a 1-mL bed volume (GE Healthcare) equilibrated with 20 mL of TED buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, 1 mM DTT, pH 8.0). The column was washed extensively with 10 mL of TED buffer and the GST fusion protein was eluted using elution buffer (10 mM glutathione in TED buffer), followed by dialysis with TED buffer.</p>

<title>In vitro kinase assay</title>
<p>The phosphorylation assay was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref014">14</xref>]. In brief, MAPK was reacted with the recombinant proteins of Girdin-NT WT and mutants (S233A, S237A, and AA) in 50 μL of reaction mixture (20 mM MOPS, pH 7.2, 25 mM β-glycerol phosphate, 5 mM EGTA, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 1 mM DTT, 13.5 mM MgCl2, 90 μM ATP containing [g-32P]ATP [Perkin Elmer, NEG502Z], 1 ng/μl active mouse MAPK [Erk2, Millipore], and 0.8 μM purified Girdin-NT) for 10 min at 32°C. Then, the reaction mixtures were boiled in SDS sample buffer and subjected to SDS-PAGE and silver staining. The radiolabeled proteins were visualized with an image analyzer (Typhoon FLA 9000; GE Healthcare Life Sciences).</p>

<sec id="sec023">
<title>Ubiquitination assay</title>
<p>Two methods were used to test in vivo ubiquitination of 4F2hc. For the detection of endogenous 4F2hc ubiquitination, we exploited the recently developed TUBEs approach to capture ubiquitinated proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref051">51</xref>]. 293FT cells treated with MG132 (10 μM, Sigma) for 4 h were starved for amino acids for 1 h and stimulated with total amino acids for 1 h. The cells were then lysed with 500 μL of IP lysis buffer supplemented with Complete Mini protease inhibitor and PhosSTOP phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Roche) and 25 μg of GST-TUBE2 (LifeSensors, #UM102). Cleared cell lysates were incubated with 50 μL of Glutathione Sepharose 4B beads for 2 h. The beads were washed three times with IP lysis buffer, followed by elution of the protein complex by 100 μL 1× SDS sample buffer and WB analysis using anti-4F2hc antibody.</p>
<p>For the detection of exogenous 4F2hc ubiquitination, 293FT cells transfected with 4F2hc (1.5 μg) and His-Ub (3 μg) plasmids were treated with MG132 (10 μM) for 4 h. Then, the cells were washed twice with ice-cold PBS, scraped off the plates in the PBS, and collected by centrifugation at 600 × <italic>g</italic> for 5 min. The cell pellets were lysed in buffer C (6 M guanidine-HCl, 0.1 M Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>/NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 10 mM imidazole, pH 8.0) and sonicated. The whole cell extracts were mixed with 100 μL of Ni-NTA agarose beads (Qiagen) at 4°C overnight. The Ni-NTA beads were washed twice with buffer C, once with buffer D (1:3 mixture of buffer C: buffer E), and once with buffer E (25 mM Tris-HCl, 20 mM imidazole, pH 6.8). The bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS loading buffer containing 300 mM imidazole and resolved by SDS-PAGE, followed by WB analysis.</p>

<sec id="sec024">
<title>Isolation of cell surface protein</title>
<p>Cells were quickly washed twice using ice-cold PBS on ice and then incubated with 250 μg/mL of sulfosuccinimidyl-2-(biotinamido)ethyl-1,3-dithiopropionate (sulfo-NHS-SS-Biotin; Thermo Scientific) at 4°C for 30 min. The cells were washed three times with ice-cold PBS and lysed in IP lysis buffer. The cell lysates were incubated with 20 μL of NeutrAvidin agarose (Thermo Scientific) for 1 h, followed by three washes with IP lysis buffer. Bound proteins were eluted by boiling in 1× SDS loading buffer and were detected by WB analysis.</p>

<title>Immunofluorescence staining</title>
<p>Immunofluorescence studies were performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref018">18</xref>]. Cells were plated on glass base dishes (Iwaki, Osaka, Japan), fixed, and stained with the indicated antibodies. The cells were imaged using a confocal laser-scanning microscope (LSM700, Carl Zeiss, Oberkochen, Germany).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec026">
<title>Immunohistochemistry</title>
<p>Immunohistochemistry was performed as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005090.ref023">23</xref>]. Mouse brains were perfused with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, postfixed in the same fixative overnight, and cut into 50–60-μm sections on a microslicer (VT1200S, Leica, Heidelberg, Germany). Tissue sections were deparaffinized and rehydrated, and antigens were retrieved by boiling in target retrieval solution pH 9 (Dako) for 30 min. After washing with PBS containing 0.05% Tween-20, Protein Blocking Agent (Dako) was used to cover slides for 30 min, and then anti-pS6 antibody (Cell Signaling Technology) diluted (1:100) in 0.1% BSA/PBS buffer was applied to the slides overnight at 4°C. After washing, sections were treated with 3% hydrogen peroxide/ethanol solution for 15 min at room temperature and incubated with horseradish peroxidase-labeled anti-rabbit IgG secondary antibodies (EnVision System, Dako) for 30 min at room temperature, followed by signal detection with diaminobenzidine solution.</p>
