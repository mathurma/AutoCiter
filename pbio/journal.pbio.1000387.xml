<p>The unusual dual functions of the actin-binding protein EPS8 as an actin capping and actin bundling factor are mapped to distinct structural features of the protein and to distinct physiological activities in vivo.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Actin capping and cross-linking proteins regulate the dynamics and architectures of different cellular protrusions. Eps8 is the founding member of a unique family of capping proteins capable of side-binding and bundling actin filaments. However, the structural basis through which Eps8 exerts these functions remains elusive. Here, we combined biochemical, molecular, and genetic approaches with electron microscopy and image analysis to dissect the molecular mechanism responsible for the distinct activities of Eps8. We propose that bundling activity of Eps8 is mainly mediated by a compact four helix bundle, which is contacting three actin subunits along the filament. The capping activity is mainly mediated by a amphipathic helix that binds within the hydrophobic pocket at the barbed ends of actin blocking further addition of actin monomers. Single-point mutagenesis validated these modes of binding, permitting us to dissect Eps8 capping from bundling activity in vitro. We further showed that the capping and bundling activities of Eps8 can be fully dissected in vivo, demonstrating the physiological relevance of the identified Eps8 structural/functional modules.

</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>One of the key components of the cytoskeleton of cells is actin, which allows cells to move. Actin-based motility is involved in many biological processes, such as intestinal development, intracellular trafficking and cell migration. Actin monomers are individual building blocks that can be linked together to form actin filaments. Numerous actin-binding proteins are involved in controlling the higher order architecture and dynamics of these actin filaments within cells. For example, actin capping proteins regulate actin dynamics by controlling the number of growing filament ends, and actin cross-linking or bundling proteins determine how to organize these filaments into higher order structures. The protein Eps8 is capable of capping as well as bundling actin filaments. However, the structural basis of this dual role of Eps8 remains unknown. In this study, we use a combination of techniques to unravel the molecular and structural basis of Eps8 interactions with actin filaments. We show that distinct structural modules of Eps8 are responsible for capping versus bundling activity, and we determine the contributions of these modules in vitro and in vivo. At the functional level, we find that Eps8 regulates actin-based motility and cellular trafficking through its capping activity, whereas Eps8-mediated bundling is essential for intestinal morphogenesis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Actin-based motility is involved in many cellular processes including cell migration, morphogenesis, endocytosis, and cytokinesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Pollard1">[1]</xref>. A large number of actin-binding proteins participate in controlling the architecture and dynamics of the diverse and versatile actin-based structures that result from these processes. Among them, capping proteins block the growing ends of actin-filaments and are essential for the regulation of actin turnover. The importance of capping proteins in actin motility was demonstrated by experiments in which actin-based motility could be reconstituted in vitro, starting from a minimal set of purified components, in the presence of a capping protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Wiesner1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Loisel1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>Consistent with such a key role, various types of capping families have been identified in mammals and considerable effort has been devoted to explore the structural mechanisms of action. Capping proteins display a variable and not conserved domain organization, suggesting different modes through which they cap actin filaments. The Gelsolin family includes seven actin-binding proteins, characterized by a variable number of homologous and repeated Gelsolin domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-McGough1">[4]</xref>. Gelsolin itself, for instance, contains six repeats (G1–G6) of which three are calcium-regulated actin binding-surfaces G1, G2, and G4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-McLaughlin1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-McGough2">[8]</xref>. Biochemical and structural studies of the isolated first two domains of Gelsolin, G1–G2, in complex with monomeric or dimeric actin, indicated that this assembly is sufficient for capping, with G1 binding the barbed end of actin and G2 contacting the side of the filament end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Robinson1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Way1">[9]</xref>. This mode of interaction is conserved in Twinfilin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Paavilainen1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Paavilainen2">[11]</xref>, which, however, has no sequence similarity with Gelsolin. Instead, it contains two ADF (Actin Depolymerizing Factor) homology domains, which have been proposed to contact the last two actin subunits in the filament, in a fashion that resembles the interaction between gelsolin G1–G2 and actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Paavilainen1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Paavilainen2">[11]</xref>. Finally, the Capping Protein CP, the most widely distributed cappers in mammalian cells, is a heterodimer in which the flexible C-terminal regions of each promoter, α and β, have been proposed to block elongation of the two terminal actin subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Kim1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Narita1">[13]</xref>.</p>
<p>Eps8 is the prototype of an Eps8L-family of capping proteins including four related genes in mammals, which possess unique features among cappers. Eps8L molecules display a modular domain organization (PTB, SH3 domains and a C-terminal, actin-binding region) more typically found in signaling adaptors. Accordingly, Eps8 participates, via its SH3 domain, in the formation of distinct macromolecular complexes that either transduce signals from Ras to Rac leading to actin remodeling or regulate endocytosis of receptor tyrosine kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Scita1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Lanzetti1">[15]</xref>. The isolated C-terminal domain (residues 648–821) caps barbed ends in the nanomolar range, as do most cappers, but it is inhibited in the context of the full-length protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Croce1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza1">[17]</xref>. Binding of Eps8 to ABI1 relieves this auto-inhibition. Therefore, Eps8 is regulated somewhat unconventionally for barbed end cappers via a protein:protein interaction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza1">[17]</xref>. Remarkably, unlike other cappers, full-length Eps8 has also been shown to organize actin filaments into higher order structures, and this cross-linking activity is significantly enhanced in the presence of another protein:protein interaction, in this case with IRSp53 (Insulin Receptor Tyrosine Kinases Substrate of 53 KD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Oda1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza2">[21]</xref>).</p>
<p>Here, we combined biochemical and molecular biology and genetic approaches with electron microscopy (EM) to dissect the molecular and structural basis of Eps8 interaction(s) with actin filaments. We find that an amphipathic helix (H1) is largely responsible for Eps8 capping activity by blocking the barbed end of the filament while a compact, globular domain (H2–H5) binds to the side of filaments and promotes bundling. This bimodal mechanism of association to actin filaments further permitted us to define the relative contribution of the two actin related activities of Eps8 in vivo. Thus, Eps8 controls actin-based motility and endomembrane cellular trafficking through its capping activity, while, as a bundler, is essential for proper intestinal morphogenesis of developing <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>.</p>

<title>Eps8 Actin Binding Domain (648–821) Binds and Sequesters Monomeric Actin</title>
<p>Capping proteins are able to bind and block the barbed end of actin filaments. In addition, Gelsolin, Twinfilin, and CP can associate with monomeric actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Ojala1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Wear1">[23]</xref>. Similarly, the fluorescence of NBD-(7-chloro-4-nitrobenzofurazan)-actin was significantly increased (by as much as 20%) by the addition of Eps8 capping domain, Eps8(648–821), in low ionic strength conditions (G-buffer), demonstrating its ability to bind monomeric actin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The intensity of fluorescence depended directly upon the protein concentration, indicating a saturation binding mode, consistent with the formation of a 1∶1 complex between monomeric actin and Eps8(648–821) with an equilibrium dissociation Kd of around 50 nM, when measured at low ionic strength conditions (G-buffer) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1A, 1H</xref>), and around 1.7 µM, when physiological conditions (F-Buffer) were used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1B–1H</xref>). We confirmed the 1∶1 ratio of the Eps8(648–821):G-actin complex through chemical cross-linking and size-exclusion chromatography experiments. In the first approach, we detected a single covalently cross-linked protein with a size of ∼60 KD, equivalent to the sum of the molecular weights of Eps8(648–821) and monomeric actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). By gel filtration analysis, Eps8(648–821) and G-actin eluted in distinct fractions, according to their respective molecular weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Conversely, when mixed in a 1∶1 molar ratio, they co-fractionated, forming a stoichiometric complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Addition of 2-fold molar excess of Eps8(648–821) saturated the amounts of G-actin and the excess of the former eluted with the expected retention volume (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Finally, submicromolar (at low ionic strength) to micromolar (at physiological ionic strength) Kd values were obtained for ADP-G-actin, indicating that Eps8(648–821) binds both nucleotide-bound forms of actin with similar affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1E, 1H</xref>).</p>

<p>(A–B) <italic>Eps8(648</italic>–<italic>821) binds monomeric actin</italic>. The change in fluorescence of NBD-labeled-actin was measured at different concentrations of Eps8(648–821), in either (A) low salt (G-buffer) or (B) in high salt (F buffer) buffer containing 0.1 M KCl and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. Symbols indicate data; solid line indicates fitted binding curve for a complex with a 1∶1 stoichiometry. The curve is calculated using Equation 1 in the “Experimental Procedure.” (C–D) <italic>Eps8(648</italic>–<italic>821) forms a 1∶1 complex with actin</italic>. (C) Chemical cross-linking revealed that Eps8(648–821) and actin form a 1∶1 complex. Eps8(648–821) and actin, either alone or in combination, were incubated for various lengths of time in the absence or presence of PPDM, separated by SDS-PAGE and detected by Coomassie blue staining. Lanes 1, 2, 3: 10 µM of Eps8(648–821) incubated in the absence (Lane 1) or the presence of the cross-linker for 5 min (Lane 2) or 15 min (Lane 3); Lanes 4, 5, 6: 10 µM of actin alone incubated in the absence (Lane 4) or the presence of PPDM for 5 min (Lane 5) and 15 min (Lane 6); Lanes 7, 8, 9: 10 µM of Actin (10 µM) and Eps8(648–821) incubated in the absence (Lane 7) or the presence of PPDM for 5 (Lane 8) and 15 (Lane 9) min. Molecular weight markers are also shown and indicated on the right. (D) Eps8 C-terminal domain and Actin co-elute in gel filtration forming a 1∶1 complex. Size exclusion chromatography experiment on a Superdex 200 10/30 column in G buffer (2 mM TRIS pH 7.8, 0.2 mM ATP, 1 mM DTT, 0.1 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>). Purified Actin and Eps8(648–821) were analyzed by gel filtration either alone (blue and black line, respectively) or after pre-incubation on ice for 1 h in a 1∶1 or 1∶2 molar ratio (red and green line, respectively). In each case, 30 uL fractions were collected and analyzed by Coomassie staining on 10% SDS-PAGE gel, which is shown beneath the elution profile. (E) <italic>Eps8(648</italic>–<italic>821) binds ATP- and ADP-G-actin with similar affinities</italic>. The change in fluorescence of 1.5 µM NBD-ADP-G-actin (blue line, closed squares) or NBD-ATP-G-actin (red line, closed circles) was measured at different concentrations of Eps8(648–821), in G-buffer. ATP to ADP exchange was performed using Hexokinase in the presence of 10 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub> and 1 mM glucose. Symbols indicate data; solid lines indicate fitted binding curves for a complex with 1∶1 stoichiometry. The affinity constants calculated from these plots using the equation described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section were Kd(ATP-Ca-G-Actin)  = 75 nM, Kd(ADP-Ca-G-Actin)  = 125 nM. (F) <italic>Eps8(648</italic>–<italic>821) inhibits the dissociation of ATP from ATP-G-Actin</italic>. ATP-G-actin (2 µM, in G-buffer containing 20 µM of CaCl<sub>2</sub>) was supplemented with the indicated concentrations of Eps8(648–821). The dissociation of bound ATP was monitored by adding 5 µM of εATP at time 0 and recording the subsequent increase of fluorescence of εATP. The pseudo-first order exchange rate constant is plotted versus the total concentration of Eps8(648–821). (G) <italic>Barbed and pointed end elongation rate of actin in the presence of Eps8(648</italic>–<italic>821)</italic>. The rate of elongation was measured from pointed ends (circles), using gelsolin-actin seeds (5 nM) and 2 µM of G-actin (10% pyrenyl-labeled), or from barbed ends (triangles) using spectrin-actin seeds, in the presence of increasing concentrations of Eps8(648–821), as indicated. Rates are normalized taking as 100% the rate of elongation from either pointed or barbed ends measured in the absence of Eps8(648–821).

<p>Several G actin-binding domains, such as WH2 (WASp Homology 2) and ADF homology domains, decrease the nucleotide dissociation rate from G-actin, while others, like profilin, enhance it. Among the capping proteins, Twinfilin inhibits nucleotide exchange from ADP-G-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Vartiainen1">[24]</xref>, whereas gelsolin, which forms a ternary complex with two actin subunits, blocks nucleotide exchange from the ATP-bound G-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-McLaughlin1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Slupsky1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Lee1">[28]</xref>. We thus tested the effect of Eps8(648–821) on nucleotide exchange by monitoring the association of a fluorescent ε-ATP analogue to ATP-G-actin. At low ionic strength, Eps8(648–821) significantly diminished the nucleotide exchange rate on G-actin by 5-fold, similarly to what has been reported for the WH2 domain of Ciboulot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Hertzog2">[29]</xref>. These results suggest that the Eps8(648–821):G-actin complex shares biochemical and, likely, structural features with G-actin in complex with either WH2 domains, S1-gelsolin, or Twinfilin.</p>
<p>The formation of an Eps8(648–821):G-actin complex prompted us to revisit the effect of Eps8(648–821) on actin assembly. We initially carried out seeded growth assays in the presence of increasing concentration of Eps8(648–821). For this purpose, we used spectrin-actin seeds, which are purified oligomers of actin and Spectrin with blocked pointed, but free barbed, ends. As previously reported, Eps8(648–821) inhibited the filament barbed end linear elongation rate in a dose-dependent manner with nanomolar affinity (K<sub>cap</sub> = 15 nM); inhibition occurred at concentration that were substoichiometric with respect to G-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Eps8(648–821) also inhibited, in a concentration-dependent fashion, actin polymerization in gelsolin-seeded growth assays, which permit measurement of the elongation rate of filaments exclusively from pointed ends. In this latter case, however, stoichiometric concentrations of Eps8(648–821) with respect to G-actin were required, with an apparent K<sub>i</sub> (Constant of inhibition) of Eps8(648–821) for pointed end filament growth of around 2.5 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1G–1H</xref>), in good agreement with the Kd of the Eps8(648–821):G-actin complex measured at physiological salt conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1B, 1H</xref>). Under these conditions, an Eps8(648–821):G-actin complex is formed that cannot be incorporated into nascent filament; the complex thus fails to support pointed end growth, and this is reflected in the sequestration of monomeric actin.</p>

<title>The Minimal G-Actin Binding and Capping Region of Eps8(648–821) Encompasses Its Amphipathic (H1) Helix</title>
<p>Eps8 barbed end capping activity is encoded by its evolutionarily conserved, C-terminal region (residues 648–821 for murine Eps8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure S1B</xref>). This region displays no sequence similarity with other known capping proteins or actin-binding motifs. However, prediction of its secondary structure indicated that it is composed of five alpha helices (H1 to H5 from N- to C-terminus) connected by linkers of variable length.</p>
<p>In order to define the binding surfaces of the C-terminal region of Eps8 with actin, various fragments encompassing different helices, alone or in combination, were purified and assayed for actin binding using the fluorescence of NBD-actin as a probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). The helices H1–H2 (residues 674–737) and the isolated predicted H5 (residues 765–788) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s001">Figure S1D</xref>) were the minimal fragments capable of increasing NBD-actin fluorescence by 17% and 12%, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s001">Figure S1E</xref>), and were further characterized. Determination of the affinity constants of dissociation revealed that the two fragments bound with significantly different affinity parameters. H1–H2 displays a much higher affinity (Kd = 50 nM) for monomeric actin than the isolated H5 (Kd = 3 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g002">Figure 2B, 2C, and 2G</xref>). The existence of a 1∶1 complex between G-actin and Eps8(648–821) suggests the possibility that this region of Eps8 may bind one actin monomer through two different surfaces. This, however, appears unlikely since, as predicted by avidity, the overall interaction affinity of Eps8(648–821), which possesses two actin binding sites, would be in the picomolar rather than in the nanomolar range as experimentally determined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Thus, we conclude that the H1–H2 helices represent the major surface of interaction within the Eps8(648–821):G-actin complex.</p>

<p>Next, we tested the effect of the formation of the G-actin:H1–H2 and G-actin:H5 complexes on actin dynamics at the two ends of actin filaments. H1–H2 inhibited growth completely at both ends of actin filaments in a saturable fashion. Substoichiometric concentrations of H1–H2 to G-actin were required to reduce barbed end growth, with a calculated K<sub>cap</sub> of ∼200 nM suggesting that these isolated helices are critical in mediating barbed end capping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). However, the significantly reduced affinity of H1–H2 (K<sub>cap</sub> = 200 nM) with respect to Eps8(648–821) (K<sub>cap</sub> = 1–15 nM) indicates that other structural determinants contribute to full capping activity and barbed end binding. Sequestration of ATP-G-actin by HI–H2, instead, completely accounted for the concentration-dependent inhibition of pointed ends growth, in a stoichiometric range of concentrations with respect to G-actin, with a K<sub>seq</sub> of 2.5 µM, identical to that calculated for the Eps8(648–821) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g002">Figure 2D, 2G</xref>).</p>
<p>We performed the same set of assays for the isolated H5. H5 inhibited filament growth from either pointed or barbed ends in a concentration-dependent fashion. In both cases, however, the thermodynamic parameters of inhibition were in the micromolar range (Kd<sub>pointed</sub> = 32 µM; Kd<sub>barbed</sub> = 40 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g002">Figure 2E, 2G</xref>), indicating that supra-stoichiometric amounts of H5 were required to block filament end growth, consistent with a low sequestering activity. To provide additional evidence that low affinity binding to filaments ends does not account for the observed inhibition, we performed pointed end assays at two concentrations of G-actin. Higher concentrations of H5 were required to inhibit barbed end growth when the concentrations of G-actin was increased from 2 to 4 µM, accounting for the shift toward the right of the curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g002">Figure 2F</xref>); this result demonstrates that the inhibition by the isolated H5 is solely dependent on its ability to sequester monomeric actin and is not due to low affinity binding to filament ends.</p>
<p>Collectively, these data indicate that Eps8(648–821)'s actin-binding surface comprises two binding surfaces, H1–H2 and H5. Only the isolated H1–H2 displays significant barbed end capping activity. This result underlines the importance of the integrity of these helices for this function, a notion that further accounts for previous findings indicating that mutations in key amino acid residues in H2 significantly impaired capping <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Menna1">[30]</xref>. Instead, both H1–H2 and H5 can associate with monomeric actin, albeit with different affinities, both contributing to barbed end capping in the context of the full-length protein.</p>

<title>The Amphipathic (H1) Helix of Eps8 Contacts the Hydrophobic Pocket between Subdomain 1 and 3 of Actin</title>
<p>We employed two independent approaches to identify residues involved in binding between actin and Eps8(648–821). In the first approach, we performed competition binding assays between NBD-actin and Eps8(648–821) in the presence or absence of saturating concentrations of either Ciboulot or Thymosin β4 or ADF cofilin, which bind between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin, at the barbed end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Hertzog1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Carlier1">[31]</xref>. NBD-G-actin saturated with Thymosin β4 or Ciboulot displayed levels of fluorescence significantly higher than NBD-G-actin either alone or in complex with Eps8(648–821) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3A, 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Hertzog2">[29]</xref>. The addition of increasing concentrations of Eps8(648–821) to either Thymosinβ4:NBD-G-actin or Ciboulot:NBD-G-actin led to a decrease in fluorescence to levels consistent with the displacement of these proteins from actin and the concomitant formation of a Eps8(648–821):actin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3A–B, 3G</xref>). Similarly, Eps8(648–821) competed with ADF/cofilin for binding to ADP-G-actin. Binding of ADF/cofilin did not significantly affect the fluorescence of NBD-ADP-actin but caused a large increase in the apparent Kd for binding of Eps8(648–821) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Thus, Eps8(648–821) competes with Thymosin β4, Ciboulot, and ADF/cofilin for binding to monomeric actin, suggesting that the three proteins share the same interaction surfaces. Similar assays were performed utilizing Ciboulot and either the isolated H1–H2 or H5. Only H1–H2, but not H5, displaced Ciboulot from actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3D, 3E</xref>). We obtained similar results using Thymosin β4, Eps8(648–821), H1–H2, and 5-(2((acetyl)amino)ethyl)amino-naphthalene-1-sulfonate (AEDANS)-labeled-G-actin in high salt buffer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s002">Figure S2A, S2B</xref>). Thus, collectively, these results indicate that H1–H2 and H5 bind actin on different surfaces. Consistently, H1–H2 bound NBD-G-actin with identical affinity in the absence or presence of H5, at low ionic strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3F, 3G</xref>). Notably, the increases in fluorescence of NBD-actin due to the binding of H5 and of H1–H2 are additive, consistent with simultaneous binding of the two fragments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Thus, Eps8(648–821) appears to interact with two distinct actin surfaces, one of which, the high-affinity interaction region (H1–H2), is essential for capping and is located between subdomains 1 and 3 of G-actin. Ciboulot, Thymosin β4, and ADF cofilin contact this hydrophobic pocket by inserting an amphipathic helix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Dominguez1">[32]</xref>. Eps8 may adopt a similar mode of binding since helical wheel analysis showed that the H1 amphipathic helix exposes conserved hydrophobic residues exposed on a line on one side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), while the rest of the helix contains a mixture of different charges. This arrangement is very reminiscent of the other known helices that bind the hydrophobic cleft of actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>

<p>To obtain direct validation of our finding, we performed a chemical cross-linking experiment followed by mass spectrometry identification of the resulting hybrid peptides. We generated isopeptide bonds between side chains of actin and Eps8(648–821) by incubating these proteins alone, as a control, or in combination with a cross-linking agent (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). SDS-PAGE separation of the resulting reaction products revealed two slower-migrating protein species, only when Eps8(648–821) and actin were simultaneously present in the cross-linking mixture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We isolated these products and subjected them to mass spectrometry analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). A number of Eps8-actin, cross-linked peptides could be identified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 4B</xref>, right). All actin-derived peptides contained either K330, located in subdomain 3, or K375, located in subdomain 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), whereas Eps8-derived fragments contained K675 and K683, which are located just before or in the predicted H1, respectively, or K707, located in the linker region connecting the predicted H1 and H2. These results are in good agreement with our biochemical mapping, strengthening the importance of H1–H2 helices in mediating a tight association of Eps8 with monomeric actin. Additionally, and more importantly, they suggest that H1–H2 by interacting in close proximity with subdomains 1 and 3 of actin, which are the exposed domains on barbed ends of actin filaments, block the further addition of monomer accounting for their capping activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Notably, one cross-linked peptide isolated from the slower migrating band is the result of an intramolecular interaction within Eps8(648–821), occurring between H1 and the linker region, thus suggesting the possibility that these regions of Eps8 may fold one over the other in a configuration that may be relevant for regulation of barbed end capping, as observed in the case of full-length Eps8, which displays no capping activity.</p>

<title>H1 Is Connected to the H2–H5 Globular Core via a Cleavable Linker</title>
<p>To gain insight into the structural organization of murine Eps8 capping domains we took advantage of the recently solved NMR structure of the C-terminal region of human Eps8L2 (residues 612–697, 1WWU), a member of the Eps8L family protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Offenhauser1">[33]</xref>, and of human Eps8 (residues 699–784, 2E8M) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), deposited in the PDB database (Structural Genomic Program–RIKEN Genomic Sciences Center, Yokohama, Japan). These fragments, which include the most C-terminal four helices, H2 to H5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g001">Figure S1B</xref>), fold into a globular, helical core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Notably, murine and human Eps8 C-terminal actin binding domains are nearly identical predicting that they adopt a similar fold. Structural atomic modeling using the Phyre software (Protein Homology/Analogy Recognition Engine) confirmed this prediction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Conversely, the absence of experimental structural information on the first α-helix of Eps8 and Eps8L2 prevented modeling the folding of this helix with respect to the globular core. This region of Eps8 appears connected to the core helical bundle by an unstructured and presumably flexible linker of 20 residues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This latter notion is supported by the observation that in the more closely related ESP8 and EPS8L2 NMR structures (PDB ids 2E8M, 1WWU), the linker is in a disordered state and not part of the compact core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and unpublished data). Additionally, limited proteolysis of Eps8(648–821) resulted in the generation of a fragment encompassing the proteolytic-resistant, helical globular core, which is thus connected by an exposed, cleavable linker to H1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s002">Figure S2C</xref>).</p>

Furthermore, the SH3 domain of Eps8 does not bind actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza1">[17]</xref>. These features allowed us to use this extra mass as a visual marker for the H1 helix without affecting the mode of Eps8 binding to actin. Similar approaches were employed to localize structural elements in helical reconstructions of kinesin bound to microtubules using an SH3 domain as a marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Wendt1">[36]</xref> and in Arp2/3 mediated actin branches using GFP as a marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Egile1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the raw images extra density associated to Eps8 is clearly visible (red arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The corresponding 3D reconstructions show a significant change in twist (2.16 subunits per turn) if compared to that of F-actin alone (2.14 subunits per turn), indicating that Eps8 interferes with intra-filament contacts. Difference mapping between the reconstruction and control F-actin (after correcting for the difference in twist) resulted in an elongated density corresponding to the bound Eps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5B–5C</xref>). Part of the density is located between three actin subunits making the majority of its contacts with two short-pitch neighbors. One actin subunit is contacted at the back of subdomains 1 and 2 (grey subunit) and one mostly at the back of subdomain 3 (blue subunit). The barbed-end, long-pitch neighbor (yellow) of the latter subunit provides contacts at the top of subdomain 4. The volume and shape of this density segment corresponds well to the compact H2–H5 domain of Eps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>
<p>A second density segment is located at the hydrophobic pocket between subdomains 1 and 3 of the blue subunit, consistent with the biochemical studies placing H1 at this location. This density segment cannot accommodate the size of the H2–H5 domain. The remaining density of the second segment, after accounting for the H1 helix, accommodates the flexibly attached SH3 domain serving as a visual marker for the H1 position (arrowhead in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The H1–H2 linker can easily accommodate the distance between the two density segments if threaded into the connecting density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5B–5D</xref>). The resulting model brings the residues that we identified in the cross-linking experiments into reasonably close apposition to account for the cross-linking between Eps8 and actin (cyan and yellow circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<title>Eps8 Capping and Bundling Activities Can Be Dissected In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
<p>The structural model of the interaction of Eps8 with actin provides the molecular framework to account for both capping and bundling activities, further suggesting that they can be dissected. The model predicts that residues involved in accommodating the amphipathic, H1 helix into the hydrophobic barbed end pocket would be critical for capping, and may instead be dispensable for Eps8 to bind and bundle actin filaments. Furthermore, the core helical loop (H2–H5), which makes the most extensive contact with respect to three consecutive actin subunits within a filament, is likely essential for binding and bundling filament, but not for capping.</p>
<p>We set out to test these predictions by generating point mutations. The unique mode of Eps8 wrapped around the protomeric subunits of actin filaments suggests that mutation in single key residues in the loop of the extending arm, which is in close contact to actin units (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g005">Figure 5B–5D</xref>), should reduce binding to barbed ends, monomeric actin, and presumably also to the side of actin filaments. Consistently, mutations of R706A and F708A in the linker region reduced the affinity for barbed end (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, KcapEps8-WT = 7 nM; KcapEps8-Linker mutant  = 180 nM) and binding to G-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) by around 10-fold with respect to the WT Eps8(648–821) fragment. These mutations also significantly reduced side binding (not show) and bundling of filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6A, right panel</xref>s), consistent with a role of the linker in stabilizing the association of Eps8(648–821) to actin filament. Next, we engineered a second set of mutations in the amphipathic H1, which is engaged in hydrophobic contacts with the cleft between subdomain 1 and 3 of actin barbed ends, by changing non-polar residues of H1 into polar ones. Remarkably, mutations of two hydrophobic residues into Aspartate (V689D and L693D) virtually abrogated barbed end binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, KcapEps8–WT = 6.5 nM, KcapEps8<italic>Δcap</italic>  = 700 nM), while leaving side binding and bundling properties unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6B, right panels</xref>). We obtained similar results when a construct encompassing the linker, L1, and the four remaining alpha helices, but devoid of H1, Eps8(701–821) was employed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza1">[17]</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Thus, collectively these results demonstrate the absolute requirement of the linker and H1 helix for capping.</p>

<p>We next inspected the sequence encompassing the globular, helical fold (H2–H5). We found a stretch of amino acids, LNKDE (757–761), that shares similarities with a motif, which was identified as critical for mediating the binding and bundling of actin filament of a variety of actin-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Friederich1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Yamamoto1">[39]</xref>, and displays homology with the Villin head-piece domain, which contacts the side of actin filaments (herein referred to as Villin-like motif; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g003">Figure 3C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Hampton1">[40]</xref>. Within this motif, the key residues, essential for mediating the interaction between these proteins and actin, are conserved also in Eps8 (LNKDE), predicting that they may be important for Eps8 side-binding and bundling activities. It was shown previously that full-length Eps8 has bundling activity in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza2">[21]</xref>, presumably due to its ability to dimerize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Kishan1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Kishan2">[42]</xref>. To mimic the oligomeric state of Eps8, we used Eps8(648–821) wild type and mutants fused to dimeric GST. Hydrodynamic analysis performed by size-exclusion chromatography and glycerol gradient sedimentation revealed that the purified GST-Eps8 fragments do not unspecifically aggregate but form, as expected, dimers driven by the GST moiety (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Co-sedimentation assays showed that Eps8(648–821) does not support bundling activity by itself but a GST-tagged construct does (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s005">Figure S5</xref> and see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>). More importantly, a mutant L757A-K759A fused to GST retained close to GST-WT barbed end binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, KcapEps8-WT  = 4 nM, KcapEps8<italic>Δbund</italic>  = 20 nM) but was completely unable to promote bundling of filaments, even when used in the high micromolar range of concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6C, right panels</xref>). Finally, a double GST-fused H1 and Villin-like motif mutant (<italic>ΔcapΔbund</italic>) lost both barbed ends binding and bundling activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, KcapEps8-WT  = 16 nM; KcapEps8<italic>ΔcapΔbund</italic>  = 4 µM). We obtained similar results when the ability of the various GST-Eps8 mutants to form actin bundles was directly visualized by immunofluorescence staining with phalloidin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, collectively these data indicate that the capping activity is primarily mediated by the amphipathic H1 helix, while the globular H2–H5 core is responsible for bundling. These biochemical distinct functions are reflected by the ability of Eps8 to support in vitro reconstituted actin-based motility of N-WASP-functionalized beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Loisel1">[3]</xref>. Actin-based motility can, indeed, be reconstituted in the presence of a minimal set of purified proteins that includes the ARP2/3 complex, Profilin, Cofilin, and Capping Proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Loisel1">[3]</xref>. Accordingly, motility of N-WASP-coated beads was supported by the addition of WT Eps8(648–821) or the bundling defective mutant (Eps8-Δbund) or the minimal capping region H1–H2, but not by the capping deficient Eps8-<italic>Δcap</italic> or the H2–H5 fragment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s011">Videos S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s018">S8</xref>) fused to GST, even if added at micromolar concentrations. Consistently, in vivo analysis indicated that Eps8-<italic>Δcap</italic>, but neither Eps8-<italic>Δbund</italic>, which localized on rocketing tails similarly to WT, nor Eps8-<italic>ΔcapΔbund</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s007">Figure S7</xref>) was no longer able to fully restore the velocity of phosphatidylinositol 4,5-bisphosphate (PIP2)-rich rocketing endomembranes, whose optimal motility depends on Eps8 (SI <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s019">Videos S9</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s023">S13</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza1">[17]</xref>. Additionally, both in spreading mouse embryo fibroblasts and in migratory B16-F1 mouse melanoma cells, Eps8-<italic>Δcap</italic> no longer localized to lamellipodia leading edges but was present throughout the lamellipodial network and enriched in microspikes, which are bundles embedded in lamellipodia that can serve as filopodia precursors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s008">Figure S8</xref>). In contrast, bundling-deficient Eps8 was restricted to the lamellipodial edge. Thus, there is a tight correlation between the capping and bundling activities of Eps8 with architectural and dynamically diverse cellular structures: lamellipodia, which are sites of high actin turnover made of short filaments with numerous barbed ends oriented toward the plasma membrane, versus microspikes/filopodia, which are composed of cross-linked linear, long actin filament bundles.</p>

<p>Next we set out to identify biological processes that might be dependent upon a functional bundling rather than capping activity of Eps8. The residues mutated in the mammalian Eps8 to dissect the capping and the bundling activities in vitro are conserved between mouse and nematodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). Additionally, in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, deletion of the <italic>eps-8</italic> gene leads to altered microvillar and intestinal morphology and intestinal dysfunction, which in turn are responsible for larval lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Croce1">[16]</xref>. In the nematode there are two isoforms of EPS-8, a long one (EPS-8A) and a short one (EPS-8B) that lacks the C-terminal region of the protein where the determinants responsible for interaction with actin are contained. Only the intestinal expression of EPS-8A could rescue both the lethal phenotype and the microvillar defect, whereas the EPS-8B isoform was unable to do so <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Croce1">[16]</xref>, indicating that the intestinal function of Eps8 is mediated by its C-terminal region and, more importantly, allowing the use of the worm as a suitable simplified model to dissect the molecular functions of Eps8.</p>
<p>We engineered mutants of the nematode <italic>eps-8</italic> gene putatively lacking either the capping (EPS-8AΔcap) or the bundling (EPS-8AΔbund) functions. We could confirm that the mutants fused to GST were selectively impaired in their actin barbed end capping and actin bundling activities, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g008">Figure 8A–8B</xref>). A mutant harboring both types of mutations (EPS-8AΔcapΔbund) displayed severe reduction of both capping and bundling activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g008">Figure 8C</xref>).</p>

<p>Next, we generated heterozygous <italic>eps-8</italic> transgenic lines expressing either EPS-8<italic>A</italic>-WT or EPS-8 genes harboring the two mutations (alone or in combination). The mutant proteins localized on the lumina, apical side of the intestine, indistinguishably from the WT protein as judged by morphological analysis and localization with respect to DLG-1::RFP transgene, that encodes for the apical junctional marker Discs, large homolog-1 (DLG-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g008">Figure 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s009">Figure S9B and S9C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Bossinger1">[43]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we have defined the molecular basis through which Eps8 binds to the sides and caps actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Electron microscopy, biochemical, cellular, and mutagenesis studies indicate how distinct portions within the C-terminal region of Eps8 contribute to bind actin. The first region, H1, is crucial for capping, whereas the second region, composed of four alpha helices organized into a globular core (H2–H5), is crucial for bundling. This latter region is connected to H1 via a linker segment. The relatively weak interactions of the H2–H5 globular core and the linker with the actin filament are primarily responsible for the side binding of Eps8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g009">Figure 9B</xref>) while H1 only contributes little to side binding. The flexibility of the linker allows the amphipathic helix H1 to plug into actin's hydrophobic binding pocket at barbed ends, acting as a lock that increases the binding affinity of Eps8 actin binding domain from 10<sup>6</sup> to 10<sup>9</sup> M<sup>−1</sup>, as typically observed for cappers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g009">Figure 9C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Wear2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Yamashita1">[45]</xref>. CP, for instance, adopts a similar mechanism whereby full capping activity is achieved when a flexible domain swings into the hydrophobic pocket, locking barbed ends <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Narita1">[13]</xref>. Thus, the capping activity of Eps8 appears to be determined by a clamp mechanism by which the extended C-terminal Eps8 domain fasten around the barbed end actin unit blocking further filament elongation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000387-g009">Figure 9C</xref>). Within this context, both the side binding of the globular core and the end binding mediated by H1 are spatially coordinated by the linker and contribute to the high affinity interaction of Eps8 to filaments ends (accounting also for the slightly reduced affinity for barbed ends of the bundling-deficient mutants). The flexibility of the linker ensures also a bimodal topological arrangement of Eps8 with respect to either the side or the barbed end of the filaments, reflecting its bundling or capping activities, respectively. These two latter functions of Eps8 can indeed be dissected and consistently exert distinct roles in diverse actin-based processes.</p>

The helical bundle (H2<italic>–</italic>H5) positions in the long grove of the filament, contacting three actin subunits. The amphipathic helix (H1) does not contribute significantly. The H1 binding site may not be fully exposed in filamentous actin. (C) At the barbed ends, the H1 binding site is fully accessible and H1 can bind within the hydrophobic pocket blocking further addition of monomeric actin. (D) A similar arrangement as seen at the barbed end is presumably occurring on monomeric actin, accounting for the sequestering activity of Eps8. In (B–D), two views, related by a 60° counterclockwise rotation around the filament axis, are shown.</p>

<title>The Actin Capping Activity of Eps8 Requires the Amphipathic H1 Helix</title>
<p>Various lines of evidence support the notion that the H1 actin-binding surface of Eps8 is critical for capping, displaying a binding mode similar to WH2 domain: (i) Competition binding studies show that an Eps8 fragment encompassing the entire five terminal α-helices (Eps8 648–821) or the isolated H1–H2, but not H5, can displace the WH2 domain-containing proteins Ciboulot, Thymosin β<sub>4</sub>, and ADF/Cofilin from actin. Binding of these proteins to the hydrophobic pocket between subdomain 1 and 3 of actin is well established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Hertzog1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Chereau1">[46]</xref>. (ii) Mass spectrometry identification of chemically cross-linked peptides of the Eps8:actin complex revealed that K675 and K683 on H1 are in close proximity to K375, a residue of actin in the hydrophobic cleft on subdomain 1. (iii) Helical wheel analysis showed that H1 forms an amphipathic helix which displays the same “signature” of conserved hydrophobic residues as the helix of the WH2 domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Dominguez2">[47]</xref>. (iv) Mutations of the hydrophobic residues in the amphipathic helix H1 cause a significantly reduced capping activity in vitro. Engineered mutants of the nematode <italic>EPS-8</italic> gene lacking H1 also show impaired capping activity. In addition, mutated Eps8 fails to support actin-based motility and to restore PI4,5K-induced vesicle motility when expressed in Eps8 null mouse embryo fibroblasts.</p>
<p>Many actin-binding proteins, including DBP (Vitamin D binding protein), Gelsolin, ADF, the WH2 domain of Ciboulot, VASP, WASP, and WAVE2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Chereau1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Chereau2">[48]</xref>, share similar modes of binding. Notably, they all contact the hydrophobic cleft between subdomains 1 and 3 of actin. Although the morphology of the cleft is likely to change upon filament formation, it is accessible to some extent in both G and F forms of actin. For example, thymosin β<sub>4</sub> binds tightly to the hydrophobic cleft of monomeric actin, sequestering G-actin up to a certain concentration threshold. At higher concentrations, it becomes incorporated into filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Carlier2">[49]</xref>. Structural studies showed that thymosin β<sub>4</sub> binding to F-actin interferes with intra-filament contacts and changes the twist of actin from 2.16 subunits per turn to 2.14 subunits per turn <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Ballweber1">[50]</xref>. We show here that Eps8 can bind G-actin as well as F-actin. Interestingly, Eps8 binding also changes the actin filament twist to 2.14 subunits per turn, indicating that it interferes with intra-filament contacts in a similar fashion as thymosin β<sub>4</sub>.</p>
<p>One of the functions of WH2 domain, such as in the case of Ciboulot, WASP, and N-WASP, is to participate in barbed end assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Dominguez2">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Boquet1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Co1">[52]</xref>. This, however, is not the case for Eps8, which instead tightly caps actin filament barbed ends. This functional difference may be associated with the fact that the WH2 domain of Ciboulot can only bind ATP-actin, in a “profilin-like” mode, whereby detachment of the WH2 domain from the last subunit of a filament takes place following ATP hydrolysis. Conversely, the Eps8 actin-binding region binds both ATP- and ADP-actin, with equivalent affinities. This property may provide a mechanism by which Eps8, upon binding to the barbed end actin via H1, does not dissociate after ATP hydrolysis. This mechanism would allow Eps8 to remain clamped to filaments ends, blocking further actin assembly.</p>

<title>The Globular H2–H5 Helical Lobe Is Responsible for Eps8 Bundling In Vitro and In Vivo</title>
<p>The globular lobe, composed of H2–H5, is primarily responsible for the bundling activity of Eps8 as indicated by the findings that: (i) the isolated H2–H5 domain of Eps8 is sufficient to bind and bundle filamentous actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Funato1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza2">[21]</xref>; (ii) mutations in key conserved residues (from mammalian organisms to <italic>C. elegans</italic>) within this domain (see below) abolished F-actin binding and bundling, while leaving unaffected the ability of the domain to cap actin filaments. In the 3D reconstruction the H2–H5 lobe, which displays no obvious sequence homology with other actin cross-linkers, is located in between three actin subunits of the filament with the major contacts at subdomain 3 of the actin subunit that has H1 bound and with subdomain 4 of the actin subunit below. This is significantly different from other F-actin bundling proteins, such as Fimbrin and Vinculin, which share common actin interacting surfaces, associating along the filament between subdomains 1 and 2 of two adjacent actin protomers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Janssen1">[53]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Galkin1">[57]</xref>. Conversely, the helical lobe of Eps8 binds actin filament mainly through a critical stretch of amino acids (LNKDE), which resembles those identified in the headpiece of Villin (LKKEK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Friederich1">[38]</xref> and in a variety of other actin-binding proteins homologous to villin headpiece <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Yamamoto1">[39]</xref>. Interestingly, EM reconstructions show villin headpiece as well as dematin headpiece binding in a similar location on F-actin as the H2–H5 lobe of Eps8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Chen1">[58]</xref>.</p>
<p>As for the mechanism of Eps8 bundling, it is generally accepted that a protein can bundle actin by cross-linking adjacent filaments through two distinct binding surfaces or through dimerization when it possesses a single F-actin binding site. Alternatively, since actin filaments are poly-electrolytes, proteins rich in basic residues (such as small molecules or proteins like calponin, EF1alpha, MARCKS, the monomeric C-terminal domain of cortexillin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Tang1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Stock1">[60]</xref>) can, by associating to the sides of actin filaments, neutralize the repulsive charges of the actin polymer driving bundling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Tang2">[61]</xref>. In the case of Eps8, this latter possibility is unlikely since the minimal, isolated actin binding region, 648–821 (cleaved from the GST moiety) displays little if no bundling activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000387.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Conversely, both GST-tagged Eps8(648–821) and full-length Eps8, in the absence of GST tag, can dimerize in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Hampton1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Kishan1">[41]</xref> and possesses bundling activity in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza2">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, this latter activity is significantly enhanced by association of Eps8 with IRSp53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza2">[21]</xref>, whose ability to dimerize through its IMD domain has been documented both by in vitro structural studies and in vivo experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Millard1">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Suetsugu1">[64]</xref>. Thus, we propose that Eps8 cross-links actin filaments by forming homo- or hetero-dimers (in this latter case, with IRSp53).</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Correlating Dual Role of Eps8 Modes of Actin-Binding from In Vitro to In Vivo</title>
<p>Here we have provided evidence that two segregated actin binding domains confer Eps8 with bimodal functionality: capping and bundling. We had previously shown that this duality is regulated in the context of the full-length protein by activation of different effectors (IRSp53 and ABI1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Funato1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza2">[21]</xref>). Our data support the notion that this bimodal functionality in the context of one single protein can be dissected and exert independent, cell- and tissue-specific roles.</p>
<p>The bundling but not the capping function of Eps8 is presumably essential for the proper structural organization of gut microvilli, which are composed of parallel, highly cross-linked actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Bartles1">[65]</xref>. Importantly, the role of Eps8 in the intestine is conserved also in mice, where Eps8 genetic removal disrupts intestinal morphology leading to reduced fat absorption, calorie restriction, and improved metabolic status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Tocchetti1">[66]</xref>. Filament side binding and bundling of Eps8 are also critical to direct the protein to microspikes. This is consistent with the role of Eps8 (together with IRSp53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza2">[21]</xref>) in filopodia formation and also suggests that Eps8 through its cross-linking properties may be generally implicated in the regulation of highly dynamic structures composed of parallel actin bundles.</p>
<p>The capping activity instead is required to reconstitute actin-based rocketing motility in vitro and for optimal velocity of intracellular pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Disanza1">[17]</xref> or PIP2-rich endomembranes in vivo; to restrict localization of Eps8 to the leading edge of the cell in migratory cells; and to control the number of axonal filopodia in primary hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Menna1">[30]</xref>. In these latter cells, Eps8 acts, like capping proteins CP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Mejillano1">[67]</xref>, by negatively regulating, through barbed end binding, the filament lengths of the actin networks from which filopodia then arise.</p>
<p>Finally, the role of Eps8 as a bifunctional actin remodeller further suggests that this protein by controlling various actin-based protrusions regulates optimal cell locomotion both in physiological and in pathological contexts, such as during tumor development. In keeping with this latter possibility, Eps8 has been reported to be unregulated in a variety of tumor types and to be specifically required for optimal cell migration and invasion in a subset of metastatic oral squamous carcinoma cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Yap1">[68]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Wang1">[69]</xref>. Whether the capping or bundling activities are critical for Eps8 to exert this pro-invasive functions remains to be tested. However, the availability of Eps8 mutants specifically impaired in either one of its actin-related functions will be instrumental in addressing this issue and certainly worthy to be investigated.</p>

The first step of the procedure is the selection of overlapping boxes containing short helical segments. A box size of 80×80 pixels with a 0.54 nm pixel size was used. This corresponds to about 15 asymmetric units of the helix, a little over one actin crossover. An overlap of 60 pixels was chosen, allowing every asymmetric unit to contribute to four different views of the helix. A total of 36,550 units contributed to the average. The twist of the reconstruction refines to 2.14 subunits per turn, which corresponds to a rotation of −168° between symmetry neighbors along the short-pitch helix. Control reconstructions of F-actin alone were also calculated resulting in a twist of 2.16 subunits per turn, a rotation of −166.66°.

According to the equation: K<sub>app</sub>  =  K<sub>T</sub><sup>0</sup>(1+[Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821)]/K<sub>Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821)</sub>) where K<sub>app</sub> is the binding constant of the Thymosin β4 in presence of the indicated concentration of Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821), K<sub>T</sub><sup>0</sup> is the binding constant of the Thymosin β4 in absence of Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821) and K<sub>Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821)</sub>, the binding constant of Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821). We can approximate a Kd of ∼3 µM for Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821), at high concentration of salt. (B) <italic>The fragment H1–H2 is sufficient to compete with Thymosin β4 for binding to monomeric actin</italic>. The change in fluorescence of 1.5 µM AEDANS-labeled-actin was measured at increasing concentrations of Thymosin β4 and 0, 10, or 15 µM of H1<italic>–</italic>H2 in presence of 0.1 M KCl and 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>. In these conditions, the Kd of Thymosin β4 is 3 µM, and the K<sub>app</sub> (K apparent) are 6 µM and 11 µM in the presence of 10 µM and 15 µM of H1<italic>–</italic>H2, respectively. As described above for Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821), we can approximate a Kd of ∼3 µM for H1<italic>–</italic>H2 at high concentration of salt. Please note that under the conditions described above, we could not obtain reliable results using H5 and in the presence or absence of Thymosin β4 likely due to the low affinity of H5 for AEDANS-actin. (C) <italic>Limited proteolysis of the C-terminal Eps8 fragment</italic>. Eps8(648<italic>–</italic>821) (0.5 mg/ml) was digested with chymotrypsin (C), trypsin (T), Elastase (EL), and proteinase K (PK) at the dilution 1/10,000 I in the buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5; 50 mM NaCl; 1 mM DTT) for the indicated time at room temperature. Digestion was terminated by the addition of phenylmethylsulfonyl fluoride (1 mM). Aliquots of the protelytic peptides were resolved by SDS-PAGE and stained with Coomassie Blue. The proteolytic-resistant fragments, indicated by boxes, were subjected to N-terminal sequencing. The resulting amino acid sequence is reported at the bottom.</p>

(C) A Villin-like motif is conserved in EPS8 and its family members. Sequence alignment of a Villin-like motif of Eps8 from various species and of murine Eps8L1 and Eps8L2 with Villin headpiece domain. The key residues, which have been shown to be critical for mediating actin binding and bundling of Villin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Wiesner1">[2]</xref> and Eps8 family members, are highlighted. Abbreviations: Hs, homo sapien; Mm, Mus Musclus; Xl, Xenopous leavis; Ce, Caernorabditis elegans. It must be pointed out that due to limited similarity between the C-terminal region of Eps8 and the Villin HeadPiece domain, a simple comparison of primary sequences does not allow the identification of additional conserved key residues. However, we inspected in greater detail the ternary structure of Eps8 C-terminus and Villin Headpiece and found a number of similarities. More specifically, the residues R771, R763, and K759 (which is mutated to A in Eps8Dbund mutant) of Eps8 C-terminus are in a position structurally equivalent (i.e. they form a positively charged surface presumably facing the actin filament) to those forming the positively charged “crown” in the VillinHP structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-Loisel1">[3]</xref>, namely K65, K71, and F73, and implicated in the binding to F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-McGough1">[4]</xref>. Additionally, the residue forming the “hydrophobic cap,” W64, can be provided by P767 of Eps8, while L757 (which was mutated to A in Eps8 C-terminus) is in the same structural position of the Phenylalanine at position 76 of the VillinHP; mutation of the latter residue has been shown to lower the binding to F-actin by more than 80% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000387-McGough1">[4]</xref>. These observations suggest that Eps8 and Villin may indeed share a similar mode of interaction with actin filaments.</p>
