<abstract>
<p>Breast cancer is the most common malignancy in women and is responsible for hundreds of thousands of deaths annually. As with most cancers, it is a heterogeneous disease and different breast cancer subtypes are treated differently. Understanding the difference in prognosis for breast cancer based on its molecular and phenotypic features is one avenue for improving treatment by matching the proper treatment with molecular subtypes of the disease. In this work, we employed a competition-based approach to modeling breast cancer prognosis using large datasets containing genomic and clinical information and an online real-time leaderboard program used to speed feedback to the modeling team and to encourage each modeler to work towards achieving a higher ranked submission. We find that machine learning methods combined with molecular features selected based on expert prior knowledge can improve survival predictions compared to current best-in-class methodologies and that ensemble models trained across multiple user submissions systematically outperform individual models within the ensemble. We also find that model scores are highly consistent across multiple independent evaluations. This study serves as the pilot phase of a much larger competition open to the whole research community, with the goal of understanding general strategies for model optimization using clinical and molecular profiling data and providing an objective, transparent system for assessing prognostic models.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>We developed an extensible software framework for sharing molecular prognostic models of breast cancer survival in a transparent collaborative environment and subjecting each model to automated evaluation using objective metrics. The computational framework presented in this study, our detailed post-hoc analysis of hundreds of modeling approaches, and the use of a novel cutting-edge data resource together represents one of the largest-scale systematic studies to date assessing the factors influencing accuracy of molecular-based prognostic models in breast cancer. Our results demonstrate the ability to infer prognostic models with accuracy on par or greater than previously reported studies, with significant performance improvements by using state-of-the-art machine learning approaches trained on clinical covariates. Our results also demonstrate the difficultly in incorporating molecular data to achieve substantial performance improvements over clinical covariates alone. However, improvement was achieved by combining clinical feature data with intelligent selection of important molecular features based on domain-specific prior knowledge. We observe that ensemble models aggregating the information across many diverse models achieve among the highest scores of all models and systematically out-perform individual models within the ensemble, suggesting a general strategy for leveraging the wisdom of crowds to develop robust predictive models.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Breast cancer remains the most common malignancy in females, with more than 200,000 cases of invasive breast cancer diagnosed in the United States annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Cancer1">[1]</xref>. Molecular profiling research in the last decade has revealed breast cancer to be a heterogeneous disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Perou1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kristensen1">[4]</xref>, motivating the development of molecular classifiers of breast cancer sub-types to influence diagnosis, prognosis, and treatment.</p>
<p>In 2002, a research study reported a molecular predictor of breast cancer survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-VanDeVijver1">[5]</xref> based on analysis of gene expression profiles from 295 breast cancer patients with 5 year clinical follow-up. Based on these results, two independent companies developed the commercially available MammaPrint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-VanTVeer1">[6]</xref> and Oncotype DX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Paik1">[7]</xref> assays, which have both been promising in augmenting risk prediction compared to models based only on clinical data. However, their role in clinical decision-making is still being debated.</p>
<p>Based on the success of these initial molecular profiles, a large number of additional signatures have been proposed to identify markers of breast cancer tumor biology that may affect clinical outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-GlinskyG1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Valastyan1">[13]</xref>. Meta-analyses indicate that many of them perform very similarly in terms of risk prediction, and can often be correlated with markers of cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Wirapati1">[14]</xref>, a well-known predictor of patient outcome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Elston1">[15]</xref>, especially for ER+ tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Sotiriou1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Naderi1">[17]</xref>. Therefore, it is much more challenging to identify signatures that provide additional independent and more specific risk prediction performance once accounting for proliferation and clinical factors. Recent studies have even suggested that most random subsets of genes are significantly associated with breast cancer survival, and that the majority (60%) of 48 published signatures did not perform significantly better than models built from the random subsets of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Venet1">[18]</xref>. Correcting for the confounding effect of proliferation based on an expression marker of cell proliferation removes most of the signal from the 48 published signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Venet1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>The difficulties in reaching community consensus regarding the best breast cancer prognosis signatures illustrates a more intrinsic problem whereby researchers are responsible for both developing a model and comparing its performance against alternatives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Norel1">[19]</xref>. This phenomenon has been deemed the “self-assessment trap”, referring to the tendency of researchers to unintentionally or intentionally report results favorable to their model. Such self-assessment bias may arise, for example, by choosing assessment statistics for which their model is likely to perform well, selective reporting of performance in the modeling niche where their method is superior, or increased care or expertise in optimizing performance of their method compared to others.</p>
<p>In this work, we explore the use of a research strategy of collaborative competitions as a way to overcome the self-assessment trap. In particular, the competitive component formally separates model development from model evaluation and provides a transparent and objective mechanism for ranking models. The collaborative component allows models to evolve and improve through knowledge sharing, and thereby emphasizes correct and insightful science as the primary objective of the study.</p>
<p>The concept of collaborative competitions is not without precedent and is most evident in crowd-sourcing efforts for harnessing the competitive instincts of a community. Netflix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Bennett1">[20]</xref> and X-Prize <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-X1">[21]</xref> were two early successes in online hosting of data challenges. Commercial initiatives such as Kaggle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kaggle1">[22]</xref> and Innocentive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Innocentive1">[23]</xref> have hosted many successful online modeling competitions in astronomy, insurance, medicine, and other data-rich disciplines. The MAQC-II project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Shi1">[24]</xref> employed blinded evaluations and standardized datasets in the context of a large consortium-based research study to assess modeling factors related to prediction accuracy across 13 different phenotypic endpoints. Efforts such as CASP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Moult1">[25]</xref>, DREAM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-The1">[26]</xref>, and CAFA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Radivojac1">[27]</xref> have created communities around key scientific challenges in structural biology, systems biology, and protein function prediction, respectively. In all cases it has been observed that the best crowd-sourced models usually outperform state-of-the-art off-the-shelf methods.</p>
<p>Despite their success in achieving models with improved performance, existing resources do not provide a general solution for hosting open-access crowd-sourced collaborative competitions due to two primary factors. First, most systems provide participants with a training dataset and require them to submit a vector of predictions for evaluation in the held-out dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Bennett1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kaggle1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Shi1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-The1">[26]</xref>, often requiring (only) the winning team to submit a description of their method and sometimes source code to verify reproducibility. While this achieves the goal of objectively assessing models, we believe it fails to achieve an equally important goal of developing a transparent community resource where participants work openly to collaboratively share and evolve models. We overcome this problem by developing a system where participants submit models as re-runnable source code by implementing a simple programmatic API consisting of a train and predict method. Second, some existing systems are designed primarily to leverage crowd-sourcing to develop models for a commercial partner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kaggle1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Innocentive1">[23]</xref> who pays to run the competition and provides a prize to the developer of the best-performing model. Although we support this approach as a creative and powerful method for advancing commercial applications, such a system imposes limitations on the ability of participants to share models openly as well as intellectual property restrictions on the use of models. We overcome this problem by making all models available to the community through an open source license.</p>
<p>In this study, we formed a research group consisting of scientists from 5 institutions across the United States and conducted a collaborative competition to assess the accuracy of prognostic models of breast cancer survival. This research group, called the Federation, was set up as a mechanism for advancing collaborative research projects designed to demonstrate the benefit of team-oriented science. The rest of our group consisted of the organizers of the DREAM project, the Oslo team from the Norwegian Breast Cancer study, and leaders of the Molecular Taxonomy of Breast Cancer International Consortium (METABRIC), who provided a novel dataset consisting of nearly 2,000 breast cancer samples with median 10-year follow-up, detailed clinical information, and genome-wide gene expression and copy number profiling data. In order to create an independent dataset for assessing model consistency, the Oslo team generated novel copy number data on an additional 102 samples (the MicMa cohort), which was combined with gene expression and clinical data for the same samples that was previously put in the public domain by the same research group <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kristensen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Naume1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>The initial study using the METABRIC data focused on unsupervised molecular sub-class discovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Curtis1">[29]</xref>. Although some of the reported sub-classes do correlate with survival, the goal of this initial work was not to build prognostic models. Indeed, the models developed in the current study provide more accurate survival predictions than those trained using molecular sub-classes reported in the original work. Therefore, the current study represents the first large-scale attempt to assess prognostic models based on a dataset of this scale and quality of clinical information.</p>
<p>The contributions of this work are two-fold. First, we conducted a detailed post-hoc analysis of all submitted models to determine model characteristics related to prognostic accuracy. Second, we report the development of a novel computational system for hosting community-based collaborative competitions, providing a generalizable framework for participants to build and evaluate transparent, re-runnable, and extensible models. Further, we suggest elements of study design, dataset characteristics, and evaluation criteria used to assess whether the results of a competition-style research study improve on standard approaches. We stress that the transparency enabled by making source code available and providing objective pre-defined scoring criteria allow researchers in future studies to verify reproducibility, improve on our findings, and assess their generalizability in future applications. Thus the results and computational system developed in this work serve as a pilot study for an open community-based competition on prognostic models of breast cancer survival. More generally, we believe this study will serve as the basis for additional competition-based research projects in the future, with the goal of promoting increased transparency and objectivity in genomics research (and other applications) and providing an open framework to collaboratively evolve complex models leading to patient benefit, beyond the sum of the individual efforts, by leveraging the wisdom of crowds.</p>

<title>Competition dataset characteristics</title>
<p>We used the METABRIC dataset as the basis of evaluating prognostic models in this study. This dataset contains a total of nearly 2,000 breast cancer samples. 980 of these samples (excluding those with missing survival information) were available for the duration of the collaborative competition phase of this study. An additional 988 samples became available after we had concluded our evaluation in the initial dataset and, fortunately, served as a large additional dataset for assessing the consistency of our findings. For each sample, the dataset contains median 10 year follow-up, 16 clinical covariates (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003047-t001">Table 1</xref>), and genome-wide gene expression and copy number profiling data, normalized as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Curtis1">[29]</xref>, resulting in 48,803 gene expression features and 31,685 copy number features summarized at the gene level (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

<p>Initial analysis was performed to confirm that the data employed in the competition were consistent with previously published datasets and to identify potential confounding factors such as internal subclasses. Data-driven, unsupervised hierarchical clustering of gene expression levels revealed the heterogeneity of the data and suggested that multiple subclasses do exist (not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Curtis1">[29]</xref>. However, for the current analysis we decided to focus on the well established separation into basal, luminal, and HER2 positive subclasses, as previously defined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Perou1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Srlie1">[30]</xref>. These subclasses are known to closely match clinical data in the following way: most triple-negative samples belong to the basal subclass; most ER positive samples belong to the luminal subclass; and most ER negative HER2 positive samples belong to the HER2 subclass. To ensure that this holds in the current dataset, the 50 genes that best separate the molecular subclasses in the Perou dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Prat1">[31]</xref> (PAM50) were used for hierarchical clustering of the METABRIC data and compared with a similar clustering of the Perou dataset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The results of the supervised clustering reveal similar subclasses with similar gene expression signatures as those presented by Perou et al, and were also consistent with the clinical definitions as presented above. Finally, the 3 subclasses show a distinct separation in their Kaplan-Meier overall survival plots for the three subtypes defined by the clinical data, where the HER2 subclass has the worst prognosis, followed by the basal subclass, and the luminal subclass has the best prognosis, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This analysis shows that sub-classification based on ER (IHC), PR (gene expression), and HER2 (copy number) should capture the major confounding factors that may be introduced by the heterogeneity of the disease.</p>

<p>(A) Comparison of hierarchical clustering of METABRIC data (left panel) and Perou data (right panel). Hierarchical clustering on the gene expression data of the PAM50 genes in both datasets reveals a similar gene expression pattern that separates into several subclasses. Although several classes are apparent, they are consistent with sample assignment into basal-like, Her2-enriched and luminal subclasses in the Perou data. Similarly, in the METABRIC data the subclasses are consistent with the available clinical data for triple-negative, ER and PR status, and HER2 positive. (B) Kaplan-Meier plot for subclasses. The METABRIC test dataset was separated into 3 major subclasses according to clinical features. The subclasses were determined by the clinical features: triple negative (red); ER or PR positive status (blue); and HER2 positive with ER and PR negative status (green). The survival curve was estimated using a standard Kaplan-Meier curve, and shows the expected differences in overall survival between the subclasses. (C,D) Kaplan-Meier curve by grade and histology. The test dataset was separated by tumor grade (subplot C; grade 1 – red, grade 2 – green, grade 3- blue), or by histology (subplot D; Infilitrating Lobular – red, Infiltrating Ductal – yellow, Medullary –green, Mixed Histology – blue, or Mucinous - purple). The survival curves were estimated using a standard Kaplan-Meier curve, and show the expected differences in overall survival for the clinical features.</p>

To demonstrate that the competition data is consistent in this respect, a Cox proportional hazard model was fit to the overall survival (OS) of all patients using each one of the clinical covariates individually. As expected, the most predictive single clinical features are the tumor size, age at diagnosis, PR status, and presence of lymph node metastases (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003047-t001">Table 1</xref>). To assess the redundancy of the clinical variables, an additional multivariable Cox proportional hazard model was fit to the overall survival (OS) of all patients using all clinical features. The remaining statistically significant covariates were patient age at diagnosis (the most predictive feature), followed by tumor size, presence of lymph node metastases, and whether the patient received hormone therapy.</p>

<p>Analysis of the relative performance among model categories suggested interesting patterns related to criteria influencing model performance. The traditional method for predicting outcome is Cox regression on the clinical features <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Clark1">[32]</xref>. This model, which used only clinical features, served as our baseline, and obtained a concordance index of 0.6347 on the validation set. Models trained on the clinical covariates using state-of-the-art machine learning methods (elastic net, lasso, random forest, boosting) achieved notable performance improvements over the baseline Cox regression model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g002">Figure 2</xref>, category ‘C’).</p>
<p>Two submitted models were built by naively inputting all molecular features into machine learning algorithms (i.e. using all gene expression and CNA features and no clinical features). These models (our category ‘M’) both performed significantly worse than the baseline clinical model (median concordance index of 0.5906). Given that our training set contains over 80,000 molecular features and only 500 training samples, this result highlights the challenges related to overfitting due to the imbalance between the number of features and number of samples, also known as the curse of dimensionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Friedman1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Jain1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Models trained using molecular feature data combined with clinical data (category ‘MC’) outperformed the baseline clinical model in 10 out of 28 (36%) submissions, suggesting there is some difficulty in the naïve incorporation of molecular feature data compared to using only clinical information. In fact, the best MC model attributed lower weights to molecular compared to clinical features by rank-transforming all the features (molecular and clinical) and training an elastic net model, imposing a penalty only on the molecular features and not on the clinical ones, such that the clinical features are always included in the trained model. This model achieved a concordance index of 0.6593, slightly better than the best-performing clinical only model.</p>
<p>One of the most successful approaches to addressing the curse of dimensionality in genomics problems has been to utilize domain-specific prior knowledge to pre-select features more likely to be associated with the phenotype of interest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Ideker1">[35]</xref>. Indeed, the majority of submitted models (66 of 110, 60%) utilized a strategy of pre-selecting features based on external prior knowledge. Interestingly, analysis of model submission dates indicates that participants first attempted naïve models incorporating all molecular features, and after achieving small performance improvements over clinical only models, evolved to incorporate prior information as the dominant modeling strategy in the later phase of the competition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This observation is consistent with previous reports highlighting the importance of real-time feedback in motivating participants to build continuously improving models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Athanasopoulos1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>All models trained on only the molecular features (i.e. excluding the clinical features) and incorporating prior knowledge (MP category) performed worse than the baseline model, with the highest concordance index being 0.5947, further highlighting the difficultly in using molecular information alone to improve prognostic accuracy compared to clinical data.</p>
<p>Twenty-four models outperformed the baseline by combining clinical features with molecular features selected by prior knowledge (MPC category). The overall best-performing model attained a concordance index of 0.6707 by training a machine learning method (boosted regression) on a combination of: 1) clinical features; 2) expression levels of genes selected based on both data driven criteria and prior knowledge of their involvement in breast cancer (the MASP feature selection strategy, as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>); 3) an aggregated “genomic instability” index calculated from the copy number data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>The wide range of concordance index scores for models in the MPC category raises the question of whether the improved performance of the best MPC models are explained by the biological relevance of the selected features or simply by random fluctuations in model scores when testing many feature sets. Due to the uncontrolled experimental design inherent in accepting unconstrained model submissions, additional evaluations are needed to assess the impact of different modeling choices in a controlled experimental design. We describe the results of this experiment next.</p>

<title>Controlled experiment for model evaluation</title>
<p>We analyzed the modeling strategies utilized in the original “uncontrolled” model submission phase and designed a “controlled” experiment to assess the associations of different modeling choices with model performance. We determined that most models developed in the uncontrolled experiment could be described as the combination of a machine learning method with a feature selection strategy. We therefore tested models trained using combinations of a discrete set of machine learning methods crossed with feature selection strategies using the following experimental design:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p>We designed 15 categories of models based on the choice of features used in each model based on the following design:</p>
<list list-type="alpha-lower"><list-item>
<p>We chose 6 strategies for pre-selecting feature subsets as developed in the uncontrolled phase (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003047-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>We created 6 additional model categories consisting of each feature subset plus all clinical covariates.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>We created an additional model category using only clinical covariates.</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>We created 2 additional categories incorporating the genomic instability index (GII), which was a component of the best-performing model in the uncontrolled phase. We used GII in additional to all clinical covariates, as well as GII in addition to all clinical covariates and the additional features used in the best-performing model (MASP) from the uncontrolled experiment. We note that since GII is only a single feature we did not train models using GII alone.</p>
</list-item></list>
</list-item><list-item>
<p>For each of the 15 feature selection strategies described above, we trained 4 separate models using the machine learning algorithms that were frequently applied and demonstrated good performance in the uncontrolled experiment: boosting, random survival forest, lasso, and elastic net.</p>

<p>We constructed a series of ensemble learning algorithms by computing concordance index scores after averaging the rank predictions of subsets of models. Models trained using ensemble strategies included:</p>

<p>This experiment design resulted in a total of 60 models based on combinations of modeling strategies from the uncontrolled experiment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003047.s005">Table S4</xref>), plus 20 models using ensemble strategies. This controlled experimental design allowed us to assess the effect of different modeling choices while holding other factors constant.</p>
<p>Following an approach suggested in the MAQC-II study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Shi1">[24]</xref>, we designed negative and positive control experiments to infer bounds on model performance in prediction problems for which models should perform poorly and well, respectively. As a negative control, we randomly permuted the sample labels of the survival data, for both the training and test datasets, and computed the concordance index of each model trained and tested on the permuted data. To evaluate how the models would perform on a relatively easy prediction task, we conducted a positive control experiment in which all models were used to predict the ER status of the patients based on selected molecular features (excluding the ER expression measurement). We found that all negative control models scored within a relatively tight range of concordance indices centered around 0.5 (minimum: 0.468, maximum: 0.551), significantly lower than the lowest concordance index (0.575) of any model trained on the real data in this experiment. Conversely, all ER-prediction models scored highly (minimum: 0.79, maximum: 0.969), suggesting that the scores achieved by our survival models (maximum: 0.6707) are not due to a general limitation of the selected modeling strategies but rather the difficulty of modeling breast cancer survival.</p>
<p>Overall, we found that the predictive performance of the controlled experiment models (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g003">Figure 3A</xref>) was significantly dependent on the individual feature sets (<italic>P</italic> = 1.02e-09, F-test), and less dependent on the choice of the statistical learning algorithm (<italic>P</italic> = 0.23, F-test). All model categories using clinical covariates outperformed all model categories trained excluding clinical covariates, based on the average score across the 4 learning algorithms. The best-performing model category selected features based on marginal correlation with survival, further highlighting the difficulty in purely data-driven approaches, and the need to incorporate prior knowledge to overcome the curse of dimensionality.</p>

<p>The best-performing model used a random survival forest algorithm trained by combining the clinical covariates with a single additional aggregate feature, called the genomic instability index (GII), calculated as the proportion of amplified or deleted sites based on the copy number data. This result highlights the importance of evaluating models using a controlled experimental design, as the best-performing method in the uncontrolled experiment combined clinical variables with GII in addition to selected gene expression features (clinical variables plus only GII was not evaluated), and the controlled experiment pointed to isolating GII as the modeling insight associated with high prediction accuracy.</p>
<p>The random survival forest trained using clinical covariates and GII was significantly better than a random survival forest trained using clinical covariates alone (<italic>P</italic> = 2e-12 by paired Wilcoxon signed rank test based on 100 bootstrap samples with replacement from the test dataset). We also tested if inclusion of the GII feature improved model performance beyond a score that could be obtained by chance based on random selection of features. We trained 100 random survival forest models and 100 boosting models, each utilizing clinical information in addition to random selections of 50 molecular features (corresponding to the number of features used based on the MASP strategy, which achieved the highest score of all feature selection methods). The best-performing model from our competition (trained using clinical covariates and GII) achieved a higher score than each of these 100 models for both learning algorithms (<italic>P</italic>&lt; = .01).</p>
<p>The use of the aggregate GII feature was based on previous reports demonstrating the association between GII and poor prognosis breast cancer subtypes like Luminal B, HER2+ and Basal-like tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kwei1">[37]</xref>. We found that HER2+ tumors had the strongest association with the GII score (<italic>P</italic> = 1.65e-12, t-test) which partly explains why it performs so well considering none of the patients were treated with compounds that target the HER2 pathway (e.g. Herceptin). Samples with high GII scores were also associated with high-grade tumors (<italic>P</italic> = 7.13e-13, t-test), further strengthening its credential as a good survival predictor. However, despite these strong associations, the genomic instability index provided an added value to the strength of predictions even as clinical covariates histologic grade and HER2 status are used in the models.</p>
<p>Boosting was the best-performing method on average. Elastic net and lasso exhibited stable performance across many feature sets. Random survival forests performed very well when trained on a small number of features based on clinical information and the genomic instability index. However, their performance decreased substantially with the inclusion of large molecular feature sets.</p>
<p>Ensemble methods trained by averaging predicted ranks across multiple methods systematically performed better than the average concordance index scores of the models contained in the ensemble, consistent with previously reported results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Marbach1">[38]</xref>. Strikingly, an ensemble method aggregating all 60 models achieved a concordance index score of .654, significantly greater than the average of all model scores (.623) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The ensemble performed better than the average model score for each of 100 resampled collections of 60 models each, using bootstrapping to sample with replacement from all 60 models (<italic>P</italic>&lt; = .01). The ensemble model scored better than 52 of the 60 (87%) models that constituted the ensemble. We note that 2 of the algorithms (boosting and random forests) utilize ensemble learning strategies on their own. For both of the other 2 algorithms (lasso and elastic net) the method trained on an ensemble of the 15 feature sets scored higher than each of the 15 models trained on the individual feature sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Consistent with previous reports, the systematic outperformance of ensemble models compared to their constituent parts suggests that ensemble approaches effectively create a consensus that enhances the biologically meaningful signals captured by multiple modeling approaches. As previously suggested in the context of the DREAM project <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Marbach1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Prill2">[41]</xref>, our finding further reinforces the notion that crowd-sourced collaborative competitions are a powerful framework for developing robust predictive models by training an ensemble model aggregated across diverse strategies employed by participants.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Consistency of results in independent datasets</title>
<p>In the first round of the competition, we did not restrict the number of models a participant could submit. This raises the possibility of model overfitting to the test set used to provide real-time feedback. We therefore used 2 additional datasets to evaluate the consistency of our findings. The first dataset, which we called METABRIC2, consisted of the 988 samples (excluding those with missing survival data) from the METABRIC cohort that were not used in either the training dataset or the test dataset used for real-time evaluation. The second dataset, called MicMa, consisted of 102 samples with gene expression, clinical covariates, and survival data available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kristensen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Naume1">[28]</xref> and copy number data presented in the current study (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We used the models from our controlled experiment, which were trained on the original 500 METABRIC samples, and evaluated the concordance index of the survival predictions of each model compared to observed survival in both METABRIC2 and MicMa.</p>
<p>The concordance index scores across models from the original evaluation were highly consistent in both METABRIC2 and MicMa. The 60 models evaluated in the controlled experiment (15 feature sets used in 4 learning algorithms) had Pearson correlations of .87 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1e-10) compared to METABRIC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) and .76 (<italic>P</italic>&lt;1e-10) compared to MicMa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), although we note that p-values may be over-estimated due to smaller effective sample sizes due to non-independence of modeling strategies. Model performance was also strongly correlated for each different algorithm across the feature sets for both METABRIC2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) and MicMa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003047-g004">Figure 4D</xref>).</p>

<p>Consistent with results from the original experiment, the top scoring model, based on average concordance index of the METABRIC2 and MicMa scores, was a random survival forest trained using clinical features in combination with the GII. The second best model corresponded to the best model from the uncontrolled experiment (3<sup>rd</sup> best model in the controlled experiment), and used clinical data in combination with GII and the MASP feature selection strategy, and was trained using a boosting algorithm. A random forest trained using only clinical data achieve the 3<sup>rd</sup> highest score. The top 39 models all incorporated clinical data.</p>
<p>As an additional comparison, we generated survival predictions based on published procedures used in the clinically approved MammaPrint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-VanTVeer1">[6]</xref> and Oncotype DX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Paik1">[7]</xref> assays. We note that these assays are designed specifically for early stage, invasive, lymph node negative breast cancers (in addition ER+ in the case of Oncotype DX) and use different scores calculated from gene expression data measured on distinct platforms. It is thus difficult to reproduce exactly the predictions provided by these assays or to perform a fair comparison to the present methods on a dataset that includes samples from the whole spectrum of breast tumors. The actual Oncotype DX score is calculated from RT-PCR measurements of the mRNA levels of 21 genes. Using z-score normalized gene expression values from METABRIC2 and MicMa datasets, together with their published weights, we recalculated Oncotype DX scores in an attempt to reproduce the actual scores as closely as possible. We then scored the resulting predictions against the two datasets and obtained concordance indices of 0.6064 for METABRIC2 and 0.5828 for MicMa, corresponding to the 81<sup>st</sup> ranked model based on average concordance index out of all 97 models tested, including ensemble models and Oncotype DX and MammaPrint feature sets incorporated in all learning algorithms (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003047.s006">Table S5</xref>). Similarly, the actual MammaPrint score is calculated based on microarray gene expression measurements, with each patient's score determined by the correlation of the expression of 70 specific genes to the average expression of these genes in patients with good prognosis (defined as those who have no distant metastases for more than five years, ER+ tumors, age less than 55 years old, tumor size less than 5 cm, and are lymph node negative). Because of limitations in the data, we were not able to compute this score in exactly the same manner as the original assay (we did not have the metastases free survival time, and some of the other clinical features were not present in the validation datasets). We estimated the average gene expression profile for the 70 MammaPrint genes based on all patients who lived longer than five years (with standardized gene expression data), then computed each patient's score as their correlation to this average good prognosis profile. We scored the predictions against the two validation datasets and observed concordance indices of 0.602 in METABRIC2 and 0.598 in MicMa, corresponding to the 78<sup>th</sup> ranked out of 97 models based on average concordance index.</p>
<p>We were able to significantly improve the scores associated with both MammaPrint and Oncotype DX by incorporating the gene expression features utilized by each assay as feature selection criteria in our prediction pipelines. We trained each of the 4 machine learning algorithms with clinical features in addition to gene lists from MammaPrint and Oncotype DX. The best-performing models would have achieved the 8<sup>th</sup> and 26<sup>th</sup> best scores, respectively, based on average concordance index in METABRIC2 and MicMa. We note that using the ensemble strategy of combining the 4 algorithms, the model trained using Mammaprint genes and clinical data performed better than clinical data alone, and achieved the 5<sup>th</sup> highest average model score, including the top score in METABRIC2, slightly (.005 concordance index difference) better than the random forest model using clinical data combined with GII, though only the 17<sup>st</sup> ranked score in MicMa. This result suggests that incorporating the gene expression features identified by these clinically implemented assays into the prediction pipeline described here may improve prediction accuracy compared to current analysis protocols.</p>
<p>An ensemble method, aggregating results across all learning algorithms and feature sets, performed better than 71 of the 76 models (93%) that constituted the ensemble, consistent with our finding that the ensemble strategy achieves performance among the top individual approaches. For the 19 feature selection strategies used in the METABRIC2 and MicMa evaluations, an ensemble model combining the results of the 4 learning algorithms performed better than the average of the 4 learning algorithms in 36 out of 38 cases (95%). Also consistent with our previous result, for both algorithms that did not use ensemble strategies themselves (elastic net and lasso), an ensemble model aggregating results across the 19 feature sets performed better than each of the individual 19 feature sets for both METABRIC2 and MicMa. Taken together, the independent evaluations in 2 additional datasets are consistent with the conclusions drawn from the original real-time feedback phase of the completion, regarding improvements gained from ensemble strategies and the relative performance of models.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>“Precision Medicine”, as defined by the Institute of Medicine Report last year, proposes a world where medical decisions will be guided by molecular markers that ensure therapies are tailored to the patients who receive them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Toward1">[42]</xref>. Moving towards this futuristic vision of cancer medicine requires systematic approaches that will help ensure that predictive models of cancer phenotypes are both clinically meaningful and robust to technical and biological sources of variation.</p>
<p>Despite isolated successful developments of molecular diagnostic and personalized medicine applications, such approaches have not translated to routine adoption in standard-of-care protocols. Even in applications where successful molecular tests have been developed, such as breast cancer prognosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-VanDeVijver1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-VanTVeer1">[6]</xref>, a plethora of research studies have claimed to develop models with improved predictive performance. Much of this failure has been attributed to “difficulties in reproducibility, expense, standardization and proof of significance beyond current protocols” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Zoon1">[43]</xref>. The propensity of researchers to over-report the performance of their own approaches has been deemed the “self-assessment trap” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Norel1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>We propose community-based collaborative competitions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Zoon1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Earl1">[49]</xref> as a general framework to develop and evaluate predictive models of cancer phenotypes from high-throughput molecular profiling data. This approach overcomes limitations associated with the design of typical research studies, which may conflate self-assessment with methodology development or, even more problematic, with data generation. Thus competition-style research may promote transparency and objective assessment of methodologies, promoting the emergence of community standards of methodologies most likely to yield translational clinical benefit.</p>
<p>The primary challenge of any competition framework is to ensure that mechanisms are in place to prevent overfitting and fairly assess model performance, since performance is only meaningful if models are ranked based on their ability to capture some underlying signal in the data. For example, such an approach requires datasets affording sufficient sample sizes and statistical power to make meaningful comparisons of many models across multiple training and testing data subsets. We propose several strategies for assessing if the results obtained from a collaborative competition are likely to generalize to future applications and improve on state-of-the art methodologies that would be employed by an expert analyst.</p>
<p>First, baseline methods should be provided as examples of approaches an experienced analyst may apply to the problem. In our study, we employed a number of such methods for comparison, including methodologies used in clinical diagnostic tests and multiple state-of-the-art machine learning methods trained using only clinical covariates.</p>
<p>Second, performance of models should be evaluated in multiple rounds of independent validation. In this study, we employed a multi-phase strategy suggested by previous researchers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Lakhani1">[50]</xref> in which a portion of the dataset is held back to provide real-time feedback to participants on model performance and another portion of the dataset is held back and used to score the performance of all models, such that participants cannot overfit their models to the test set. If possible, we recommend an additional round of validation using a dataset different from the one used in previous rounds, in order to test against the possibility that good performance is due to modeling confounding variables in the original dataset. This experimental design provides 3 independent rounds of model performance assessment, and consistent results across these multiple evaluations provides strong evidence that performance of the best approaches discovered in this experimental design are likely to generalize in additional datasets.</p>
<p>Finally, statistical permutation tests can provide useful safeguards against the possibility that improved model performance is attributable to random fluctuations based on evaluation of many models. Such tests should be designed carefully based on the appropriate null hypothesis. A useful, though often insufficient, test is to utilize a negative control null model, for example by permuting the sample labels of the response variable. We suggest that additional tests may be employed as post-hoc procedures designed specifically to provide falsifiable hypotheses that may provide alternative explanations of model performance. For example, in this study we assessed the performance of many models trained using the same learning algorithm (random survival forest) and the same clinical features as used in the top scoring model, but using random selections of molecular features instead of the GII feature. This test was designed to falsify the hypothesis that model performance is within the range of likely values based on random selection of features, as has been a criticism of previously reported models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Venet1">[18]</xref>.</p>
<p>We suggest that the guidelines listed above provide a useful framework in reporting the results of a collaborate competition, and may even be considered necessary criteria to establish the likelihood that findings will generalize to future applications. As with most research studies, a single competition cannot comprehensively assess the full extent to which findings may generalize to all potentially related future applications. Accordingly, we suggest that a collaborative competition should indeed report the best forming model, provided it meets the criteria listed above, but need not focus on declaring a single methodology as conclusively better than all others. By analogy to athletic competitions such as an Olympic track race, a gold medal is given to the runner with the fastest time, even if by a fraction of a second. Judgments of superior athletes emerge through integrating multiple such data points across many races against different opponents, distances, weather conditions, etc., and active debate among the community. A research study framed as a collaborative competition may facilitate the transparency, reproducibility, and objective evaluation criteria that provide the framework on which future studies may build and iterate towards increasingly refined assessments through a continuous community-based effort.</p>
<p>Within several months we developed and evaluated several hundred modeling approaches. Our research group consisted of experienced analysts trained as both data scientists and clinicians, resulting in models representing state-of-the art approaches employed in both machine learning and clinical cancer research (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003047-t003">Table 3</xref>). By conducting detailed post-hoc analysis of approaches developed by this group, we were able to design a controlled experiment to isolate the performance improvements attributable to different strategies, and to potentially combine aspects of different approaches into a new method with improved performance.</p>
<p>The design of our controlled experiment builds off pioneering work by the MAQC-II consortium, which compiled 6 microarray datasets from the public domain and assessed modeling factors related to the ability to predict 13 different phenotypic endpoints. MAQC-II classified each model based on several factors (type of algorithm, normalization procedure, etc), allowing analysis of the effect of each modeling factor on performance. Our controlled experiment follows this general strategy, and extends it in several ways.</p>
<p>First, MAQC-II, and most competition-base studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Bennett1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kaggle1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-The1">[26]</xref>, accept submissions in the form of prediction vectors. We developed a computational system that accepts models as re-runnable source code implementing a simple train and predict API. Source code for all submitted models are stored in the Synapse compute system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Derry1">[51]</xref> and are freely available to the community. Thus researchers may reproduce reported results, verify fair play and lack of cheating, learn from the best-performing models, reuse submitted models in related applications (e.g. building prognostic models in other datasets), build ensemble models by combining results of submitted models, and combine and extend innovative ideas to develop novel approaches. Moreover, storing models as re-runnable source code is important in assessing the generalizability and robustness of models, as we are able to re-train models using different splits or subsets of the data to evaluate robustness, and we (or any researcher) can evaluate generalizability by assessing the accuracy of a model's predictions in an independent dataset, such as existing related studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-VanDeVijver1">[5]</xref> or emerging clinical trial data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Cardoso1">[52]</xref>. We believe this software system will serve as a general resource that is extended and re-used in many future competition-based studies.</p>
<p>Second, MAQC-II conducted analysis across multiple phenotypic endpoints, which allowed models to be re-evaluated in the context of many prediction problems. However, this design required models to be standardized across all prediction problems and did not allow domain-specific insights to be assessed for each prediction problem. By contrast, our study focused on the single biomedical problem of breast cancer prognosis, and allowed clinical research specialists to incorporate expert knowledge into modeling approaches. In fact, we observed that feature selection strategies based on prior domain-specific knowledge had a greater effect on model performance than the choice of learning algorithm, and learning algorithms that did not incorporate prior knowledge were unable to overcome challenges with incorporating high-dimensional feature data. In contrast to previous reports that have emphasized abstracting away domain-specific aspects of a competition in order to attract a broader set of analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Lakhani1">[50]</xref>, in real-word problems, we emphasize the benefit of allowing researchers to apply domain-specific expertise and objectively test the performance of such approaches against those of analysts employing a different toolbox of approaches.</p>
<p>Finally, whereas MAQC-II employed training and testing splits of datasets for model evaluation, our study provides an additional level of evaluation in a separate, independent dataset generated on a different cohort and using different gene expression and copy number profiling technology. Consistent with findings reported by MAQC-II, our study demonstrates strong consistency of model performance across independent evaluations and provides an important additional test of model generalizability that more closely simulates real-world clinical applications, in which data is generated separately from the data used to construct models. More generally, whereas MAQC-II evaluated multiple prediction problems in numerous datasets with gene expression data and samples numbers from 70 to 340, our study went deeper into a evaluating a single prediction problem, utilizing copy number and clinical information in addition to gene expression, and with a dataset of 2,000 samples in addition to an independently-generated dataset with 102 samples.</p>
<p>The model achieving top performance in both the initial evaluation phase and the evaluation in additional datasets combined a state-of-the-art machine learning approach (random survival forest) with a clinically motivated feature selection strategy that used all clinical features together with an aggregate genomic instability index. Interestingly, this specific model was not tested in the uncontrolled phase, and was the result of the attempt to isolate and combine aspects of different modeling approaches in a controlled experiment. The genomic instability index measure may serve as a proxy for the degree to which DNA damage repair pathways (including, for instance, housekeeping genes like p53 and RB) have become dysregulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kwei1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>Beyond the specifics of the top performing models, we believe the more significant contribution of this work is as a building block, providing a set of baseline findings, computational infrastructure, and proposed research methodologies used to assess breast cancer prognosis models, and extending in the future to additional phenotype prediction problems. Towards this end, we have recently extended this work into an open collaborative competition through which any researcher can freely register and evaluate the performance of submitted models against all others submitted throughout the competition. Though this expanded breast cancer competition, and future phenotype prediction competitions to be hosted as extensions of the current work, we invite researchers to improve, refute, and extend our findings and research methodologies to accelerate the long arc of cumulative progress made by the community through a more transparent and objectively assessed process.</p>

<title>Breast Cancer Prognosis Competition Design and Software</title>

An automated script continuously monitored for new submissions, which were sent to worker nodes in a computational cluster for scoring. Each worker node ran an evaluation script, which called the submitted model's customPredict method with arguments corresponding to the gene expression, copy number, and clinical covariate values in the held-out validation dataset. This function returns a vector of predicted survival times in the validation dataset, which were used to calculate the concordance index as a measure of accuracy compared to the measured survival times for the same samples. Concordance index scores were shown in a real-time leaderboard, similar to the leaderboards displaying the models scores shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003047.s002">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003047.s005">Table S4</xref>.</p>
<p>Concordance index (c-index) is the standard metric for evaluation of survival models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Harrell1">[53]</xref>. The concordance index ranges from 0 in the case of perfect anti-correlation between the rank of predictions and the rank of actual survival time through 0.5 in the case of predictions uncorrelated with survival time to 1 in the case of exact agreement with rank of actual survival time. We implemented a method to compute the exact value of the concordance index by exhaustively sampling all pairwise combinations of samples rather than the usual method of stochastically sampling pairwise samples. This method overcomes the stochastic sampling used in standard packages for concordance index calculation and provides a deterministic, exact statistic used to compare models.</p>

<title>Study timeline</title>
<p>Data on the original 980 samples were obtained for this study in early January, 2012. Study design and computational infrastructure were developed from then until March 14<sup>th</sup>, at which point participants were given access to the 500 training samples and given 1 month to develop models in the “uncontrolled experiment” phase. During this time, participants were given real-time feedback on model performance evaluated against the held-out test set of 480 samples. After this 1-month model development phase, all models were frozen and inspected by the group to conduct post-hoc model evaluation and identify modeling strategies used to design the controlled evaluation. All models in the controlled evaluation were re-trained on the 500 training samples and re-evaluated on the 480 test samples. After all evaluation was completed based on the original 980 samples, the METABRIC2 and MicMa datasets became available, and were used to perform additional evaluations of all models, which was conducted between January 2013–March 2013. For the new evaluation, all data was renormalized to the gene level, as described below, in order to allow comparison of models across datasets performed on different platforms. Models were retrained using the re-normalized data for the same 500 samples in the original training set.</p>

<title>Datasets and normalization</title>
<p>The METABRIC dataset used in the competition contains gene expression data from the Illumina HT 12v3 platform and copy number data derived from experiments performed on the Affymetrix SNP 6.0 platform. In the initial round of analysis, the first 980 samples data was normalized as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Curtis1">[29]</xref>, corresponding to the data available in the European Genome-Phenome Archive (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/ega</ext-link>), accession number EGAS00000000083. Copy number data was summarized to the gene level by calculating the mean value of the segmented regions overlapping a gene. Data for use in our study are available in the Synapse software system (synapse.sagebase.org) within the folder with accession number syn160764 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://synapse.prod.sagebase.org/#Synapse:syn160764" xlink:type="simple">https://synapse.prod.sagebase.org/#Synapse:syn160764</ext-link>), subject to terms of use agreements described below. Data may be loaded directly in R using the Synapse R client or downloaded from the Synapse web site.</p>
<p>Patients treated for localized breast cancer from 1995 to 1998 at Oslo University Hospital were included in the MicMa cohort, and 123 of these had available fresh frozen tumor material <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Kristensen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Naume1">[28]</xref>. Gene expression data for 115 cases obtained from an Agilent whole human genome 4×44 K one color oligo array was available (GSE19783) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Enerly1">[54]</xref>. Novel SNP-CGH data from 102 of the MicMa samples were obtained using the Illumina Human 660k Quad BeadChips according to standard protocol. Normalized LogR values summarized to gene level were made available and are accessible in Synapse (syn1588686).</p>
<p>All data used for the METABRIC2 and MicMa analyses are available as subfolders of Synapse ID syn1588445. For comparison of METABRIC2 and MicMa, we standardized all clinical variables, copy number, and gene expression data across both datasets. Clinical variables were filtered out that were not available in both datasets. Data on clinical variables used in this comparison are available in Synapse.</p>
<p>All gene expression datasets were normalized according the supervised normalization of microarrays (snm) framework and Bioconductor package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Gentleman1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Mecham1">[56]</xref>. Following this framework we devised models for each dataset that express the raw data as functions of biological and adjustment variables. The models were built and implemented through an iterative process designed to learn the identity of important variables. Once these variables were identified we used the snm R package to remove the effects of the adjustment variables while controlling for the effects of the biological variables of interest.</p>
<p>SNP6.0 copy number data was also normalized using the snm framework, and summarization of probes to genes was done as follows. First, probes were mapped to genes using information obtained from the <italic>pd.genomewidesnp.6</italic> Bioconductor package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Carvalho1">[57]</xref>. For genes measured by two probes we define the gene-level values as an unweighted average of the probes' data. For genes measured by a single probe we define the gene-level values as the data for the corresponding probe. For those measured by more than 2 probes we devised an approach that weights probes based upon their similarity to the first eigengene. This is accomplished by taking a singular value decomposition of the probe-level data for each gene. The percent variance explained by the first eigengene is then calculated for each probe. The summarized values for each gene are then defined as the weighted mean with the weights corresponding to the percent variance explained.</p>
<p>For Illumina 660k data we processed the raw files using the crlmm bioconductor R package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Scharpf1">[58]</xref>. The output of this method produces copy number estimates for more than 600k probes. Next, we summarized probes to Entrez gene ids using a mapping file obtained from the Illumina web site. For genes measured by more than two probes we selected the probe with the largest variance.</p>

<title>Feature selection methods</title>
<p>Feature selection strategies used in the controlled experiment (identified through post-hoc analysis of the uncontrolled experiment) are described briefly in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003047-t003">Table 3</xref>. Specific genes used in each category are available within Synapse ID syn1643406 and can be downloaded as R binaries via the Synapse web client or directly loaded in R using the Synapse R client. Most feature selection strategies are sufficiently described in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003047-t003">Table 3</xref>, and we provide additional details on 2 methods below.</p>
<p>The MASP (Marginal Association with Subsampling and Prior Knowledge) algorithm employs the following procedure: all genes were first scored for association with survival (using Cox regression) in chunks of 50 randomly selected gene expression samples. This process was repeated 100 times which resulted in an overall survival association score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003047.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003047.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the p-value associated with the Cox regression on the expression of gene <italic>i</italic> in sample set <italic>j</italic>. All genes were sorted in descending order by their survival association score and the top 50 oncogenes and transcription factors were kept. A list of human transcription factors was obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003047-Ravasi1">[59]</xref> and a list of oncogenes was compiled by searching for relevant keywords against the Entrez gene database.</p>
<p>GII is a measure of the proportion of amplified or deleted genomic loci, calculated from the copy number data.
