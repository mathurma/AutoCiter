        <p>Prion proteins (PrPs) are key players in fatal neurodegenerative disorders, yet their physiological functions remain unclear, as PrP knockout mice develop rather normally. We report a strong PrP loss-of-function phenotype in zebrafish embryos, characterized by the loss of embryonic cell adhesion and arrested gastrulation. Zebrafish and mouse PrP mRNAs can partially rescue this knockdown phenotype, indicating conserved PrP functions. Using zebrafish, mouse, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells, we show that PrP: (1) mediates Ca<sup>+2</sup>-independent homophilic cell adhesion and signaling; and (2) modulates Ca<sup>+2</sup>-dependent cell adhesion by regulating the delivery of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane. In vivo time-lapse analyses reveal that the arrested gastrulation in PrP knockdown embryos is due to deficient morphogenetic cell movements, which rely on E-cadherin–based adhesion. Cell-transplantation experiments indicate that the regulation of embryonic cell adhesion by PrP is cell-autonomous. Moreover, we find that the local accumulation of PrP at cell contact sites is concomitant with the activation of Src-related kinases, the recruitment of reggie/flotillin microdomains, and the reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton, consistent with a role of PrP in the modulation of cell adhesion via signaling. Altogether, our data uncover evolutionarily conserved roles of PrP in cell communication, which ultimately impinge on the stability of adherens cell junctions during embryonic development.</p>

          <p>Unlike conventional pathogens, prions are infectious particles devoid of nucleic acids and composed entirely of a misfolded host protein, PrP. It is widely assumed that the neurodegeneration observed in prion disorders may be related to an aberrant function of PrP in the misfolded state. However, the normal physiological function of PrP remains poorly understood, mainly owing to the absence of clear phenotypes in mice lacking PrP. Here, we show that when PrP is depleted in zebrafish embryos, dramatic phenotypes ensue, severely affecting the development of early and late (neural) structures. We examined the mechanisms responsible for some of these defects, and found that fish and mammalian PrPs play conserved roles in cell–cell communication, by directly mediating cell adhesion and by triggering cellular signals that further modulate the function of other adhesion molecules. In the early zebrafish embryo, these activities control not only tissue integrity and cell morphology, but also the complex cellular movements that give rise to germ layers. This study describes—to our knowledge—the first known in vivo function of PrP and its molecular cellular basis, which may provide helpful insights into the role of PrP in the adult brain and its proposed connections to prion-induced neurotoxicity.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The prion protein (PrP) is a membrane-anchored glycoprotein, best known for its unique ability to undergo structural conversion from a normal “cellular” isoform (PrP<sup>C</sup>) into a pathogenic conformer known as “scrapie” (PrP<sup>Sc</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b001">1</xref>]. The accumulation of scrapie aggregates—prions—in the brain is a distinctive feature of transmissible spongiform encephalopathies, a group of lethal neurodegenerative diseases that include Kuru and Creutzfeldt-Jacob disease in humans, scrapie in sheep, and mad cow disease in cattle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b002">2</xref>]. While much has been learned about the pathogenic properties of PrP, its normal physiological role remains elusive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b004">4</xref>]. We previously identified PrP orthologs in fish and proposed that the conservation of their protein domain architecture reflects the maintenance of an ancient and important biological role of PrP across vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Although PrP is widely expressed in mouse embryos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b006">6</xref>], PrP knockout mice are surprisingly viable and show no major physical or behavioral abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b007">7</xref>]. For the last 17 years, this lack of in vivo phenotypes has precluded PrP from genetic functional analysis, raising the intriguing question of whether its unknown physiological function is necessary or dispensable for the organism, and also whether prion neurotoxicity may be a consequence of PrP mis- or loss-of-function. So far, diverse roles have been proposed for PrP<sup>C</sup>, including signal transduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b008">8</xref>], cell adhesion and protection from apoptosis and oxidative stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b004">4</xref>], as well as neurogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b010">10</xref>], axonal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b011">11</xref>], hematopoietic stem cell self-renewal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b012">12</xref>], and lymphocyte activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b014">14</xref>]. However, these potential PrP functions do not seem to share a common molecular basis, and their in vivo relevance remains to be clarified.</p>
      <p>Here, we show that early down-regulation of PrP impairs cell adhesion in the zebrafish embryo, disrupting morphogenetic cell movements and ultimately causing developmental arrest. Using aggregation assays, we established that PrP subserves complex roles in both Ca<sup>+2</sup>-independent and Ca<sup>+2</sup>-dependent cell adhesion. Our analyses of morphant embryonic cells revealed that PrP is required for the proper membrane localization of E-cadherin adhesion complexes. We also carried out experiments in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells to demonstrate that PrP itself induces homophilic cell adhesion, and that its accumulation at cell contacts leads to the recruitment of microdomain-associated proteins, eliciting signal transduction and rearrangement of the actin cytoskeleton. Finally, we found that the roles of PrP in cell adhesion and signaling are conserved across vertebrate classes, and that PrP interactions can take place even between mouse and fish orthologs. Our results contribute novel molecular and cellular aspects of PrP function in vitro and in vivo, which may be of relevance to understanding its long-sought physiological roles in the mammalian brain, as well as the potential link between PrP loss-of-function and prion-induced neurodegeneration.</p>

        <title>PrP Expression during Zebrafish Development</title>
        <p>Because zebrafish contain duplicated <italic>PrP</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b005">5</xref>], <italic>PrP-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic>, we assessed their degree of functional overlap by examining their patterns of embryonic expression. RNA in situ hybridization shows strong and ubiquitous distribution of maternal <italic>PrP-1</italic> transcripts at early midblastula stages (2.5 h postfertilization [hpf], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g001">Figure 1</xref>A); this is followed by a sharp decrease after gastrulation to reach minimal levels in the forebrain and eyes at the pharyngula stage (30 hpf, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In contrast, <italic>PrP-2</italic> transcripts remain undetectable from 2.5 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g001">Figure 1</xref>C) until somitogenesis but reach high levels by 30 hpf, especially in the brain (telencephalon and diencephalon), as well as in discrete neuronal populations of the central nervous system (CNS) (trigeminal ganglia and neuromeres) and peripheral nervous system (PNS) (lateral line ganglia and Rohon-Beard neurons) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, arrows). These complementary expression patterns, which were not evident in previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b015">15</xref>], indicate that fish <italic>PrP-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic> carry out specialized roles during distinct developmental stages: <italic>PrP-1</italic> transcripts are abundant at early stages characterized by active cell division and migration in the entire embryo, whereas <italic>PrP-2</italic> is specifically up-regulated later in the developing nervous system, particularly in neurogenic placodes.</p>

        <title>PrP Loss-of-Function Phenotypes</title>
        <p>The developmental expression patterns of <italic>PrP-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic> indicated that they perform early ubiquitous and late neural embryonic roles, respectively. To test this prediction, we blocked the translation of each gene by microinjecting antisense morpholinos into one- to four-cell stage embryos. Such knockdown of PrP-1 produced a strong early phenotype characterized by the failure to carry out gastrulation beyond 6 hpf (shield stage), resulting in a large proportion of arrested embryos at 9 hpf (∼95%, <italic>n</italic> = 200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) compared to control embryos (5%, <italic>n</italic> = 200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-st001">Table S1</xref>). Western blot analysis of 6-hpf embryos confirmed that PrP-1 expression levels were effectively suppressed by morpholino microinjection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>G). On the other hand, PrP-2 knockdown embryos showed normal gastrulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) and survived into early larval stages (≥7 d postfertilization [dpf]), but presented morphological defects in the head region, particularly malformed brains and eyes (∼65%, <italic>n</italic> = 200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>K and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">2</xref>M). These early and late phenotypes correlate with the developmental expression patterns of <italic>PrP-1</italic> and <italic>-2</italic>, respectively. Thus, the gastrulation arrest in PrP-1 morphant embryos reveals that this protein is essential for epiboly (the spreading of the blastodisc from the animal to the vegetal pole), whereas the malformations observed in PrP-2 morphant embryos are consistent with a specific role of this protein in neural differentiation and brain morphogenesis.</p>

        <p>Given their shared protein domain composition, PrP-1 and -2 are likely to have similar biological activities, despite their distinct amino acid sequences and developmental expression patterns. To examine the degree of functional relatedness between zebrafish (and mouse) PrPs, we tested their ability to rescue the PrP-1 loss-of-function phenotype. Embryos were coinjected with various combinations of <italic>PrP-1</italic> morpholino and in vitro synthesized <italic>PrP</italic> mRNAs lacking the morpholino binding sites. As expected, the severity of the PrP-1 early phenotype could be rescued with <italic>PrP-1</italic> mRNA (21% of arrested embryos, <italic>n</italic> = 200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>D): coinjected embryos overcame the gastrulation arrest and survived into larval stages. Remarkably, partial rescue of the PrP-1 knockdown was also observed upon coinjection of <italic>PrP-2</italic> (38% of arrested embryos, <italic>n</italic> = 200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>E) and even mouse <italic>PrP</italic> mRNAs (47% of arrested embryos, <italic>n</italic> = 200) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). Differences in rescue efficiency between these mRNAs were also seen in the variation of the degree of epiboly attained at 9 hpf: while control embryos and PrP-1 morphants reached about 90% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, arrowheads) and 50% epiboly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>B, arrowheads), respectively, the zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">2</xref>E, arrowheads) and mouse PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>F, arrowheads) rescues attained about 90% and 70% epiboly at this time, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-st001">Table S1</xref>). Rescues using the corresponding <italic>EGFP-PrP</italic> fusion mRNAs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) produced similar results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>H and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-st002">Table S2</xref>) and allowed us to visualize ubiquitous expression of the rescuing fusion proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">2</xref>I). Furthermore, control mRNAs coding for only the PrP leader and GPI-anchor peptides (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, controls) could not revert the PrP-1 phenotype (87.5% of arrested embryos, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g002">Figure 2</xref>I and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-st002">Table S2</xref>), confirming that the rescue ability depends on the presence of the PrP cores (repetitive, hydrophobic, and globular domains). In contrast, the PrP-2 phenotype could not be rescued due to the technical limitation of having to inject the mRNAs at the one- to four-cell stages: rescuing mRNAs were inevitably expressed at blastula stages, causing early ectopic overexpression before the endogenous <italic>PrP-2</italic> could actually be transcribed and therefore targeted by the morpholino. Interestingly, ectopic (ubiquitous) overexpression of zebrafish or mouse <italic>PrP</italic> mRNAs produced similar morphological phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg001">Figure S1</xref>): asymmetric epiboly and severe defects in eye and brain morphology. Thus, although not identical, PrP down-regulation and overexpression phenotypes converge at the same developmental processes (gastrulation and neural development) where a basic cellular function shared by fish and mouse PrPs is required.</p>

        <title>Conserved Cellular Properties of PrPs</title>
        <p>To gain preliminary insight into the cellular mechanisms responsible for the phenotypes observed, we analyzed the heterologous expression of zebrafish PrPs in mouse neuroblastoma 2a (N2a) cells, a neuronal cell line routinely used to study the functional and pathogenic properties of PrP. To overcome the lack of anti–zebrafish-PrP antibodies suited for immunofluorescence, we used EGFP-PrP fusion constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). In these experiments, expression of zebrafish and mouse EGFP-PrP constructs in N2a cells led to strong protein accumulation at cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">3</xref>D, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">3</xref>F, arrowheads and fluorescence profiles). This phenomenon was not observed upon surface expression of control EGFP constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">3</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">3</xref>G), indicating that the PrP leader and GPI-anchor peptides are sufficient for protein targeting and attachment to the cell membrane, but that the accumulation at cell contacts is dependent on the presence of the PrP cores. Moreover, PrP accumulation was observed only when both cells forming the contact expressed the PrP construct (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A), suggesting that PrPs might engage in homophilic <italic>trans</italic>-interactions. Interestingly, while mouse PrP and zebrafish PrP-2 were observed along the entire cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">3</xref>F), PrP-1 localized almost exclusively at cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>D), suggesting a contact-dependent regulation of PrP-1 membrane positioning. PrP accumulation at N2a cell contacts could also be observed by immunostaining endogenous PrP with a specific monoclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B), as well as by using DsRed-monomer constructs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>C–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">S2</xref>H), and in HeLa cells (data not shown). To examine zebrafish and mouse PrP expression in vivo, we microinjected the corresponding <italic>EGFP-PrP</italic> mRNAs into zebrafish embryos. The localization patterns observed at 6 hpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>H–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">3</xref>K) were consistent with those seen in N2a cells, including the relatively homogeneous membrane distribution of PrP-2 and mouse PrP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">3</xref>J), the local accumulation of PrP-1 in patches at cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>H), and even the loss of discrete accumulation by a control construct lacking the PrP-1 core (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>K). Similar to their mammalian counterparts, attachment of zebrafish PrPs to N2a cell membranes via GPI-anchors was greatly reduced by PI-PLC treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>I and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">S2</xref>J); likewise, N-glycosylation could be demonstrated by PNGase F digestion (see Western blots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg002">Figure S2</xref>K). We also generated mutant constructs for PrP-1 and PrP-2 in which the putative N-glycosylation residues were point mutated to glutamine. Western blot analysis of these constructs confirmed that, like mammalian PrPs, zebrafish PrP-1 and -2 are mono- and di-glycosylated at the expected residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g003">Figure 3</xref>L). These experiments strengthen the concept that the cellular function of PrP is conserved between fish and mammals.</p>

        <title>PrP-1–Mediated Embryonic Cell Adhesion</title>
        <p>The specific accumulation of PrP at cell contacts suggested that the zebrafish PrP phenotypes could be explained by defects in cell–cell communication. Given the relative simplicity and ease of manipulation of the early zebrafish embryo, we focused our analysis on the cellular and molecular characterization of the PrP-1 phenotype. Morphological examination of PrP-1 knockdown embryos at 6 hpf revealed that the developmental arrest was preceded by a marked decrease in tissue integrity and compactness; as they detached, deep cells in the morphant embryo lost their otherwise polygonal shape and became round (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">Figure 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">4</xref>B). The progressive loss of cell adhesion was clearly not a consequence of cell death, as in control embryos, death at this stage usually leads to generalized cell lysis within a few minutes. In contrast, round morphant cells survived at least until 12 hpf. Moreover, TUNEL (terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling) and DAPI stainings of 6-hpf PrP-1 morphant embryos showed no signs of apoptotic DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">Figures 4</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">4</xref>F and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg003">S3</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg003">S3</xref>D). Thus, the loss of embryonic cell adhesion is a specific effect of PrP-1 knockdown, which can be rescued by the local accumulation of exogenous PrPs at cell contacts sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g004">Figure 4</xref>C, arrowheads).</p>

        <p>During gastrulation, cell adhesion is dynamically maintained by cadherin homophilic interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b016">16</xref>]. This raised the possibility that the PrP-1 knockdown phenotype could be due—at least partly—to the misregulation of cadherin function, which is Ca<sup>+2</sup> dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b017">17</xref>]. To test this hypothesis, we performed aggregation assays with dissociated control and PrP-1 morphant cells in the presence and absence of Ca<sup>+2</sup>. When the assay was performed in the Ca<sup>+2</sup>-containing medium, PrP-1 morphant cells underwent a significant decrease in the number of large (&gt;10 cells) and small (&lt;10 cells) aggregates (100%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0004; and 36% reduction, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003, respectively), compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, + bars). The same relative effect was observed when the assay was performed in Ca<sup>+2</sup>-free medium, indicating that PrP-1 is required for the formation of Ca<sup>+2</sup>-independent cell clusters, mostly of small size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, − bars). On the other hand, aggregation of PrP-1 morphant cells in the presence or absence of Ca<sup>+2</sup> showed no significant differences, implying that the formation of large clusters is mediated by cadherins and controlled by PrP-1. Interestingly, when the assay was performed with PrP-1 overexpressing cells in the presence of Ca<sup>+2</sup>, a dramatic increase in the number of large clusters was recorded (200% increase, <italic>p</italic> = 4 × 10<sup>−7</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, + bars); in the absence of Ca<sup>+2</sup>, PrP-1 overexpressing cells virtually formed no large clusters (as expected), and the number of small clusters was larger than that of PrP-1 knockdown cells, and comparable to that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>D, − bars). These results are consistent with a complex role of PrP-1 in the maintenance of embryonic cell adhesion via cell-autonomous interactions at the plasma membrane. To test for cell autonomy, we transplanted small groups of deep cells from 4-hpf blastulae treated with <italic>PrP-1</italic> and control morpholinos into 4-hpf control blastulae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>G). After 2 h, control cells established normal cell contacts within the control host embryo and acquired polygonal morphology (10 out of 12 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>E). In contrast, PrP-1 morphant cells remained round and loose within the control host embryo (10 out of 10 experiments, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g005">Figure 5</xref>F). Thus, the adhesion defect in PrP-1 morphant cells is cell-autonomous and cannot be corrected by the cellular environment of the control host embryo. Unfortunately, transplantation of control cells into a morphant host was not informative because PrP-1 morphant embryos did not withstand manipulation.</p>

        <title>PrP-1 and the Regulation of E-cadherin–Mediated Cell Adhesion</title>
        <p>Our aggregation assays indicated that PrP-1 can modulate Ca<sup>+2</sup>-dependent cell adhesion in the embryo. Therefore, we investigated whether PrP-1 knockdown would affect the expression and subcellular localization of E-cadherin. Since cadherin homophilic interactions are anchored to the actin cytoskeleton via catenins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b018">18</xref>], we also analyzed PrP-1–mediated changes in the distribution of β-catenin and F-actin. Antibody and phalloidin stainings revealed the typical cell surface localization of these molecules in 6-hpf control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">6</xref>C). In contrast, E-cadherin and β-catenin appeared largely intracellular in PrP-1 morphant cells, and the distribution of F-actin was disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">6</xref>F). This apparent intracellular accumulation of E-cadherin could be due to increased E-cadherin endocytosis and/or degradation, or to deficient trafficking to the plasma membrane. To address these possibilities, we first carried out Western blot analysis on cell extracts from 6-hpf control and PrP-1 morphant embryos. Notably, PrP-1 morphant cells showed an almost complete reduction in the levels of the 120-kDa polypeptide reported to be the active membrane-bound form of E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b019">19</xref>], as well as a slight increase in the levels of the 140-kDa immature form of E-cadherin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b019">19</xref>], thought to be abundantly stored in intracellular compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>G). Previous studies have identified the recycling endosome, with its associated small GTPase Rab11, as an intermediate compartment that regulates post-Golgi trafficking and exocytosis of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b021">21</xref>]. We reasoned that if the increased intracellular distribution of E-cadherin in PrP-1 morphant cells was due at least in part to deficient delivery of E-cadherin to the plasma membrane, then E-cadherin would be seen to accumulate in Rab11-positive intermediate compartments. Therefore, we analyzed the subcellular distribution of E-cadherin and Rab11 in 6-hpf embryos by double immunostainings, and quantitatively assessed changes in their degree of colocalization upon PrP-1 knockdown. We found that the marked intracellular distribution of E-cadherin in morphant embryos was accompanied by a significant increase (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) in the number of E-cadherin/Rab11 double-positive vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>H–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">6</xref>N). These experiments suggest that PrP-1 can modulate the function of E-cadherin by regulating its processing and/or transport from intracellular stores to the plasma membrane.</p>

        <p>To verify that PrP-1 can specifically modulate the stability of adhesion complexes at discrete cell–cell contacts (as opposed to within a tissue), we also carried out immunostainings on dissociated blastomeres that had been allowed to reaggregate. Comparison of control and morphant cells showed that the local accumulation of E-cadherin and β-catenin at newly formed cell contacts requires PrP-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>, compare 6S and 6T with 6O and 6P). Moreover, we observed PrP-1–dependent accumulation of Fyn tyrosine kinase and tyrosine phosphorylated proteins at cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>, compare 6U and 6V with 6Q and 6R), suggesting that the regulation of E-cadherin localization by PrP-1 involves the activation of Src-related kinases and downstream targets. We asked next whether the regulatory role of PrP-1 over E-cadherin could be further confirmed by showing that the two molecules interact at the genetic level. To test for synergistic interactions, we microinjected embryos with low doses of PrP-1 morpholino, E-cadherin morpholino, or the two morpholinos together, and scored the number of embryos with arrested gastrulation at 6 hpf. Our results show a statistically significant increase (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005, <italic>n</italic> = 3, ∼400 embryos per experiment) in the percentage of arrested embryos for the PrP-1/E-cadherin double knockdown (88.75 ± 1%), compared to the PrP-1 (46.02 ± 0.8%) or to the E-cadherin (38.16 ± 0.46%) single knockdowns, or to the control morpholino (1.29 ± 0.23%). These data strongly suggest that PrP-1 and E-cadherin act synergistically to regulate embryonic cell adhesion.</p>
        <p>Kane et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b022">22</xref>] have demonstrated that E-cadherin mutants fail to carry out epiboly because radial intercalation—a morphogenetic cell movement crucial for the spreading of the blastoderm over the yolk cell—is impaired. In these mutants, cells from the interior layer of the epiblast move normally to the exterior layer but fail to integrate and become restricted, thereby blocking the expansion of the blastoderm. Because E-cadherin adhesion is affected in PrP-1 morphants, we hypothesized that their epibolic arrest could be explained by defective radial intercalation. To confirm this, we carried out time-lapse recordings of cell behavior in the epiblast. In control embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>A), intercalating cells (in blue) entered the exterior layer and flattened out within approximately 20 min, effectively increasing their area. During this process, cells from the exterior layer that were initially in contact with the intercalating cell (in green), or that established new contacts with it (in red), remained in stable contact. In PrP-1 morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>B), intercalating cells entered the exterior layer and increased their area, but did not completely flatten out: after approximately 10 min, they eventually reduced their area and left the exterior layer (deintercalation). Moreover, not all exterior cells that were in contact with the intercalating cell remained in contact with it (see green cells 2 and 4, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and other cells that became in contact with it (red cells) did not maintain stable cell contacts. Overall, deintercalation events occurred frequently in morphant embryos but were not observed in control embryos, suggesting that the developmental basis for the epibolic arrest of PrP-1 morphant embryos is the impairment of morphogenetic cell movements directly controlled by E-cadherin. In agreement with this, the corresponding time-lapse videos show that PrP-1 morphant cells have a reduced ability to maintain tissue cohesion and to migrate in a coordinated fashion (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv001">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv002">S2</xref>). Interestingly, and despite these defects, morphant cells seemed quite active in generating processes. To further clarify this issue, we made time-lapse recordings of single dissociated blastomeres (8 hpf), which show that their intrinsic motility is not affected by PrP-1 knockdown (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv003">Videos S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv004">S4</xref>). To assess whether PrP-1 knockdown might affect other cellular events relying on proper cell–cell communication, we also controlled for changes in mitosis rates upon PrP-1 knockdown. Interestingly, we found a partial reduction in the numbers of dividing blastomeres in morphant embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg003">Figure S3</xref>E); however, neither cell size nor overall cell density appeared to be significantly compromised in these embryos.</p>

        <p>It has previously been reported that mutation or down-regulation of E-cadherin specifically affects adhesion in the deep cell layer but not in the enveloping layer (EVL) of the zebrafish gastrula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b024">24</xref>]. Similarly, the PrP-1 adhesion phenotype reported here appears restricted to deep cells, supporting the notion that PrP-1 modulates E-cadherin function, and that cell adhesion in the EVL may be controlled by additional mechanisms, such as the use of different types of cellular junctions. To further investigate this, we studied the distribution of markers for adherens and tight junctions in the EVL at 6 hpf. In PrP-1 morphants, EVL cells showed similar alterations in the distribution of E-cadherin, β-catenin, and F-actin as in deep cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">Figure 8</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">8</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">8</xref>F–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">8</xref>H; for a <italic>Z</italic>-stack reconstruction of an embryo showing the size and morphology of both types of cells, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv005">Video S5</xref>), indicating that PrP-1 regulates the stability of adherens junctions in both cell layers. In contrast, the membrane distribution of classical tight junction markers like occludin and ZO-1 remains unaffected in morphant EVL cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">Figure 8</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">8</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">8</xref>I, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g008">8</xref>J), whereas their presence in deep cells (control or morphant) could not be detected. Hence, the loss of PrP-1 and E-cadherin function may not significantly impair EVL cell adhesion due—at least in part—to its different cell junction composition.</p>

        <title>Adhesive and Signaling Properties of PrP</title>

To clarify this, we employed nonadhesive <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells, an experimental paradigm classically used to demonstrate the adhesive properties of membrane proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b025">25</xref>]. Notably, S2 cells transfected with mouse and zebrafish EGFP- and DsRed-monomer-PrP constructs acquired the ability to aggregate and accumulate PrP at cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figures 9</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">9</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg004">S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sv006">Video S6</xref>). In contrast, control EGFP constructs did not accumulate even at fortuitous cell contacts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>F). Since S2 cells lack endogenous PrP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b026">26</xref>] and do not express adhesion molecules, these experiments show that PrP expression leads to cell aggregation. Similarly, aggregation of cells transfected with frog and chicken PrP constructs indicates that the PrP-mediated adhesion is conserved across vertebrate classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">9</xref>E, arrowheads). To corroborate that PrP accumulates between distinct cells (as opposed to between dividing daughter cells), we reproduced these results using mixed S2 cell populations separately transfected with EGFP- and DsRed-monomer-PrP constructs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>G, arrowheads). In these experiments, untransfected cells did not form aggregates and remained excluded from the mouse PrP-transfected aggregates (data not shown), suggesting that cell aggregation is due to homophilic affinity between PrPs on apposing cell membranes. Interestingly, cross-interactions involving zebrafish and mouse PrPs also triggered aggregation of S2 cells (47 ± 1% aggregated cells compared to 83 ± 2% between mouse PrPs and 94 ± 2% between zebrafish PrP-2s, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>H, arrowheads), revealing that, unlike the species restrictions that limit prion propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b027">27</xref>], functional interactions can take place even between distantly related PrPs.</p>

        <p>Our present work in zebrafish embryos revealed that PrP can regulate the function of E-cadherin; similarly, other studies have reported functional interactions between PrP and NCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b010">10</xref>]. To exclude the possibility that PrP might cause S2 cell aggregation by indirectly activating these endogenous adhesion molecules, we immunostained S2 cells for DE-cadherin, DN-cadherin, and fasciclin II (<italic>Drosophila</italic> NCAM), and confirmed that these molecules are not re-expressed upon transfection with PrP constructs. To further test whether PrP itself can act as an adhesion molecule, we asked whether an anti-PrP antibody could interfere with the aggregation process. Indeed, clustering of cells transfected with mouse EGFP-PrP was drastically reduced by incubation with M-20, an anti-mouse PrP polyclonal antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>I, fluorescence images, arrowheads). The reduction in the percentage of aggregated cells was concentration-dependent, going from 83 ± 6% (control without antibody) to 48 ± 6% and 18 ± 5% in the presence of 2 and 4 μg/ml M-20, respectively. In contrast, incubation with 4 μg/ml of control antibody did not significantly affect cell clustering (82 ± 7%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>I, histogram). Moreover, PrP-mediated aggregation of S2 cells was not affected by the presence of 0.5 mM EGTA (data not shown). Thus, we conclude that PrP can mediate homophilic cell adhesion in a Ca<sup>+2</sup>-independent manner.</p>
        <p>Using T cells, we previously have shown that PrP can elicit signal transduction and reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton via Src-related tyrosine kinases, and that these events take place at specialized membrane microdomains defined by the presence of reggie/flotillin scaffolding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b014">14</xref>]. The present study shows that similar cellular signals between zebrafish blastomeres are inhibited upon PrP-1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">Figure 6</xref>T and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g006">6</xref>U). Therefore, we investigated whether such signaling events are also induced in S2 cells upon the formation of Ca<sup>+2</sup>-independent, PrP-mediated contacts. In fact, activated Src-kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>J, arrowheads) and phosphotyrosine staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg005">Figure S5</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg005">S5</xref>C), as well as coclustering of reggie/flotillin membrane microdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>L, arrowheads, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg006">Figure S6</xref>A–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-sg006">S6</xref>E), and accumulation of F-actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g009">Figure 9</xref>N) could be seen to colocalize with PrP accumulation at cell contacts.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The present study shows that the loss of PrP function in a vertebrate can produce clear phenotypes amenable to cellular and molecular characterization. Our experiments reveal important roles of PrP during zebrafish development, PrP-1 regulating embryonic cell adhesion during gastrulation, and PrP-2 affecting later stages of neural development. Interestingly, the developmental expression and cellular localization patterns of PrP-2 suggest that it might play a role closer to that of mammalian PrP in the nervous system. In fact, mouse PrP is expressed throughout the developing nervous system in a pattern analogous to that of zebrafish PrP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b006">6</xref>]. Nevertheless, the differences in expression patterns and knockdown phenotypes between PrP-1 and −2 are most likely of transcriptional regulatory nature, because both proteins share important biological properties with mouse PrP, such as membrane anchorage, posttranslational processing, subcellular localization, and the ability to revert the PrP-1 knockdown phenotype. The strength of the PrP knockdown phenotypes in zebrafish is in sharp contrast with the lack of significant defects in PrP knockout mice. This striking difference may be due to the activation of gene compensatory mechanisms in the embryonic stem (ES) cells selected to derive the mouse knockouts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b002">2</xref>]. For instance, a potential role of PrP in supporting axonal growth can be compensated by up-regulation of integrins in PrP knockout mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b011">11</xref>]. Hence, clear PrP phenotypes in mammals might become visible only upon replacement of the PrP gene with a dysfunctional (i.e., truncated) copy, such as in the “Shmerling phenotype” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b028">28</xref>]. Examination of the immediate changes in gene expression upon PrP knockout in mammalian ES cells and embryos might help clarify this issue.</p>
      <p>While PrP may establish interactions in <italic>cis</italic> or <italic>trans</italic> with adhesion molecules like NCAM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b010">10</xref>], the specific accumulation of PrPs at the contacts between transfected N2a cells suggests that PrPs can also establish <italic>trans</italic>-interactions on apposing plasma membranes, as it has been hypothesized for brain endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b029">29</xref>]. In fact, our aggregation assays with zebrafish blastomeres and <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells show that PrP itself can mediate Ca<sup>+2</sup>-independent homophilic cell adhesion, and that this adhesive property is conserved across vertebrate classes. Moreover, our results also demonstrate that PrP interactions play a regulatory role in vivo, by eliciting the signal transduction events necessary to modulate Ca<sup>+2</sup>-dependent cell adhesion in the zebrafish gastrula. In particular, we show that PrP-1–mediated signaling influences proper processing and/or trafficking of E-cadherin from storage vesicles to adherens junctions at the plasma membrane. This upstream regulatory role of PrP-1 over of E-cadherin is underscored by the remarkable similarities between the developmental roles of these two molecules. For instance, zebrafish E-cadherin is maternally expressed at adherens junctions and required to regulate embryonic cell adhesion of deep but not EVL cells; mutation or knockdown of E-cadherin induce epibolic arrest and disaggregation of blastodermal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b024">24</xref>]. In this study, we further strengthened the functional connection between PrP-1 and E-cadherin, by showing that they interact genetically to control distinct cell morphogenetic movements required for zebrafish gastrulation.</p>
      <p>Our experiments suggest that the regulation of E-cadherin by PrP-1 is likely to occur indirectly via signal transduction, and not through direct physical interaction. Accordingly, PrP colocalizes, but does not physically interact, with E-cadherin in cell junctions of human enterocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b030">30</xref>]. Likewise, the different embryonic localization patterns of PrP-1 (in discrete membrane patches) and E-cadherin (along entire cell–cell contacts) argue against a necessary physical interaction between the two. Moreover, discrete localization in patches at cell contacts, and regulation of E-cadherin function via signaling have also been described for the wnt11 signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b032">32</xref>]. Interestingly, we find that PrP-1 knockdown also results in increased cytoplasmic accumulation of β-catenin. Since the loss of β-catenin signaling is known to increase neuronal apoptosis in Alzheimer's disease patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b033">33</xref>], it would be interesting to study whether β-catenin or wnt signaling are affected along with PrP function during prion-induced neurodegeneration.</p>
      <p>Our previous work on T cells revealed that PrP-mediated signaling can trigger activation of Src-related kinases (such as Fyn and Lck) and elevation of intracellular Ca<sup>+2</sup> levels, along with reorganization of the actin cytoskeleton [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b014">14</xref>]. Here, we show that similar signaling events are induced upon PrP accumulation at cell contacts. Interestingly, Src-related kinases are known to regulate cell adhesion via direct phosphorylation of p120 and β-catenins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b035">35</xref>]. Moreover, two Src-related kinases, Fyn and Yes, are required for Ca<sup>+2</sup> signaling and for regulation of the actin cytoskeleton during zebrafish epiboly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b037">37</xref>]. Thus, PrP signaling may modulate embryonic cell adhesion and actin cytoskeleton dynamics through the activation of Src-related kinases and associated targets.</p>
      <p>Analysis of the PrP-2 phenotype is beyond the focus of this study. However, ongoing studies in our lab (E. Málaga-Trillo and L. Luncz, unpublished data) indicate that PrP-2 plays a role in the proliferation and differentiation of developing neurons in vivo, similar to what has been shown for mouse embryonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b009">9</xref>]; the precise signaling pathways involved in these processes remain to be clarified.</p>
      <p>Altogether, our experiments reveal evolutionarily conserved roles of PrP in the maintenance of Ca<sup>+2</sup>-dependent and Ca<sup>+2</sup>-independent embryonic cell adhesion. On one hand, we showed that PrP can directly mediate homophilic cell adhesion and signaling via Src-related kinases. On the other hand, we uncovered a functional link between the activity of PrP at cell contacts and the regulation of cadherin-mediated cell adhesion. Furthermore, we have demonstrated that these roles of PrP are required in vivo to regulate morphogenetic movements that drive early zebrafish development. The implications of these findings for mammalian prion biology await further elucidation; however, they open new avenues for the study of PrP function and prion-induced neurodegeneration across vertebrate models.</p>

        <p>The leader, core, and GPI-anchor signal fragments (144, 1,677, and 120 bp for PrP-1; 219, 1,485, and 138 bp for PrP-2; 105, 660, and 87 bp for mouse PrP; 126, 447, and 75 bp for <italic>Xenopus</italic> PrP; and 129, 588, and 84 bp for chick PrP, respectively) containing the necessary restriction sites were generated by PCR and cloned into pCRII-TOPO as separate fragments, before subcloning into the end vectors. The corresponding EGFP-PrP constructs were engineered through conventional cloning procedures, by inserting leader cDNAs into the NheI/AgeI; and core and/or GPI-anchor cDNAs into the BglII/EcoRI sites of pEGFP-C1 (BD Biosciences Clontech). Zebrafish PrP N-glycosylation mutants were engineered by introducing point mutations (asparagine to glutamine) in residues 509 and/or 514 of PrP-1, and 438 and/or 443 of PrP-2. DsRed-monomer-PrP constructs were generated by replacing the EGFP ORF with the DsRed-monomer sequence (BD Biosciences Clontech). For <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cell transfection experiments, the EGFP- and DsRed-PrP constructs were subcloned into the XbaI/ApaI sites of the pAc5.1/V5-HisA vector (Invitrogen, provided by V. Katanaev). For morpholino rescue experiments, PrP ORF cDNAS were subcloned into the EcoRI site of pCS2+ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000055-b038">38</xref>] (provided by Z. Varga) and transcribed in vitro using the mMESSAGE mMACHINE SP6 kit (Ambion). For colocalization studies in S2 cells, rat reggie-1 and −2, and zebrafish reggie-2a were cloned into the EcoRI/BamHI sites of the pDsRed-Monomer-N1 (BD Biosciences Clontech), and further subcloned into the EcoRI/NotI sites of the pAc5.1/V5-HisA vector.</p>

All microinjections were performed at early cleavage stages (one- to four-cell stage) using a manual micromanipulator (Narishige) coupled to a Transjector 5246 (Eppendorf) under a Stemi 2000 stereomicroscope (Zeiss). After running specificity and dose-dependency controls, morpholinos were injected at a concentration of 0.8 ng/nl in 1× Danieau buffer (58 mM NaCl, 0.7 mM KCl, 0.4 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 0.6 mM Ca(NO<sub>3</sub>)<sub>2</sub>, 5.0 mM HEPES [pH 7.6]) and 0.125% Phenol Red (Sigma); both PrP-1 morpholinos produced the same phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000055-st001">Table S1</xref>). For double-knockdown experiments, low doses (0.4 ng/nl) of PrP-1 morpholino, E-cad morpholino, or both morpholinos were microinjected; the numbers of embryos with arrested gastrulation were given as the percentage of total embryos treated, and statistically analyzed with an unpaired <italic>t</italic>-test (two-tailed distribution; average ± standard error of the mean [SEM]; <italic>n</italic> = 3). For rescue experiments, morpholinos at 1.6 ng/nl in 1× Danieau buffer were coinjected with capped mRNAs at 80 pg/nl at a 1:1 ratio in 0.05 M KCl and 0.125% Phenol Red; for overexpression experiments mRNAs were microinjected at or 40 pg/nl. At least 300 embryos were microinjected per experiment (5-nl injection volume) and kept in E3 medium (5 mM NaCl, 0.17 mM KCl, 0.33 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 0.33 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>) at 28 °C; quantitation of phenotypes was carried out for 200 embryos per experiment. Phenotypes were photographed with Zeiss color and black &amp; white Axiocam cameras on an Axioplan 2 microscope using Nomarski optics. Images were further processed with Adobe Photoshop 8.0. Apoptotic cells in fixed embryos were stained with the TUNEL method using the In situ cell death detection kit, AP (Roche), images were acquired on a LUMAR.V12 (whole mounts) or Axioplan 2 (flat mounts) microscopes (Zeiss). Embryos treated with 10% ethanol for 5 min were used as positive apoptotic controls. In addition, embryos were stained with DAPI (100 ng/ml) at room temperature (RT) for 30 min, and examined for their nuclear morphology and the presence of apoptotic bodies.</p>

          <p>(E–L) At prim-5 (24 hpf) (E–H), and long pec (48 hpf) (I–L) stages, the normal development of the head in control embryos (E and I) contrasts sharply with the small brains and reduced, asymmetric (F–H and J–L), or even fused (K) eyes observed in embryos overexpressing zf PrP-1 (F and J), zf PrP-2 (G and K), or m PrP (H and L).</p>
          <p>(M–O) The asymmetric epiboly phenotype (M)-seen here for overexpression of zf PrP-1 at 6 hpf- is not due to asymmetric distribution of mRNA, as lateral (N) and animal pole (O) fluorescence views of the same embryo show.</p>

The coordinated migration of blastomeres and the general cell cohesion of the epiblast can be seen, along with some dividing cells. Radial intercalation events normally take place (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>), with cells from the interior cell layer entering the exterior cell layer and flattening out (building cell contacts with the surrounding cells). No instances of deintercalation could be observed. The recording was made over 20 min at four frames per minute. The images were converted into a video using the Axiovision 4.7 software (Zeiss).</p>

          <p>Time-lapse recording of gastrulation cell movements in the epiblast at 8 hpf (lateral view). The coordinated migration of blastomeres is impaired and, in general, cell cohesion in the epiblast is severely disrupted, as more rounded cells are evident, with more and larger gaps between them. Around the gaps, cells can be seen actively extending protrusions and making unstable cell contacts. Radial intercalation events take place, but morphant cells do not show the ability to flatten out and integrate within the exterior layer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000055-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The recording was made over 20 min at four frames per minute. The images were converted into a video using the Axiovision 4.7 software (Zeiss).</p>
