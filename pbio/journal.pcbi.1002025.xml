        <p>Non-intermingling, adjacent populations of cells define compartment boundaries;
                    such boundaries are often essential for the positioning and the maintenance of
                    tissue-organizers during growth. In the developing wing primordium of
                        <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, signaling by the secreted protein
                    Hedgehog (Hh) is required for compartment boundary maintenance. However, the
                    precise mechanism of Hh input remains poorly understood. Here, we combine
                    experimental observations of perturbed Hh signaling with computer simulations of
                    cellular behavior, and connect physical properties of cells to their Hh
                    signaling status. We find that experimental disruption of Hh signaling has
                    observable effects on cell sorting surprisingly far from the compartment
                    boundary, which is in contrast to a previous model that confines Hh influence to
                    the compartment boundary itself. We have recapitulated our experimental
                    observations by simulations of Hh diffusion and transduction coupled to
                    mechanical tension along cell-to-cell contact surfaces. Intriguingly, the best
                    results were obtained under the assumption that Hh signaling cannot alter the
                    overall tension force of the cell, but will merely re-distribute it locally
                    inside the cell, relative to the signaling status of neighboring cells. Our
                    results suggest a scenario in which homotypic interactions of a putative Hh
                    target molecule at the cell surface are converted into a mechanical force. Such
                    a scenario could explain why the mechanical output of Hh signaling appears to be
                    confined to the compartment boundary, despite the longer range of the Hh
                    molecule itself. Our study is the first to couple a cellular vertex model
                    describing mechanical properties of cells in a growing tissue, to an explicit
                    model of an entire signaling pathway, including a freely diffusible component.
                    We discuss potential applications and challenges of such an approach.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In developing animal tissues, cells can often re-arrange locally and mix
                    relatively freely. However, in some stereotypic and crucially important
                    instances during body development, cells will strictly not intermingle, and
                    instead form sharp boundaries along which they will sort out from each other.
                    This mechanism helps organisms to establish signaling centers and to maintain
                    distinct cellular identities. Often, cells at such boundaries will remain in
                    close physical contact and are morphologically alike. Thus, the boundary itself
                    can be difficult to observe unless the expression status of specific marker
                    genes is monitored experimentally. How are these ‘compartment
                    boundaries’ established? Here we devise a computational model that aims to
                    describe one such boundary in a well-studied animal tissue: the developing wing
                    primordium of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. We model the production,
                    diffusion and local sensing of an essential signaling molecule, the
                        <italic>Hedgehog</italic> protein. We reveal one possible mechanism by which
                    Hedgehog sensing can influence the mechanical properties of cells, and compare
                    the simulated outcome to observations in experimentally perturbed, actual wing
                    discs. Our relatively simple model suffices to establish a straight and stable
                    compartment boundary.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>During embryonic development of complex multicellular organisms, spatial reference
                points need to be established within tissues. These are often formed by specialized
                groups of cells that are capable of signaling to neighboring cells. Such signaling
                centers define coordinate systems along which newly arising cells can orient
                themselves and make crucial decisions regarding proliferation, differentiation or
                migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Brook1">[1]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Meinhardt1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-DeRobertis1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Rhinn1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Neumann1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Tabata1">[6]</xref>. Because of
                their pervasive importance, tissue-organizing centers need to be precisely
                controlled – both spatially and temporally, as well as with respect to their
                signaling amplitude.</p>
      <p>One possible mechanism for spatial control of tissue organizers is to restrict the
                movement of cells at fixed boundary positions. This phenomenon is indeed observed,
                and it involves the separation of groups of cells that have already been spatially
                instructed to assume distinct identities, for example at segment- or
                parasegment-boundaries. Akin to water in oil, the two cell populations are seen to
                establish and maintain a relatively straight interface to each other, effectively
                minimizing their contact area. The minimizing force is assumed to help stabilize the
                interface against random perturbations that may arise from cell divisions or from
                arbitrary cell movements; thus, any organizing activity that is associated with the
                interface is likewise stabilized. How is this separation, or ‘sorting’,
                of cells of distinct identities achieved? One line of work attributes this to
                differential cell adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Steinberg1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Steinberg2">[8]</xref>: cell populations might develop distinct adhesive
                properties; these affinity differences would then allow them to sort out from one
                another. Another line of reasoning is based on Differential Interfacial Tension
                (DIT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Harris1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Brodland1">[10]</xref>: this
                hypothesis suggests that cells might actively constrict surfaces that are in contact
                with neighboring cells, depending on the cellular identity of neighbors and/or
                depending on signaling events. Both mechanisms would ultimately lead to physical
                forces that would help keep the cell populations apart.</p>
      <p>The developing wing primordium of <italic>Drosophila</italic> (‘wing
                disc’) is particularly well suited to study boundary formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g001">Figure 1</xref>). It is not required for
                larval viability, can be manipulated experimentally through an advanced genetic
                toolkit, and has been well characterized. The disc contains a compartment boundary
                that separates anterior from posterior cells; this boundary is inherited from
                specification events occurring early in the embryo. The initial embryonic events
                that give rise to the boundary involve mutual signaling between stripes of cells,
                mediated by an extensively studied network of genes (the ‘segment polarity
                network’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Scott1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Ma1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-vonDassow1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Monier1">[14]</xref>). Once established, the cellular identities on both sides
                of these boundaries are stable throughout larval development and well into adult
                life. The compartment boundary in the disc is strictly respected by all cells, even
                when cells on one side of the boundary are artificially provided with a competitive
                growth advantage over cells on the other side of the boundary <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-GarciaBellido1">[15]</xref>. The wing disc itself is
                a simple, flat, epithelial sheet, and the orientations of cell divisions appear
                largely random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Landsberg1">[16]</xref>. Genetic analysis and computational modeling of this
                tissue is simplified by the fact that daughter cells arising from cell divisions
                usually remain in physical contact and do not migrate away from each other. This has
                been shown experimentally by tracing descendents of single cells; in most cases such
                a ‘clone’ of offspring cells will form a coherent patch of connected
                cells. This behavior suggests that the complicated processes of cell intercalation
                and migration can be neglected, to a first approximation, when studying boundary
                maintenance in this tissue.</p>

                        discs.</title>
          <p>In the wing imaginal disc, cells of two distinct identities form the
                        posterior and anterior halves, respectively. The demarcation line between
                        them has been termed ‘compartment boundary’. The secreted
                        signaling protein Hedgehog is emanating from the posterior section, and
                        cells respond to this signal in the anterior section; this response is
                        needed to maintain a well-defined separation between the two compartments.
                        In the boxes to the right, two alternative scenarios for the molecular
                        events leading to boundary formation are outlined.</p>

      <p>Working with such wing discs, a recent, seminal study has begun to shed light on
                possible boundary formation mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Landsberg1">[16]</xref> (see also ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Umetsu1">[17]</xref>). The authors
                have directly demonstrated an increased mechanical tension at cell-to-cell
                interfaces located immediately at the boundary, using laser ablation experiments.
                Subsequent computer simulations then revealed that collectively such local forces
                are sufficient to maintain a stable compartment boundary. These results are
                intriguing, but they raise a number of new questions: Boundary formation in the wing
                disc is known to depend on the secreted and diffusible signaling protein Hedgehog
                (Hh), which is produced by posterior cells and specifically sensed and transduced by
                anterior cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Blair1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Rodriguez1">[19]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g002">Figure
                    2</xref>). If diffusible Hh indeed somehow influences mechanical tension, what
                conditions must then be met to ensure a well-defined boundary? So far, all known
                transcriptional responses of Hh signaling are occurring several cell-diameters wide
                into the responding tissue. How is the response in this case restricted to the
                immediate boundary region? Furthermore, experimental suppression of Hh signaling has
                been shown to lead to ectopic boundary formation distant from the actual boundary
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Dahmann1">[20]</xref>. Does
                this mean that the influence of Hh signaling does extend beyond the actual boundary,
                and if so, why does this not have a noticeable consequence in the wild type
                situation?</p>

          <title>Summary of Hh signaling in the wing disc.</title>
          <p>A) The diffusible signaling protein Hh exerts its function by binding to its
                        receptor Ptc. This relieves the transmembrane protein Smo from inhibition by
                        Ptc. Smo then signals to the cytoplasm, where the signal is eventually
                        relayed to the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci). Target genes
                        under the control of Ci thus respond to Hh signaling. B) Expression domains
                        of genes important in the process. Engrailed (en) and ci mark the two
                        compartments. Hh is produced under the direction of en, and then diffuses
                        freely. Smo is expressed throughout the disc. Ci is needed to activate or
                        repress target genes in response to Hh signaling. Ci is not present in the
                        posterior half, hence Hh target genes cannot be activated there. Immediately
                        at the boundary, target genes exhibit the largest difference in expression.
                        C) When small groups of cells are made mutant for the <italic>smo</italic>
                        gene, they can no longer activate target genes. When such clones are located
                        within the target gene stripe, they are known to round off and to tend to
                        minimize contact with neighboring cells.</p>

      <p>Here, we propose a mechanistic model that can generate a localized outcome of Hh
                signaling with respect to physical forces and mechanical properties, despite a
                longer range of the molecular response in terms of target gene expression.
                Furthermore, we estimate the distance from the boundary, up to which Hh signaling
                may be able ‘prime’ cells for boundary formation; this distance is
                inferred using both experimental results as well as modeling results, and we
                estimate it to be at least 10 cell diameters. We approach the problem by first
                formulating an explicit, two-dimensional model of Hh production, diffusion and
                transduction, and by then coupling this setup to a physical model of the growing
                tissue. In our modeling approach, cells and their contact surfaces are described as
                a graph of connected vertexes. Our model essentially follows the Differential
                Interface Tension hypothesis; it is a modified version of a model that has been
                previously established for the very same tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Farhadifar1">[21]</xref>. We observe good
                compartment boundary formation over a range of simulation parameters, and the
                modeling outcomes agree qualitatively with experimental perturbations specifically
                performed for this study.</p>

      <title>Results/Discussion</title>
      <p>In principle, at least two distinct molecular scenarios could explain the local
                generation of tensile forces at the boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g001">Figure 1</xref>). In the first scenario (ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Landsberg1">[16]</xref>), two
                different cell-surface molecules would form a heterotypic interaction at the
                boundary; their expression would essentially be under the control of the anterior or
                posterior “identities” of cells on either side of the boundary. The
                heterotypic interaction of these two molecules would be sensed locally at the
                cell-interaction interfaces, which would then respond by generating increased
                physical tension. This is a simple and attractive model, but it is not
                straightforward to consolidate with the known requirement, on the anterior side, for
                reception and transduction of the Hh signal. Loss of Hh transduction can generate
                ectopic boundaries in the anterior compartment (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Dahmann1">[20]</xref>, this study), but it is
                generally not presumed that such loss of Hh signal will change the identity of
                anterior cells into that of posterior cells: the expression status of the selector
                genes engrailed and ci is not affected by Hh signaling. Thus, if the cell-identity
                seems unchanged, then both of the putative cell-surface molecules required for this
                model would have to be under Hh control: one as a direct molecular target, and one
                as an “inverse” molecular target (i.e., de-repressed upon the loss of Hh
                signal). Only in such a setup would loss of Hh transduction lead to ectopic boundary
                formation within the anterior compartment. However, target gene de-repression upon
                loss of Hh signal has to our knowledge never been reported for any known Hh target
                gene, and it would likely require further, more complicated indirect signaling
                mechanisms. Alternatively, one might imagine that one of the two molecules was
                expressed ubiquitously throughout the tissue, and only the other molecule would be a
                target of Hh signaling. However, in such a scenario heterotypic binding would occur
                throughout the entire Hh target gene expression domain; increased tension would thus
                not be restricted to the immediate compartment boundary only.</p>
      <p>We therefore propose an alternative, somewhat more parsimonious scenario (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g001">Figure 1</xref>): The increased tensile
                forces at the boundary would be the consequence of a single cell-surface molecule,
                which would be a simple, direct molecular target gene of Hh signaling. This molecule
                would be able to transmit a signal to the inside of the cell, but only upon its
                activation by a homotypic interaction with molecules of the same type from a
                neighboring cell. Crucially, as discussed in more detail below, this signal and its
                conversion into mechanical tension would have to be rate-limited: relative tension
                would be highest at the section of the cell where most of the molecule has been
                activated, but the overall tension per cell would be constant (i.e. independent of
                the absolute amount of activated cell-surface molecule).</p>
      <p>To accurately take into account the role of Hh signaling in the disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we first devised a
                formal model for the production, diffusion and transduction of Hh in this
                two-dimensional tissue. The model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3</xref>) includes the Hh receptor Patched (Ptc), as well as the
                essential downstream signaling component Smoothened (Smo), together with an unknown,
                putative co-factor of Smo; this co-factor is not further specified but has been
                speculated to be a lipid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Eaton1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Hausmann1">[23]</xref>. The Hh protein is allowed to freely diffuse throughout
                the tissue, following its production in posterior cells. For each individual cell
                within the tissue, we compute the concentrations of the modeled entities as they
                develop in time by numerically solving a set of partial differential equations
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Apart from
                known or suspected players in Hh signaling, we implement an additional, putative
                target gene of Hh signaling, which we term “TMx”. Unlike Ptc, this gene
                is presumed to play no active role in the signaling pathway itself, instead it is a
                downstream target of the pathway and does not feed back into the sending or
                receiving of the Hh signal. We assume this gene to have the simplest possible
                connection to Hh signaling, namely a production term proportional to the amount of
                active Smo molecule in anterior cells. We further assume that the product of this
                gene has a function in regulating cortical tension at the inner surface of cells. We
                do not specify the molecular mechanism by which it regulates tension, but one could
                for example envisage TMx being a transmembrane protein whose intracellular domain
                recruits or otherwise influences cortical actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Lecuit1">[24]</xref>. Since TMx is modeled as a Hh
                target gene, it provides a way to connect transcriptional Hh responses to physical
                forces acting on cell shapes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure
                    3C</xref>). Our model is based on three central assumptions with regard to TMx:
                first, that it would increase cortical tension only in response to homotypic
                activation, i.e. upon binding another TMx molecule presented on the surface of a
                neighboring cell. Second, that it cannot increase the <italic>overall</italic>
                propensity of the cell for exacting cortical forces, but instead merely
                re-distributes cortical tension factors among the various interfaces that a given
                cell has with its neighbors. Again, we do not specify why this might be the case,
                but one could envisage a dynamic equilibrium of cytoskeleton filament deposition,
                and removal, at the cortex. In such a situation, each section of the cellular
                surface competes with all other sections within the same cell for the build-up of
                cytoskeleton material, and activated TMx might simply tip the balance towards
                deposition, locally. Lastly, the TMx molecule itself (while initially expressed
                isotropically) would enrich at cell surfaces at which it is activated by homotypic
                binding, perhaps because it is stabilized or preferentially re-deposited there.
                Thus, the overall effect of TMx would be that it changes the relative strength of
                contractile forces at each individual cell/cell contact segment; we model this as
                scaling factor within the line tension term of the physical energy function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

      <p>For our implementation of the full model, a challenge was to accurately compute the
                two-dimensional diffusion of the Hh protein on a geometry that is itself constantly
                changing. We achieve this by alternating the mechanical relaxation/growth
                computations with an explicit diffusion of Hh on finite volumes established by the
                shapes of the cells (see Supplemental Material, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s008">Text S1</xref>). It
                should be noted that our model does not address questions related to overall
                regulation of tissue growth or to the determination of final organ size (nor does it
                address issues of correct developmental timing). Detailed models for growth control
                and mechanical forces affecting the tissue as a whole have been developed already
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-AegerterWilmsen1">[25]</xref>,
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Hufnagel1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-AegerterWilmsen2">[27]</xref>, but
                they do not need to be applied here because our readouts are local, and because we
                stop the simulations well before the tissue would normally cease growing.</p>
      <p>Having specified the model, we next set out to parameterize it. Experimentally
                quantified data regarding the various kinetic parameters in Hh signaling are
                difficult to obtain and are at present quite sparse. We therefore focused our
                parameter exploration and validation on the modeled <italic>shapes</italic> of the
                various concentration gradients in the tissue (rather than on the absolute molecular
                concentrations); these shapes are already much better known, mainly from antibody
                staining experiments. For simplification, we performed parameter exploration in one
                dimension only, by projecting molecular concentration gradients along an
                anterior-posterior transect of the tissue (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The Ptc protein in particular served
                as a guide for our manual parameter optimization – it is itself a target gene
                of Hh, and its expression and activity gradients are understood comparatively well
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Casali1">[28]</xref>. As is
                shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s001">Figure
                    S1</xref>, our model resulted in the characteristic up-regulation of Ptc in a
                small stripe of cells anterior to the boundary. Remarkably, the Ptc protein
                concentration gradient shows an approximately sigmoidal shape when projected along
                the antero-posterior axis, with highest values close to the boundary; this is not
                specified in the model as such, but instead follows naturally from the wiring of the
                pathway, with Ptc being both the receptor and a direct target gene of Hh. Because
                the parameter space of our model is fairly large, and each simulation run takes
                several CPU hours, a fully systematic scan of the possible parameters is difficult.
                Instead, we explored the parameter space manually. Thus, our parameter set should
                and will be updated as experimental data on concentrations and kinetic constants
                become available; any updates will again have to reproduce the known shapes of
                concentration gradients in the tissue. Initial test runs of our model revealed that
                several parameter sets resulted in the formation of a stable lineage boundary at the
                anterior/posterior interface (see for example <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The resulting overall tissue-shapes
                often revealed a small constriction of the tissue margins at the position of the
                boundary, suggesting that the boundary exerts long-range mechanical forces on the
                tissue as a whole, as might be expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

          <p>The disruption of the crucial transduction protein Smo is an important assay
                        revealing the functional roles of Hh signaling. A) Confocal microscopy image
                        of a wing pouch with clones of cells mutant for <italic>smo</italic>.
                        Posterior cells are marked in blue (via a <italic>hh</italic>-lacZ enhancer
                        trap construct), cell outlines are marked in red (cadherin staining), and
                        loss of <italic>smo</italic> is indicated by loss of GFP staining (i.e.
                        absence of green color). Most clones are accompanied by a twin-spot (having
                        two functional <italic>smo</italic> genes; bright green). Notice how an
                        anterior clone close to the boundary has a ‘rounded’ appearance
                        and seems to minimize contact with neighboring cells (marked by a white
                        arrow). Another clone of anterior origin (i.e. absence of blue staining)
                        happened to originate in immediate contact with the boundary. It has
                        migrated into posterior territory, lost its roundness, and its leftward edge
                        now constitutes a new boundary interface. B) Simulated wing pouch with
                        clones of cells mutant for <italic>smo</italic> (marked in red) and their
                        corresponding twin spots (marked in bright green). Simulations reproduce the
                        experimentally observed ‘rounded’ appearance of clones in the
                        boundary region of the anterior compartment as well as the migration of
                        anterior clones close to the compartment boundary into the posterior
                        compartment (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s007">Video S3</xref>). C) – F) Roundness of
                        clones is used as an indirect measure of the strength of ectopic boundary
                        formation. In both experiments (C) and simulation (D),
                                <italic>smo<sup>−</sup></italic> clones in the anterior
                        compartment show a highly significant trending for decreasing roundness away
                        from the boundary. In both cases, roundness is above background levels for
                        at least 20 µ<italic>m</italic> (equivalent to at least 10 cells). In
                        controls – i.e. posterior compartment clones, or wild-type twin spots
                        – no significant trend is observed. For automatic image processing in
                        C) and D), clones were required to be located at a minimum distance of 5
                            <italic>µ</italic><italic>m</italic> from boundary, thus excluding
                        clones migrating from anterior to posterior compartment in the analysis of
                        roundness. C)–F) Straight lines: Moving average of the clonal (red)
                        and twin spot (blue) shape distributions; Blue dashed lines: Linear fit of
                        twin spot shapes vs. distance. E)–F): Red dashed lines: Linear fit of

      <p>Next, we validated the overall distribution of cell shapes in the simulated tissue,
                i.e. the distribution of cells over the various possible polygon classes (i.e.,
                number of edges per cell), and the dependency between polygon class and cell surface
                area. We based this on published experimental data (cell shape measurements) from
                refs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Landsberg1">[16]</xref> and
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Farhadifar1">[21]</xref>. This
                test further constrained our model parameters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g005">Figure 5</xref>). As shown previously, the relative
                settings of the main parameters of the energy function (i.e., perimeter elasticity
                factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vs. line tension factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) can be varied over a
                certain range, without resulting in much deviation between modeled and measured cell
                shapes. In our case, the added requirement of a stable boundary, which should mimic
                the actual boundary in the disc, constrained the parameters even further. For
                example, we noticed that relaxing the relative strength of the ‘perimeter
                elasticity’ parameter (third row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g005">Figure 5</xref>) resulted in the best overall appearance
                of the boundary; however this was accompanied with a reduced fit to the
                polygon-distribution, and with somewhat unrealistic (elongated) cell shapes
                immediately adjacent to the boundary. As the best subjective compromise, we
                identified the parameter setting <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and
                        <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (first row in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g005">Figure 5</xref>). At this point in parameter space, we observed the best fit to
                known cell sizes and shapes, while at the same time obtaining a fairly straight
                boundary (see also the comparison to a negative control in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Immediately at the boundary, our
                model posits an approximately twelve-fold difference between TMx expression levels
                (anterior cells in row A1 having maximal TMx concentration of roughly 2.4 a.u. vs.
                posterior cells in row P1 with a basal TMx concentration of 0.2 a.u.; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figures 3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s001">S1D</xref>). For
                average six-sided cells, this translates to a roughly two-fold increase in line
                tension at the boundary (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s003">Figure S3F</xref>) – in good agreement with
                laser-ablation experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Landsberg1">[16]</xref>, in which a 2.5 fold increase had been measured.</p>

          <p>Different parameter choices for the energy function are observed to lead to
                        compartment boundaries of varying stringency and straightness, but they will
                        also influence descriptive statistics for cell and clonal shape

      <p>Our model qualitatively recapitulated the configurations observed in actual wing
                discs (including a localized boundary in spite of a longer-ranging response to Hh),
                so we next tested whether it would also correctly recapitulate the effects of
                genetic perturbations in the pathway. As described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Dahmann1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Dahmann2">[29]</xref>, the transduction and response
                to the Hh signal can be blocked, in cells anterior to the boundary, by the removal
                of the essential Hh pathway protein Smo. This is achieved experimentally by inducing
                mitotic recombination in a small subset of cells, early in development, in larvae
                that are heterozygous for a mutant in the <italic>smo</italic> gene. The resulting
                small patches of homozygous mutant cells (clones) have been demonstrated to display
                two types of behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Dahmann1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Dahmann2">[29]</xref>: first, when situated close to the boundary, they tend to
                round off, minimizing their contact with neighboring cells. Second, when situated
                immediately adjacent to the boundary (specifically: at its anterior side), they tend
                to sort out from anterior cells and migrate into posterior territory. Both effects
                are interpreted as evidence for ectopic boundary formation – cells inside the
                clone are not receiving the Hh signal, but are juxtaposed to cells that do (this
                mimicks the situation at the boundary and leads to the rounding off, and/or to the
                migration into the posterior compartment that also does not transduce Hh). For our
                present study, we have repeated these experiments for a number of wing discs, and
                used automated image processing to quantify the extent of the
                “rounding-off” effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We observed a highly significant distance-dependence of the
                rounding-off behavior: clones farther away from the boundary are rounding off less
                strongly than clones closer to the boundary
                    (p = 6·10<sup>−6</sup>). As expected, this
                effect is not observed on the posterior side of the boundary, where Hh signaling has
                no known effects. This suggests that, whatever the molecular response to Hh
                signaling that is contributing to boundary formation, this response does extend
                further into the anterior tissue than just the immediate first row of cells at the
                boundary. In essence, cells seem to be “primed” for boundary formation,
                by Hh, several cell-diameters wide into the tissue.</p>
      <p>In our model, we can arbitrarily set the Smo production rate to zero for any cell
                (and its descendents), thus mimicking the experimental situation. We find that we
                can qualitatively recapitulate the behavior of
                    <italic>smo<sup>−</sup></italic> clones in our simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g004">Figure 4</xref>): clones situated close
                to the anterior side of the boundary, but not on the posterior side, can be observed
                to round off; in addition, we observe a tendency of clones that immediately straddle
                the boundary to migrate from anterior towards posterior territory (but not in the
                opposite direction). Importantly, similar to the experimental situation, we also
                observed a highly significant distance-dependence for the extent of rounding-off
                (with respect to the distance to the boundary, again only on the anterior side).
                This confirms that our model can correctly recapitulate this important aspect of the
                perturbation, and it supports our interpretation of the situation in the wing disc:
                a hypothetical transcriptional target of Hh signaling could be sufficient to
                generate a strictly local force that can establish a clearly delinated compartment
                boundary, despite this target being expressed (like all known transcriptional
                targets) over a certain distance away from the boundary. By assessing the shape of
                experimental <italic>smo<sup>−</sup></italic> clones, we can effectively chart
                out the predicted expression level of this putative gene; it appears to be expressed
                roughly similar to <italic>ptc</italic> or <italic>dpp</italic> (in a graded stripe
                of expression along the boundary, at least 10 cell diameters wide).</p>
      <p>When mutant cells are generated experimentally using mitotic recombination, a sister
                cell is generated that is not homozygous mutant, but instead homozygous wild-type in
                the <italic>smo</italic> gene. This so-called “twin-spot” provides
                another relevant input for our modeling: it presumably contains a larger amount of
                Smo protein (relative to the surrounding heterozygous tissue). We note that, both in
                the experiment and in our simulation, this difference in Smo levels does not suffice
                to generate a significant rounding-up of twin-spots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Indeed, the roundness of twin-spots is
                identical in the anterior and posterior compartment and independent from the
                distance towards the compartment boundary. Effectively, this observed behavior of
                experimental twin spots served as another constraint for our model parameterization:
                Differences in Hh pathway activity that are at most two-fold should not be
                sufficient to generate an observable boundary; and, the actual change in pathway
                activity at the endogenous boundary can thus be inferred to be much higher.</p>
      <p>In an earlier version of the model, we had assumed that the amount of cortical
                constriction would simply be directly proportional to the hypothetical Hh target TMx
                (data not shown). However, under this assumption we were unable to find a parameter
                set that would satisfy all constraints and that would result in realistic cell
                shapes. Cells were either visibly too small or too large in the TMx expression
                stripe, and/or were showing imbalances in the relative contributions of cortical
                forces and area elasticity, leading to distorted cellular shapes (data not shown).
                In our view, this indicates that the processes at the boundary are not simply based
                on increasing or decreasing overall cortical constriction, but instead on a local
                redistribution of a pre-existing, basal propensity for cortical constriction. As an
                important consequence, it appears that it is not the absolute level of TMx that is
                important, but the <italic>ratio</italic> of TMx expression between two neighboring
                cells.</p>
      <p>Our model is the first to couple tissue growth, driven by explicit cell divisions in
                a force-balanced cellular vertex approach, to signal transduction processes
                including diffusion, transcriptional responses and mechanical effects. This general
                approach should be applicable to a number of crucial developmental mechanisms,
                including growth control and body axis specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Lecuit1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Wozniak1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Mammoto1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Reeves1">[32]</xref>. In our case, we chose to model
                the Hh pathway, despite lacking many of the kinetic parameters that are needed to
                fully describe the pathway. This is probably the situation faced for most
                developmental signal transduction pathways today. However, we do believe this
                approach is justified, as long the as the outcome of the modeling is challenged
                experimentally, and as long as the sought-after answers are not addressing merely
                quantitative nuances in the pathway, but instead more fundamental mechanistic
                choices. Here, we essentially aimed to clarify whether a homotypic boundary model
                can work in principle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g001">Figure
                1</xref>), and whether a single, classical transcriptional target of Hh could be the
                missing link between pathway activity and physical forces at the cellular level. We
                find that this could indeed be the case, and that such a target gene might even be
                expressed at a basal level outside the Hh signaling stripe (since only relative
                differences at the boundary are needed). Our findings provide one possible
                explanation why previous attempts to search for this gene were unsuccessful: often
                it was assumed that the gene would be strongly expressed anteriorly, but not at all
                posteriorly. Instead, in our model the gene can indeed be expressed posteriorly (in
                fact, many configurations are possible, as long as they include a localized
                difference in expression at the boundary). Overall, our study indicates that
                mechanistic pathway modeling within whole tissues can help to choose among
                hypothetical, conflicting scenarios, and that it can even constrain properties of
                postulated missing players in a pathway.</p>

        <title>Modeling the Hedgehog pathway</title>
        <p>We explicitly describe the Hedgehog pathway by a coupled system of ordinary and
                    partial differential equations. The Hh protein, produced in the posterior
                    compartment of the wing disc, diffuses into the anterior compartment, where it
                    binds reversibly to its receptor Patched (Ptc). Binding of Hh to Ptc relieves
                    the repression of the transmembrane protein Smoothened (Smo) by Ptc, but neither
                    the mechanism for Ptc repression of Smo nor the mechanism by which the complex
                    [Hh Ptch] relieves this repression has been fully understood. We
                    assume that the active form of Smo corresponds to a complex of Smo protein and
                    an unknown ligand Lx, [<italic>Lx Smo</italic>]. We further assume
                    that, in a membrane compartment inaccessible to Smo, there exists a reservoir of
                    Lx, from where it can flow towards Smo via a passive transport mechanism. We
                    assume that Lx gets pumped away from Smo (active transport) by unbound Ptc. Ptc
                    in turn is produced with a constant, low basal rate in the A-compartment, and is
                    additionally a transcriptional target downstream of the active form of Smo in
                    the A-compartment (via the transcription factor Ci, not modeled explicitly).
                    Finally, we assume that the putative transmembrane protein “TMx” is
                    likewise a transcriptional target downstream of the active form of Smo, with an
                    additional, basal expression throughout the tissue. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, the above players and their
                    interactions are summarized. This network of interactions is translated into a

                    diffusion is restricted to the Hh molecule, only the first equation includes
                    spatial derivatives, whereas all other equations are ordinary differential
                    equations. We assume that protein kinetics can be described by a constant set of

        <title>A change in line tension leads to a straight boundary</title>
        <p>The apical side of Drosophila's wing disc is modeled as a two-dimensional
                    vertex model, where the junctions between cells are defined by straight lines
                    (edges) connecting vertices. The resulting tissue topology is obtained by
                    minimizing an energy function describing visco-elastic properties of the cells.
                    Our model is an extension of previously published models describing cells as
                    polygons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Farhadifar1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Hufnagel1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Rauzi1">[36]</xref>. In keeping with the framework of these previous
                    models, mechanical forces are not stated explicitly; instead, by minimizing the
                    ‘work function’ that aims to reflect the potential energy of the
                    system, quasi-instantaneous relaxation of the system into local energy-minima is
                    achieved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Dahmann3">[37]</xref>. This is assumed to correspond to the outcome of balanced
                    forces acting in the elastic, dampened system of the tissue. It should be
                    stressed that the modeling takes place on three, well-separated time scales: at
                    the longest time scale (hours to days), cells divide and the tissue grows. At
                    the medium time scale (minutes to hours), signaling proteins diffuse and are
                    transduced into molecular responses inside the cell. The actual mechanics
                    (forces and movements) occur at the shortest time scale – on the order of
                    seconds – as has been demonstrated experimentally by tracking the
                    relaxation movements following laser ablations in the tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Landsberg1">[16]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In our extension of the published models, we assume that a putative transmembrane
                    protein downstream of the Hedgehog pathway (“TMx”) leads to a change
                    in the line tension term of the energy function. We assume that TMx molecules
                    are preferentially recruited to those edges that offer more binding partners
                    (i.e., other TMx molecules expressed on neighboring cells). At the inner side of
                    the cell membrane, TMx is assumed to signal to “effectors” that in
                    turn influence cortical tension. The total number of effectors in each cell is
                    not influenced by Hh signaling and is rate limiting. Both requirements are
                    reflected in the definition of an additional scaling
                            factor<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the line tension contribution of the energy function
                    displayed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002025-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Note
                    that the sum in the definition of the scaling factor runs only over the edges of
                    cell α.</p>
        <p>The size of the scaling factor only depends on the <italic>ratio</italic> of the
                    concentrations of two neighboring cells and is thus independent on the absolute
                    values of concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s003">Figure S3</xref>). For all cells outside the stripe
                    of increased TMx expression, the scaling factor computes to 1 and the energy
                    function thus corresponds to the original energy function published in ref <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002025-Farhadifar1">[21]</xref>. The
                    scaling factor is strongly increased above the basal value of 1 on those edges
                    of posterior cells immediately straddling the boundary (and thus touching
                    anterior cells); and it is strongly decreased on all other edges of those cells.
                    The changes in the scaling factor for anterior cells are more subtle, as shown
                    in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002025.s003">Figure
                        S3</xref>. As each edge belongs to two cells, and their scaling factors for
                    a given edge may not be the same, the energy function effectively takes into
                    account the average of the two factors.</p>
        <p>With the dimensionless parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and

                    minimize the normalized energy function eq. (1) by a conjugate gradient method,
                    leading to a shortening of edges that have an increased scaling factor and a
                    lengthening of edges with a decreased scaling factor. This causes a
                    straightening of the boundary between anterior and posterior cells, and (as an
                    interesting side-effect) an increased average area of cells immediately

                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the higher value of both is given to both bonds
                        (named in the following <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Together
                        with the subsequence normalization, this mimics the fact that transmembrane
                        proteins are preferentially recruited to edges offering more binding
                        partners. D) Our assumption that the total line tension per cell is limited
                        is modeled by normalizing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the average
                        value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on all edges of a cell. Note that if all edges of a
                        cell have the same value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the scaling
                        factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> equals one for all edges of the cell. This is the
                        case for all cells outside the stripe of increased expression of the
                        transmembrane protein. E) Example for the calculation of the scaling factor
                        with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for regular
                        hexagons. F) The effective average scaling factor
                                <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002025.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of each edge.</p>
