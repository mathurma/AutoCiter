        <p>The peptide repertoire that is presented by the set of HLA class I molecules of an individual is formed by the different players of the antigen processing pathway and the stringent binding environment of the HLA class I molecules. Peptide elution studies have shown that only a subset of the human proteome is sampled by the antigen processing machinery and represented on the cell surface. In our study, we quantified the role of each factor relevant in shaping the HLA class I peptide repertoire by combining peptide elution data, <italic>in silico</italic> predictions of antigen processing and presentation, and data on gene expression and protein abundance. Our results indicate that gene expression level, protein abundance, and rate of potential binding peptides per protein have a clear impact on sampling probability. Furthermore, once a protein is available for the antigen processing machinery in sufficient amounts, C-terminal processing efficiency and binding affinity to the HLA class I molecule determine the identity of the presented peptides. Having studied the impact of each of these factors separately, we subsequently combined all factors in a logistic regression model in order to quantify their relative impact. This model demonstrated the superiority of protein abundance over gene expression level in predicting sampling probability. Being able to discriminate between sampled and non-sampled proteins to a significant degree, our approach can potentially be used to predict the sampling probability of self proteins and of pathogen-derived proteins, which is of importance for the identification of autoimmune antigens and vaccination targets.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>HLA class I molecules are expressed on the cell surface of almost all cells of the human body in complex with short fragments (peptides) of cytosolic proteins, thereby providing a snapshot of the intracellular state of a cell to circulating CD8+ T cells. Several processes are involved in shaping the peptide ligand repertoire of an HLA class I molecule, which generally represents only a small fraction of the proteins available in the cytosol. In our work we addressed protein sampling by HLA class I molecules to answer two questions: 1) Which proteins are sampled by the antigen processing pathway and why, and 2) which peptides of a given protein are picked to represent the source protein on the cell surface? To this end we quantified the contribution of each process involved in peptide processing and presentation individually and combined them into a logistic regression model. This simple model enabled us to predict the sampling probability of self proteins and may aid in the identification of autoimmune antigens.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Major histocompatibility complex (MHC) class I molecules play a crucial role in the adaptive immune response of higher vertebrates. These molecules, in humans referred to as human leukocyte antigen (HLA) class I molecules, bind peptides derived from endogenous proteins of host or, in the case of infected cells, of pathogen origin and present them to circulating CD8+ T lymphocytes and natural killer (NK) cells. The presentation of self peptides by an individual's HLA class I molecules has an impact on positive and negative selection of CD8+ T lymphocytes in the thymus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Starr1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Huseby1">[2]</xref>, maintenance of naive T cells in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Takada1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Marrack1">[4]</xref>, and inhibition of NK cells through recognition of self peptides in the context of HLA class I molecules by killer cell immunoglobulin-like receptors (KIR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Vilches1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Generally, HLA class I ligands are derived from intracellular proteins, which are degraded by the proteasome into peptide fragments. These peptides are then translocated by the transporter associated with antigen processing (TAP) into the lumen of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), where they may be loaded onto an HLA molecule if the peptide sequence fits the HLA molecule's binding preference. The C-terminus of an HLA ligand is assumed to be mainly determined by the proteasome (even though recently a carboxypeptidase has been found to contribute to C-terminal editing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Shen1">[6]</xref>), whereas the N-terminus may be trimmed by cytosolic and endoplasmic aminopeptidases after proteasomal cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Rock1">[7]</xref>. Finally, the HLA-peptide complexes are transported to the cell surface for presentation to CD8+ T cells and NK cells.</p>
      <p>Several studies analyzed peptide data sets obtained by peptide elution from specific cell lines and peptide sequencing by mass spectrometry to characterize the HLA peptide repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Hickman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Gebreselassie1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Milner1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Weinzierl1">[11]</xref>. Most of these studies focused on characterizing the function and subcellular localization of source proteins and suggested that HLA class I presented peptides are sampled from functionally and compartmentally diverse proteins, with a functional bias towards RNA-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Hickman1">[8]</xref>. In human cells, a weak correlation has been found between the abundance of HLA class I ligands presented and the corresponding mRNA levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Milner1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Weinzierl1">[11]</xref>, whereas peptides eluted from murine thymocytes were preferentially derived from highly abundant mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Fortier1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here, we take a different angle to the question of what fraction of the human proteome is represented on the cell surface. We studied two large HLA ligand data sets obtained by peptide elution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Johnson1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-BenDror1">[14]</xref> with the aim to quantify the role of several factors shaping the peptide repertoire of HLA class I molecules. We show that the gene expression level, protein abundance, rate of potential binding peptides in a protein and the processing quality of these peptides all contribute to which proteins are sampled and which peptides are chosen to be presented on the cell surface. Having studied the impact of each of these factors separately, we subsequently combined all factors in a logistic regression model in order to quantify their relative impact. This model can potentially be used to predict the sampling probability of self proteins and of pathogen-derived proteins.</p>

        <title>Elution data sets and procedure to determine HLA binders</title>
        <p>We studied two different peptide elution data sets. One large set, which we will call the <italic>Johnson</italic> data, comprises 4717 human peptides and 105 vaccinia peptides eluted from vaccinia infected cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Johnson1">[13]</xref>. A second set of eluted peptides, the <italic>Ben Dror</italic> data, comprises 569 human peptides eluted from soluble HLA-B*27:05 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-BenDror1">[14]</xref>. By mapping each eluted peptide to the human proteome, we were able to uniquely identify the source protein for 90% (4243 of 4717) of the <italic>Johnson</italic> data and 81.9% (466 of 569) of the <italic>Ben Dror</italic> data. Peptides that mapped to several human proteins (about 9%) or for which no source protein could be identified (only 0.4‚Äì1.1%) were excluded from further analysis.</p>
        <p>The cell line used for the generation of the <italic>Johnson</italic> data was homozygous for HLA-A*02:01, B*15:01 and C*03. In order to assess which of these three HLA molecules each of the reported peptides was eluted from, we employed NetMHC 3.2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Lundegaard1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Lundegaard2">[16]</xref>, a tool for HLA-peptide binding prediction. This tool is applicable for peptides of 8 to 13 amino acids in length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Lundegaard1">[15]</xref>. Of all eluted peptides of appropriate length and that could be mapped uniquely to a human source protein (4113 of 4243 peptides), we were able to assign 86.4% (3552 of 4113) to either being eluted from A*02:01 or B*15:01. The remaining 561 peptides could potentially have been eluted from C*03. Binding predictions, however, suggested C*03 binding only for a minor fraction of these (28% for all peptide lengths and 37% for 9mers), and therefore we decided to exclude these peptides from further analysis. Surprisingly, we identified twice as many potential B*15:01 binders as A*02:01 binders, originating from a larger number of source proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g001">Fig. 1</xref>). This observation is in agreement with the estimation given by the original study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Johnson1">[13]</xref>, in which the assignment to the restricting HLA molecule was solely determined based on the C-terminal residues of the eluted peptides. Likewise, among the vaccinia-derived peptides, a larger number of peptides (1.5-fold) were eluted from B*15:01 than from A*02:01, mapping to a larger number of vaccinia proteins, even though in this case the difference was less pronounced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g001">Fig. 1</xref>).</p>

        <p>Of the 569 eluted peptides in the <italic>Ben Dror</italic> data, 466 peptides (81.9%) mapped uniquely to 396 human source proteins. Among these peptides, 420 (90.1%) were predicted to bind to HLA-B*27:05, the soluble HLA molecule expressed by the cells studied. For all three HLA alleles studied, the majority of sampled proteins were represented by only a single peptide: 86.9% (457 of 526) of the proteins sampled by A*02:01, 76.1% (981 of 1289) of the ones sampled by B*15:01, and 86.4% (342 of 396) of the proteins sampled by B*27:05 gave rise to only one eluted peptide.</p>
        <p>In total, the two elution data sets had 160 source proteins in common. GO-term enrichment analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) revealed that for this set of proteins biological processes relating to the cell cycle and its regulation as well as nucleic acid metabolic processes were overrepresented.</p>

        <title>Eluted peptides are characterized by higher binding affinity and more efficient processing</title>
        <p>The observation that a protein is represented on the cell surface by one or more peptides allows the assumption that the protein must have been available in sufficient amounts or must have been present at an accessible subcellular location to be available for the antigen processing machinery. What factors then determine which of the potential HLA binders of a given protein will be found on the cell surface?</p>
        <p>In order to characterize the obtained peptide set, we employed prediction methods for HLA binding and antigen processing (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For the identified source proteins, we predicted all potential (9mer) binders to HLA-A*02:01, B*15:01, and B*27:05 and compared the predicted binding affinity of the eluted peptides (which form a subset of all potential binders) with the predicted binders from the same source protein that were not found in the elution. To ensure an unbiased comparison, the set of eluted peptides was limited to 9mers that were predicted to bind to the respective HLA molecule. We found that eluted peptides bind their HLA molecule with a significantly higher (predicted) binding affinity than other potential binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>However, not all predicted high-affinity binders were found in the elution. In order to investigate whether this observation may be due to inefficient processing of these peptides, we predicted the probability of C-terminal processing (using NetChop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Kesmir1">[17]</xref>) for all eluted peptides and all predicted binders that were not found in the elution data set. Based on these predictions, the set of eluted peptides is indeed more likely to arise from antigen processing as compared to the set of predicted binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). Possibly due to co-evolution between HLA class I molecules and the immunoproteasome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Kesmir2">[18]</xref>, predicted binding affinity and C-terminal processing probability show a weak (but significant) correlation (Kendall's tau‚Ää=‚Ää‚àí0.065, <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;0.0001). Therefore, we investigated the effect of processing without the influence of HLA binding by comparing the eluted peptide set to an affinity-matched subset of predicted binders to ensure that eluted and predicted peptides show the same distribution of binding affinities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s001">Fig. S1A</xref>). Also for this subset of predicted binders we observed a significantly lower C-terminal processing probability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s001">Fig. S1B</xref>). NetChop was trained on the C-termini of known HLA ligands and therefore predicts the combined effect of proteasome and TAP. Investigating the impact of these two processes separately (by employing prediction methods that are part of mhc-pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Peters1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Tenzer1">[20]</xref>) suggested that the C-termini of eluted peptides are more likely to be produced by the immunoproteasome and that these peptides are more efficiently transported by TAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s002">Fig. S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>For non-self peptides, we observed the same characteristics. Eluted peptides that originated from vaccinia proteins showed a significantly higher binding affinity to the respective HLA allotype than other potential binders derived from the same set of proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s003">Fig. S3A</xref>). A difference in predicted C-terminal processing probability between eluted and other peptides was, however, only found for A*02:01-binding vaccinia peptides (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s003">Fig. S3B</xref>). Interestingly, we did not observe a difference in predicted HLA binding affinity between the eluted peptides that originate from human proteins and vaccinia proteins (results not shown). This is in line with an earlier study, which showed that the HLA alleles analyzed here do not show a preference for presentation of non-self over self peptides, while others, foremost HLA-A alleles, do <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Calis1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Rao1">[22]</xref>.</p>

In other words, why are some proteins sampled while others are not?

Predicting the subcellular localization of each of the sampled proteins in the two data sets of our study, we found similar results: Overall, the distribution of cellular compartments for the sets of source proteins significantly differed from the distribution for the complete human proteome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s004">Fig. S4</xref>), and specifically, extracellular proteins were significantly underrepresented in both elution data sets (<italic>p</italic>&lt;1e-09, Chi-squared test), while proteins resident in the cytosol were overrepresented (<italic>p</italic>&lt;2e-05). In addition, we tested several protein characteristics for their ability to discriminate source proteins from proteins that were not sampled by the antigen processing pathway. For all three HLA allotypes studied, source proteins are longer, more abundant, and the corresponding genes are more highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g003">Fig. 3</xref>). These factors, however, are not independent. As expected, gene expression level and protein abundance are moderately correlated (Spearman's rho‚Ää=‚Ää0.3, <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;2e-16). Additionally, we noticed that protein length and abundance are inversely correlated to each other, with shorter proteins being more abundant (rho‚Ää=‚Ää‚àí0.41, <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;2e-16). Since we found that sampled proteins were longer but at the same time more abundant, correcting for protein length (by choosing a random subset of non-sampled proteins with the same length distribution as the set of sampled proteins) enhanced the difference in protein abundance even (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s005">Fig. S5</xref>). In addition, proteins that were sampled in both elution studies (<italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää160) were found to be more abundant than source proteins that emerged only in one of the data sets (median abundance‚Ää=‚Ää17.54 ppm (parts per million, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) compared to 3.15 ppm, <italic>p</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää1e-10). Moreover, we found a significantly higher rate of predicted binders (in the following referred to as the ‚Äúpredicted hit rate‚Äù) in sampled proteins, most pronounced for A*02:01-specific source proteins (median hit rate‚Ää=‚Ää0.3 for sampled proteins vs. 0.025 for non-sampled proteins, <italic>p</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää7e-14). Interestingly, within the same cell line, proteins that were sampled only by B*15:01 show a significantly lower predicted hit rate for A*02:01 than proteins that have been sampled by A*02:01 (median hit rate‚Ää=‚Ää0.030 vs. 0.026, <italic>p</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää7e-13), further emphasizing that the relative number of potential binding peptides does have an influence on sampling probability.</p>

        <title>Putting it all together - prediction of protein sampling</title>
        <p>Overall, all tested factors - protein length, gene expression level, protein abundance, and predicted hit rate - show differences between the set of sampled proteins and the proteins that were not sampled. In order to quantify the contribution of each factor and to determine which combination of factors best describes the data, we performed a multiple logistic regression analysis. Starting from a maximal model including all factors as explanatory variables, we obtained a minimal model by iterative exclusion of non-significant factors. Before running the regression, we first randomly picked a subset of non-sampled proteins to form a ‚Äúnegative‚Äù set of equal size as the positive set of sampled proteins. This balanced set of negative and positive data points was then used to perform a logistic regression and performance analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), which was repeated 100 times with different random negative subsets. The performance was measured as the Spearman correlation coefficient between the known sampling status (i.e., a binary value) and the predicted sampling probability. For all three HLA allotypes, a regression model combining protein abundance, protein length and predicted hit rate showed the best performance (the best examples are given in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g004">Fig. 4A‚ÄìC</xref>). Since we found that eluted peptides are more efficiently processed than other HLA-binding peptides, we tested whether we could improve the model by filtering the set of predicted binders for processing efficiency. For all three HLA allotypes, this filtering step improved the prediction performance only to a minor extent (results not shown). As gene expression and protein abundance are moderately correlated, we tested which of these two factors would carry more information for predicting protein sampling. We found that protein abundance clearly outcompetes gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g005">Fig. 5</xref>). Among the three HLA allotypes, the prediction performance of the B*27:05 model was best (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g004">Fig. 4C</xref>), with an average AUC (area under the receiver operating characteristic curve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Swets1">[25]</xref>) value of 0.74 compared to 0.70 for A*02:01 and 0.68 for B*15:01 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002517-g004">Fig. 4D</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Only a small fraction of the human proteome is sampled by the class I antigen processing pathway and presented on HLA class I molecules. Previously it was suggested that the cellular localization of a protein and its function play a role in this sampling process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Hickman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Juncker1">[23]</xref>. Here we show that other protein characteristics like protein length, abundance, and rate of predicted binders also largely influence the sampling probability of a protein and thereby shape the peptide repertoire of an HLA class I molecule.</p>
      <p>We analyzed two large peptide elution datasets; one derived from a vaccinia virus infected cell line, and one obtained from cells transfected with a gene encoding a soluble HLA class I molecule. Identification of the source protein of each peptide showed that, in spite of the huge difference in proteome size between human and vaccinia virus, a similar fraction of either proteome (10‚Äì12% of all proteins) was sampled by the antigen processing pathway. We characterized the set of eluted peptides in terms of antigen processing and presentation and observed a significantly higher binding affinity to the respective HLA molecule and more efficient processing for the eluted peptides than for other potential binders derived from the same set of source proteins. The predicted median affinity of eluted peptides was 14 nM IC50 for A*02:01, 65 nM IC50 for B*15:01, and 107 nM IC50 for B*27:05. These values are much lower than the 500 nM, which are often used as a threshold to discriminate HLA-binding peptides from non-binders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Sette1">[26]</xref>. This observation could reflect that high-affinity binders are preferentially loaded onto the HLA molecule among others with the help of the ER resident chaperone tapasin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Praveen1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Williams1">[28]</xref>, or that they have a longer ‚Äúlife span‚Äù on the cell surface because they form a more stable complex with the HLA molecule, which increases their chance of being eluted (even though this is rather related to the off-rate of a peptide than to its affinity). Especially for the elution studies involving soluble HLA molecules, it is not surprising to identify foremost high-affinity binders after the long affinity purification process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-BenDror1">[14]</xref>. A higher binding affinity of eluted peptides has also been found for mouse MHC class I molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Fortier1">[12]</xref>. If high-affinity peptides are able to outcompete lower affinity-peptides in binding to the HLA, this may result in a higher copy number of these peptides on the cell surface which in turn increases their chance to be detected by mass spectrometry. The nature of the data sets we analyzed does not allow us to study this because we do not have abundance data on the peptides. Instead we merely know whether a peptide was present in the eluate or not.</p>
      <p>To our surprise, most proteins were represented by only a single peptide in the elution data sets we studied. This is in line with the observation by Hickman <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Hickman1">[8]</xref> who found only 9 of 189 source proteins (4.8%) to be represented by more than one peptide.</p>
      <p>For the prediction of C-terminal processing, we employed a method that has been trained on the C-termini of known HLA ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Kesmir1">[17]</xref>. Initially intended as a predictor of proteasomal cleavage, the method automatically accounts for the contribution of other potential peptidases that are able to further process the carboxy terminus of proteasome products, as for example the carboxypeptidase ACE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Shen1">[6]</xref>. It does, however, not account for the activity of aminopeptidases in the cytosol and ER, which may further trim the amino termini of peptides. There is some evidence for the existence of N-terminal processing motives, which differ in specificity between cytosol and ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Schatz1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Hearn1">[30]</xref>. However, the lack of appropriate prediction methods prevented us from assessing the effect of N-terminal trimming of peptides in our analysis.</p>
      <p>For the data sets we studied, we observed that (i) source proteins are longer and more abundant than non-source proteins, (ii) the corresponding genes show higher expression levels, and (iii) source proteins show a higher rate of predicted binders than proteins that were not sampled. We combined these factors in a logistic regression model and conclude that prediction of protein sampling probability is possible to some degree. The best model made use of protein length, abundance, and predicted hit rate to predict the sampling probability of a protein. Fortier <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Fortier1">[12]</xref> observed that MHC-presented peptides are preferentially derived from highly abundant mRNAs. Our analysis confirmed the impact of gene expression reported earlier by Fortier <italic>et al.</italic>, but in addition, our results suggest that protein abundance carries more information for the prediction of protein sampling than transcript levels do.</p>
      <p>It has been argued that antigen processing should be correlated with protein turnover rather than cellular abundance of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Milner1">[10]</xref>. In addition, a recent study suggested that the pioneer round of mRNA translation, which serves as a ‚Äúproof-reading‚Äù step during mRNA maturation, might be a major source of HLA ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Apcher1">[31]</xref>. We believe that the model presented in this paper will improve considerably when more data is available describing the specificity and kinetics of peptide generation via these processes. Finally, another source of antigenic peptides are so-called defective ribosomal products (DRiPs), which are truncated and/or misfolded polypeptides that are directly targeted to proteasomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Yewdell1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Yewdell2">[33]</xref>. The DRiP hypothesis suggests that the set of MHC-presented peptides reflects recent protein synthesis rather than the protein content of the cell, which should manifest itself in our analysis as a higher correlation with gene expression level than with protein abundance. Even though this is not what we see, the fact that HLA ligands are preferentially derived from long proteins is in accordance with the DRiP hypothesis, because the chance of incorporating errors and of misfolding increases with protein length.</p>
      <p>A limitation of our analysis is the presumably high noise in the protein abundance and gene expression data. The abundance data was derived through meta-analysis from a multitude of different tissue types, even though there is considerable variation of protein abundance between cells and tissues. However, as Weiss <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002517-Weiss1">[34]</xref> report, the abundance data set consists mainly of house-keeping genes whose tissue-to-tissue expression variability is limited. Ideally, the analysis presented here should be repeated on a data set where mRNA levels, protein abundance, and HLA peptide presentation are measured simultaneously for a single cell type or tissue sample to minimize noise. All the more striking it is, however, that we see a clear signal for both gene expression and protein abundance in their impact on protein sampling in spite of the noise introduced by averaging over cell types.</p>
      <p>In conclusion, the results presented in this paper demonstrate that protein characteristics such as gene expression level, protein abundance, and the rate of HLA ligands determine which protein will be sampled for antigen presentation. Moreover, our results suggest that sampling prediction may be extended to the proteomes of pathogens, allowing us to identify promising targets for vaccination studies.</p>

The hit rate is calculated per HLA allele and hit rates may differ between alleles, because we use a fixed affinity threshold of 500 nM IC50 to define binders (instead of assigning a fixed fraction of peptides, e.g. top 1%, as binders).

The boxplots compare eluted 9mer peptides and predicted binders from the same set of source proteins in terms of (<bold>A</bold>) predicted C-terminal cleavage probability by the immunoproteasome and (<bold>B</bold>) predicted TAP transport efficiency. Here, the eluted peptides are compared to all predicted binders originating from the same set of source proteins. Similar results are obtained when using an affinity-matched subset of predicted binders (cf. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002517.s001">Fig. S1</xref>).</p>
