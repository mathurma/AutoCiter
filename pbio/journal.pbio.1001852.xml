<p>A novel role for Rabconnectin-3a in endosome maturation regulates Wnt signaling, migration, and fate specification in zebrafish neural crest cells.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cell migration requires dynamic regulation of cell–cell signaling and cell adhesion. Both of these processes involve endocytosis, lysosomal degradation, and recycling of ligand–receptor complexes and cell adhesion molecules from the plasma membrane. Neural crest (NC) cells in vertebrates are highly migratory cells, which undergo an epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) to leave the neural epithelium and migrate throughout the body to give rise to many different derivatives. Here we show that the v-ATPase interacting protein, Rabconnectin-3a (Rbc3a), controls intracellular trafficking events and Wnt signaling during NC migration. In zebrafish embryos deficient in Rbc3a, or its associated v-ATPase subunit Atp6v0a1, many NC cells fail to migrate and misregulate expression of cadherins. Surprisingly, endosomes in Rbc3a- and Atp6v0a1-deficient NC cells remain immature but still acidify. Rbc3a loss-of-function initially downregulates several canonical Wnt targets involved in EMT, but later Frizzled-7 accumulates at NC cell membranes, and nuclear B-catenin levels increase. Presumably due to this later Wnt signaling increase, Rbc3a-deficient NC cells that fail to migrate become pigment progenitors. We propose that Rbc3a and Atp6v0a1 promote endosomal maturation to coordinate Wnt signaling and intracellular trafficking of Wnt receptors and cadherins required for NC migration and cell fate determination. Our results suggest that different v-ATPases and associated proteins may play cell-type-specific functions in intracellular trafficking in many contexts.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The neural crest is a highly migratory population of embryonic cells, which requires Wnt signaling at several stages to promote migration and cell fate decisions. Intracellular trafficking of Wnt receptors and associated proteins can affect the timing and intensity of Wnt signaling. An obvious question is whether proton pumps and/or their partner proteins that are associated with intracellular vesicles might have a role in intracellular trafficking, Wnt signaling, and cell migration/adhesion. In this study we demonstrate such a role for Rabconnectin-3a, a protein associated with the vacuolar-ATPase (v-ATPase) proton pump complex. Loss of Rabconnectin-3a in zebrafish embryos disrupts the maturation of endocytic vesicles in neural crest cells, which has two effects: (1) decreasing Wnt signaling in these cells before migration and (2) increasing Wnt signaling after migration. Prior to migration, endosomes that fail to mature reduce Wnt signaling in neural crest cells and disrupt the localization and expression of cadherins, membrane-bound cell adhesion molecules required for these cells to initiate an epithelial-mesenchymal transition. At later stages, however, Wnt receptors accumulate at the membranes of unmigrated neural crest cells due to defective endocytosis, which correlates with high levels of Wnt signaling. Interestingly, Rabconnectin-3a-deficient neural crest cells that fail to migrate become pigment cells, presumably due to elevated Wnt signaling. Rabconnectin-3a may have a conserved role in endosomal maturation, Wnt signaling, and cell migration in many other cell populations.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The epithelial-mesenchymal transition (EMT) is characterized by loss of epithelial cell adhesion, dynamic expression and subcellular localization of cell–cell adhesion molecules, and increased cell motility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Hay1">[1]</xref>. EMT is a hallmark of cancer metastasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Thiery1">[2]</xref> and of many cell populations during embryogenesis. Neural crest (NC) cells in vertebrate embryos undergo a classic EMT to separate from the neural ectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Kerosuo1">[3]</xref> and become highly migratory progenitor cells, which give rise to a wide variety of cell types including cartilage and bone of the craniofacial skeleton, peripheral neurons/glia, and pigment cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-LeDouarin1">[4]</xref>. NC cells initiate EMT in response to a variety of external signals, but how these are integrated spatially and temporally to give rise to different NC cell populations is poorly understood.</p>
<p>Proper timing of signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Stuhlmiller1">[5]</xref> and dynamic expression and subcellular localization of adhesion molecules is required for NC EMT and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Nakagawa1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Piloto1">[9]</xref>. Secreted Wnt ligands bind to Frizzled (Fz) receptors to promote canonical Wnt signaling by stabilizing B-catenin (Bcat) in the cytosol and allowing it to translocate to the nucleus and regulate target gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-deMelker1">[10]</xref>. In NC cells this promotes EMT through downstream gene targets such as the transcription factors <italic>Snail</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Katoh1">[11]</xref>, <italic>Slug</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Wu1">[12]</xref>, and <italic>Twist</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Howe1">[13]</xref>. These transcription factors regulate many of the cellular changes required for EMT such as downregulation of epithelial cadherins (e.g., <italic>Ecad</italic>, <italic>Ncad</italic>) and subsequent upregulation of more “mesenchymal” cadherins (e.g., <italic>Cdh6</italic>, <italic>Cdh7</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Nakagawa1">[6]</xref>. Disrupting Wnt signaling prior to EMT prevents NC delamination and migration in chick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-BurstynCohen1">[14]</xref>, and reducing expression of <italic>Snail</italic> or <italic>Twist1</italic> prevents early NC migration in <italic>Xenopus</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-LaBonne1">[15]</xref>. Canonical Wnt signaling also determines trunk NC cell fate at later stages by driving a pigment progenitor fate at the expense of neuronal/glial fates, both in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Dorsky1">[16]</xref> and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Hari1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>Endocytosis and intracellular trafficking of Fz modulates Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Blitzer1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Bryja1">[19]</xref>. Moreover, formation of endocytic vesicular compartments containing Wnt-bound Fz receptors, termed “signalosomes,” can impact the intensity and response of the Wnt signal within a cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Bilic1">[20]</xref>. Regulation of endosomal pH can also attenuate Wnt and other signaling pathways. Intracellular vesicles acidify by the recruitment and activity of the vacuolar-ATPase (v-ATPase) complex, which pumps protons into the lumen of vesicles, lowering their pH. Adaptor proteins such as Prorenin Receptor recruit the v-ATPase complex to endosomes containing Fz and its co-receptor LRP5/6 and regulate Wnt signaling through modulation of intracellular pH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Cruciat1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>Rabconnectin-3a (Rbc3a) is a large, ∼325 kDa protein, highly conserved in multicellular organisms, which associates with its obligate binding partner, Rbc3b, and subunits of the v-ATPase complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Sakisaka1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Li1">[23]</xref>. Studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos and murine cell culture have shown that Rbc3a and Rbc3b are required for proper lysosomal acidification and regulation of the Notch signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Yan1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Sethi1">[25]</xref>. In these cases, Rbc3a is required for v-ATPase function in endosomes/lysosomes and lowers their luminal pH. Low vesicular pH is necessary for γ-secretase activity in the lysosome, which cleaves the Notch receptor and allows translocation of the Notch intracellular domain to the nucleus to promote downstream Notch signaling. Mutations in <italic>rbc3a</italic> in zebrafish reduce synaptic vesicle acidification in hair cells, leading to aberrant responses to acoustic stimuli at 5 d postfertilization (dpf) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Einhorn1">[26]</xref>. Rbc3a promotes the polarized colocalization of the Atp6v0a1 (V0a1) and Atp6v1a1 (V1a1) v-ATPase subunits within these hair cells, allowing the acidification of synaptic vesicles required for optimal synaptic function.</p>
<p>However, v-ATPase subunits have other functions in cells besides vesicle acidification. For example, in microglial cells in the zebrafish central nervous system, disruption of the v-ATPase subunit isoform V0a1 causes a failure of autophagosomes to mature and fuse, but they acidify normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Peri1">[27]</xref>. Additionally, when the fly ortholog of the V0a1 subunit, vha100-1, is deleted in fly photoreceptors, early endocytosis and recycling are disrupted, but endosomes still acidify <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Williamson1">[28]</xref>. Thus v-ATPase subunits may alter cell–cell signaling, such as Wnt signaling, through acidification-independent mechanisms, which may be shared with other partner proteins associated with intracellular vesicles such as Rbc3a.</p>
<p>Here we show that both zebrafish Rbc3a and V0a1 control intracellular trafficking events required for Wnt signaling during NC migration. <italic>rbc3a</italic> is highly expressed in premigratory NC cells. Embryos deficient in Rbc3a or V0a1 show NC-specific defects in endosomal maturation, expression of pro-EMT genes, and subsequent migration, which are acidification-independent. Wnt signaling is initially downregulated in these embryos but later rebounds, which correlates with the fact that unmigrated NC cells in Rbc3a-deficient embryos become pigment progenitors and not other NC cell types. We propose that Rbc3a promotes maturation and fusion of endosomes to regulate Wnt signaling in NC cells by altering the intracellular trafficking of receptors.</p>

<p><italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1 injections into transgenic <italic>Tg(7.2 kb-sox10:gfp)</italic>—hereafter referred to as <italic>sox10:gfp</italic>—embryos (which labels NC cells) revealed GFP+ dorsal midline cell aggregates at 24 hpf, which appeared to be NC cells that failed to migrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g002">Figure 2D–E′</xref>). Co-injection of 100 pg/embryo of full-length, <italic>in vitro</italic> transcribed <italic>rbc3a</italic> mRNA with <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1 significantly reduced the number of NC cells remaining in the dorsal midline (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Injection of a second, translation-blocking MO targeting the first ATG in the ORF of <italic>rbc3a</italic> (<italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO2, 5 ng/embryo) produced similar defects in the distribution of <italic>sox10:GFP</italic>+ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s003">Figure S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s013">Table S1</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 35/41 embryos; X<sup>2</sup> = 47.5, <italic>p</italic>≪0.001), which were also partially rescued by co-injection with full-length <italic>rbc3a</italic> mRNA, confirming specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s013">Table S1</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 11/21, X<sup>2</sup> = 9.94, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0016). Similar controls with <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO2 were not performed for subsequent experiments. Hereafter, unless otherwise noted, all Rbc3a knockdown experiments were performed with the <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1. Additionally, injection of a truncated <italic>Xenopus tropicalis rbc3a</italic> DNA construct (Open Biosystems, Accession No. BC127555) missing the 3′ ∼2,200 bp, which contains several predicted WD40-repeat domains, into <italic>sox10:gfp</italic> embryos produced similar NC migration defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Co-injection of this construct with subthreshold levels (1.0 ng/embryo) of <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1 had a synergistic effect, causing larger numbers of dorsal NC aggregates per embryo, suggesting that it acts as a dominant negative.</p>
<p>To determine if cells that aggregate in the dorsal midline of embryos injected with <italic>rbc3a-</italic>MO1 were NC cells that failed to migrate, we performed time-lapsed confocal imaging of control and <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected <italic>sox10:gfp</italic> embryos. Early premigratory NC appeared to form normally at 12 hpf and began to extend filopodia in <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected embryos, but by 16 hpf, many of these cells remained in distinct patches of GFP+ cells at the dorsal midline that were never seen in wild-type, <italic>sox10:gfp</italic> controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s011">Movies S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s012">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In contrast to wild-type NC cells (3 embryos, <italic>n</italic> = 12), NC cells in <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected embryos (3 embryos, <italic>n</italic> = 11) showed significant reductions in migration speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s005">Figure S5M</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and directionality/persistence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s005">Figure S5N</xref>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01—distance between initial and final cell position divided by the total distance traveled). These results suggest that NC cells in <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected embryos are motile, albeit at significantly reduced velocity, and fail to migrate directionally.</p>
<p>To determine if Rbc3a is required cell autonomously in NC cells, we transplanted <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected, <italic>sox10:lyn-tdtomato</italic> donor cells into wild-type hosts. A significant number of chimeras displayed midline NC aggregates (<italic>n</italic> = 9/17 embryos) compared to wild-type donor cells (<italic>n</italic> = 0/30; Chi-squared test—X<sup>2</sup> = 12.48, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001), indicating a cell-autonomous requirement for Rbc3a in NC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001852.s009">Figure S9D</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the identities of NC cells that remain at the midline in <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected embryos, we performed whole mount <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization with probes for different NC lineages in both <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected embryos and <italic>rbc3a</italic> mutants. At 28 hpf, dorsal midline NC aggregates in these embryos expressed melanophore (<italic>mitfa</italic>) and xanthophore (<italic>gch</italic>) progenitor markers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g002">Figure 2L–Q</xref>), but did not express markers for skeletogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g002">Figure 2F–H</xref>, <italic>dlx2</italic>) or gliogenic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g002">Figure 2I–K</xref>, <italic>foxd3</italic>) NC cells.

<title>Rbc3a Knockdown Disrupts Endocytosis But Not Endosome Acidification in NC</title>
<p>Rbc3a is known to associate with the v-ATPase complex and regulate lysosomal acidification in cells. Therefore, we examined the effects of Rbc3a knockdown on intracellular vesicle formation, acidification, and trafficking. In this case, we used <italic>Tg(7.2 kb-sox10:lyn-gfp)—</italic>hereafter referred to as <italic>sox10:lyn-gfp</italic>—trangenics, in which a membrane-localized variant of GFP was expressed in NC cells to avoid obscuring their intracellular organelles. Injection of <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1 led to the formation of large, clustered early endosomes within NC cells (<italic>n</italic> = 23 embryos), as determined by immunohistochemical staining with an antibody that recognizes Early Endosome Antigen 1 (EEA1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g003">Figure 3A–B′</xref>). However, surprisingly, these cells showed decreases in late endosomal/lysosomal size and number (<italic>n</italic> = 21 embryos), based on staining for Lysosomal Associated Membrane Protein 1 (LAMP1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g003">Figure 3C–D′</xref>).

Endosomal processing defects in <italic>rbc3a</italic>/<italic>v0a1</italic>-deficient NC cells resemble those seen in Drosophila photoreceptors, zebrafish microglia, and mouse embryonic fibroblasts lacking V0a1, all of which develop large acidified endosomal aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Peri1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Williamson1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Coen1">[36]</xref>. In other cell types, however, such as fly ovarian follicle or wing disc cells, or mammalian osteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Yan1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Einhorn1">[26]</xref>, Rbc3a and V0a1 control organelle acidification by regulating v-ATPase activity. Although acidification defects were not observed in NC cells of <italic>rbc3a</italic> or <italic>v0a1</italic>-deficient zebrafish embryos, V0a1 does regulate intracellular acidification of zebrafish hair cells of the lateral line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Einhorn1">[26]</xref>. Thus, deficiency of V0a1 in the same organism (zebrafish) causes different phenotypes (i.e., endosomal processing versus acidification defects) depending on the cell type examined.</p>
<p>Such cell-type specificity in V0a subunits is not unprecedented. Fly ovaries express high levels of the v0a2 subunit homolog and low levels of v0a1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Chintapalli1">[37]</xref>. The v0a3 subunit is expressed specifically in mammalian osteoclasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Toyomura1">[38]</xref>. Both V0a1 and V0a2 isoforms regulate both endocytosis and storage of neurotransmitter-containing vesicles, rather than just exocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Saw1">[39]</xref>. Rbc3a resides in synaptic vesicles in mammalian neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Kawabe1">[40]</xref> and drives co-localization of V0a1 and V1a1 subunits in zebrafish hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Einhorn1">[26]</xref>. Thus, V0a1/2 subunits can control vesicle uptake and storage in addition to their better-known roles in lysosomal acidification and may do so together with Rbc3a in many other cell types.</p>
<p>One possible explanation for the ability of endosomes to acidify in certain cell types deficient in Rbc3a and/or V0a1 likely relates to differences in binding partners for V0a1 and/or multiple isoforms of V0a that may exist in various cell types. For example, Drosophila V0a1 binds to a syntaxin necessary for endosomal membrane fusion, which likely explains why Drosophila photoreceptors deficient in V0a1 exhibit an early endosomal processing defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Williamson1">[28]</xref>. In addition, elegant studies in Drosophila have dissociated the regulation of endosomal processing from that of v-ATPase-activity in V0a1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Williamson1">[28]</xref>. V0a1 is not required for lysosomal acidification in mouse embryonic fibroblasts or rat PC12 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Coen1">[36]</xref>. Our results suggest that Rbc3a and V0a1 regulate endosomal fusion but not acidification by v-ATPase in NC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>

<title>Model for Rbc3a and V0a1 functions in NC cells.</title>
<p>(A) Rbc3a promotes association of a specific v0a1 isoform to early endosomes. In the absence of Rbc3a, endosomes acidify, but do not mature. (B) Rbc3a controls maturation of early endosomes (EE) containing Fz-Wnt complexes to contribute to multivesicular bodies (MVBs), which promote canonical Wnt signaling and EMT. In the absence of Rbc3a (or v0a1), canonical Wnt signaling decreases early (∼11 hpf) and increases later (∼20 hpf). Defects in EE maturation disrupt Fz-Wnt recycling and degradation, producing high levels of Fz-Wnt complexes at the cell membrane and aberrantly high levels of canonical Wnt signaling, which drives NC cells to a pigment progenitor fate.</p>

<p>Our results further suggest that abnormal endosomal maturation alters Wnt signaling in NC cells lacking Rbc3a and V0a1. Canonical Wnt signaling requires endocytosis, and intracellular v-ATPase–mediated acidification is necessary for phosphorylation of the Wnt receptor LRP6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Bilic1">[20]</xref>. Regulation of endocytosis and v-ATPase activity by Rbc3a/b also plays a critical role in Notch signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Yan1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Sethi1">[25]</xref>. Mounting evidence suggests that signal transduction via multiple cell surface receptors must occur in endosomal signaling protein complexes or “signalosomes” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Taelman1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Murphy1">[41]</xref>. Signalosomes allow coordinated regulation of receptor signaling, recycling, and/or degradation in a regulated microenvironment. We hypothesize that a reduction of Rbc3a and V0a1 disrupts signalosome function and interferes with Wnt signaling in NC cells. During early NC development, we observed increased cell surface staining of Bcat and reduced expression of multiple canonical Wnt target genes. During later stages of development, however, we observed a paradoxical increase in Wnt signaling in midline NC aggregates that failed to migrate. These nonmigrating midline NC aggregates showed increased cell surface Fz staining, increased nuclear Bcat staining, up-regulation of Wnt target genes, and became specified as pigment cells, which is known to be driven by canonical Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Dorsky1">[16]</xref>. Impaired lysosomal function and a build-up of endosomes can increase Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Dobrowolski1">[42]</xref>. Other Fz receptors and components of canonical Wnt signaling known to accumulate in endosomal bodies, such as GSK3B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Taelman1">[31]</xref>, may also contribute to this elevation in Wnt signaling. The early reduction and later increase in Wnt signaling in NC cells caused by Rbc3a and V0a1 deficiency may be secondary to differential expression of other signalosome components or other mechanisms of Wnt signaling that occur at different stages of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001852-g007">Figure 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>Changes in Wnt signaling, as well as endocytosis and Fz receptor localization, in response to Rbc3a knockdown appear to be NC-specific. Rbc3a-deficient NC cells display both reduced migration velocity and persistent directionality. Additionally, transplanted Rbc3a-deficient NC cells fail to migrate in a wild-type host. These observations and the specific expression of <italic>rbc3a</italic> in premigratory NC cells suggest a cell autonomous role for Rbc3a in NC development.</p>
<p>Both canonical (Bcat/Tcf-dependent) and noncanonical (PCP, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent) Wnt signaling plays important roles in NC development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-DeCalisto1">[43]</xref>, but several lines of evidence suggest that the main requirements for Rbc3a are in canonical signaling. First, <italic>rbc3a</italic> expression is highly enriched in NC cells prior to migration, when they require canonical Wnt signaling for induction and EMT, but not during later stages of migration, when noncanonical signaling has been implicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-CarmonaFontaine1">[44]</xref>. Second, loss of Rbc3a leads to specific defects in pigment cells, which are induced by canonical Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Wang1">[45]</xref>. Third, the timing of changes in expression of Wnt target genes, nuclear localization of Bcat, and membrane localization of Fz7b correlate with stages in which canonical signaling predominates, though Fz7b has been implicated in both canonical and noncanonical Wnt pathway activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-DeCalisto1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Medina1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p>Canonical Wnt signaling plays a major role in NC induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-GarciaCastro1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Steventon1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Villanueva1">[48]</xref>, but we have not detected defects in NC induction in <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected or mutant embryos. Rbc3a may only affect certain Wnt signaling pathways or Wnt family members, leading to specific downstream effects in migration but not NC induction. Alternatively, maternal <italic>rbc3a</italic> mRNA or protein may be sufficient to allow induction but not later stages of NC development.</p>
<p>We demonstrate that Rbc3a and V0a1 play important and novel roles in NC EMT and cell migration. Canonical Wnt signaling promotes NC EMT and delamination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-deMelker1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-BurstynCohen1">[14]</xref> by up-regulating expression of pro-EMT transcription factors such as Gbx2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Gao1">[49]</xref>, Snail2/Slug <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Wu1">[12]</xref>, and Twist1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Howe1">[13]</xref>. Our data indicate that Rbc3a and V0a1 are required for this Wnt response and suggest that they coordinate both cell signaling and cell adhesion during migration. Rbc3a and V0a1 knockdown reduce Bcat nuclear localization in premigratory NC as well as expression of pro-EMT, NC-specific Wnt targets. Snail1/2 and Twist1 promote EMT, in part by regulating expression of cell adhesion molecules, including Ecad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Cano1">[33]</xref> and Ncad levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Howe1">[13]</xref>. We show that in addition to reductions in <italic>snail2</italic> and <italic>twist1a</italic> expression, Rbc3a deficiency reduces <italic>ncad</italic> levels at the onset of NC migration. It also increases expression of <italic>cdh11</italic>, which normally must be down-regulated for proper NC EMT and delamination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Nakagawa1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Borchers1">[35]</xref>. Because of the close association between cadherins and Bcat, these differences in cadherin expression could be downstream of defects in Wnt signaling and pro-EMT target gene expression or could reflect defects in trafficking of cadherins directly. Either could explain the failure of <italic>rbc3a</italic>-deficient NC cells to undergo EMT, delaminate, and migrate. However, our results suggest that the reduction in canonical Wnt signaling comes first. We detect reductions in expression of canonical Wnt target genes by qPCR and <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization 2–3 h before changes in Ncad and other cadherins' (Ecad, Cdh11) expression in <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected embryos. In addition, nuclear localization of Bcat protein is reduced relative to its levels in membrane/cytoplasm in <italic>rbc3a</italic>-MO1–injected embryos at 11 hpf, prior to any differences in abundance or membrane versus cytoplasmic localization of Ncad protein.</p>
<p>Cells undergoing EMT and migration require the regulated function of several intertwined cellular processes: endocytosis, signal transduction, and cell adhesion molecule localization. Rbc3a and V0a1 provide a novel link between all of these processes in NC development. Although previous work has shown the importance of Rbc3a in Notch signaling, we propose a novel role for Rbc3a in Wnt signaling in NC cells, as well as a more general role in EMT and cell migration through the recruitment of V0a1. The yeast orthologues of Rbc3a and Rbc3b simply promote the association of the V0 and V1 units of the v-ATPase and its function in acidification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001852-Smardon1">[50]</xref>. In multicellular organisms, Rbc3a may have gained a role driving the association of specific v-ATPase subunit isoforms and other adaptor proteins in specialized cell types and specific cellular transitions. Rbc3a is expressed in multiple migratory cell types in the zebrafish and other species, and Rbc3a's potential role in EMT/migration may serve as a new avenue of developmental biological investigation as well as a therapeutic target in cancer metastasis.</p>
