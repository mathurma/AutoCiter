<abstract>
<p>Although quorum-sensing (QS) systems are important regulators of virulence gene expression in the opportunistic human pathogen <italic>Pseudomonas aeruginosa</italic>, their detailed regulatory mechanisms have not been fully characterized. Here, we show that deletion of PA2588 resulted in increased production of pyocyanin and biofilm, as well as enhanced pathogenicity in a mouse model. To gain insights into the function of PA2588, we performed a ChIP-seq assay and identified 28 targets of PA2588, including the intergenic region between PA2588 and <italic>pqsH</italic>, which encodes the key synthase of <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> quinolone signal (PQS). Though the C-terminal domain was similar to DNA-binding regions of other AraC family members, structural studies revealed that PA2588 has a novel fold at the N-terminal region (NTR), and its C-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) domain is also unique in DNA recognition. We also demonstrated that the adaptor protein ClpS, an essential regulator of ATP-dependent protease ClpAP, directly interacted with PA2588 before delivering CdpR to ClpAP for degradation. We named PA2588 as CdpR (<underline>C</underline>lpAP-<underline>d</underline>egradation and <underline>p</underline>athogenicity <underline>R</underline>egulator). Moreover, deletion of <italic>clpP</italic> or <italic>clpS/clpA</italic> promotes bacterial survival in a mouse model of acute pneumonia infection. Taken together, this study uncovered that CdpR is an important QS regulator, which can interact with the ClpAS-P system to regulate the expression of virulence factors and pathogenicity.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Although many transcriptional regulators tune <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> virulence factor expression and secretion, the molecular mechanisms of the underlying regulatory network are still elusive. Quorum sensing, the ability of bacteria to communicate and detect cell density to determine the most advantageous time to orchestrate collective events, is known to govern <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> virulence. In this study, we present a novel AraC-family transcription factor, CdpR (PA2588), that controls numerous virulence factors via directly regulating the quorum sensing <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> quinolone signal (PQS) system. We solved the crystal structure of CdpR, which showed that its N-terminal domain contains a unique fold that is different from other AraC-family proteins. In addition, we found that CdpR is regulated by the ClpAS-ClpP protease. CdpR interacts with the adaptor protein ClpS and then is degraded by the ATP-dependent ClpAP protease. This is the first example of a quorum-sensing regulator as a substrate of the ClpAS-ClpP protease in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. These findings significantly extend our understandings of quorum sensing and virulence regulation and provide insights into the function of proteases in pathogenic bacteria.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p><italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> is one of the most common nosocomial pathogens associated with fatal lung disease in cystic fibrosis patients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref001">1</xref>]. This bacterium synthesizes a group of virulence factors consisting of pyocyanin, rhamnolipids, proteases, and biofilms that are regulated by a cell density-dependent quorum-sensing (QS) system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref003">3</xref>] and second messenger c-di-GMP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref004">4</xref>].</p>
<p>QS systems enable bacteria to communicate and regulate a large number of genes. <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> has one of the most sophisticated QS systems of all bacterial species, which includes two systems (<italic>las</italic> and <italic>rhl</italic>) based on N-acyl-homoserine lactones (AHLs) and one based on 2-alkyl-4-quinolone (AQ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref002">2</xref>]. The LasI synthase produces the signal of the <italic>las</italic> system, <italic>N</italic>-3-oxo-dodecanoyl homoserine lactone (3-oxo-C<sub>12</sub>-HSL), which is recognized by the transcriptional regulator LasR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref005">5</xref>]. The RhlI synthase catalyzes the synthesis of <italic>N</italic>-butanoyl homoserine lactone (C<sub>4</sub>-HSL), which is sensed by the transcriptional regulator RhlR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref006">6</xref>]. These two systems control 10% of the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref008">8</xref>]. Besides the AHLs systems, <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> also produces the AQ signal molecule [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref009">9</xref>]. <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> quinolone signal (PQS) is synthesized from the precursor molecule 2-heptyo-4(1H)-quinolone (HHQ) and finally converted into PQS by PqsH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref010">10</xref>]. Moreover, these three systems and a group of transcriptional regulators (such as VqsR, QscR, VqsM, Vfr, and RpoN) form a complex regulatory network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>Intracellular protein degradation plays essential roles in many physiological processes such as cell growth and division. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, proteolysis is mainly mediated by ATP-dependent proteolytic machineries (termed AAA+ proteases) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref012">12</xref>], which consist of a proteolytic barrel (e.g., heptameric ClpP) and a hexameric ATPase (e.g., ClpA, ClpX). The ATP-binding proteins ClpX and ClpA recognize a specific peptide sequence of unfolded proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref014">14</xref>], and translocate the tags into the peptidase barrel of ClpP, thus degrading the unfolded protein into small peptides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref015">15</xref>]. In addition, adaptor proteins (i.e., ClpS) are responsible for binding and transporting their target proteins to the protease complexes for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref016">16</xref>]. In <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, the Lon and ClpP proteases share 84% and 86% identity with their <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> counterparts, which suggest that these proteases also play important roles in the degradation of unstable or misfolded proteins in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Moreover, the ATP-dependent ClpP protease has been shown to control virulence, antibiotic resistance, and a group of metabolic pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref017">17</xref>]. However, the substrates and molecular mechanism of ClpP in regulating bacterial pathogenesis are still unclear.</p>
<p>In this study, we showed that the new QS regulator CdpR (we named PA2588 in this study) directly activated PqsH, the PQS synthase. CdpR regulated the expression of virulence factors (i.e., pyocyanin and motility) and bacterial pathogenicity of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Unlike other AraC-family proteins, the C-terminal HTH (helix-turn-helix) motif of CdpR has a unique conformation, which may play important roles in DNA recognition. Structural comparison also revealed that the N-terminal region (NTR) of CdpR has a novel fold whose function remains elusive. We also found that CdpR interacts with adaptor protein ClpS and is degraded by the ClpAP protease in vivo. Moreover, the deletion of <italic>clpP</italic> or <italic>clpS/clpA</italic>-promoted bacterial survival in a mouse model of acute pneumonia. To the best of our knowledge, this is the first report showing the degradation of a regulator of the alginate system by ClpAS-P proteases in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Overall, these findings establish a link between proteases ClpAS-P and virulence, which provides us with new insights into investigate the roles of proteases in the future.</p>

<title>Deletion of <italic>cdpR</italic>-Altered <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> Phenotypes</title>
<p>Previously, we showed that the QS regulator VqsM directly binds to the promoter region of the <italic>PA2588</italic>(<italic>cdpR</italic>) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref018">18</xref>]. Its N-terminus (amino acids 59â€“198) is homologous to the arabinose-binding domain of the AraC transcription regulator (N-term; pfam12625), suggesting that it may be an AraC-family transcriptional regulator. Given that <italic>lasI</italic> and <italic>cdpR</italic> are directly controlled by VqsM, we hypothesized that CdpR also regulates <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> QS-associated virulence factors, such as pyocyanin production. To this end, we made a <italic>cdpR</italic> null mutant in the PAO1 strain by following procedures from our previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref018">18</xref>]. The resulting Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant exhibited higher pyocyanin production than wild-type PAO1 after 24 h of growth in Luria-Bertani (LB) medium. Overexpression of <italic>cdpR</italic> in a pAK1900 plasmid (T7 promoter) decreased the pyocyanin production in the <italic>cdpR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>Two homologous operons are involved in the synthesis of phenazine compounds (i.e, pyocyanin) in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>, <italic>phzA1B1C1D1G1</italic> (<italic>phzA1</italic>) and <italic>phzA2B2C2D2G2</italic>(<italic>phzA2</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref019">19</xref>]. The increased pyocyanin production in the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> strain led us to test if <italic>cdpR</italic> regulates the promoter activity of <italic>phzA1</italic>. To this end, a <italic>phzA1-lux</italic> reporter was introduced into the wild-type, the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant, and its complemented strain. The expression of <italic>phzA1-lux</italic> in the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant was 3-fold higher than in the wild-type PAO1 or its complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

<p>The enhanced pyocyanin production in the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant led us to test if <italic>cdpR</italic> regulates other QS-related pathways, such as biofilm formation and bacterial motility. We performed microtiter dish and borosilicate tube binding assays to evaluate the biofilm formation of these strains. The Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant exhibited better adherence than either the wild-type or the complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition, deletion of <italic>cdpR</italic> resulted in reduced swarming motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).

<title>ChIP-seq Identified CdpR Targets in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> Genome</title>
<p>In order to dissect the regulatory mechanism of CdpR, we performed a ChIP-seq assay to identify its direct targets in the <italic>Pseudomonas</italic> genome. Like untagged CdpR, CdpR-VSV (overexpressed in the plasmid pAK1900) was also able to decrease the expression of <italic>phzA1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).Using MACS software for identifying conserved DNA motif bound by CdpR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref020">20</xref>], 28 enriched loci (<italic>p</italic>-value = e<sup>âˆ’5</sup>) were identified to carry CdpR-binding peaks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s011">S1 Table</xref>), which were enriched &gt; 1.5 folds compared to the control samples using the wild-type without VSV tags. Eighty-nine percent of these 28 loci are located within coding regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). For example, CdpR binds to the coding region of PA0440 gene in the immunoprecipitated sample, while the enrichment in PA0440 was not present in the input sample (the wild-type PAO1 strain with empty pAK1900 vector) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). We further categorized the biological processes of CdpR targets based on gene ontology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref021">21</xref>], including metabolism (28%), secretion (7%), regulation (4%), nucleic acid metabolism (3%), transportation (11%), virulence (11%), and unknown functions (36%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). The ChIP-seq data also allowed us to define a 15-bp consensus-binding motif of CdpR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g002">Fig 2D</xref>) using multiple EM for motif elicitation (MEME) analysis.</p>

<p>In order to determine if the motif (CTGCGCCTGGATGAT) was important for binding to CdpR, we performed EMSAs again using a <italic>pqsH-p1</italic> DNA fragment (âˆ’365 to +88 relative to the start codon of <italic>pqsH</italic>, without the binding motif) and a <italic>pqsH-M-p</italic> DNA fragment (the motif CTGCGCCTGGATGAT was mutated to <underline>TGACTT</underline>CTGGATGAT). Neither the <italic>pqsH-p1</italic> nor <italic>pqsH-M-p</italic> fragments were able to bind to CdpR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s004">S3A Fig</xref>). As expected, CdpR could not bind to the <italic>sphR-p1</italic> or <italic>cerN-p1</italic> fragment (without the binding motif) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s002">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next tested if CdpR controls the expression of <italic>pqsH</italic> or itself in vivo. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, the promoter activity of <italic>pqsH</italic> (<italic>pqsH-lux</italic>, âˆ’500 to +88 relative to the start codon) in the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant strain was drastically weaker than that in the parental strain. Overexpression of <italic>cdpR</italic> gene in the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> strain restored the expression of <italic>pqsH</italic> to the wild-type level. This result was further echoed by western blotting of the strains carrying an integrated mini-CTX-<italic>pqsH</italic>-<italic>flag</italic> plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g003">Fig 3E</xref>).

The NTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) is of <italic>Pa</italic>CdpR that is of Î±/Î² fold in nature; it is composed of ten Î±-helices (Î±1 to Î±10) and five Î²-strands (Î²1 to Î²5). The Î² strands form a single-layer Î²-sheet. The last strand (Î²5) sits in the center, whereas Î²2 and Î²1 locate on one side, and Î²3 and Î²4 locate on the other side. Except Î²4, which is parallel to Î²3, all the other strands are antiparallel to each other. The Î±-helices can be divided in two groups: group A (Î±1 to Î±5) and group B (Î±6 to Î±10). Group B Î±-helices were clamped between the A group helices and the Î²-sheet. Four helices, Î±9, Î±10, Î±6, and Î±7 were packed against the Î²-sheet at the edge in an anti-clockwise direction, while Î±8 (the longest helices) crossed the Î²-sheet in the middle and formed extensive hydrophobic interactions with the three central strands (Î²2, Î²5, and Î²3).</p>

Though both CdpR NTR and <italic>Ec</italic>AraC NTD are of Î±/Î² fold in nature, their overall folds are different from each other. <italic>Ec</italic>AraC NTD has a jelly-roll fold Î²-barrel, which holds the arabinose in between the double-layer beta-sheet (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s005">S4A Fig</xref>). Moreover, no sequence similarity was observed between CdpR NTR and <italic>Ec</italic>AraC NTD. These differences suggested that CdpR NTR and <italic>Ec</italic>AraC NTD may have different functions. To this end, we carried out an in vitro DNA binding assay. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s005">S4B Fig</xref>, the CdpRâ€“DNA interaction was almost identical in the presence or absence of arabinose, suggesting that arabinose is not a cofactor of CdpR.

<p>The interaction modes between HTH1 and HTH2 motifs are also different within these structures. In <italic>Ec</italic>MarA and <italic>sg</italic>AdpA structures, loop A and loop B interact with each other via backbone van der Waals contacts; however, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6B</xref>, such interaction was not observed in CdpR, indicated by the shortest distance (6.7 Ã…) between the loop backbones. Instead, CdpR HTH1 and HTH2 mainly interact with each other through the backbone of loop B (aa 303â€“304) and the side chain of Tyr245 from loop A. This interaction was further enhanced by Arg281 and Arg284 of helice Î±16, which connects HTH1 and HTH2 and Tyr305 of loop B, via H-bonding and stacking. Both Tyr245 and Arg284 of CdpR are not conserved in other AraC-family proteins.</p>
<p>HTH domains are responsible for target DNA recognition, and the complex structures have been solved for <italic>Ec</italic>MarA and <italic>sg</italic>AdpA. To better understand the mechanism of CdpR-DNA recognition, we also carried out molecular modeling study. CdpR HTH may recognize the DNA base pairs using two positive charged residues (Arg260 and Arg264), corresponding to Arg262 and Arg266 of <italic>sg</italic>AdpA. In <italic>sg</italic>AdpA HTHâ€“DNA structure, DNA backbones form several H-bonds with the side chains of positive charged residues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Arg312 and Arg317 of CdpR HTH are corresponding to Arg315 and Arg320 of <italic>sg</italic>AdpA. The other four residues (Arg261, Arg269, Arg309, and His317) of <italic>sg</italic>AdpA are not conserved, but Arg263 of CdpR may replace Arg261 of <italic>sg</italic>AdpA during DNA recognition, supported by the similar orientations of their guanine groups. Structural analysis did not reveal any residues of CdpR, which could form H-bonds with DNA similar to Arg269, Arg309, and His317 of <italic>sg</italic>AdpA; lack of extensive interactions with DNA backbones may be the main cause of the weak CdpR-DNA binding affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to experimentally confirm the proposed structural model for CdpR-DNA complex, conserved residues predicted to contact DNA (Arg263, Arg274, Arg312, and Arg317) were mutated to Ala. We next performed EMSAs for comparing the ability of purified wild-type CdpR to bind a DNA probe encompassing the <italic>pqsH</italic>-<italic>cdpR</italic> intergenic region with those of its mutated derivatives. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, CdpR<sup>wt</sup> was able to shift about 50% of the probe at a concentration of 0.5 Î¼M, while CdpR<sup>R263A</sup>, CdpR<sup>R274A</sup>, and CdpR<sup>R312A/R317A</sup> were unable to shift the same DNA probe even at a concentration of 2 Î¼M. To future confirm these residues are important for CdpR activity, we tested the expression of <italic>pqsH-lux</italic> in the <italic>cdpR</italic> mutant containing the expressing plasmid p-<italic>cdpR</italic><sup>R263A</sup>, p-<italic>cdpR</italic><sup>R274A</sup>, or p-<italic>cdpR</italic><sup>R312A/317A</sup>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, mutation of these residues did not restore the <italic>pqsH</italic> activity of <italic>cdpR</italic> mutant to wild-type levels. These results clearly suggest that these residues are important for CdpR activity and confirm the CdpR-DNA model is accurate.</p>

<title>Identification of Mutants with Altered CdpR Expression</title>
<p>In order to identify regulators of <italic>cdpR</italic>, its promoter was used as a reporter (CTX-<italic>cdpR</italic>-<italic>lux</italic>) and subjected to transposon mutagenesis. After three rounds of screening of 8,000 mutants, 4 positive and 10 negative mutants were selected. Genes inserted by transposon were determined via arbitrary primed PCR and subsequent DNA sequencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s012">S2 Table</xref>). Interestingly, mutation of <italic>lasI</italic> compromised the expression of <italic>cdpR</italic> compared to wild-type PAO1, suggesting that LasI is a positive regulator of <italic>cdpR</italic>. The expression of <italic>cdpR</italic> was increased in the M6 (<italic>cdpR</italic>::<italic>Tn</italic>) strain compared to the wild-type strain, which is consistent with the observation in the <italic>cdpR</italic> deletion mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s007">S6A Fig</xref>). As expected, pyocyanin production was also elevated in the M6 strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s007">S6B Fig</xref>). We noted that <italic>vqsM</italic> was missing in our screen, which might result from limited number (8,000) of mutants.</p>
<p>Of these genes, we are most interested in the ATP-dependent protease ClpP, which associates with ClpS (ATP-dependent Clp protease adaptor protein) and ClpA (ATP-binding protease component). These mutants showed very strong phenotypes, revealing that they are involved in CdpR-controlled pathway. Moreover, previous study has shown that ClpP is related to bacterial virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref027">27</xref>]. <italic>clpS</italic> and <italic>clpA</italic> share the same operon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref028">28</xref>]. To further verify the effects of the <italic>clpS</italic>/<italic>clpP</italic> transposon insertion, we made a <italic>clpS-clpA</italic> double mutant (Î”<italic>clpS</italic>Î”<italic>clpA</italic>) and a <italic>clpP</italic> single mutant (Î”<italic>clpP</italic>). As expected, the activity of <italic>cdpR-lux</italic> in these two deletion strains was higher than that in the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s008">S7A Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>We next wanted to verify whether the protein level of CdpR was affected by these proteases. To this end, we constructed the CTX-<italic>cdpR-flag</italic> fusion and the activity of CdpR-<italic>flag</italic> was shown the same as the wild-type CdpR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s008">S7B Fig</xref>). Next, we tested the expression of CdpR-Flag in the wild-type PAO1, the Î”<italic>clpS</italic>Î”<italic>clpA</italic> mutant, the Î”<italic>clpP</italic> mutant, and their complemented strains (Î”<italic>clpS</italic>Î”<italic>clpA/p-clpSclpA</italic>, and Î”<italic>clpP/p-clpP</italic>) using western-blot assay. Higher levels of CdpR-Flag were detected in the Î”<italic>clpS</italic>Î”<italic>clpA</italic> or Î”<italic>clpP</italic> mutant than in the wild-type strain. The complemented strains restored CdpR-Flag to the wild-type levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s008">S7C Fig</xref>). As expected, the expression of <italic>pqsH</italic> in Î”<italic>clpS</italic>Î”<italic>clpA</italic> or Î”<italic>clpP</italic> mutants was also higher than the wild-type PAO1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s009">S8 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that ClpS/ClpA and ClpP negatively regulate the expression of CdpR.</p>

<title>CdpR Interacted with Adaptor ClpS and Was Degraded by ClpAP Protease</title>

<title>ClpS and ClpAP Modulated <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> Pathogenicity</title>
<p>A group of proteases has been shown to modulate <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> virulence. For example, the deletion of Lon protease exhibits a defect in cell division and virulence-related properties, such as swarming, twitching, and biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref031">31</xref>].

In the present study, ClpS/ClpA and ClpP controlled the expression of CdpR, which negatively regulated pyocyanin production and bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we present the first characterization of CdpR as an important regulator of QS system that directly binds to the promoter region of <italic>pqsH</italic>. We also solved the crystal structure of CdpR and revealed that CdpR NTD has a unique fold that is different from other AraC-family proteins. In addition, we found that CdpR interacts with ClpS before degradation by ClpAP proteases, thus regulates the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> virulence.</p>
<p>Although the QS systems in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> have been widely characterized in the last several decades, the complete signaling network and interactions with other systems still remain elusive. Previously, we showed that the QS regulator VqsM interacts with the promoter of <italic>cdpR</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref018">18</xref>]. Like VqsM, CdpR belongs to the AraC-family transcriptional regulators, which control a variety of cellular processes in bacteria, including carbon metabolism, stress responses, and virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref021">21</xref>]. We performed a ChIP-seq assay that revealed 28 CdpR targets in the <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> genome. More importantly, CdpR directly regulates the PQS system by binding to the promoter of <italic>pqsH</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g003">Fig 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s004">S3 Fig</xref>). The Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant exhibited higher pyocyanin and biofilm production as well as reduced bacterial motility (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which are controlled by the PQS system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref033">33</xref>]. Moreover, CdpR plays important roles in regulating bacterial pathogenicity in a mouse experiment. Mice inoculated with the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant showed more bacterial loads than mice infected with the wild-type strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The increased pathogenicity corresponds to the higher production of pyocyanin in the Î”<italic>cdpR</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g001">Fig 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>Like the other AraC-family proteins, CdpR has an NTD whose function is deemed as binding to small molecules and a HTH region, which binds to a special substrate. From our ChIP-seq results, CdpR can target many genes, but its DNA binding affinity is relatively lower than other identified AraC proteins. This is due to the lack of positively charged residues in HTH domain that can interact with the DNA backbones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s006">S5 Fig</xref>). Unlike other AraC-family proteins that can bind arabinose using NTD domain and alter the gene regulation activity, CdpR has a novel NTR region, and its interaction with target DNAs is not affected by arabinose (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s005">S4 Fig</xref>). CdpR NTR may also play a role in the gene regulation via the interaction with other proteins or small molecules. Besides, analysis of the CdpR structure revealed that the conformation of CdpR HTH is different from other AraC proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). The proposed structural model for CdpR-DNA complex demonstrated that Arg263, Arg274, Arg312, and Arg317 are important for DNA-binding ability of CdpR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), which has been verified by in vitro EMSA and in vivo complemented assays where these residues were mutated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). Overall, our results provide insights into the function of AraC-family protein in different bacteria.</p>
<p>To further understand the regulatory mechanism upstream of CdpR, we performed a transposon mutagenesis assay that revealed several mutants showing altered expression of <italic>cdpR</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s012">S2 Table</xref>). The expression of <italic>cdpR</italic> was highly compromised in a mutant containing a transposon insertion in <italic>clpAP</italic>, which encodes ATP-dependent proteases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref034">34</xref>]. Proteases ClpAP and Lon are involved in bacterial virulence expression, antibiotic resistance, and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref027">27</xref>]. Lon protease negatively modulates QS by degrading autoinducer synthase LasI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref035">35</xref>]. Our present study showed that CdpR interacted with the adaptor ClpS, and CdpR protein was degraded by the ClpAP protease in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g007">Fig 7</xref>). To the best of our knowledge, this is the first evidence showing the substrates of ClpS-ClpAP in <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic>. Further work needs to focus on the precise binding sites between ClpS and CdpR.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we identified an AraC-family regulator, CdpR, which negatively modulates bacterial virulence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002449.g009">Fig 9</xref>). CdpR is a substrate of ATP-dependent ClpAP protease. CdpR also regulates the expression of <italic>pqsH</italic> by directly binding to its promoter regions. CdpR is positively modulated by LasI (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002449.s012">S2 Table</xref>) and VqsM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref018">18</xref>]. CdpR may work with other negative QS regulators, such as QscR and RsaL, to negatively regulate QS. In addition, ClpS interacts with CdpR and then associates with ClpAP to degrade CdpR. CdpR might indirectly regulate the expression of virulence factors, thus negatively controls <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> pathogenicity. This work provides insight into roles of proteases in QS and bacterial virulence, which provides more cues to design effective antimicrobial drugs for the prevention of <italic>P</italic>. <italic>aeruginosa</italic> infections in the future.</p>

Animal experimental procedures, including treatment, care, and end point choice, followed Animal Research: Reporting in Vivo Experiment guidelines. When moribund animals manifested distress and/or mortal signs, such as lethargy, weight loss (15%â€“25%), lack of eating or drinking, tissue rupture, or edema, we considered these as endpoints and humanely euthanized them immediately by CO<sub>2</sub>. Recovery of the animals was achieved without complications, but we monitored hourly until they were awake and active after procedures and then every 6 h. Animals were monitored daily throughout the experimental process. Once sedation was diminished, the mice acted normally and appeared playful. There generally was no apparent pain from the intranasal instilling procedure. If any pain sign occurred, a 1% solution of lidocaine was applied to lessen pain.</p>

<p>The complex structures have been solved for two AraC family proteins, <italic>Ec</italic>MarA (PDB code: 1BL0) and <italic>sg</italic>AdpA (PDB code: 3W6V).

The <italic>Pa</italic>CdpR HTHâ€“DNA complex was modeled in three steps. In the <italic>sg</italic>AdpA HTHâ€“DNA complex structure, two symmetry-related DNA duplexes interact with the two DNA recognition helices (which are Î±15and Î±18 in <italic>Pa</italic>CdpR) from one protein molecule; and the two DNA duplexes are not broken, due to the lacking of 5'-phosphate groups. Therefore, the first step was the generation of 5'-phosphate groups and bridging it with the 3'-OH of its neighboring nucleotide, resulting continuous DNA duplex. Second, the modified DNA was docked on the <italic>Pa</italic>CdpR HTH structure, via the superimposing of the modified <italic>sg</italic>AdpA HTHâ€“DNA structure with <italic>Pa</italic>CdpR HTH. The rmsd between the overall structure of <italic>Pa</italic>CdpR HTH and <italic>sg</italic>AdpA HTH is 1.7 Ã…, based on 111 pairs of Catoms. Finally, the side chains of some residues, including Arg260, Arg263, Arg264, Arg265, Arg274, and Arg317, were adjusted to avoid the clashes between protein and DNA.

<title>Nitroblue Tetrazolium (NBT) Assay</title>
<p>AM cells were cultured in 96-well plates at 37Â°C with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> overnight. NBT dye (Sigma) was added to AM cells following the manufacturerâ€™s procedures. The yellow-colored NBT changes to blue when oxidized by superoxide from AM cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref057">57</xref>]. The plate was kept at room temperature overnight for complete formation of dye product, which is monitored by a plate reader at 560 nm. Each experiment was conducted in three repeats.</p>

<title>Histological Analysis</title>
<p>After BAL procedures and serum collection, lung tissues were fixed in 10% formalin using a routine histologic procedure. Ten Î¼l of BAL and serum were applied on microscope slide. The PMN numbers were counted under a light microscope using a Hema staining kit (Thermofisher). Homogenizations of lung tissues were done using liquid nitrogen then dissolved in RIPA buffer and sonicated (10 s sonication with 10 s intervals, 3 times) for next analysis. Tissue damage was determined by H&amp;E staining in formalin-fixed tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002449.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
