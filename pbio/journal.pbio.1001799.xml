<abstract>
<p>Developmental programming links growth in early life with health status in adulthood. Although environmental factors such as maternal diet can influence the growth and adult health status of offspring, the genetic influences on this process are poorly understood. Using the mouse as a model, we identify the imprinted gene <italic>Grb10</italic> as a mediator of nutrient supply and demand in the postnatal period. The combined actions of <italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the mother, controlling supply, and <italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the offspring, controlling demand, jointly regulate offspring growth. Furthermore, <italic>Grb10</italic> determines the proportions of lean and fat tissue during development, thereby influencing energy homeostasis in the adult. Most strikingly, we show that the development of normal lean/fat proportions depends on the combined effects of <italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the mother, which has the greater effect on offspring adiposity, and <italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the offspring, which influences lean mass. These distinct functions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mother and pup act complementarily, which is consistent with a coadaptation model of imprinting evolution, a model predicted but for which there is limited experimental evidence. In addition, our findings identify <italic>Grb10</italic> as a key genetic component of developmental programming, and highlight the need for a better understanding of mother-offspring interactions at the genetic level in predicting adult disease risk.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Experiences during early life can impact on health status in adulthood; low birth weight, for example, is linked to an increased risk of diabetes and obesity in later life. Such developmental programming can be influenced by environmental factors such as diet, but the importance of genetics in this process is not well understood. Using the mouse as a model, we investigate the gene <italic>Grb10</italic>, which is imprinted, meaning that it is expressed from only one of its two copies. We show that <italic>Grb10</italic> is a key mediator of developmental programming, controlling supply and demand of nutrients in the postnatal period and influencing growth and body composition. Specifically, we find that <italic>Grb10</italic> determines the proportions of lean and fat tissue during development, and that this is dependent on the combined actions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in the mother and offspring. Our findings have two main implications. First, they suggest that the functions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mother and offspring are coadapted, providing support for a coadaptation model for the evolution of imprinted genes. Second, they highlight the need for a better grasp of how maternal and offspring genetics interact during development if we are to understand more fully the causes of complex adult disorders such as obesity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Growth during prenatal and postnatal development influences adult health status. In humans, low birth weight is associated with an increased risk of metabolic diseases, including obesity and diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-McMillen1">[1]</xref>. In addition to overall size, disproportionate growth during development is also a risk factor for common adult diseases, including coronary heart disease and high blood pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Barker1">[2]</xref>. It is well-established that environmental stresses, such as poor maternal diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Victora1">[3]</xref>, can influence offspring growth, but the genetic control of developmental programming is not fully understood. Additionally, most studies have focused on prenatal development, but development in the postnatal period is also critical in influencing adult health status (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-MartinGronert1">[4]</xref>).</p>
<p>The genetic control of growth and nutrient acquisition <italic>in utero</italic> is mediated in part by imprinted genes, defined by their expression from a single parental allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-FergusonSmith1">[5]</xref>. In the placenta, paternally expressed genes generally promote growth and maternally expressed genes suppress growth. For many genes, this pattern is thought to reflect conflict between the parental genomes, played out within the offspring, over maternal resource allocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Moore1">[6]</xref>. Females maximise lifetime reproductive success by evenly distributing their resources to offspring (since a mother is equally related to all of her offspring). However, when there is multiple paternity within or among litters, males are only related to some offspring produced by a female, and so it is in his genetic interest for his offspring to extract as much of his mate's resources as possible. The functions of a number of imprinted genes are consistent with the predictions of this “parental conflict hypothesis.” For example, deletion of the paternally expressed <italic>Igf2</italic> P0 transcript in the mouse placenta causes a failure in the supply of nutrients to the developing fetus, resulting in growth restriction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Constancia1">[7]</xref>. Conversely, deficiency of the maternally expressed gene <italic>Grb10</italic> causes placental overgrowth and increases placental efficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous1">[8]</xref>. Conflict between the parental genomes appears to be conserved in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Frost1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>Postnatally, the majority of imprinted genes influence aspects of metabolism or behaviour. <italic>Grb10</italic> is an intriguing example of an imprinted gene with diverse postnatal functions. We have previously generated and characterised <italic>Grb10</italic> knockout mice to show that <italic>Grb10</italic> is expressed from the maternally inherited allele in most peripheral tissues but expression in the central nervous system (CNS) is from the paternally inherited allele <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Garfield1">[10]</xref>. Consistent with these sites of parent-of-origin specific expression, we have demonstrated that maternally expressed <italic>Grb10</italic> controls placental and fetal growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous2">[11]</xref>, as well as adiposity and energy homeostasis in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Smith1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Wang1">[13]</xref>, while paternally expressed <italic>Grb10</italic> tempers social dominance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Garfield1">[10]</xref>. This reciprocal imprint, with the parental alleles of <italic>Grb10</italic> influencing distinct physiological and behavioural processes, raises questions about the evolution of imprinting at this and other loci. The presence of imprinted gene expression beyond weaning, i.e., after the cessation of parental provisioning, is not consistent with the original predictions of the parental conflict hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hurst1">[14]</xref>. However, theoretical analyses have demonstrated that there are conditions that can favour imprinted expression later in life, but the expectations for patterns of imprinting in adults are not as clear as those associated with imprinting during the phase of parental care <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Ubeda1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Haig1">[16]</xref>. It is also possible that selection for imprinting at a locus occurs only during development and the imprint simply persists into adulthood.</p>
<p>Postnatal nutrient provisioning by mothers occurs through the mammary gland, but unlike the placenta, the genome of the offspring's father is not represented in this tissue, precluding it as a site of direct parental conflict over allocation of resources to offspring. Despite this, we find that <italic>Grb10</italic> is expressed and imprinted in the mammary epithelium during lactation. We show that <italic>Grb10</italic> controls postnatal nutrient supply through expression of the maternally inherited allele in the lactating mammary gland, but at the same time, expression of the maternally inherited allele in the offspring controls nutrient demand. Proportionate growth as in wild-type (WT) animals requires a combination of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in the mother, which influences offspring adiposity, and <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in the offspring, which influences lean mass. Together, these findings have two key implications. Firstly, our data suggest that <italic>Grb10</italic> mediates both sides of the mother-offspring interaction. The coordinated pleiotropic effects of the gene suggest a possible role for <italic>Grb10</italic> in mother-offspring coadaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Wolf1">[17]</xref>. Coadaptation has been shown theoretically to potentially favour the evolution of imprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Wolf2">[18]</xref>, but there is limited empirical evidence to support this. Secondly, when coupled with our previous observations that <italic>Grb10</italic>-associated control of lean/fat proportions influences adult energy homeostasis, our data identify <italic>Grb10</italic> as a key genetic mediator of developmental programming. Moreover, the need for expression of <italic>Grb10</italic> in both mother and offspring to achieve WT lean/fat proportions suggests that a better understanding of mother-offspring interactions at the genetic level will be required for more accurate prediction of adult disease risk.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>We have previously described two mouse models of <italic>Grb10</italic> ablation, generated by the integration of a <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene-trap cassette <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Garfield1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous2">[11]</xref>. Here we more precisely map the gene trap loci (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s001">S1</xref>), and also confirm and directly compare the patterns of fetal <italic>LacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Both the <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic> and <italic>Grb10KO</italic> alleles ablate Grb10 protein with essentially identical phenotypic consequences, yet expression from their <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter genes is not always equivalent. Maternal transmission of each allele produces similar <italic>LacZ</italic> expression patterns at embryonic day 14.5 (e14.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Contrastingly, <italic>LacZ</italic> expression in the CNS is apparent after paternal transmission of the <italic>Grb10KO</italic> allele (<italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> embryos) but is not detected in the CNS of <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic><sup>+/p</sup> embryos.

<p>Gene-trap cassette integration in the <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic> allele is coincident with the deletion of 36 kb of endogenous sequence, while only 12 bp are deleted in <italic>Grb10KO</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g001">Figures 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s001">S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous2">[11]</xref>. We considered that the differences in <italic>LacZ</italic> expression between <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> and <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic><sup>+/p</sup> brains might be attributed to a tissue-specific enhancer perturbed by cassette integration in the <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic> allele. A screen of the <italic>Grb10</italic> genomic sequence for similarity to regulatory elements in Transfac, using PReMod <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Blanchette1">[19]</xref>, identified a single element of 70 bp, called <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory module 1 (CRM1), that is highly conserved among vertebrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and represents a candidate enhancer element.</p>

<p>(A) <italic>In silico</italic> identification of conserved elements among selected vertebrate sequences. Conserved intronic sequences between <italic>Grb10</italic> homologs are plotted against annotated mouse transcripts. The PReMod track shows the position of the single regulatory module (CRM1).

(C) <italic>In situ</italic> hybridisation autoradiographs showing examples of overlapping sites of <italic>Grb10</italic> and <italic>Stat5b</italic> mRNA expression in adult mouse brain, including the arcuate nucleus of the hypothalamus (ARC), dorsomedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (DMH), lateral septal nucleus (LSV), medial amygdaloid nucleus (posteroventral part) (MePV), medial habenular nucleus (MHb), medial preoptic nucleus (MPA), median preoptic nucleus (medial part) (MPOM), periaqueductal grey (PAG), paraventricular thalamic nucleus (PVA), paraventricular nucleus of the hypothalamus (PVH), supraoptic nucleus (SON), ventromedial nucleus of the hypothalamus (VMH), and ventraltegmental area (VTA). (D) <italic>In vitro</italic> transfection assay of the enhancer capability of CRM1. Luciferase activity was measured in cells transfected with a minimal promoter driving luciferase (pGL3-Pro) or with CRM1 cloned upstream of the minimal promoter (pGL3-Pro-CRM1).

<p>CRM1 proved hypersensitive to DNase I digestion in mouse adult brain, but not liver where <italic>Grb10</italic> is not transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), consistent with CRM1 being an enhancer. PReMod identified potential recognition sequences within CRM1 for Signal transducer and activator of transcription (STAT)5a/STAT5b, Tst-1, TCF11, and Pax family members (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). We reasoned that only factors spatially overlapping with <italic>Grb10</italic> expression could potentially regulate <italic>Grb10 in vivo</italic>, and using public expression data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Lein1">[20]</xref>, we ruled out all but STAT5b. Using mRNA <italic>in situ</italic> hybridisation, we confirmed that <italic>Stat5b</italic> brain expression overlaps extensively with <italic>Grb10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In a cell transfection assay, CRM1 demonstrated enhancer capability in the presence of constitutively active STAT5b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The STAT5 recognition sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Soldaini1">[21]</xref>, but not those of Tst-1, TCF11, or Pax, are 100% conserved between mouse, human, chimpanzee, cow, and chicken (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Together, these data suggest STAT5 promotes <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in mouse brain. Although CRM1 is not within the deleted sequence of <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic>, its 5′ end is within 366 bp of the deletion. STAT5 binding, or its affect on <italic>Grb10</italic> transcription, might therefore be perturbed by the deletion in the <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic> allele, which could account for the observed expression differences in the CNS. One explanation is that the deletion alters the local chromatin conformation, reducing the interactions between CRM1 and the <italic>Grb10</italic> promoter. Consistent with this, the deletion includes at least one binding site in brain for CTCF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Prickett1">[22]</xref>, a regulator of chromatin architecture.</p>
<p><italic>Grb10</italic> was previously identified as a STAT5-responsive gene in mammary epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Prickett1">[24]</xref>. More recently, genome-wide ChIP-seq mapping of STAT5 binding sites in mammary tissue identified three binding sites within the Grb10 locus, including one coincident with CRM1, confirming that CRM1 can bind STAT5 in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Yamaji1">[23]</xref>. We examined <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in the mammary epithelia of our mouse models utilising <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter activity as a readout, predicting that reporter expression from the <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic> allele would be weaker than from the <italic>Grb10KO</italic> allele because of a perturbation of CRM1 activity, similar to the differences observed in the CNS. We first demonstrated pregnancy-dependent expression of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mammary epithelium using <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> females. No reporter activity was detected at day 7.5 of gestation (G7.5), a subset of epithelial cells were <italic>LacZ</italic>-positive at G12.5, and widespread epithelial expression was observed at day 6 of lactation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), an expression profile comparable with other transcriptional targets of STAT5 signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Clarkson1">[24]</xref>. Mammary epithelial expression is restricted to the maternally inherited copy (no <italic>LacZ</italic> staining was detected in <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> females), consistent with <italic>Grb10</italic> imprinting in other peripheral tissues; expression of the <italic>Grb10</italic> maternal allele is widespread during fetal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Garfield1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous2">[11]</xref> and in neonatal tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s004">Figure S4</xref>), but more restricted in the adult <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Garfield1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Smith1">[12]</xref>. Comparable with expression differences in the CNS, no <italic>LacZ</italic> expression was detected in <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic><sup>m/+</sup> epithelium.</p>
<p>The functional significance of imprinting in the mammary gland, which regulates nutrient allocation in the postnatal period, has not been widely considered. We were therefore intrigued by the pregnancy-dependent, imprinted expression of <italic>Grb10</italic> observed in the mammary gland and its potential functional importance. Pup growth is the ultimate correlate of gland function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Ramanathan1">[25]</xref>, and we thus compared growth of WT (+/+) pups born to WT and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams. At e17.5, WT embryos of <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> females are 10% smaller than those of WT females, due to an increased litter size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous1">[8]</xref>. Despite this embryonic growth disadvantage, WT pups born to <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams gained more weight postnatally than those born to WT dams, after standardising litter size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We initially interpreted this as an enhanced provisioning capacity of <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams, suggesting that <italic>Grb10</italic> functions in mothers to suppress nutrient supply postnatally. However, WT pups born to <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams also had <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> siblings, which were 16%±5.4% larger than their WT littermates at birth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figures 3B, 3C</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s005">S5A</xref>). It was therefore necessary to consider whether these larger siblings might be impacting on WT growth, and to separate as far as possible these effects from the genotype of the dam.</p>

<p>We used a cross-fostering strategy to differentiate the postnatal growth effects of <italic>Grb10</italic> ablation in pup from those in dam and sibling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Similar approaches have been used previously to differentiate between parental and offspring effects on traits, including in the context of genomic imprinting (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hager1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hager3">[29]</xref>). Pup weights at days 1, 8, and 15 were modelled as described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Data were analysed using a generalised linear mixed model (GLMM). Cross-fostering had no main effect on any trait (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.2 for all traits; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s010">Table S1</xref>), consistent with other studies, and therefore was not included in the final models (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s005">Figure S5B</xref>). The effect of <italic>Grb10</italic> ablation in the dam alone was assessed by comparing the growth of pure WT litters raised by WT or <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses. Reduced weight gain was observed in pups raised by <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, purple line) compared to those raised by WT nurses (black), demonstrating that <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses exhibit compromised nutrient supply, and therefore the function of <italic>Grb10</italic> in the mother is to promote nutrient provisioning postnatally. Compromised supply from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses was confirmed by our modelling, which showed a significant effect of nurse genotype at day 8 (F<sub>1,21</sub> = 15.08; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and day 15 (F<sub>1,21.6</sub> = 25.60; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), but not day 1 (F<sub>1,19.9</sub> = 0.53; <italic>p</italic> = 0.4744) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001799-t001">Table 1</xref>, which presents hypotheses tested and key findings from the data; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s010">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s011">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s012">S3</xref>, which present the results of the models in full). The observations in our initial experiment that WT pups born to <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams gained more weight postnatally than those born to WT dams could therefore not be attributed to dam genotype alone, but were likely to be influenced by sibling genotype. In support of this, WT pups with <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> siblings gained more weight than WT pups with only WT siblings, when raised by WT nurses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, red and black, respectively). This is consistent with the idea that <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups exhibit increased demand for nutrients, to which WT nurses respond with improved provisioning, enabling increased weight gain in WT littermates. However, because all litters born to <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams contained at least one <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pup, this result is also consistent with a maternal effect in which exposure to the <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> uterine environment promotes increased postnatal weight gain in both WT and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups. Although the effects of siblings and the dam are correlated, we examined whether the postnatal growth of an individual is influenced by the frequency of <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups in their litter. This analysis supported the conclusions that the pattern of postnatal growth reflects a demand effect, with postnatal growth of a pup increasing as a function of the frequency of <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> siblings, with this relationship being significant for growth from day 1 to day 8 (<italic>β</italic> = 0.97, 21 degrees of freedom [df], <italic>p</italic> = 0.022) and from day 1 to day 15 (<italic>β</italic> = 1.34, 21.5 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.018). Thus, <italic>Grb10</italic> has pleiotropic and complementary roles in dam and pup, enhancing nutrient supply in dams and suppressing demand in pups.</p>

<p>We next considered the compound effects of <italic>Grb10</italic> ablation in nurse and pup, hypothesising that more demanding <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups might not reach their full size potential when suckling from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses with reduced supply. Supporting this, <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups raised by WT nurses gained more weight than those raised by <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses during the postnatal period, despite being similar in weight at day 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, blue and brown, respectively). Modelling the data confirmed significant differences in weight between <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups raised by WT and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses at day 8 (t = 4.78, 43.6 df, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and day 15 (t = 5.47, 52.3 df, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), but not at day 1 (t = 1.76, 43.7 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.086) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001799-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s011">S2</xref>). <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups suckling from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses were larger than their WT littermates at day 1, but their growth trajectories converged within a few days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, brown and grey, respectively). However, <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups remained larger than WT siblings throughout the experimental period when suckling from WT nurses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, blue and red, respectively). Modelling of the pup/nurse interaction confirmed these observations, with the contrast between <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups suckling from WT nurses compared to other combinations being significant at day 8 (F<sub>1,62.3</sub> = 39.33; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and day 15 (F<sub>1,70.4</sub> = 38.83; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), while the difference between <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups with <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses was significantly different to that of WT pups with <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses at day 1 (t = 6.28, 113 df, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), but not day 8 (t = 1.48, 115 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.14) or day 15 (t = 0.25, 119 df, <italic>p</italic> = 0.80) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s012">Table S3</xref>). Thus, oversized <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> neonates rapidly adjust to WT size after birth, but only when the nurse genotype is also <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup>, implying a role for <italic>Grb10</italic> in influencing mother-offspring coadaptation. Our cross-fostering experiments show that WT body size is achieved through the complementary actions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mother and offspring.</p>
<p>In addition to overall size, disproportionate growth can also be a risk factor for adult disease. In adulthood, <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic><sup>m/+</sup> and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> mice have an altered body composition, exhibiting increased lean mass and reduced adiposity relative to WT animals, which results in enhanced glucose metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Smith1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Wang1">[13]</xref>. The finding in the present study that growth is influenced by <italic>Grb10</italic> in both mother and pup prompted us to examine the lean/fat ratios of animals used in the cross-fostering study. More specifically, we set out to ask whether the increased lean/fat ratio of a <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> mouse is a result of <italic>Grb10</italic> depletion within that mouse, or if the genotype of the nurse also contributes to this phenotype. To address this question, we analysed the body composition of cross-fostered pups at the end of the growth study period using dual-emission X-ray absorptiometry (DXA). Ablating <italic>Grb10</italic> in either nurse or pup increased the lean/fat ratio compared to WT pups raised by WT nurses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). When <italic>Grb10</italic> was ablated in offspring alone, the increased lean/fat ratio was caused by a gain in lean mass, with fat mass unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>; compare red with blue). Conversely, <italic>Grb10</italic> ablation in nurse alone caused a reduction in adipose tissue, while lean mass remained unchanged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>; compare black with purple). Therefore, <italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the mother has the major influence on adipose deposition, while offspring <italic>Grb10</italic> largely influences lean mass. A WT lean/fat ratio requires functional <italic>Grb10</italic> in both mother and pup.</p>

<p>Since <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> neonates adjust to WT size when suckling from a <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurse, we asked whether this normalisation effect was also reflected in the lean/fat ratios. Consistent with the adjustment in body size, the lean/fat ratio of <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> animals raised by <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses was comparable to that of their WT littermates, and also to that of WT pups raised by WT nurses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g004">Figure 4D</xref>; compare brown with grey and black). This provides further evidence that the pleiotropic functions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mother and pup are complementary.</p>
<p>To inform on the mechanism through which <italic>Grb10</italic> regulates postnatal nutrient supply, we examined <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> mammary gland gross morphology at different stages, but did not detect any obvious differences from WT glands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). We also measured various parameters in histological sections of glands harvested at day 5 of lactation. Since we had shown that <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> pups demonstrate increased nutrient demand, we compared glands from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams to glands from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> dams. Unlike WT dams, both <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> dams raise comparable mixed genotype litters, but the absence of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression from the paternally-expressed allele in mammary glands (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) means that <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> females are effectively WT for <italic>Grb10</italic> in this tissue. No differences were observed in total abdominal gland weight or surface area (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s006">Figure S6B and S6C</xref>). To gain more detailed insight into gland structure, we quantified the total number, total area, mean area, mean perimeter, mean Feret diameter and mean minimum Feret diameter for lumina and adipocytes, but found no differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s006">Figures S6D and S6E</xref>). These analyses were repeated on a separate cohort of glands isolated 48 hours after a forced wean at day 15 of lactation, and we made similar observations (unpublished data). In support of these morphometric analyses, no significant differences were found between WT and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> glands, in immunofluorescence experiments using antibodies to markers of luminal epithelial (cytokeratin-18 [CK18]) and myoepithelial (CK14) cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s007">Figure S7A and S7B</xref>). Moreover, fluorescence activated cell sorting (FACS) showed no differences in the number or proportions of the same key cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s007">Figure S7C and S7D</xref>).</p>
<p>As a measure of milk letdown from dam to pups, pup weight gain was assessed following a period of separation from the dam. We found no evidence that the reduced nutrient provisioning of <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams observed in our earlier experiments was due to compromised milk letdown since, if anything, they were able to transfer more milk to pups than <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> dams (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). Although <italic>Grb10</italic> is almost exclusively expressed from the paternally inherited allele in adult brain, and therefore <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> females are unlikely to demonstrate perturbed maternal behaviour, we confirmed that pup retrieval and nest building behaviours are comparable between <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> dams (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s008">Figure S8B–S8E</xref>). The protein and fat content of milk was also comparable between nurses used in the cross-fostering study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s009">Figure S9A and S9B</xref>). Together these data suggest that milk letdown, maternal behaviour or the proportions of fat and protein in milk are not the basis for reduced provisioning in <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> dams. However, prolactin expression in the pituitary glands of <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> nurses was significantly elevated relative to WT nurses, when raising WT litters, whereas pituitary growth hormone levels were unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001799.s009">Figure S9C</xref>). Reduced provisioning causes pups to suckle more vigorously, promoting maternal pituitary prolactin expression that normally stimulates increased milk production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Jakubowski1">[30]</xref>.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In mice, most imprinted genes are expressed in the placenta and many have been shown experimentally to influence placental development and function. The parental conflict hypothesis, which, at a gross level, predicts that paternally expressed genes promote growth while maternally expressed genes suppress growth, is consistent with the functions of several genes imprinted in the placenta, including <italic>Grb10</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous2">[11]</xref>. While the conflict hypothesis can potentially explain the occurrence of imprinting at many loci, the functions of a considerable number of imprinted genes cannot be easily reconciled with the predictions of the model, such as those involved in maternal care behaviours. Recent extensions to the model have considered cases in which asymmetries between genes inherited from mothers and fathers can arise from various patterns of interactions with kin, but they do not provide strong predictions about the nature of imprinting in adult tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Ubeda1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Ubeda2">[31]</xref>. There are also alternative models that do not consider conflict, such as the maternal-offspring coadaptation model, which describes how the combination of alleles expressed in mothers and their offspring jointly determines offspring fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Wolf2">[18]</xref>. Whether each of these models could potentially account for the complex patterns of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression and imprinting is unclear, but we present here some of the strongest empirical evidence that coadaptation could play a role, without necessarily ruling out alternative hypotheses.</p>
<p>Earlier studies involving reciprocal crosses, and cross-fostering, between two distinct mouse strains established that parent-of-origin effects such as genomic imprinting could contribute to coadaptation between genotypes (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hager1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hager3">[29]</xref>). These studies provide evidence that maternal provisioning is influenced by maternal and offspring genotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hager2">[27]</xref> and that provisioning is optimal when mother and offspring are of the same genotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hager3">[29]</xref>. A study mapping quantitative trait loci on adult mouse body weight and organ weights indicated that a number of imprinted loci had small but detectable effects on these traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Cheverud1">[28]</xref>. This genome-wide mapping is complementary to our approach, the manipulation of a single imprinted gene, which shows that <italic>Grb10</italic> can contribute functionally to body weight and proportions through actions in both mother and offspring.</p>
<p><italic>Grb10</italic> is an intriguing model with which to study imprinted gene function and evolution, because its two parental alleles are expressed in different tissues where they influence distinct physiological and behavioural processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Garfield1">[10]</xref>. Our earlier work characterising the same knockout mice used in this study established that maternally expressed <italic>Grb10</italic> regulates fetal and placental growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous2">[11]</xref>, consistent with the conflict hypothesis, as well as glucose homeostasis in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Smith1">[12]</xref>. In the present study, we demonstrate that <italic>Grb10</italic> also controls postnatal growth through imprinted expression in mammary epithelium. The two archetypal mammalian tissues differ fundamentally in that the placenta contains both maternal and paternal genetic contributions, as in the offspring, but the mammary gland shares only maternal genes with offspring. Thus, while they are functionally analogous in supporting offspring growth, the placenta can be a site of direct conflict between the maternal and paternal genomes, whereas the mammary gland is not <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Hurst1">[14]</xref>. Consequently, our findings do not appear to fit with the simple predictions of the conflict hypothesis. The finding that WT body size and proportions require the combined and complementary actions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mother and pup (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001799-g005">Figure 5</xref>), provides support for the coadaptation model of imprinting evolution, although further work would be needed to confirm that the effects of <italic>Grb10</italic> lead to increased fitness. However, even if coadaptation explains the imprinting of <italic>Grb10</italic> in pups, the coadaptation process would not favour imprinted expression in the mammary gland. Either a different hypothesis is needed to explain why the gene is imprinted in this tissue, or the pattern of expression in the mammary gland could simply reflect the selection that led to imprinting earlier in life. It should also be noted that our study compares WT <italic>Grb10</italic> with a single knockout allele. Strong support for the coadaptation theory would come from an analysis of different allelic variants. Pups from combinations where mothers and offspring are expressing the same allelic variant would be expected to have higher fitness than those from combinations expressing different alleles.</p>

<title>Overview of complementary <italic>Grb10</italic> functions in mother and pup.</title>
<p><italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the mother promotes postnatal nutrient supply through the mammary gland, while offspring <italic>Grb10</italic> suppresses nutrient demand. Together, this regulation of nutrient acquisition ensures offspring achieve an optimal body size. Body proportions are also influenced by both <italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the mother and in the offspring. Offspring <italic>Grb10</italic> suppresses the development of lean mass, while offspring fat mass is promoted by <italic>Grb10</italic> expressed in the mother and acting on postnatal nutrient supply, jointly promoting optimal offspring body proportions.</p>

<p>Conflict between the parental genomes, coadaptation of processes regulating postnatal nutrient acquisition, or indeed some other driving force, could have provided the initial selective pressure for the evolution of imprinting. However, a mechanism for imprinted gene regulation, once evolved, could facilitate development of novel gene functions, and thus the two models for the evolution of imprinting at the <italic>Grb10</italic> locus, conflict and coadaptation, need not be mutually exclusive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Wilkins1">[32]</xref>. Indeed, expression of both the maternally and paternally inherited alleles of <italic>Grb10</italic> in different tissues, influencing different phenotypes, strongly supports this notion, since the same selective forces presumably could not have led to both patterns of expression. Evidence for the later evolutionary acquisition of novel functions or imprinted expression of a gene in adult tissues could be viewed as consistent with this idea. In this context it is interesting that in at least one marsupial species, the tammar wallaby, <italic>Grb10</italic> is expressed in a range of fetal and adult tissues, including lactating mammary gland, but its expression appears not to be imprinted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Stringer1">[33]</xref>. Future work on the expression and functions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in non-mammalian species will help to unravel the likely evolutionary course of this pleiotropic gene.</p>
<p>The mechanism through which <italic>Grb10</italic> regulates postnatal nutrient supply is not clear, but its pregnancy-dependent expression in the mammary epithelium is consistent with <italic>Grb10</italic> controlling supply through this tissue. Our data suggest that <italic>Grb10</italic> might mediate the response of the epithelium to pituitary prolactin, but further work will be needed to define its mode of action. We could not detect any phenotype associated with <italic>Grb10KO</italic> in analyses of mammary glands at the cellular level or in analyses of milk fat and protein content. One intriguing possibility is that <italic>Grb10</italic> in mammary epithelium could regulate the release of signalling molecules that influence growth or metabolism of suckling offspring. Evidence exists for such lactocrine signalling playing a role in offspring development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Melnik1">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Environmental influences on the programming of adult health status during development have been widely investigated. In humans, maternal and child undernutrition are risk factors for high glucose concentration and blood pressure in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Victora1">[3]</xref>. Chemical insults can also adversely affect development with implications for adult health. Bisphenol A (BPA), which mimics oestrogen, has garnered much attention recently because of its widespread use in the manufacture of baby bottles, coatings for food cans and other commonly used items. Effects of exposure during development to environmentally relevant levels of BPA, using rodent models, include increased body weight, advanced puberty, and altered reproductive function, as well as a possible predisposition to mammary and prostate cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Maffini1">[35]</xref>. This is effected, at least in part, through alterations to the fetal epigenome, including reduced levels of DNA methylation, which is associated with changes in gene transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Dolinoy1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Bromer1">[37]</xref>.</p>
<p>The genetic control of developmental programming of adult health status is relatively poorly understood. We have previously shown that <italic>Grb10</italic> determines the proportions of lean and fat tissue during development, and that altering the lean/fat ratio by ablating <italic>Grb10</italic> affects glucose homeostasis in adulthood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Smith1">[12]</xref>. In the present study, we find that this programming of adult metabolic state during postnatal development is not the result of <italic>Grb10</italic> acting in the pup alone, but is achieved through the combined actions of <italic>Grb10</italic> in mother and offspring. Interestingly, two recent mouse studies of nutrient restriction during gestation have demonstrated up-regulation of <italic>Grb10</italic> expression in offspring, consistent with our findings that <italic>Grb10</italic> plays a key role in responding to nutrient supply <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Radford1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Ivanova1">[39]</xref>. Our work highlights the need for a much better understanding of genetic interactions between mother and offspring in predicting adult health status.</p>

After fat removal, protein was diluted 1/5 in 50 mM Tris HCl (pH 8.0), 150 mM NaCl, 1% (v/v) Igepal CA-630, boiled for 10 minutes, and mixed with an equal volume of reducing sample buffer. Samples were run on a 15% Criterion Tris-HCl gel (Bio-Rad Laboratories) alongside pre-stained molecular weight markers. Fixation and drying were performed using standard methods.</p>
<p>After milk collection, nurses were humanely killed by cervical dislocation and pituitary glands harvested. RNA was extracted from pituitaries using TRI Reagent (Sigma Aldrich). Total RNA (1 µg) was DNase-treated with RQ1 RNase-free DNase I (Promega). cDNA was synthesised using random hexamers with Superscript III RNase H<sup>−</sup> Reverse Transcriptase (Invitrogen). Real-time PCR (qRT-PCR) was used to measure expression of prolactin and growth hormone normalised to β-actin. Reactions were performed in duplicate and analysed as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous1">[8]</xref>.</p>

<title>Maternal Behaviour and Milk Letdown</title>
<p><italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> dams were considered to be a better control than WT dams in these experiments because both <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/+</sup> and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> dams have mixed genotype litters, and therefore demand is more equally matched than with WT dams that have only WT litters. Nurturing behaviour of dams was quantified, including time to initiate nest building activity, time to settle on the nest, and time to retrieve pups, following removal of pups from the nest and separation from the dam for 1 hour (essentially as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Curley1">[49]</xref>, but performed at 3–4 hours into the light cycle on postnatal day 1). As a surrogate measure of milk letdown, pups were weighed immediately following removal from the dam, immediately before their return to the nest, and at intervals for up to four hours thereafter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Curley1">[49]</xref>.</p>

<p><bold>Mapping of the gene-trap cassette integration sites in </bold><bold><italic>Grb10KO</italic></bold><bold> and </bold><bold><italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic></bold><bold>.</bold> (A) Schematic of the <italic>Grb10</italic> gene around exons 6–8 (black boxes). 5′ RACE experiments (unpublished) demonstrated splicing of transcripts from <italic>Grb10</italic> exon 6 onto the gene-trap cassette in the <italic>Grb10KO</italic> allele, and so cassette integration was initially assumed to be within intron 6. The positions of relevant restriction enzyme recognition sequences and probe B (thick black line) are shown. The amplicons generated by primer sets A–C are illustrated by grey lines. The gene-trap cassette, consisting of a 5′ splice acceptor sequence (SA), <italic>LacZ</italic> reporter, and 3′ polyadenylation sequence (pA), is shown with dashed lines indicating its integration site at the 3′ end of exon 7. A broken line indicates intronic sequence not shown. Diagram not to scale. (B) Upper panel: Southern blots of <italic>Bam</italic>HI- and <italic>Pst</italic>I-digested genomic DNA from tail clips of a WT (+/+) animal and animals heterozygous (+/p) and homozygous (m/p) for the <italic>Grb10KO</italic> allele, challenged with probe B. A 4.5 kb <italic>Bam</italic>HI digestion fragment was detected for all genotypes indicating that cassette integration occurred downstream of the intron 6 <italic>Bam</italic>HI restriction site. A 6.7 kb <italic>Pst</italic>I fragment was detected in WT and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>+/p</sup> DNA, but was absent from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/p</sup> DNA. A band of ∼10 kb was detected in DNA from animals heterozygous and homozygous for the <italic>Grb10KO</italic> allele. The gene-trap cassette contains a <italic>Pst</italic>I site ∼4.3 kb from the 5′ end, suggesting the integration site is ∼5.7 kb downstream of the exon 5 <italic>Pst</italic>I site, close to the 3′ end of exon 7. Lower panel: Primer sets A, B, and C were designed to span the approximate site of cassette integration determined by Southern blotting, to enable finer mapping. PCR was performed on WT and <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/p</sup> DNA. Primer set B failed to amplify from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/p</sup> DNA indicating the site of integration was between the two primers. (C) The forward primer from set B was used with a reverse primer complementary to a sequence within the gene-trap cassette to amplify from <italic>Grb10KO</italic><sup>m/p</sup> DNA. The amplicon was cloned and sequenced. Cassette integration (dashed lines) is coincident with the deletion of 11 bp from the 3′ end of exon 7 (bold) and 1 bp from the 5′ end of intron 7. Despite integrating at the 3′ end of exon 7, transcripts initiating upstream splice from exon 6 onto the SA sequence of the gene-trap cassette, as determined by 5′ RACE (unpublished). (D) For <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic>, the approximate site of integration has been mapped previously by Southern blotting and is coincident with the deletion of ∼36 kb of endogenous <italic>Grb10</italic> sequence including exons 2–4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001799-Charalambous2">[11]</xref>. In the present study, the 5′ end of the deleted sequence was mapped with greater resolution using PCR. A schematic of the <italic>Grb10</italic> gene around exon 2 (black box) is shown. Amplicons generated by primer sets D–H are illustrated by grey lines. CRM1 is indicated by a grey box. The gene-trap cassette integration site is illustrated by dashed lines; the 3′ end of the integration site is downstream of exon 4 (unpublished). (E) Primer sets D, E, F, and G were designed to span the approximate site of cassette integration in <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic> determined by Southern blotting (not shown). Primer sets D and E readily amplified from WT and <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic><sup>m/p</sup> DNA, indicating that the sequence spanned by these primers is present in both genotypes. Primer sets F and G amplified from WT, but not <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic><sup>m/p</sup> DNA, indicating that the 5′ end of the deletion lies within the sequence spanned by primer set F. (F) Genomic sequence around CRM1 (bold text) showing its proximity to the 5′ end of the deleted sequence in the <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic> allele. The positions of primer sets F and H are indicated. Primer set H amplified from WT and <italic>Grb10Δ2-4</italic><sup>m/p</sup> DNA (not shown) indicating the 5′ end of the deleted sequence lies between the reverse primer of set H (H rev) and the reverse primer of set F (F rev). Genome coordinates are based on mouse build mm9, and were obtained from the UCSC genome browser.</p>
