<p>A comparative genomics study maps nucleosomes across the entire genomes of 12 fungal species, identifying multiple distinct mechanisms linking changes in chromatin architecture to evolution of gene regulation.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Chromatin organization plays a major role in gene regulation and can affect the function and evolution of new transcriptional programs. However, it can be difficult to decipher the basis of changes in chromatin organization and their functional effect on gene expression. Here, we present a large-scale comparative genomic analysis of the relationship between chromatin organization and gene expression, by measuring mRNA abundance and nucleosome positions genome-wide in 12 <italic>Hemiascomycota</italic> yeast species. We found substantial conservation of global and functional chromatin organization in all species, including prominent nucleosome-free regions (NFRs) at gene promoters, and distinct chromatin architecture in growth and stress genes. Chromatin organization has also substantially diverged in both global quantitative features, such as spacing between adjacent nucleosomes, and in functional groups of genes. Expression levels, intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences, and <italic>trans</italic>-acting chromatin modifiers all play important, complementary, and evolvable roles in determining NFRs. We identify five mechanisms that couple chromatin organization to evolution of gene regulation and have contributed to the evolution of respiro-fermentation and other key systems, including (1) compensatory evolution of alternative modifiers associated with conserved chromatin organization, (2) a gradual transition from constitutive to <italic>trans</italic>-regulated NFRs, (3) a loss of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences accompanying changes in chromatin organization and gene expression, (4) re-positioning of motifs from NFRs to nucleosome-occluded regions, and (5) the expanded use of NFRs by paralogous activator-repressor pairs. Our study sheds light on the molecular basis of chromatin organization, and on the role of chromatin organization in the evolution of gene regulation.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Divergence in gene regulation plays a major role in organismal evolution. Evidence suggests that changes in the packaging of eukaryotic genomes into chromatin can underlie the evolution of divergent gene expression patterns. Here, we explore the role of chromatin structure in regulatory evolution by whole-genome measurements of nucleosome positions and mRNA levels in 12 yeast species spanning ∼250 million years of evolution. We find several distinct ways in which changes in chromatin structure are associated with changes in gene expression. These include changes in promoter accessibility, changes in promoter chromatin architecture, and changes in the accessibility of specific transcription factor binding sites. In many cases, changes in chromatin architecture are coupled to physiological diversity, including the evolution of a respiration- or fermentation-based lifestyle, mating behavior, salt tolerance, and broad aspects of genomic structure. Together, our data will provide a rich resource for future investigations into the interplay between chromatin structure, gene regulation, and evolution.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulatory differences affecting gene expression can play a major role in species evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-King1">[1]</xref> and can help elucidate the functional mechanisms that control gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Thompson1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wohlbach1">[3]</xref>. Although specific examples of regulatory divergence are known in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-McAdams1">[4]</xref>, fungi <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Gasch1">[5]</xref>,, flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Prudhomme1">[9]</xref>, and mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Khaitovich1">[10]</xref>, a general understanding of the evolution of gene regulation is still lacking. The recent availability of many sequenced genomes and accessibility of genomic profiling approaches open the way for comparisons of gene regulation across multiple species.</p>
<p>Among eukaryotes, the <italic>Hemiascomycota</italic> yeasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), which span over ∼250 million years of evolution, are particularly suitable for studying evolution of gene regulation. This is due to the genetic tractability of yeasts, the wealth of knowledge about the model organism <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, the large number of sequenced genomes, and the diversity of yeast lifestyles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wohlbach1">[3]</xref>. Notably, <italic>Hemiascomycota</italic> yeasts diverged before and after a whole genome duplication event (WGD, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kellis1">[11]</xref>, which marked a shift from using respiration for energy production in pre-WGD species to primarily using fermentation in post-WGD species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Conant1">[12]</xref>.</p>

<p>Nucleosomes modulate eukaryotic gene regulation by affecting the accessibility of other proteins to the DNA, which can impact gene activation and repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kornberg1">[13]</xref>. In particular, many genes have nucleosome-depleted “Nucleosome Free Regions” (NFRs) in their proximal promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, top), providing access to sequence specific transcription factors (TFs) and to the basal transcription machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-RadmanLivaja1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Rando1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Jiang1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Li1">[17]</xref>. Three major determinants have been proposed to impact nucleosome depletion at NFRs: (1) active transcription by RNA polymerase II results in eviction of the −1 nucleosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Venters1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Weiner1">[19]</xref>, (2) intrinsic “anti-nucleosomal” DNA sequences such as Poly(dA:dT) bind histones with low affinity and can “program” NFRs constitutively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Drew1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Sekinger1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Yuan1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Zhang1">[24]</xref>, and (3) <italic>trans</italic>-acting proteins can move nucleosomes away from their thermodynamically preferred locations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Clapier1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Whitehouse1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent studies in yeast suggest a broad role for chromatin organization in regulatory evolution. Most regulatory divergence between closely related <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strains is associated with divergence in unlinked (<italic>trans</italic>) chromatin remodelers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Brem1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Lee1">[28]</xref>. Conversely, many transcriptional differences between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (Last Common Ancestor (LCA) ∼2 million years ago (MYA)) are due to linked <italic>cis</italic> polymorphisms predicted to affect nucleosome occupancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tirosh2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tirosh3">[30]</xref>. Furthermore, a recent study suggested that changes in the regulation of mitochondrial ribosomal protein (mRP) genes between the distant species <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (LCA ∼200 MYA) were associated with a change in nucleosome organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Ihmels1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>. In particular, the higher expression of mitochondrial genes in respiratory <italic>C. albicans</italic> is accompanied by enrichment for the PolyA-like “RGE” binding site in the mRP gene promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Ihmels1">[31]</xref>, which appears to “program” the constitutive presence of wider, more open NFRs at these genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>. All of these are absent from the promoters of mRPs in the fermentative <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. Finally, a recent study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Lantermann1">[33]</xref> compared genome-wide nucleosome positioning in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> (LCA ∼300M–1 BYa), finding changes in global nucleosome spacing and in the apparent sequences that intrinsically contribute to nucleosome positioning in vivo.</p>
<p>While these examples are intriguing, they are limited in their phylogenetic coverage (a pair of species) or their functional scope (one regulon). Thus, we understand little about the evolutionary interplay between gene expression, regulatory sequence elements, and chromatin organization. How does chromatin organization change over evolutionary time scales? Are the mechanisms underlying chromatin packaging of functional gene modules conserved? If not, how do they evolve and what is the role of different factors in this divergence? Are changes in chromatin organization related to changes in gene regulation? Can phylogenetic comparisons shed light on the distinct mechanisms that help establish chromatin organization?</p>
<p>Here, we present the first large-scale experimental and computational study of chromatin organization across a eukaryotic phylogeny. We measured genome-wide nucleosome locations and mRNA abundance in 12 <italic>Hemiascomycota</italic> yeast species, spanning over 250 million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We developed an analysis framework that integrates the experimental data with genome sequences, functional gene sets, and TF binding sites across the 12 species.</p>
<p>Our analysis uncovers several major principles that govern the evolutionary and functional relationship between chromatin organization and gene regulation in this phylogeny. (1) While qualitative features of chromatin organization are conserved in all species, quantitative features such as nucleosome packing, NFR length, and NFR to ATG distance have substantially diverged; (2) promoter chromatin organization and gene expression levels of “growth” and “stress” genes follow distinct patterns, and this dichotomy is conserved in all species; (3) evolutionary divergence in gene expression is often accompanied by transition of chromatin organization from a “growth” to a “stress” pattern; (4) changes in transcription levels, gain/loss of anti-nucleosomal sequences, and gain/loss of binding sites for “general regulatory factors” (GRFs) all play substantial and complementary roles in divergence of chromatin organization; (5) the loss of anti-nucleosomal sequences and parallel gain of binding sites for GRFs drive shifts from intrinsic to <italic>trans</italic>-regulated chromatin organization; (6) regulatory divergence can also occur by re-positioning of binding sites relative to nucleosome positions or by expanding the use of accessible sites by paralogous TFs. These mechanisms played a role in the evolution of respiro-fermentation, as well as in the evolution of regulation of other key regulons at different phylogenetic points, including mating, meiosis, RNA polymerase subunits, proteasomal, and splicing genes. Together, they uncover novel insights into the general roles for chromatin in regulating genomic access and in the evolution of regulatory programs, and provide a rich resource for future investigation.</p>

To minimize condition- and stress-related differences, we grew all species in the same rich medium, where the growth rate of each species was at least ∼80% of its maximal measured rate in any of over 40 tested media formulations. In order to compare our data to transcriptional output, we also used species-specific microarrays to measure mRNA abundance in all species in the same mid-log cultures used for nucleosome mapping (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s019">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>Aligning nucleosome reads to each genome and averaging over all genes showed remarkably similar profiles in all species studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s003">S3</xref>). All gene-averaged profiles are dominated by a pronounced depression upstream of the ATG that corresponds to the NFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-RadmanLivaja1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Rando1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Jiang1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Li1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Segal1">[36]</xref>. To quantitatively compare chromatin structure between various genes, we first called nucleosome positions, identified 5′ and 3′ NFRs, and measured a number of nonredundant features that describe the chromatin organization at each gene (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figures 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s004">S4</xref>). Below, we will study each feature at three levels: (1) <italic>globally</italic>, averaged across all genes in a genome; (2) <italic>functionally</italic>, averaged across all genes in a functional category; and (3) <italic>locally</italic>, at a single gene.</p>

<title>Packaging of Coding Regions Is Qualitatively Conserved, but Quantitative Features Such as Nucleosome Spacing and NFR Width Have Diverged between Species</title>
<p>Several qualitative chromatin features have previously been identified in all eukaryotes studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-RadmanLivaja1">[14]</xref>, and these are conserved across all 12 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figures 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s002">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s003">S3</xref>). These include an abundant 5′NFR, a common 3′NFR, a well-positioned +1 nucleosome (Nuc<sup>+1</sup>), and increasing nucleosome fuzziness over the body of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s020">Table S3</xref>), which is consistent with statistical positioning of nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Yuan1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kornberg2">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Mavrich1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast, quantitative global features were often variable between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figures 1C–F </xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s020">Table S3</xref>). Our measurements recapitulated previous predictions or bulk assays in the few cases where these were available, thus validating our dataset and analytical methods. For example, nucleosome spacing in coding regions was variable between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figure 1C,D</xref>), consistent with observed nucleosome laddering on gels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Heus1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-VanHolde1">[40]</xref>. This leads to variation in the specific coding sequences exposed in linker DNA and could affect patterns of sequence variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Sasaki1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Warnecke1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Washietl1">[43]</xref> and higher-order packaging into the 30 nm fiber <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Routh1">[44]</xref>. The distance between the NFR and a gene's start codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figures 1E,F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s005">S5</xref>) is also variable between species, consistent with prior computational predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tirosh4">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Other evolutionary variations in global features were not previously described, showing that additional major aspects of chromatin architecture can substantially diverge. Most notably, the median NFR width was highly variable between species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s020">Table S3</xref>), ranging from 109 to 155 nucleotides. This likely reflects the variation in the length and abundance of anti-nucleosomal Poly(dA:dT) tracts between species (discussed below). Shorter NFRs may constrain regulatory information into more compact promoters.</p>

<title>A Conserved Dichotomy in Chromatin Organization of “Stress” and “Growth” Genes</title>
<p>We next explored possible functional implications of chromatin organization in specific sets of genes with related function. Prior studies in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> have shown that in both species, “growth” genes, defined by their co-expression with cytoplasmic ribosomal proteins (cRPs), have a more open chromatin organization on average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>. Conversely, “stress” genes, whose expression is anti-correlated to that of growth genes, have a more closed chromatin organization in both species.</p>
<p>To assess the generality of this observation, and identify additional trends, we tested in each species thousands of functional gene sets for enrichment of each of 22 distinct chromatin parameters. We used gene orthology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wapinski1">[34]</xref> to project functional gene sets defined in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> across species (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). For a given gene set in each species we calculated whether its constituent genes tended to have high or low values of each of the chromatin features (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), relative to the background of that feature's overall distribution in that species (Kolmogorov-Smirnov (K-S) test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). This provides a comprehensive overview of chromatin organization at 5′ promoters and 3′ ends for each functional gene set across the 12 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2C–J</xref>, middle panels, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s006">Figures S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s007">S7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s021">Tables S4</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s022">S5</xref>).

Promoters of “growth” genes (e.g., ribosomal, proteasomal, and nuclear pore proteins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2C,E,G</xref>) exhibit long and deep (low occupancy) 5′NFRs. Conversely, those of “stress” genes (e.g., toxin-response genes, integral membrane proteins, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) exhibit a more variable chromatin architecture, with shallower (higher occupancy) and narrower 5′NFRs. A host of other chromatin features also distinguish between the two functional groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, the separation of the “growth” and “stress” axes is a hallmark of <italic>Hemiascomycota</italic> gene regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Thompson1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wohlbach1">[3]</xref> and imposes strong constraints at all levels from evolution of gene content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wapinski1">[34]</xref> to chromatin organization. There are, however, several exceptions to this rule. Most notably, several key “growth” genes, including glycolysis genes and endoplasmic reticulum genes, are highly expressed, yet do not exhibit deep NFRs in any species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>We identify a range of additional conserved patterns of chromatin architecture associated with other specific functions, which were not previously reported. For example, a number of gene sets (e.g., reproduction, cell wall, inositol phosphate, benzoate, and nicotinamide metabolism genes) have conserved long NFR to ATG distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s006">Figure S6</xref>), but have few other hallmarks of stress genes, and are expressed at average levels. In <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, these genes have long 5′ untranslated regions (5′UTRs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Xu1">[50]</xref>, suggesting that relatively long 5′UTRs are conserved at their orthologs in all 12 species. This may indicate a conserved role for translational control in the regulation of these functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-MacKay1">[51]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Coherent Changes in Chromatin Organization Accompanied the Evolutionary Divergence of Gene Regulation in Mitochondrial, Splicing, and Cytoskeleton Genes</title>
<p>On this backdrop of conservation, we find that coordinated changes have occurred in chromatin organization of specific functional gene sets, consistent with major phenotypic changes. Most notably, respiration and mitochondrial genes have switched from a “growth”-like chromatin pattern in pre-WGD species (where they are highly expressed) to a more “stress”-like pattern post-WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s006">S6</xref>). We confirm the previously reported change between <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic> for genes involved in respiratory metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>. We further extend these results across the full phylogenetic scope and to several other gene sets of related function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figures 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s006">S6</xref>). This change corresponds to a major change in lifestyle from respiration to respiro-fermentation after the WGD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Conant1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Ihmels1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kurtzman1">[52]</xref>. We also discover the converse evolutionary pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2I</xref>): a number of gene sets involved in cytoskeletal organization are packaged into deeper NFRs in post-WGD species than in pre-WGD species. Surprisingly, the expression level of these genes has not substantially changed with this transition.</p>
<p>Changes in chromatin organization have also occurred at other phylogenetic points of phenotypic evolution, suggesting a general evolutionary mechanism. For example, we discovered that in <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> spliceosome genes are associated with long and deep NFRs, but in all other species they are enriched for short and shallow NFRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2J</xref>, middle panel). This switch between deep and shallow NFRs is accompanied by a decrease in expression of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2J, left panel</xref>) and is consistent with the much larger number of introns in <italic>Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Marck1">[53]</xref> and with the loss of introns and reduction of splicing in the subsequently diverged species.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Differences in Expression and Intrinsic Anti-Nucleosomal Sequences Only Account for Some of the Changes in Chromatin Organization Within and Between Species</title>
<p>We next asked what mechanisms contribute to conservation and variation in chromatin organization across species. Three determinants have been previously implicated in establishing NFRs in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-RadmanLivaja1">[14]</xref>: (1) the expression level of the gene, as RNA polymerase recruitment affects NFR width; (2) the presence of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences such as Poly(dA:dT) tracts in the gene's promoter; and (3) the binding of proteins such as chromatin remodelers that actively evict or move nucleosomes. We first consider these three determinants independently, and then assess their relative contributions.</p>
<p>In some cases, variation in chromatin organization in a gene set, both within and between species, correlates with gene expression level. Within each species, many highly expressed “growth” genes (e.g., RP genes) are packaged with wide and deep NFRs, while many poorly expressed stress genes have shorter, occupied NFRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figures 2C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s006">S6</xref>). Between species, evolutionary shifts from high to low expression levels were sometimes accompanied by corresponding changes in chromatin organization (e.g., mitochondrial RP and splicing genes, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2H,J</xref>).</p>
<p>However, transcription level is insufficient to solely explain the NFR occupancy measured across the 12 species. Globally, expression level alone explains only 1.7%–13.1% of the variation in NFR occupancy in each of the 12 species (Lowess fit, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s009">Figure S9A</xref>,C,E, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Furthermore, when we use Lowess subtraction to correct for the relationship between mRNA level and each chromatin feature, the enrichments of most gene sets for high or low values of chromatin features were maintained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s010">Figure S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Within species, the discrepancy is prominent in some of the gene sets (e.g., glycolysis, gluconeogenesis) that are highly expressed in all species but do not exhibit the expected deep NFRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Between species, cytoskeleton and nuclease-related gene sets have shifted from shallow to deep NFRs at the WGD, often without a concomittant change in expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). The failure of transcript levels to fully explain NFR width and depth is consistent with recent experimental results in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, where the distinctive chromatin organization of growth and stress genes was largely maintained even after genetically inactivating RNA Pol II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Weiner1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>We next tested an alternative hypothesis that chromatin organization at the NFR is determined by intrinsic “anti-nucleosomal” sequences with low affinity for the histone octamer, such as Poly(dA:dT) tracts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Drew1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Sekinger1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Zhang1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Iyer1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kunkel1">[55]</xref>. We estimated the average extent of nucleosome depletion over a variety of Poly(dA:dT) elements (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) for each species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s011">Figures S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s012">S12</xref>). We then tested if functional gene sets in each species were enriched or depleted for strongly anti-nucleosomal sequences in their NFRs. Finally, we compared this pattern to their chromatin organization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2C–J</xref>, right versus middle panels).</p>
<p>In some cases, the variation in chromatin organization within and between species is associated with variation in intrinsic “anti-nucleosomal” Poly(dA:dT) tracts. Within each species, Poly(dA:dT) sequences are enriched upstream of many highly expressed, nucleosome-depleted, “growth” gene sets, consistent with previous observations in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field2">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tirosh5">[49]</xref>. Between species, we found that gain and loss of polyA sequences is associated with changes in chromatin organization at several gene sets and phylogenetic points, suggesting that this is a common evolutionary mechanism used more than once in this phylogeny. We confirmed a prior observation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref> that the change in chromatin organization at mitochondrial ribosomal protein (mRP) genes in post-WGD respiro-fermentative species is accompanied by the loss of PolyA-like sequences from these promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). In addition, we found that the deeper and wider NFRs at splicing genes in <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> are associated with a greater length and number of PolyA sequences at these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). Conversely, the relatively shallow NFRs of gluconeogenesis genes observed in <italic>S. castellii</italic> are associated with concomitant depletion of polyA sequences in this species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2F</xref>).</p>
<p>Nevertheless, intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences explain only 8.6%–25.7% of the global variation in NFR occupancy within a given species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Even when combining expression levels and sequence information together, these can only explain 13%–29% of the global variation in nucleosome organization in the 12 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s009">Figure S9E</xref>). Similar results are obtained when considering other measures of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences, such as those based on computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field2">[48]</xref> derived from in vitro data (unpublished analysis).</p>
<p>Thus, anti-nucleosomal sequences and expression patterns are insufficient to fully explain either conservation or divergence in chromatin organization across species. For example, proteasomal genes are highly expressed and have deep NFRs conserved in all species, but are not associated with intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Furthermore, RNA Polymerase II subunits, RNA export, and nuclear pore genes are highly expressed with deep NFRs conserved in most species, but are enriched for intrinsically anti-nucleosomal sequences in only a subset of species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2G</xref>, see below). Conversely, peroxisome genes are highly expressed in <italic>D. hansenii</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic>, where they are packaged with long (but not deep) NFRs, despite no enrichment for Poly(dA:dT) tracts (see below). In these and other cases, even when we consider expression levels, much of the depletion in NFRs remained unexplained (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s009">Figures S9</xref>,<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s010">S10</xref>).</p>

<title>General Regulatory Factors (GRFs) Contribute to the Establishment of NFRs in Each Species</title>
<p>We therefore wished to explore the role that the third mechanism—nucleosome eviction by chromatin remodelers—plays across the 12 species. We hypothesized that changes in chromatin remodeling would be accompanied by variation in the <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements bound by GRFs that likely recruit chromatin remodelers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Clapier1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Hartley1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Yarragudi1">[57]</xref>. Unlike intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences that establish constitutively programmed NFRs, binding sites for GRFs likely establish regulated NFRs that can change based on <italic>trans</italic> inputs.</p>
<p>We first assessed the potential contribution of chromatin remodelers to chromatin organization based on the presence in NFRs of the known binding sites for the two best-studied <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> GRFs: Abf1 and Reb1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s009">Figure S9E</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Together, the two motifs explain 1.2%–15.1% of the observed variation in nucleosome organization in the 12 species. Furthermore, Abf1 and Reb1 can explain up to 12.6% of the residual variation after accounting for the contribution of expression levels and intrinsic sequences (Successive Lowess, ). Thus, GRFs can play an important role in explaining global chromatin organization.</p>
<p>Notably, the Abf1 and Reb1 sites explain little of the variation in <italic>D. hansenii</italic>, <italic>C. albicans</italic>, and <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic>—the species from the two clades most distant from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. In particular, the Abf1 binding site explains less than 1% of the variation in each of these species, consistent with the absence of the Abf1 ortholog from their genome, and validating the specificity of our approach. Furthermore, although the Reb1 ortholog is present in each of these species, its contribution is substantially reduced (compared to, e.g., <italic>S. kluyveri</italic>). This loss of predictive power by Abf1 and Reb1 sites at increasing phylogenetic distance led us to hypothesize that other GRFs, with distinct binding specificity, are active in these species.</p>
<p>To identify novel GRF <italic>cis</italic>-elements, we therefore searched for short sequence elements that are depleted of nucleosomes in vivo but not in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>. We calculated the extent of nucleosome depletion over every 6- and 7-mer sequence in each of our species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s023">Table S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and identified those sequences whose depletion score in vivo in at least one species is significantly greater than expected from published in vitro data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s013">Figure S13</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s014">S14</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>.

In contrast, there are much more dramatic differences in the in vivo depleted sites (e.g., Rsc3/30, Cbf1) between the more distant <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>K. lactis</italic> (∼150 MYA, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s013">Figures S13C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s014">S14</xref>). Finally, there are also gradual changes in the specific Rsc3/30 CGCG-containing motifs that were nucleosome-depleted in each species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s023">Table S6</xref>), consistent with co-evolution of a GRF and its binding site, as previously observed for TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wohlbach1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Gasch1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>The use of different GRF sites often follows strong phylogenetic patterns, allowing us to trace transitions from the dominant use of one repertoire of GRFs to that of another, and suggesting compensatory evolution of GRF use. Most notably, we find a major and gradual transition from the use of Cbf1 as a major GRF in pre-WGD species to the use of Reb1 as a GRF in post-WGD species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The Cbf1 binding sequence CACGTG is nucleosome-depleted in vivo in most pre-WGD species (except <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> and <italic>C. albicans</italic>) but not in post-WGD species (except <italic>C. glabrata</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Conversely, Reb1 sites are nucleosome depleted in all post-WGD species but not in most pre-WGD species (except <italic>K. lactis</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This complementary phylogenetic pattern suggests an evolutionary scenario where Cbf1 was a major ancestral GRF, Reb1 emerged as a GRF before the WGD, and gradually “took over” Cbf1's global functionality. Similar evolutionary patterns were previously observed for TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wohlbach1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tuch1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Hogues1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tanay1">[62]</xref>, and this is the first demonstration to our knowledge of such a “mediated replacement” for GRFs. Evolutionary transitions in GRF usage are sometimes limited to one or a few species. For example, we found a set of novel motifs that were nucleosome-depleted only in <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s023">Table S6</xref>), the earliest diverging species in our panel.</p>
<p>Finally, we observe changes in the relative balance between nucleosome depletion via GRFs and constitutively programmed depletion via Poly(dA:dT) sequences, suggesting a global mode of compensatory evolution. Most notably, A7/T7 is less nucleosome-depleted at <italic>D. hansenii</italic> promoters than at promoters of any other species, whereas Cbf1-like and Rsc3/30-like sites are strongly nucleosome-depleted in <italic>D. hansenii</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s014">Figure S14</xref>). This transition is likely due to the shorter lengths of Poly(dA:dT) stretches in <italic>D. hansenii</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s011">Figure S11C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s024">Table S7</xref>), a sequence change that may be an adaptation to the high salt concentrations in this species' ecological niche (secondary to increased DNA flexibility in high salt). As noted above, <italic>D. hansenii</italic> has a very short average NFR width (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s020">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s011">Figure S11D</xref>), consistent with diminished nucleosome repulsion at its shorter Poly(dA:dT) sequences. We hypothesize that the expansion in use of the Cbf1 and Rsc3/30 GRFs is a mode of compensatory evolution needed to adapt to a change in genome sequence in a unique niche; it also suggests that <italic>D. hansenii</italic> NFRs may be more responsive to environmental signals.</p>

<title>Divergent GRFs Underlie Conserved Chromatin Organization in Proteasome Genes</title>
<p>We next hypothesized that the identified GRFs are important for the observed chromatin organization in functional gene sets across species. To test this hypothesis, we assessed the enrichments of GRF motifs in the NFRs of each gene set across the 12 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s025">Table S8</xref>).</p>
<p>In some cases, GRF motifs (but not Poly(dA:dT) tracts) were enriched in a gene set across multiple species, strongly indicating a conserved regulatory mechanism. For example, the Abf1 site is enriched in RNA polymerase genes across the clade spanning <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. kluyverii</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s015">Figure S15D</xref>). However, since the spectrum of GRFs is species-specific (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figures 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s014">S14</xref>), we found no gene set associated with the same GRF site across the entire phylogeny.</p>
<p>Instead, we found a number of cases where a single gene set has a conserved chromatin architecture but is associated with distinct GRF sites in different species, consistent with changes in the global GRF repertoire. This is most notable in proteasome genes, which are uniformly associated with wide/deep NFRs but are depleted of Poly(dA:dT) tracts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The establishment of NFRs at these genes has likely transitioned from a mechanism dependent on the CACGAC sequence in the <italic>Candida</italic> clade to an Abf1-dependent mechanism in later lineages, with additional contribution from Reb1 and Rsc3/30 sites, as these GRFs gained dominance in specific species and clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s015">S15E</xref>). Although the specific GRF mechanism underlying NFRs in proteasome genes has diverged, the establishment of wide/deep NFRs by a GRF-regulated mechanism (rather than polyA/constitutive mechanism) is conserved in all species. We hypothesize that GRF-regulated NFRs at proteasome genes may be related to the unusual transcriptional regulation of proteasome genes: these are among the few highly expressed “growth” genes (with open accessible promoters) that are further <italic>upregulated</italic> (rather than downregulated) during stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Gasch2">[63]</xref>.</p>

<title>Transition From Constitutively Programmed to GRF-Regulated NFRs in RNA Polymerase and Nuclear Pore Genes</title>
<p>Could promoters evolve from having constitutively programmed NFRs to regulated ones? To test this, we searched for gene sets where chromatin organization is conserved, while the underlying anti-nucleosomal sequences have diverged in a phylogenetically coherent pattern. We found that genes encoding RNA polymerase subunits exhibit deep NFRs across most of the phylogeny (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s015">Figure S15D</xref>). These genes' promoters are associated with Poly(dA:dT) tracts in <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> and the species of the <italic>Candida</italic> clade, with both Poly(dA:dT) and the site for the Abf1 GRF in species from <italic>S. kluyveryi</italic> to <italic>S. bayanus</italic>, and only with Abf1 in the clade spanning <italic>S. mikatae</italic>, <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figures 3D </xref>and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s015">S15D</xref>). Similar behavior is seen at a number of other gene sets, such as those encoding nuclear pore components (unpublished analysis). This profile suggests an evolutionary scenario where the ancestral mechanism relied on Poly(dA:dT). With the emergence of Abf1 in the LCA of the pre- and post-WGD species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wapinski1">[34]</xref>, it gained additional control of the NFRs in this gene set, alongside Poly(dA:dT) tracts. Then, after the divergence of <italic>S. bayanus</italic>, Poly(dA:dT) tracts were lost from the genes' promoters, leading to a complete switch from a constitutively programmed to a regulated NFRs. This compensatory evolution is consistent with patterns observed for TF binding sites in functional regulons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wohlbach1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tanay1">[62]</xref> and with the global transitions in GRFs described above.</p>

<title>Changes in GRFs Contribute to Chromatin Divergence Between Species in Peroxisomal Genes</title>
<p>In some cases, the gain or loss of binding sites for GRFs can contribute to divergence in chromatin organization, coupled to phenotypic changes.

<title>Evolutionary Re-Positioning of TF Motifs Relative to NFRs Contributes to Divergence of Gene Regulation in Mating, Meiosis, and Respiration Functions</title>
<p>Even when NFR positions and their underlying mechanisms are largely conserved, they can play an important role in regulatory divergence. Nucleosomes are generally inhibitory to TF binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kornberg1">[13]</xref>, and in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> most functional TF binding motifs are found in NFRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Yuan1">[23]</xref>. Precise positioning of TF binding sites relative to nucleosomes has regulatory consequences such as changing signaling thresholds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Lam1">[64]</xref> or logic gating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Lomvardas1">[65]</xref>. We therefore hypothesized that an evolutionary change in the location of TF-binding motifs relative to the nucleosomes in a gene's promoter can lead to regulatory divergence between species.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, we examined the location of known TF binding motifs (from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Badis1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Zhu1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Harbison1">[60]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-MacIsaac1">[66]</xref>) relative to nucleosome positions in each of the 12 species (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Consistent with our expectations, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>), up to 90% of the binding sites for growth-related TFs are localized to NFRs (e.g., REB1, ABF1, RAP1, and FHL1), whereas as few as 25% of sites for stress-related TFs are at NFRs (e.g., HSF1, YAP6, HAP2/3/5, GZF3, and CRZ1). Thus, sequences that are mostly occluded by nucleosomes tend to be the binding sites for inactive TFs, and we can use chromatin information to infer TF activity under our growth conditions in each species. We therefore calculated for each motif the fraction of its instances located in NFRs in each of the 12 species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figures 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s016">S16</xref>).</p>

<p>The NFR positioning of many key motifs is strongly conserved. For example, sites for growth-related factors such as SWI4/6 and GCN4 were similarly NFR-exposed in all species in this phylogeny. Notably, this conservation is observed despite the fact that many motifs, which were experimentally defined for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins, were globally less NFR-localized in distantly related species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s016">Figure S16B</xref>). This can be attributed in some cases to divergence of binding site preferences of the cognate TFs, and in other cases to the absence of the TF's ortholog from the genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, white). Nevertheless, many motifs showed robust conserved positioning in NFRs.</p>
<p>Conversely, the motifs for key TFs associated with regulation of respiration and carbohydrate metabolism have repositioned relative to NFRs at the WGD, consistent with regulatory divergence in these functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). For example, the sites for the HAP2/3/4/5 complex (a regulator of respiration genes) and for YAP6 (a regulator of oxidative functions) have re-positioned from NFRs to nucleosome-occluded positions post-WGD, consistent with the reduction in expression of respirative genes. In contrast, the sites for the carbon catabolite repressor MIG2 and for the glucose-responsive TF RGT1 have repositioned from nucleosomes into NFRs in post-WGD species, consistent with these factors' role in establishing a fermentative strategy through gene repression.</p>
<p>Motif re-positioning has also occurred at other phylogenetic points and gene sets, suggesting that this is a general regulatory and evolutionary mechanism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). For example, the mating-related STE12 motif is significantly enriched upstream of reproduction and mating-related genes in species from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to <italic>S. kluyverii</italic>, including <italic>C. glabrata</italic>. Although STE12 sites are found in NFRs at mating genes for most of these species, they are largely nucleosome-occluded in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figure 4E</xref>), an organism which has never been observed to mate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Muller1">[67]</xref>. We speculate that occlusion of STE12 sites under nucleosomes may contribute to this species' reluctance to mate, but the continued enrichment of STE12 upstream of mating genes and the retention of many meiosis-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wapinski1">[34]</xref> in <italic>C. glabrata</italic> suggests that it may still be capable of mating under special conditions. We therefore predict that conditions (environmental or perhaps genetic) that either mobilize or destabilize the nucleosomes covering STE12 sites at pheromone-response genes might enable mating in this species. Similarly, motifs for UME6, a major regulator of meiosis genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Williams1">[68]</xref>, are globally NFR-positioned in all species except <italic>C. glabrata</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), despite the fact that UME6 sites are enriched upstream of orthologs of meiosis-related genes in <italic>C. glabrata</italic>. Thus, the relative re-positioning of NFRs and TF binding sites may help explain the molecular underpinnings of dramatic changes in regulatory and phenotypic evolution.</p>

<title>Duplication of TF Genes Increases the Regulatory Capacity of Conserved <italic>Cis</italic>-Regulatory Sites Positioned at NFRs</title>
<p>Finally, we asked whether chromatin information could be used to infer the regulatory effect of exposed TF binding sites from the expression level of their target genes. We expect exposed TF binding sites to have different regulatory consequences depending on whether or not the TF is active and whether it acts as an activator or a repressor. We reasoned that an NFR-positioned site for an active positive regulator will be associated with a higher expression of the target genes. Conversely, an NFR-positioned site for an active negative regulator will be associated with a lower expression of the target genes. We therefore compared the expression level of all genes where a given TF motif was located within nucleosomes versus those in which the motif was located within promoter linkers (largely the NFR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Consistent with our expectation, in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, transcriptional activators known to be active in mid-log phase, such as RPN4 or PBF1, were associated with higher expression levels at genes carrying an accessible, linker-positioned motif. In contrast, NFR-positioned motifs for transcriptional repressors known to be active in mid-log (e.g., MIG1, SUM1, NRG1, DIG1, STB1/2, or RIM101; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) were associated with lower downstream gene expression. Thus, we devised a novel approach to predict whether a given motif is associated with an activator or repressor in vivo in the growth condition tested.</p>

<p>When we extended this analysis to all 12 species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s017">Figure S17</xref>), we found substantial divergence in the regulatory logic of the same NFR-positioned motif, most notably at the WGD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We found a host of motifs which, when present in NFRs, were associated with differences in RNA expression levels between pre- and post-WGD species. Many of those (∼100) appeared to shift from activator-like behavior in pre-WGD species (higher target expression when in NFR) to repressor-like behavior in post-WGD species (lower target expression when in NFR). These included sites for a surprisingly large number of TFs involved in repression of metabolic genes in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, including MIG1, GIS1, RGT1, and GAL80. Interestingly, several of these genes are found in a single copy in pre-WGD species but were retained as duplicates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Wapinski1">[34]</xref> with similar DNA-binding specificity following the WGD (e.g., GIS1/RPH1, RGT1/EDS1; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g005">Figure 5B,C</xref>).

<title>A Comparative Approach to Study the Determinants of Chromatin Organization</title>
<p>What establishes the nucleosomal organization of a genome? While it has been argued that intrinsic DNA sequence can almost fully explain nucleosome organization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>, recent analysis of in vitro reconstitution data showed that the major intrinsic contributor to nucleosome positioning in budding yeast is the anti-nucleosomal behavior of Poly(dA:dT) and related sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Zhang1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Tillo1">[70]</xref>. Conversely, recent reports indicate that in <italic>S. pombe</italic> Poly(dA:dT) plays only a minor role in nucleosome exclusion in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Lantermann1">[33]</xref>, indicating that even the best-understood sequence contributor to chromatin organization plays variable roles in chromatin structure in different species.</p>
<p>Our analysis provides several lines of evidence that expression levels, intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences, and binding sites for GRFs that may recruit chromatin modifiers all play a role in establishing promoter chromatin architecture, and that the balance between these three contributors changes in evolution and between functional groups of genes. (1) We show that a sequence-based model based on in vitro depletion alone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref> can only account for 8.6%–25.7% of variance in NFR depth within any of the 12 species, including <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (10.6%). Similarly, expression levels alone can only account for 1.7%–13.1% of the variation in each species. Even when combining both the expression and intrinsic models we can only explain 13%–29% of the variation within any single species. (2) Although changes in intrinsic sequences and expression levels can explain changes in chromatin across species for some gene sets (e.g., mRPs or splicing genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>), they are insufficient to explain conserved chromatin behavior across the phylogeny (e.g., RNA Polymerase subunit genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), nor do they explain changes in chromatin organization across species in other groups of genes (e.g., peroxisome genes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). Thus, these two determinants (alone or in combination) are insufficient to explain both intra- and inter-species variation. (3) In contrast, by comparing our in vivo data in each species to two in vitro datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>, we find in each species a host of sequences that exhibit significantly greater nucleosome depletion in vivo than in vitro. Many of these correspond to binding sites for known GRFs that play an active role in nucleosome eviction in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-RadmanLivaja1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Clapier1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Hartley1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Badis1">[58]</xref>, whereas others represent novel candidate GRF sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">6C</xref>). (4) The relative contribution to nucleosome organization from GRFs, intrinsic sequences, and expression levels varies between different gene sets (in all species). For example, we show that intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences are enriched at NFRs in cytoplasmic RPs (in all species; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), whereas GRFs fulfill this role in proteasome genes (in all species; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s015">Figure S15</xref>). (5) We also show that the relative contribution of one mechanism versus another can change in evolution (across species), both globally (as in the halophile <italic>D. hansenii</italic>, that relies more on GRFs) and in specific gene sets (as in the RNA polymerase gene set that shifted from intrinsic to regulated NFRs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). (6) Globally, even when we consider only the binding sites for the two best-characterized GRFs from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (Abf1 and Reb1), GRFs alone can explain 5.2%–15.1% of the variation in nucleosome organization (in species where their orthologs are present), and 3.7%–12.6% of the residual variation after considering the contribution from expression and Poly(dA:dT). Taken together, this analysis points to a complex interplay between the different factors that control nucleosome positions, allows us to assess their contributions, and recognizes the plastic and evolvable nature of all the determinants.</p>

<title>Major Modes for the Evolutionary Interplay Between Chromatin Organization and Gene Regulation</title>
<p>Our study also discovers an intricate and intimate relationship between conservation and divergence of chromatin organization and evolution of gene regulation. At one extreme, we found a broad functional dichotomy in chromatin organization between “growth” and “stress” genes, which is largely conserved. At the other extreme, we found that chromatin organization has diverged at a major evolutionary scale, as has happened during the evolution of respiro-fermentation, and at other points of phylogenetic and phenotypic divergence.</p>
<p>We found five major mechanisms by which chromatin organization can be associated with divergence of gene expression. Each of these was “used” more than once in the phylogeny, and is associated with more than one phenotypic or regulatory change, including the changes described in carbon metabolism, mating, meiosis, and splicing genes. These include (1) gain or loss of intrinsic (PolyA) sequences can open or close NFRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>; (2) conserved NFRs can be controlled by different GRF determinants, through compensatory evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g003">Figure 3C</xref>); (3) NFRs can shift between constitutive and regulated determinants by compensatory (“balanced”) gain/loss of intrinsic anti-nucleosomal sequences and GRF binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">Figure 6D</xref>); (4) motifs can re-position relative to NFRs to change transcriptional output (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">Figure 6E–G</xref>); and (5) duplication and divergence of <italic>trans</italic>-factors can expand the regulatory behavior of conserved NFRs and binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g006">Figure 6H</xref>).</p>

<title>Reprogramming Expression Through Evolution: The Case of Respiro-Fermentation</title>
<p>The evolution of the respiro-fermentative lifestyle following the WGD required a major reprogramming of the yeast transcriptional network and involved all of the mechanisms we describe. The shift thus included loss of intrinsic Poly(dA:dT) anti-nucleosomal sequences in some functional modules (e.g., mitochondrial RP genes), and the loss or switch of putative GRF sequences in others (e.g., oxidation-reduction genes). Furthermore, sites for certain respiratory TFs (e.g., HAP2/3/5, YAP1/3/6) have re-positioned out of NFRs, and those for glucose repression TFs have re-positioned into NFRs (e.g., RGT1, MIG1). In yet other cases, the WGD has resulted in the retention of paralogous activator-repressor pairs that control several modules in carbohydrate metabolism. Notably, each of these mechanisms has acted also at other phylogenetic points, suggesting that they point to general principles, and emphasizing the utility of the WGD as a model to study regulatory evolution.</p>

<p>We used BLAT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kent1">[71]</xref> to map sequenced reads from each experiment to the corresponding reference genome, keeping only reads that mapped to a unique location and allowing for up to 4 mismatches. Each uniquely mapped read was then extended to a length of 100 bp. To generate a genomic nucleosome occupancy landscape, we summed all extended reads covering each base pair. We then masked all repetitive regions along each track, defining repetitive regions as locations in the genome that cannot be uniquely defined by the length of a read (36 bp). We also masked all regions of nucleosome occupancy greater than 10 times the median occupancy, to remove outlier effects that occur in places such as the rDNA locus. To normalize for sequencing depth for each genomic nucleosome track, we divided the occupancy at each location by the mean nucleosome occupancy per base pair. These normalized maps were used to generate the average nucleosome occupancy plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000414-g002">2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s002">S2</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s003">S3</xref>).</p>

<title>Detection of Nucleosome Positions</title>
<p>To infer the location of nucleosomes from the data, we used a Parzen window approach similar to that previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Shivaswamy1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Albert1">[46]</xref>. Our modified approach uses three parameters—the average DNA fragment length, the standard deviation of the Parzen window, and the maximum allowable overlap between nucleosomes. To estimate the mean DNA fragment length in each experiment, we shifted reads from one strand and then correlated them with the reads of the opposite strand. For each species, we observed a peak in the cross-correlation at a shift between 127 and 153 bp, which we used to estimate the mean DNA fragment length per experiment. We chose a standard deviation of the Parzen window of 30 bp for all species, since it closely matched the observed standard deviation around the cross-correlation peak of each experiment. Finally, we set the maximum allowable overlap between nucleosomes to 20 bp. We then shifted all read start locations by half of the mean DNA fragment length in the direction towards the dyad of the nucleosome they represent. Our approach places a normal distribution with a standard deviation of 30 bp at each read's shifted location. Summing all individual curves for all loci leads to a smoothed probability landscape of nucleosome occupancy. We next identify all peaks along the landscape, which represent nucleosome centers. The algorithm then places nucleosomes along the genome in the order of decreasing peak heights (greedy approach) and iteratively masks out these regions to prevent more than 20 bp overlap between nucleosomes.</p>

<title>Finding 5′ and 3′ NFRs</title>
<p>We define 5′ and 3′ NFRs as the linker DNA of “significant length” closest to the 5′ and 3′ end of each gene, respectively. To find NFRs, we first created a nucleosome call landscape for each genome, normalized for sequencing depth in the same manner as the nucleosome occupancy maps (above). NFR boundaries were often obscured by very low occupancy nucleosome calls. We therefore removed all nucleosome calls with occupancy less than 40% of the average nucleosome occupancy from the map. We searched for 5′ or 3′ NFRs within 1,000 bases upstream/downstream of the 5′ or 3′ end of each gene, truncated when neighboring ORFs overlapped this region. We then defined an NFR as the linker DNA longer than 60 bp closest to the 5′ or 3′ end of each gene. If no linker longer than 60 bp was found in this search, we defined the NFR as the first linker from the 5′ or 3′ end. Our method was highly predictive of transcription start sites (TSSs) in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Xu1">[50]</xref>—the NFR boundary closest to the 5′ end of the gene was able to predict 84% of TSSs within 50 bp. Linker lengths of 50 bp or 70 bp and occupancy thresholds of 30% or 50% produced highly similar results (unpublished data).</p>

<title>Controlling for Cross-Species Variation in 5′NFR-ATG Distance</title>
<p>Since 5′NFR-ATG distances vary substantially between species, an analysis of nucleosome organization that relies on alignment by ATG can be misleading. For example, the average nucleosome organization of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> and <italic>S. castellii</italic> look similar when aligned by the +1 nucleosomes (<italic>Nuc<sup>+1</sup></italic>) but very different when aligned by ATG (unpublished data). A previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref> defines a promoter nucleosome depleted region (PNDR) score as mean nucleosome occupancy of the most depleted 100 bp region within 200 bp upstream of the ATG. Since some species have longer 5′NFR-ATG distances we reasoned that the NFR of some genes may not be contained within a 200 bp window (e.g., only a third of <italic>C. glabrata</italic> NFRs are contained within 200 bp, while 90% are contained within 500 bp).

We also learned the 0<sup>th</sup>-order Markov background probability distribution <italic>B(S<sub>1</sub>, …, S<sub>L</sub>)</italic> for each sequence <italic>S<sub>1</sub></italic>…<italic>S<sub>L</sub></italic>, set to the frequency of the four nucleotides in the promoter regions of a given species. We calculate <italic>A(P,S)</italic>, a motif's affinity score for an NFR sequence <italic>S</italic>, by summing the contributions of <italic>P(S<sub>1</sub>, …, S<sub>L</sub>)/B(S<sub>1</sub>, …, S<sub>L</sub>)</italic> over all allowable positions <italic>k</italic> in <italic>S</italic> as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000414.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
<p>Here, <italic>b(S<sub>k+j-1</sub>)</italic> is the background probability of the nucleotide <italic>S<sub>k+j-1</sub></italic> of sequence <italic>S</italic>, and <italic>p(S<sub>k+j-1</sub>,j)</italic> is the probability for nucleotide <italic>S<sub>k+j-1</sub></italic> in position <italic>j</italic> of the motif's PSSM. For the results in this study, we combined the contributions of both forward and reverse strands of each NFR. Also, normalizing the affinity by the length of each NFR sequence did not affect our results significantly.</p>

<title>N-mer Analysis</title>
<p>Prior to analysis, we log2-transformed the normalized nucleosome occupancy data (Data post-processing, above), subtracted the mean, and divided by the standard deviation. Hence, the global nucleosome occupancy data for each species is approximately normal with zero mean and unit variance. We also used the same procedure for processing published in vitro data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>For each N-mer, we define the <italic>in vivo depletion score</italic> as the mean −log2 normalized nucleosome occupancy across all instances and all instances of the reverse complement. We also defined the <italic>depletion score relative to in vitro</italic> as power 2 of the difference between the in vivo depletion scores in each species and the in vitro depletion scores in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> (also repeated for in vitro data from <italic>C. albicans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field1">[32]</xref>). The analysis was done for <italic>N</italic> = 5, 6, 7, 8 and also repeated for N-mers found only in coding regions and only in upstream promoter regions.</p>

<title>Poly(dA:dT) Tracts</title>
<p>To annotate all Poly(dA:dT) tracts in each species and determine their nucleosome repelling strength we used an approach similar to a previously described one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Field2">[48]</xref>. In summary, for each species' genome we found all PolyA or PolyT tracts of length <italic>L</italic> of 5 bp or more. We define the depletion score for a tract of length <italic>L</italic> as the mean of the −log2 normalized nucleosome occupancy across all instances of that length. This was calculated both using in vitro data from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000414-Kaplan1">[21]</xref> and the in vivo data from each species. For long Poly(dA:dT) tracts with very few occurrences in a given genome we noticed a larger variation in the depletion score, likely due to small sample size. To mitigate this problem, we fit a line for depletion scores versus <italic>L</italic> using a weighted linear least squares fit with weights proportional to the number of occurrences for tracts of length <italic>L</italic>. We then used the line as an estimate for long tracts with fewer than 100 occurrences in a given genome. We iterated this procedure for all maximal Poly(dA:dT) tract with <italic>k</italic> allowed mismatches, <italic>k</italic> = 1, …,20. The depletion score increases linearly with <italic>L</italic> for tracts with different <italic>k</italic>, confirming that a linear fit is appropriate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000414.s011">Figure S11</xref>).</p>
<p>To aggregate all non-overlapping Poly(dA:dT) tracts within a given genome, we first quantized the strengths for each <italic>L</italic>. We define the fold depletion score of all tracts of length <italic>L</italic> as power 2 of the depletion score. We then quantized all Poly(dA:dT) tract fold depletion scores to the highest fold depletion level exceeding 2, 4, 8, 16, and 32. For example, a tract with a depletion score of 3.5 is 2<sup>3.5</sup> = 11.3-fold depleted in nucleosomes relative to average, and would be assigned a fold depletion score of 8. We next iterated over all Poly(dA:dT) tracts with mismatches <italic>k</italic> = 0, …,20, replacing overlapping tracts only if the tract with more mismatches had a higher quantized fold depletion score.</p>

<p><bold>Two scenarios for changes in NFR-ATG distance.</bold> (A) Canonical promoter architecture in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> –transcriptional start site (TSS) is typically found at ∼13 nt 3′ to the upstream border of <italic>Nuc<sup>+1</sup></italic>. (B) 5′NFR to ATG distance (<italic>D<sub>5′NFR-ATG</sub></italic>) varies in other species without annotated TSSs.
