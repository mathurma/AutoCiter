				<article-title>Amyloid Peptide Toxicity in an Animal Model of Alzheimer Disease</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Protein aggregation into amyloid fibrils and protofibrillar aggregates is associated with a number of the most common neurodegenerative diseases. We have established, using a computational approach, that knowledge of the primary sequences of proteins is sufficient to predict their in vitro aggregation propensities. Here we demonstrate, using rational mutagenesis of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide based on such computational predictions of aggregation propensity, the existence of a strong correlation between the propensity of Aβ<sub>42</sub> to form protofibrils and its effect on neuronal dysfunction and degeneration in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of Alzheimer disease. Our findings provide a quantitative description of the molecular basis for the pathogenicity of Aβ and link directly and systematically the intrinsic properties of biomolecules, predicted in silico and confirmed in vitro, to pathogenic events taking place in a living organism.</p>

          <p>A wide range of diseases, including diabetes and common brain diseases of old age, are characterised by the deposition of protein in the affected tissues. Alzheimer disease, the most common neurodegenerative disorder, is caused by the aggregation and deposition of a peptide called Aβ in the brain. We have previously developed a computational procedure that predicts a particular peptide or protein's speed of aggregation in the test tube. Our goal was to test whether the speed of aggregate formation that we observe in the test tube is directly linked to the brain toxicity that we see in our fruit fly model of Alzheimer disease. We made flies that produce each of 17 variant forms of Aβ and show that the toxicity of each variant is closely linked to the tendency of each variant to form small soluble aggregates. Our computational procedure has previously been shown to be applicable to a wide range of different proteins and diseases, and so this demonstration that it can predict toxicity in an animal model system has implications for many areas of disease-related research.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A wide range of proteins has been found to convert into extracellular amyloid fibrils, or amyloid-like intracellular inclusions, under physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b002">2</xref>]. Such proteins have largely been identified through their association with disease, although a number have been found to have beneficial physiological functions in organisms including, amongst others, bacteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b003">3</xref>], yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b004">4</xref>], and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b005">5</xref>]. Indeed, the ability to aggregate and assemble into amyloid-like fibrils has emerged as a common, and perhaps fundamental, property of polypeptide chains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b007">7</xref>]. This discovery has stimulated extensive biophysical and mutational analysis of the underlying molecular determinants of amyloid fibril formation. These studies have resulted in the derivation of general models, based on physicochemical parameters, that both rationalise and predict the propensity of proteins to convert from their soluble forms into intractable amyloid aggregates in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>The misfolding and aggregation of proteins in vivo, however, differ from similar processes taking place under in vitro experimental conditions, in that they occur in complex cellular environments containing a host of factors that are known to modulate protein aggregation and protect against any subsequent toxicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b011">11</xref>]. This difference between in vitro and in vivo experimental conditions represents a significant barrier to the development of a molecular understanding of protein aggregation in living systems and its consequences for disease. In this paper we describe the results of an approach designed to bridge this divide by expressing a range of mutational variants of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b012">12</xref>] and correlating their influence on the longevity and behaviour of the flies with their underlying physicochemical characteristics.</p>

      <title>Results/Discussion</title>
      <p>The expression of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide (coupled to a secretion signal peptide) in the central nervous system of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> results in both intracellular and extracellular deposition of Aβ<sub>42</sub>, along with neuronal dysfunction, revealed by abnormal locomotor behaviour and reduced longevity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b014">14</xref>]. Learning and memory deficits are also observed in flies expressing Aβ<sub>42</sub> and to a lesser extent in those expressing Aβ<sub>40</sub>. Importantly, the severity of the cognitive deficits is closely correlated with the magnitude of the locomotor and longevity phenotypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b014">14</xref>]. Our system, as with other recently developed invertebrate models of neurodegenerative disease, therefore produces clear, quantitative phenotypes that allow rapid and statistically robust assessments of the effects of mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b016">16</xref>]. Using an algorithm described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b010">10</xref>] we computed the intrinsic aggregation propensities (<italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub>) of all 798 possible single point mutations of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide and also of the more toxic E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide. A total of 17 mutational variants, with a wide range of aggregation propensities (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050290-t001">Table 1</xref>), were then expressed throughout the central nervous system of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster,</italic> and their effects were compared to those of wild-type (WT) and E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> expression. The longevity of multiple lines of flies (<italic>n</italic> = 4–6 independent lines) for each variant was compared to that of flies expressing the WT or E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide. This pooling of data from multiple independent lines for each Aβ<sub>42</sub> mutant studied serves as a control for the potential variation in expression levels between transgene insertion sites. In addition, the locomotor ability of a representative selection of the Aβ<sub>42</sub>-variant-expressing flies was assessed to provide a measure of the early effects of the peptides on neuronal dysfunction. Examples of the results of this analysis are shown for four of the variants studied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

      <p>Whilst our analysis reveals a significant relationship between the aggregation propensity of Aβ<sub>42</sub> and its effects on neuronal integrity in vivo, it has also uncovered a small number of variants that do not conform to this trend, most notably the I31E/E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide. In order to determine the significance of such divergent behaviour for the origins of Aβ<sub>42</sub> pathogenicity, we selected one peptide whose effects on the longevity and mobility of the flies is well predicted by its <italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub> (F20E) and one whose effects did not correlate with its <italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub> (I31E/E22G) and performed further analysis of their aggregation in vitro and in vivo.</p>
      <p>The F20E mutation is predicted to reduce significantly the propensity of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide to aggregate (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050290-t001">Table 1</xref>). Indeed, when we measure the rate of aggregation using thioflavin T fluorescence we find that F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> does aggregate significantly more slowly in vitro than the WT Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 44 and 11 min, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), in good accord with our predictions.</p>

      <p>The in vivo aggregation of the F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide is also significantly reduced compared to that of the WT Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide. Anti-Aβ<sub>42</sub> immunohistochemistry using a C-terminal-specific antibody that binds an epitope (Aβ residues 35–42) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b018">18</xref>] that does not include the residues being studied here, reveals progressive accumulation of Aβ<sub>42</sub> in the brains of WT-Aβ<sub>42</sub>-expressing flies from 10 d of age, with extensive deposition being evident by day 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g004">Figure 4</xref>B). In contrast to this behaviour, flies expressing F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> show no signs of Aβ<sub>42</sub> deposition at day 20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Quantitative reverse transcription polymerase chain reaction (qRT-PCR) analysis of Aβ<sub>42</sub> transcription levels was also carried out on WT Aβ<sub>42</sub> and two independent lines of F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> fly brains to ensure that the reduced deposition and toxicity of the F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide was not due to coincidentally lower transcription levels. In fact, the F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> transgene was transcribed at slightly higher levels than WT Aβ<sub>42</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050290-sg002">Figure S2</xref>) in both lines tested.</p>
      <p>That the F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide does not form in vivo deposits, despite being able to form amyloid fibrils in vitro (albeit significantly more slowly than WT Aβ<sub>42</sub>) suggests that the F20E mutation reduces the aggregation propensity of Aβ<sub>42</sub> sufficiently to allow cellular clearance mechanisms such as proteases (e.g., neprilysin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b013">13</xref>] to prevent its accumulation in vivo. We conclude, therefore, that the increased longevity and locomotor performance of F20E Aβ<sub>42</sub> flies are indeed attributable to a measurable reduction in the aggregation propensity of this peptide in vivo, as predicted by our analysis.</p>
      <p>In the case of the I31E/E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> variant there appears to be no correlation between its predicted aggregation propensity (which is very similar to that of the highly pathogenic E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0050290-t001">Table 1</xref>) and its effects on longevity and locomotor behaviour in the fly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g001">1</xref>D). However, studies of the I31E/E22G and E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptides in vitro show that, as predicted by our algorithm, they aggregate at very similar rates (<italic>t</italic><sub>1/2</sub> = 7 and 4 min, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). Furthermore, anti-Aβ<sub>42</sub> immunohistochemistry reveals similar levels of deposition in the brains of both E22G- and I31E/E22G-Aβ<sub>42</sub>-expressing flies at 8 d of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g004">Figure 4</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g004">4</xref>F) that cannot be accounted for by variations in transcription level as measured by qRT-PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050290-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Together these observations confirm that our predictions of aggregation propensity are accurate for these peptides in vivo as well as in vitro. To determine the consequences of peptide deposition on the integrity of the brain, we looked for the presence of vacuoles, which are a well-documented sign of neurodegeneration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b019">19</xref>]. Despite comparable levels of deposition, the vacuoles seen in the brains of E22G-Aβ<sub>42</sub>-expressing flies are entirely absent from the brains of I31E/E22G-Aβ<sub>42</sub>-expressing flies. In this case, therefore, the relationship between the presence of Aβ<sub>42</sub> deposits and the functional and anatomical integrity of the brain does not appear to hold.</p>
      <p>This observation is reminiscent of the finding that there are cases in which the presence of Aβ plaques in the brains of elderly humans, and indeed in transgenic mouse models of Alzheimer disease, does not correlate with cognitive ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b021">21</xref>]. It has been proposed, in explanation of this finding, that the neuronal dysfunction and degeneration historically attributed to the presence of Aβ amyloid fibrils in the brains of patients with Alzheimer disease may in fact be caused by the concomitant presence of prefibrillar aggregates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b022">22</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b024">24</xref>]. With this in mind, the unexpected in vivo effects of variants such as the I31E/E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide prompted us to develop a second algorithm (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) by analysing a set of data for which the rates of formation of protofibrils containing β-sheet structure have been reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b008">8</xref>]. This algorithm is able to predict the propensity of other polypeptides to form protofibrils. Whilst there are a few Aβ<sub>42</sub> variants (including I31E/E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub>) whose global aggregation propensities (Z<sub>agg</sub>) do not correlate well with their in vivo effects on neuronal dysfunction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g002">Figure 2</xref>), we find that the predicted propensities of these variants to form protofibrillar aggregates (<italic>Z</italic><sub>tox</sub>) correlate very strongly with their in vivo effects (<italic>S</italic><sub>tox</sub>, <italic>r =</italic> 0.83, <italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.00001; <italic>M</italic><sub>tox</sub>, <italic>r</italic> = 0.75, <italic>p =</italic> 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050290-g005">Figure 5</xref>).</p>

      <p>We propose, therefore, that the effects of all Aβ<sub>42</sub> variants in the flies can be directly attributed to their effects on the intrinsic propensities to form deleterious protofibrillar aggregates. It is extremely interesting in this regard that a comparison, using electron microscopy, of the morphology of E22G and I31E/E22G Aβ<sub>42</sub> aggregates formed under identical conditions reveals the presence of a significant quantity of protofibrils in the former and only well-defined fibrils in the latter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050290-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, we propose that it is possible to predict accurately in silico the in vivo effects of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide from a knowledge only of the intrinsic physicochemical properties of its constituent amino acids. We believe that this approach to understanding the determinants of protein misfolding in vivo will be applicable to many other diseases as we have demonstrated previously that the physicochemical parameters that determine the aggregation propensity of Aβ also determine the aggregation behaviour of a wide range of both disease- and non-disease-related proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b025">25</xref>].</p>
      <p>It is also remarkable that, despite the fact that the intrinsic aggregation propensities of typical protein sequences vary by at least five orders of magnitude [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b025">25</xref>], we have been able to achieve profound alterations in the pathogenic effects of Aβ<sub>42</sub> by increasing or decreasing its propensity to aggregate by less than 15%. This result suggests that proteins implicated in misfolding diseases are likely to be extremely close to the limit of their solubility under normal physiological conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b026">26</xref>], and consequently the small alterations in their concentration, environment, or sequence, such as occur with genetic mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b027">27</xref>] or with increasing age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b023">23</xref>], are likely to be the fundamental origin of these highly debilitating and increasingly common conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b028">28</xref>].</p>
      <p>In conclusion, we have presented accurate, quantitative measurements of the relationships between the manifestations of neuronal dysfunction in a complex organism, such as locomotor deficits and reduced lifespan, and the fundamental physicochemical factors that determine the propensity of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide to aggregate into protofibrils. These results provide compelling evidence that, despite the presence within the cell of multiple regulatory mechanisms such as molecular chaperones and degradation systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b029">29</xref>], it is the intrinsic, sequence-dependent propensity of the Aβ<sub>42</sub> peptide to aggregate to form protofibrillar aggregates that is the primary determinant of its pathological behaviour in living systems.</p>

Differences between genotypes were analysed by ANOVA. The effect of each mutational variant on locomotor performance (<italic>M</italic><sub>tox</sub>) was calculated by fitting the decline in mobility index over time to a straight line and then estimating the time at which each mutant line of flies had declined to a mobility index of 0.5.</p>

        <title>Analysing the aggregation propensity of A<bold>β</bold><sub>42</sub> mutants.</title>
        <p>The propensity to form amyloid aggregates (<italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub>) was calculated using an approach described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b010">10</xref>]. Briefly, for a given protein, <italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub> is obtained by averaging the propensities that are above zero in the aggregation profile. All the propensities are normalised into a variable that has an average of zero and a standard deviation that equals one (the normalisation is made using the propensities of a set of random sequences). In a profile there can be residues with a propensity larger than one, but these peaks are usually sparse and their contribution is diluted upon averaging. Consequently, sequences with an overall <italic>Z</italic><sub>agg</sub> score larger than one are very rare. In order to calculate the propensity for forming protofibrillar aggregates (<italic>Z</italic><sub>tox</sub>), we developed a method based on an equation containing the same physicochemical contributions used to calculate the propensity for fibrillar aggregation, but with specific weights determined using a set of experimentally determined protofibrillar aggregation rates for the protein acylphosphatase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050290-b030">30</xref>].

        <p>Twenty flies expressing each variant of Aβ<sub>42</sub> were collected at day 0 (i.e., on the day of eclosion) for each transgenic line to be analysed. The flies were then anaesthetised and decapitated, and the heads were collected and snap frozen in liquid N<sub>2</sub>. Total RNA was extracted from the fly heads using the Qiagen RNeasy mini kit with on-column genomic DNA digestion using DNAse 1. The concentration of total RNA purified for each line was measured using a NanoDrop spectrophotometer. One microgram of RNA was then subjected to reverse transcription using the Promega Reverse Transcription System with oligo dT primers. qRT-PCR was performed using a BioRad iCycler and Absolute QPCR SYBR Green Fluorescein Mix (ABgene). Each sample was analysed in triplicate and with both target gene (Aβ<sub>42</sub>) and control gene (RP49) primers in parallel. The primers for the Aβ<sub>42</sub> PCR were directed to the 5′ end of the signal secretion peptide sequence and the 3′ end of the Aβ coding sequence: forward, GCATTCGTGAATTCATGGCGAGCAAAGT; reverse, TACTTCTAGATCCTCGAGTTACGCAATCAC. The RP49 primers were designed across an intron to avoid amplifying any residual genomic DNA contamination: forward, ATGACCATCCGCCCAGCATCAGG; reverse, ATCTCGCCGCAGTAAACG. Relative expression levels were calculated using the Livak method.</p>
