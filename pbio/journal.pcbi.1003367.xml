<abstract>
<p>Despite explosive growth in genomic datasets, the methods for studying epigenomic mechanisms of gene regulation remain primitive. Here we present a model-based approach to systematically analyze the epigenomic functions in modulating transcription factor-DNA binding. Based on the first principles of statistical mechanics, this model considers the interactions between epigenomic modifications and a cis-regulatory module, which contains multiple binding sites arranged in any configurations. We compiled a comprehensive epigenomic dataset in mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells, including DNA methylation (MeDIP-seq and MRE-seq), DNA hydroxymethylation (5-hmC-seq), and histone modifications (ChIP-seq). We discovered correlations of transcription factors (TFs) for specific combinations of epigenomic modifications, which we term epigenomic motifs. Epigenomic motifs explained why some TFs appeared to have different DNA binding motifs derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> (ChIP-seq) and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. Theoretical analyses suggested that the epigenome can modulate transcriptional noise and boost the cooperativity of weak TF binding sites. ChIP-seq data suggested that epigenomic boost of binding affinities in weak TF binding sites can function in mES cells. We showed in theory that the epigenome should suppress the TF binding differences on SNP-containing binding sites in two people. Using personal data, we identified strong associations between H3K4me2/H3K9ac and the degree of personal differences in NFκB binding in SNP-containing binding sites, which may explain why some SNPs introduce much smaller personal variations on TF binding than other SNPs. In summary, this model presents a powerful approach to analyze the functions of epigenomic modifications. This model was implemented into an open source program APEG (<underline>A</underline>ffinity <underline>P</underline>rediction by <underline>E</underline>pigenome and <underline>G</underline>enome, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://systemsbio.ucsd.edu/apeg" xlink:type="simple">http://systemsbio.ucsd.edu/apeg</ext-link>).</p>

<p>We developed a model-based approach to systematically analyze the epigenomic functions in modulating transcription factor-DNA binding. We postulated the existence of TF-specific epigenomic motifs, which could explain why some TFs appeared to have different DNA binding motifs derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments. The theoretical results suggested that the epigenome can modulate transcriptional noise and boost the cooperativity of weak TF binding sites. A preliminary analysis of the existing data suggested that epigenomic boost of binding affinities in weak TF binding sites could be a widespread regulatory mechanism in mES cells. Moreover, using personal data, we identified strong associations between H3K4me2/H3K9ac and the degree of individual differences in NFκB binding in SNP-containing binding sites, suggesting the theoretical mechanism for epigenome to attenuate the TF binding differences on SNP-containing binding sites in two individuals may contribute to link genomic variation to phenotypic variation. Thus, this model presents a powerful approach to analyze the functions of epigenomic modifications.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Central to transcriptional regulation of gene expression is the regulation of the quantities of transcription factors (TF) bound to genomic regulatory sequences. The information used to quantitatively control TF-DNA binding is not only encoded in the genomic sequences, but likely is also embedded in the chemical modifications to the genomic sequences and the nearby histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Lupien1">[1]</xref>. The chemical modifications (called epigenomic modifications) include the addition of a methyl group or a hydroxymethyl group to the 5th carbon of cytosine (5-mC and 5-hmC) and a number of posttranslational modifications to the histone proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Mikkelsen1">[2]</xref>. These modifications can alter the chromatin structure and function by changing the charge of the nucleosome or directly interacting with TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Kouzarides1">[3]</xref>. In turn, TFs can tether DNA modification enzymes and histone modification enzymes to change the epigenomic modifications around the TF binding region. Hence, both the genomic sequences and the epigenetic modifications contribute to define the regional diversity of the regulatory genome. Less clear is how the genome and the epigenome jointly encode regulatory information, and how TFs interact with such regulatory information. The goal of this work is to model the three-way interactions among the TFs, the genomic sequence, and the epigenome, and thus allowing for predicting TF binding affinities in equilibrium states.</p>
<p>Genome-wide distributions of TF-binding and epigenomic modifications can now be obtained by high-throughput sequencing methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Metzker1">[4]</xref>. The explosive growth of data urges the methodological developments that can achieve mechanistic understanding of gene regulation. In particular, quantitative models are needed to learn the regulatory rules implemented by epigenomic modifications. Two classes of methods were developed to study transcriptional regulation with different goals and mathematical foundations. The first class of methods aims at deriving regulator-target relationships or finding regulatory sequences and motifs. These methods were built upon statistical associations among sequence patterns, TF binding, and gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Tanay1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Zhou1">[11]</xref>. An advantage of this class of methods is that it is easy to incorporate new data types including epigenomic modifications. Indeed, using statistical enrichment and machine learning ideas, recent efforts have incorporated nucleosome positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-He1">[12]</xref> and epigenomic modifications to identify TFBSs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-CuellarPartida1">[13]</xref> and regulatory genomic sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-He1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Heintzman1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Ernst2">[18]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s011">Table S1B</xref>). However, machine learning methods do not allow direct biophysical interpretation for their parameters, and therefore they do not make biological inferences as directly as the thermodynamic models (see below).</p>
<p>The second class of methods aims at deriving molecular mechanisms of TF-DNA interactions, using a thermodynamic framework (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Segal1">[19]</xref>). The intensity of TF-DNA binding was modeled as the equilibrium output of input sequences and TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Shea1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Buchler1">[21]</xref>. Partially due to a huge computational burden, this class of methods was originally restricted to analyze a few selected regulatory sequences in single-cell organisms, where a few simplified assumptions can be made <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Shea1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Gertz1">[22]</xref> (Model assumptions, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s011">Table S1A</xref>). These models were extended to analyze nucleosome positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-RavehSadka1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Mirny1">[24]</xref>, gene expression in <italic>drosophila</italic> embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Segal2">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Fakhouri1">[27]</xref>, and genome-wide TF binding data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-He2">[28]</xref>. The latter development offered a unique advantage, which is the capability of gaining mechanistic understanding of TF-TF interaction and TF-DNA binding from genome-wide binding data. However, this class of models cannot easily take into account epigenomic modifications, which are argued to be more influential to TF-DNA binding than cooperative interactions between TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Biggin1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Karlic1">[30]</xref>. Here we present a thermodynamic model that incorporates epigenomic modifications. This model can learn synergistic and antagonistic interactions between specific TFs and epigenomic modifications from genome-wide TF binding and epigenomic data.</p>
<p>We were interested in a few open questions on the mechanisms of TF-DNA binding. First, to what extent does an epigenetic modification change the binding strength between a TF and a genomic sequence, which is composed of multiple strong and weak binding sites? Second, is the epigenomic influence to TF-DNA binding invariant to the nucleotide composition of the genomic sequence? Third, many TFs have preferred DNA recognition codes (a.k.a. motifs); are there TF-specific epigenomic recognition codes? Fourth, does the epigenome modulate the variability (noise) of gene expression in an isogenic cell population? Finally, what is the role of the epigenome in modulating individual variation of TF-binding among humans?</p>
<p>We used two complementary experimental systems to study the above questions. The first system is mouse embryonic stem (mES) cells. We recently assayed genome-wide distributions of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC), 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC), histone variant H2A.Z, and acetylation of histone 3 lysine 27 (H3K27ac) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Yu1">[31]</xref>. We combined these data with published chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) datasets of 5 other epigenomic modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Mikkelsen1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Marks1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Meissner1">[33]</xref> and 9 TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Chen1">[34]</xref> from mES cells. This combined dataset allowed us to study TF-epigenome-DNA interactions relatively comprehensively. The second system is the white blood cells of seven people, which allowed us to explore individual differences in humans.</p>

<title>An epigenome-sensitive TF-DNA binding model</title>
<p>We developed a quantitative model for TF-DNA binding in a given epigenomic context. The goal of this model is to predict the binding intensity of a TF in any genomic region in any cell type, using the genomic sequence and the epigenomic modifications (cell-type-specific data). This model incorporates four types of biophysical information: the active concentrations of the TFs (learned from ChIP-seq data), the binding preferences of these TFs to DNA (motif), the nucleotide composition of the genomic sequence, and the epigenomic modifications (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Given input data including position-specific weight matrices (PSWM), ChIP-seq derived TF binding sequences and binding intensities, and genome-wide distribution of epigenomic modifications, this model can learn cooperativity among TFBSs (any number of strong and weak, homotypic and heterotypic TFBSs). More importantly, it can learn synergistic and antagonistic interactions between a specific TF and every assayed epigenomic modification. The learning process involves two steps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). First, the model scans each epigenomic mark independently to identify those that interact with the transcription factor of the interest and modulate its binding affinities to genomic sequences. Second, these identified epigenomic marks are combined into one unified model to predict the binding affinity of any genomic regions. The model quantifies the improvements of predicted binding affinities by using the identified epigenomic marks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s012">Table S2</xref>). Because this model operates at thermodynamic equilibrium, it does not make causal inferences about epigenetic and TF binding changes. We implemented this model into an open source program APEG (<underline>A</underline>ffinity <underline>P</underline>rediction by <underline>E</underline>pigenome and <underline>G</underline>enome, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://systemsbio.ucsd.edu/apeg" xlink:type="simple">http://systemsbio.ucsd.edu/apeg</ext-link>).</p>

<title>Modeling the epigenome and the genome as a physical system.</title>
<p>(A) The states of the system and their probabilities. As an example, a hypothetical genomic sequence is occupied by two epigenomic modifications (orange and gray shades), which partially overlap. The sequence contains three TFBSs for two TFs (A and B). The two TFBSs for A (red boxes) are each occupied by one epigenomic modification, and the TFBS for B (green box) is located in the overlapping region of the two modifications. The first TFBS for A (red box on the left) and the TFBS for B are close enough for their bound TFs to interact (arrows in States 5 and 8). Because each of the three TFBSs can reside in either the bound or the unbound state, the whole sequence can reside in a total of 2<sup>3</sup> physical states (listed in the State column). <italic>c</italic>: a physical state; <italic>W</italic>(<italic>c</italic>): Boltzmann weight for state <italic>c</italic>, which is proportional to the probability that the system visits this state; <italic>q<sup>epi</sup></italic>: the binding affinity between a transcription factor and the sequence under the epigenomic context. (B) The workflow for inferring epigenetic marks that influence the binding of a TF. Central to this workflow is our epigenome-sensitive TF-DNA binding model (the Epigenetic biophysical model). Inputs to this model are TF binding data (ChIP-seq), PSWM of the TF and epigenomic modification data (ChIP-seq, 5-hmC-seq, MeDIP-seq, and MRE-seq). Outputs of the model include the influences of epigenomic marks to the binding of each transcription factor and the cooperativities between TFBSs.</p>

<title>Genome-wide distributions of 5-methylcytosine, 5-hydroxymethylcytosine, H2A.Z, and H3K27ac in mES cells</title>
<p>We recently published two types of 5-methylcytosine (5-mC) data in E14 mES cells, using methylated DNA immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (MeDIP-seq) and DNA digestion by methyl-sensitive restriction enzymes followed by sequencing (MRE-seq) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Yu1">[31]</xref>, . A total of 45.2 million reads were generated from MeDIP-seq, reflecting 1,495,114 methylated 200 bp genomic segments (windows) across the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s016">Text S1</xref>). A total of 2.1 million MRE-seq reads were generated from a total of three restriction enzymes, covering 428,367 unmethylated windows. We used a selective chemical labeling method to pull down and sequence 5-hydroxymethylcytosine (5-hmC) regions (5-hmC-seq) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Yu1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Song1">[36]</xref>. A total of 58 million 5-hmC-seq sequence reads were generated, detecting 1.5 million 5-hmC marked windows in mES cells. We assayed the genomic distribution of histone variant H2A.Z and acetylation of Histone 3 Lysine 27 (H3K27ac) in E14 mES cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Yu1">[31]</xref>. With 19.9 million ChIP-seq reads, 1.1 million 200 bp windows were found to contain H2A.Z. It has a small overlap with promoter regions (10.45% of H2A.Z marked windows), suggesting its substantial involvement in distal regulatory regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Barski1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Talbert1">[39]</xref>. With a total of 19.8 million ChIP-seq reads, around 1.0 million 200 bp windows were marked by H3K27ac. It had a moderate overlap with promoter regions (16.66%), in line with the thought that it is primarily an enhancer mark <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Creyghton1">[40]</xref>. Interestingly, H2A.Z and H3K27ac exhibited differential overlaps with 5-hmC marked windows (25.69% and 31.57%) and 5-mC marked windows (17.69% and 12.98%), respectively. This suggests both H2A.Z and H3K27ac tend to overlap with 5-hmC more than with 5-mC (both p-values&lt;2.2e-16, Chi-square test). Combining these data with 6 published ChIP-seq datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Mikkelsen1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Marks1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Meissner1">[33]</xref>, we obtained genome-wide distributions of 9 epigenetic marks and 9 transcription factors in mES cells, which served as the dataset for our model-based analyses.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Identification of TF-specific epigenomic motifs</title>
<p>Even though some epigenomic modifications are assumed to take some general roles in synergizing or antagonizing TF-DNA binding, little is known whether such epigenomic functions are specific to certain TFs or are general to every TF. To explore this question, we applied our new model to genome-wide distribution data of 9 TFs and 9 types of epigenomic modifications in mES cells (assayed by ChIP-seq, MeDIP-seq, MRE-seq, and 5-hmC-seq). Thirty interactions between TFs and epigenomic modifications were identified, forming an interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s012">Table S2</xref>). Here, “interaction” refers to the positive or negative correlation of an epigenetic modification and the binding between a TF and DNA. Among the 9 epigenetic modifications, H3K4me3, H3K27ac, and 5-mC each interacts with a large number of TFs, forming hubs in the interaction network. Among the five epigenetic modifications that exhibited negative roles, only 5-mC represses the mES cell-specific regulators Oct4, Sox2, Nanog, and Stat3. Compared to the hubs, H3K4me1 is more specific. It plays a positive role to the binding of Nanog, Sox2 and Stat3. Even more specific are H2A.Z, 5-hmC, and H3K9me3, which may negatively correlate with the binding of cMyc and nMyc. These data suggest that not all epigenomic modifications “uniformly” interact with every TF. Some epigenetic modifications may be associated with the binding of specific TFs.</p>

In analogy to matrix presentation of DNA recognition motifs, we propose to use a column vector to represent the epigenomic motif of a TF.

<p>Considering TFs often have recognition preferences to certain short genomic sequences (motifs), we hypothesized that there are TF-specific epigenomic motifs. By an epigenomic motif we refer to a specific combination of epigenetic modifications that is characteristic to the in vivo binding sites of a TF. To test this hypothesis, we estimated the association of every epigenetic modification and the binding of each TF, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003367.e041">Equation (5)</xref>. For each TF, we compiled the influences of epigenetic modifications as a column vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These influences are not identical across TFs (columns of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This suggests that analogous to DNA motifs, in vivo TF-DNA binding also have epigenomic motifs. A PSWM is used to describe DNA motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Stormo1">[41]</xref>. We propose to use the vector of model-learned influences of the K epigenetic marks {<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, …, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>} to describe TF-specific epigenomic motifs, where A denotes the TF of our interest and K represents the total number of epigenetic marks.

<title>Epigenomic motif improves predictions of TF binding intensities</title>
<p>We hypothesized that the predictive power of TF binding intensities should be increased by incorporating the information of epigenomic motifs. In other words, if epigenomic motifs exist, they should help to better predict TF binding intensities than using DNA sequences alone. Three computational experiments were done to test this hypothesis. We chose the Nanog TF for these experiments, mostly because Nanog is an essential TF in ES cells and Nanog's DNA recognition motif is not well understood. In the first experiment, we removed the epigenomic data and fed our model with genomic sequences only. Without epigenomic data, our model degenerates into the STAP model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-He2">[28]</xref>. STAP uses the sequences (500 bp) and the TF-specific PSWM to predict TF binding affinities, taking into account all possible interactions among strong and weak TFBSs. To quantify the model's predictive power, we used the Pearson correlation between the ChIP-seq signals (as observed binding intensities) and the model-predicted binding intensities. Pearson correlations were 0.211 and 0.212 in the training and the testing datasets, respectively, providing a baseline predictive power (Control-1 in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We then applied the model to test each epigenomic modification. H3K4me1, H3K27ac and H3K4me3 largely increased the model's predictive power of Nanog binding intensities from the baseline (red bars, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These three epigenomic marks were thus inferred as interacting with Nanog. To test the robustness of model inference, we changed the metric for quantifying prediction power into Spearman's rank correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and varied window sizes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Neither of these changes affected the inferred interacting epigenomic marks.</p>

<title>Epigenomic marks improve model predictions of Nanog binding.</title>
<p>Model predicted binding intensities are correlated to ChIP-seq reported binding intensities (y axis: Pearson correlation). The model predictions are based on sequence data alone (Control-1), sequence data plus randomized epigenomic data (Control-2), or sequence data plus one epigenomic mark (other columns). Results on both training data (shaded bars) and testing data (hollow bars) are plotted. Epigenomic marks that significantly improve the predictions of Nanog binding (marked by *) are identified by using the standard deviations of the control experiments (error bars). Combined with the Nanog motif (PSWM) derived from <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments (red bars), several epigenomic marks can increase the accuracy of predicted binding intensities, achieving Pearson Correlations above 0.47 (H3K4me3 and H3K27ac, red bars). However, combined with the Nanog motif derived from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments (blue bars), no epigenetic mark except H3K27ac can improve the predictions of ChIP-seq measurements. Even for H3K27ac, the Pearson Correlation obtained from the <italic>in vitro</italic> motif (0.29) is much smaller than the Pearson correlation obtained from the <italic>in vivo</italic> motif (0.47). None of the four measured epigenomic marks in adipose cells help to better predict Nanog binding in stem cells (green bars), suggesting that cell-type-specific epigenetic data are required for increasing the prediction accuracy.</p>

<p>In the second experiment, we randomly shuffled the genomic positions of the observed epigenetic modification intensities, generating 200 permutated datasets. Feeding the permutated datasets to the model, we obtained a background distribution of predictive power (Control-2 in red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Using this background distribution, we identified three epigenetic modifications with which the model can significantly better predict TF binding intensities (red bars with * in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g003">Figure 3</xref>, permutation p-value = 0). These three epigenetic modifications were identified as interacting with Nanog. This permutation experiment used the same number of model parameters and the same amount of data (PSWM, sequence, and epigenetic data) as the experiment using the original data. It rules out the possibility that the increased predictive power was due to increased model complexities.</p>

<title>Epigenome alone is less predictive of TF binding than epigenome and genome combined</title>
<p>We asked to what extent the epigenome can predict TF binding without using the genomic sequences. Two control datasets were generated. First, each epigenomic mark was fed to our model without sequence data (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> becomes invariant to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003367.e036">Equation (4)</xref>, solid red bars, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The enhancer and open chromatin marks H3K4me1 and H3K27ac were most strongly predictive of Nanog binding, followed by the promoter mark H3K4me3. These data are consistent with the idea that open chromatin and hypersensitivity sites are predictive of transcription factor binding regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Ernst2">[18]</xref>. Interestingly, H2A.Z is the fourth epigenomic mark that is predictive of Nanog binding. The regulatory function of H2A.Z in mammalian cells remains controversial. While H2A.Z is generally thought as an active mark of transcription, it is negatively correlated with gene expression in a mES cell differentiation process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Xiao1">[43]</xref>. The positive association of H2A.Z with Nanog binding suggests that H2A.Z may facilitate Nanog binding in undifferentiated mES cells. Second, we collected all (214) PSWMs from the JASPAR database as background motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Bryne1">[44]</xref>. These background PSWMs were fed to the model with each epigenomic mark. The mean and standard deviation of the model predicted binding intensities from these background PSWMs were derived (hollow red bars and error bars, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The predictive powers of these control datasets were compared to the predictive powers using both epigenomic and PSWM information (blue bars, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The <italic>in vivo</italic> Nanog motif combined with epigenomic data (solid blue bars) increased the accuracy of predicted Nanog binding affinities than using epigenomic data alone (red bars). More than 20% increases of predictive power were observed using Nanog motif and H3K4me1 or H3K27ac than using H3K4me1 or H3K27ac alone. Even larger increases were found in comparing <italic>in vivo</italic> Nanog motif (solid blue bars) with background PSWMs (hollow red bars). The latter comparison used models with the same number of model parameters. It rules out the possibility that the increased predictive power was due to increased model complexities.</p>

<title>Epigenomic regulation of transcriptional noise</title>
<p>We asked how epigenomic modifications may theoretically modulate transcriptional noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Raj1">[48]</xref> and the cooperativity of TFBSs. To address this question, we used constraint-based simulation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Palsson1">[49]</xref>, with the constraints being the physical and empirical limits of TF concentrations and epigenomic states in eukaryotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s016">Text S1</xref>).</p>

We asked whether the epigenome can modulate the level of transcriptional noise. We studied simple transcription systems with one TFBS, by examining the change in binding probability as a function of the concentration of the TF and the presence of epigenomic marks. Following the main assumption of thermodynamic models of gene expression, every cell in an isogenic cell population has the same probability of producing a transcript, denoted as <italic>p</italic> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is defined in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003367.e024">Equation (1)</xref> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a constant).

<title>Epigenomic regulation of transcriptional noise.</title>
<p>Transcriptional noise is introduced when the binding probability (y axis) between a TF and its target TFBS falls into a particular range (horizontal yellow band). There is nearly no noise above or below this range, because almost all cells would uniformly have this target TFBS in the bound or the unbound state, respectively. The binding probabilities are constrained by the realistic range (vertical blue band) of TF concentrations in eukaryotic cells (x axis). (A) In the presence of a strong binding site (S), the binding probabilities are shown as functions of the TF concentration and the presence of epigenomic marks (Red curve: activation mark, green: no epigenomic marks, blue: repression mark). Activation marks suppress transcriptional noise by reducing the range of feasible binding probabilities, whereas repression marks enhance transcriptional noise. (B) In the presence of a weak binding site (W), both activation (red) and repression (blue) marks tend to suppress transcriptional noise.</p>

<p>In the presence of an activation mark, the sigmoid curve of binding probabilities shifted to the left (red curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>) with no overlap to the original curve. Similarly, in the presence of a repression mark, the curve shifted to the right (blue curve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g004">Figure 4A–B</xref>). The dynamic range of TF binding probabilities, constrained by the range of TF concentrations, is a major indicator of transcriptional noise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-RavehSadka1">[23]</xref>. These constraint-based simulations provided a theoretical prediction that in the presence of a strong binding site, an activation mark decreases the dynamic range of binding probabilities and thus suppresses transcriptional noise, whereas a repression mark enhances transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). However, in a transcriptional system with a single weak binding site, both activation and repression marks tend to suppress transcriptional noise (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).

<title>The epigenome may boost the cooperativity of weak binding sites</title>
<p>We asked whether the epigenome could modulate the cooperativity of adjacent TFBSs. To obtain a baseline (no cooperativity) for this analysis, in a simulation study, we fixed the TF concentration ( [A] in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003367.e036">Equation (4)</xref>) and compared the binding affinities between a strong TFBS and a weak TFBS in various epigenomic conditions. As expected, in the presence of an activation mark, the binding affinity increases as the intensity of this activation modification increases (solid curves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and the reverse is true in the presence of a repression mark (dashed curves, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Moreover, an increase of epigenomic intensity produces a smaller difference in the binding affinities of the two TFBSs (solid and dashed curves become closer as epigenomic intensity increases, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, the binding affinity of a weak TFBS cannot surpass the affinity of a strong TFBS in any levels of an epigenomic modification (neither the solid curves nor the dashed curves crossed, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). In other words, when there is no cooperativity between TFBSs, under the same epigenomic condition, the order of binding strengths among different genomic sequences is fixed. Because TF concentration ([A]) is a multiplicative factor that is separate from the rest in the calculation of the binding affinity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003367.e036">Equation (4)</xref>), changing TF concentration would not change the contributions from other factors to the binding affinity (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<title>Epigenomic boost of cooperativity of weak binding sites.</title>
<p>(A) The relationship between binding probability and epigenetic intensity. Given the transcription factor concentration, the binding probability (y axis) is shown as functions of the intensities (Epigenetic intensity, x axis) and types (solid: activation, dashed: repression) of epigenomic modifications and the strengths of the binding sites (red: strong, blue: weak). For a single binding site, the binding probability is monotonic to the strength of the binding site for all intensities of epigenomic modifications (red curves are always above blue curves). (B) Epigenomic boost of binding-site cooperativity. In the presence of an activation mark, the binding probabilities are monotonic for single strong (red), medium-strength (green), and weak (blue) binding sites. A pair of two weak binding sites has a smaller binding probability in the absence of the activation mark (dotted blue line at Epigenetic intensity = 10<sup>−2</sup>). While the intensity of the activation mark increases, the binding probability of this pair of weak sites gradually surpasses that of the medium-strength site and the strong binding site, breaking the monotonicity of single binding sites. (C) Activation mark H3K4me3 has larger average intensities in weak-TFBS regions (blue) than in strong-TFBS-containing regions (red). SD: standard deviation. (D) The difference of model-predicted binding probabilities with and without the epigenome (y axis) is larger in weak-TFBS-only regions (right column) than in the regions containing both strong and weak sites (mixed, middle column), which in turn is larger than in the strong-TFBS-only regions (left column). (E) H3K4me3 enables larger improvements of prediction accuracy on regions containing weak TFBSs. The predictions of binding for these regions were determined by applying three cutoffs on the predicted binding probability calculated from the model (Weak-cutoff (0.3), Medium-cutoff (0.35), Strong-cutoff (0.4)). The improvement of prediction accuracy was quantified by comparing the predictions by sequence and H3K4me3 to the predictions by sequence only (Y-axis). The improvement was defined as the difference of the proportions of correctly predicted binding regions between using and not using H3K4me3 data. Red, purple, and green bars represent the sequences that contain strong, weak, and mixed TFBSs as determined by PSWM matching scores. Error bars: standard deviations. The number of each type of sequences is in parenthesis.</p>

<p>Next, we examined the cooperativity of adjacent TFBSs with simulations. With nearly no epigenomic modifications, a simulated genomic sequence containing two weak TFBSs exhibited a binding affinity larger than that of another sequence containing one weak TFBS (dashed and solid blue curves at epigenomic intensity = 10<sup>−2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), but smaller than that of a medium-strength TFBS and a strong TFBS (green and red curves at epigenomic intensity = 10<sup>−2</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). As the intensity of an activation mark increased, the binding affinity of the two-weak-TFBS sequence first surpassed that of the medium-strength TFBS and later superseded the strong TFBS to become the sequence with the largest binding strength (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This suggests that in the presence of the epigenome, the binding affinities of different genomic sequences may not always be monotonic. Considering that without cooperativity, the binding affinities of different sequences are strictly monotonic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), these data suggest that epigenomic modifications are not only capable of increasing the binding affinity of each of the two weak TFBSs, but also can increase the cooperativity between the two TFBSs.</p>
<p>Finally, we examined whether the binding affinity of the two weak TFBSs could surpass that of the medium-strength TFBS within the range of typical intensities of epigenomic modifications measured by ChIP-seq experiments. The dashed curve and the green curve crossed at the epigenomic intensity of 10<sup>0.12</sup> ( = 1.32), corresponding to the enrichment ratio of e<sup>1.32</sup> ( = 3.74) between the number of sequence reads in the input and the control samples. Because the enrichment ratio of these two numbers is typically between 1 and 40 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Zhang1">[53]</xref>, the change of order of the binding affinities of these two simulated genomic sequences can happen in typical epigenomic conditions.</p>

The average H3K4me3 intensity on weak-TFBSs was larger than 150% of that on strong-TFBSs (p-value&lt;10<sup>−20</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). The largest difference of H3K4me3 intensities between the two sets appeared at the center of Oct4 binding regions (Position = 0, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). This suggests that on Oct4 binding regions throughout the genome, H3K4me3 is more concentrated on those containing only weak sequence motifs. We ruled out promoters as a confounding factor to the association of strong H3K4me3 to weak TFBSs, because weak TFBSs do not preferentially locate in promoters (Chi-square test p-value = 0.907, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s013">Table S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s016">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>We then asked if these weak-TFBS-only sequences could obtain a larger boost of binding affinity than the other sequences. Our simulation analysis suggested this was the case in theory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). We now test it with the measured epigenomic and TF binding intensities in mES cells. We classified the ChIP-seq peaks into three sets, those only containing strong TFBSs, those containing both strong and weak TFBSs (mixed), and those only containing weak TFBSs. We computed the change in Oct4 binding affinities on these sequence sets from not using H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data to using H3K4me3 ChIP-seq data. The weak-TFBS-only set exhibited a larger increase in binding affinities than the mixed set, which in turn had a larger increase than the strong-TFBS-only set (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figures 5D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s005">S5</xref>). These data suggest that the endogenous levels of H3K4me3 in mES cells are sufficient to boost the binding affinity of adjacent weak TFBSs.</p>
<p>Finally, had epigenomic boost of weak TFBSs happened in vivo, the model would be able to better reproduce <italic>in vivo</italic> binding intensities on weak TFBSs. To test this idea, we used DNA sequence and H3K4me3 to predict Oct4 binding regions and compared with ChIP-seq data. We quantified the improvements of the prediction accuracy between with and without considering H3K4me3 data. Applying the model with a stringent threshold on the predicted binding probability, the three sequence groups that harbor strong, mixed, and weak sites showed similar improvements on prediction accuracy (strong-cutoff, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). This indicates H3K4me3 helps to improve prediction, but does not specifically show it helps prediction on weak sites. Under two less stringent thresholds of the predicted binding probabilities, the model gained larger increases of prediction accuracy on weak sites and on mixed sites than on strong sites (Medium-cutoff, Weak-cutoff, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). These results are consistent with the idea that the model was able to predict the binding intensities more accurately by capturing the epigenomic boost of weak TFBSs. Besides H3K4me3 and Oct4, several other epigenomic marks showed systematically stronger intensities near the weak TFBSs than near the strong TFBSs of other TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s014">Table S4</xref>). Thus, epigenomic boost of the binding affinity of adjacent weak TFBSs is not only a theoretical possibility, but also can be a wide-spread regulatory mechanism.</p>

<title>H3K9ac and H3K4me2 may dampen the variation of TF binding across human individuals</title>
<p>Genomic variations including single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) can result in phenotypic variation. Still unknown is how epigenomes modulate the correlation of genotypes and phenotypes among humans. We chose TF binding intensities as a molecular phenotype to study this question.</p>
<p>To study how epigenetic variation can interact with genomic variation, we did three between-individual comparisons across different ethnic groups. We first compared a European (NIGMS catalog ID: GM12878) and a Nigerian (GM18505). We categorized NFκB binding regions with the TFBSs containing SNPs into two sets (all analyses were done with homozygous SNPs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s016">Text S1</xref>). The first set had differences in NFκB binding intensities between these two individuals. This set was called <underline>D</underline>ifferent <underline>S</underline>equence <underline>D</underline>ifferent <underline>B</underline>inding (DSDB) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s006">Figure S6A</xref>). The second SNP-containing set had similar NFκB binding levels in the two individuals, and were termed the <underline>D</underline>ifferent <underline>S</underline>equence <underline>N</underline>o <underline>D</underline>ifference in <underline>B</underline>inding (DSNDB) set. The first set (DSDB) was consistent with the theory that nucleotide changes in the TFBS should change the binding affinity of this TFBS; however, the second set (DSNDB) appeared to be inconsistent with such a theory. We hypothesized that the epigenetic marks on DSNDB stabilized the binding affinities of these binding sites. In other words, the epigenetic modifications on the TFBSs buffered sequence changes (SNPs) from changing binding intensities.</p>
<p>Theoretically, the difference in binding affinities between two TFBSs is the largest without any epigenetic marks (y-intercept, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). When epigenetic modification intensities increase, the binding difference in the two TFBSs decreases (from left to right, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This is true for any two TFBSs of the same TF. Thus, we have derived a theoretical mechanism for the epigenome to attenuate the TF binding differences on SNP-containing TFBSs in two individuals.</p>
<p>We proceeded to examine whether the theoretical mechanism is relevant for transcription factor binding in humans. We first used our model to learn epigenetic marks that help to explain the binding intensities in all SNP-containing TFBSs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s015">Table S5</xref>). Four epigenetic marks were identified by the model, which were H3K4me1/2, H3K9ac, and H3K27ac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Among them, H3K4me2 and H3K9ac were identified as marks that better explain the binding intensities in DSNDB sites. If H3K4me2 and H3K9ac were used to attenuate binding differences between two people, there should be higher intensities of H3K4me2 and H3K9ac in DSNDB sites than in DSDB sites. Indeed, the intensities of H3K4me2 and H3K9ac were much higher in DSNDB sites than in DSDB sites (p-values&lt;10<sup>−20</sup>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g006">Figure 6</xref>). To assess whether these results were specific to the chosen individuals in our analysis, we did two more comparisons. The second comparison was between a European (GM12878) and a Nigerian (GM19099), and the third comparison was between a European descendant (GM12878) and a Japanese (GM18951). Each comparison identified its own DSDB and DSNDB sites. However, all comparisons found significantly higher H3K4me2 and H3K9ac intensities in DSNDB sites than in DSDB sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s008">Figure S8</xref>). The NFκB binding intensities in DSDB and DSNDB of GM12878 had similar distributions, and therefore are unlikely to contribute to explain the differences of H3K4me2 and H3K9ac intensities in GM12878 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s006">Figure S6B</xref>–C). As a control, adding H3K36me3 data to the model did not increase the correlation of model predicted binding intensities to NFκB ChIP-seq data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Accordingly, the difference in H3K36me3 levels between DSDB and DSNDB sets was not clear and not consistent in these comparisons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Finally, we assessed whether inter-individual differences of PSWM matching scores were significantly different in DSDB and DSNDB regions. No significant differences were found in two pairs of individuals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s009">Figure S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003367.s010">S10</xref>), ruling out the possibility that sequence-determined differences in binding energies were more pronounced in either of the two sequence sets. These data suggested a mechanistic explanation to the SNPs in TFBSs that do not produce between-individual differences in TF binding: epigenetic modifications on these TFBSs attenuated the binding differences. We note that not all factors relevant to gene regulation have been considered in this analysis. Other factors including DNase sensitivity and the binding of other TFs could play a role in buffering polymorphism in NFkB binding sites and therefore potential provide alternative explanations.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The overarching tenet of this work is obtaining mechanistic insights from high-throughput genomic data. Towards this goal, we forfeited commonly used “statistical enrichment” methods that look for large overlaps of two or more genomic features. Instead, we developed a biophysical model for the three-way interactions among the genomic sequence, the epigenetic modifications, and TF binding. The model is specified as a physical system, and every model parameter has a biophysical interpretation. This allows the analytical results obtained from this model to have mechanistic interpretations.</p>
<p>Several epigenetic modifications were previously assumed to facilitate or hinder TF binding in a ubiquitous manner. For example, mono-, di-, and tri- methylations on histone lysine 4 (H3K4me1/2/3) were thought to facilitate the binding of any TF. Our data suggested that some TFs tend to preferentially recognize TF-specific epigenomic codes. This implies that rather than ubiquitously synergize or antagonizing TF-DNA binding, some epigenetic marks can specifically interact with some TFs. This is conceivable because the maintenance of epigenetic marks often require histone or DNA modification enzymes to be brought to a genomic sequence by specific transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Lienert1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Zhang2">[57]</xref>. In addition, epigenetic modifications are strongly associated with the three-dimensional (3D) architectures of the local chromatin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Noordermeer1">[58]</xref>. It is also conceivable that some TFs would have different binding preferences to the same DNA sequence but different 3D chromatin conformations. We showed that epigenetic modifications can boost the cooperativity of adjacent weak TFBSs. Thus, there is a functional advantage of coding a cis-regulatory sequence with a cluster of weak TFBSs rather than one strong binding site. The advantage is that the binding affinity of a cluster of weak TFBSs has a larger tunable range than a strong TFBS, in the presence of the epigenome. Thus, clusters of weak TFBSs offer the epigenome larger ‘controllability’. This may explain why weak TFBSs tend to cluster in the mammalian genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Zhang3">[59]</xref>. Consistently, we estimated that there were 2.3–4.6 weak Oct4 sites per ChIP-seq derived Oct4 binding region. Indeed, H3K4me3 was strongly enriched in Oct4 binding regions that only contained weak TFBSs. Moreover, H3K4me3 generated larger enhancements of binding affinities in the weak-TFBS-only binding regions than in other Oct4 binding regions. Thus, the ‘epigenomic boost’ of TFBS cooperativity can be a functional mechanism in mammalian cells. This provides an alternative view on the evolutionary origin of TFBS clusters, in which the presence of the epigenome was previously ignored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-He3">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>A central question in personalized medicine is how genomic variation generates phenotypic variation. This is a challenging question because genomic variation was only partially correlated with TF-binding variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Kasowski1">[61]</xref>. In particular, a set of SNPs in TFBSs does not introduce differences to TF binding as predicted by available TF-DNA binding models. Incorporating the epigenome into the TF-DNA binding model, we can now appreciate that some epigenetic marks can buffer genomic changes from generating changes in TF binding intensities. A case in point is that H3K4me2 and H3K9ac attenuate the personal variation of NFκB binding on SNP-containing binding sites in human lymphocytes. These results highlight the importance of considering the epigenome when analyzing the functional consequences of genomic variations.</p>
<p>A limitation of the thermodynamic equilibrium model is that it does not make causal inferences. It does not differentiate whether an epigenomic motif promotes the binding of a TF, or the binding of a TF causes the buildup of an epigenomic motif. It is conceivable that TF binding and epigenomic motif can reinforce each other, in a sequence-dependent or sequence-independent manner. Recent cross-species comparisons reported larger evolutionary changes of TF binding regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Kunarso1">[62]</xref> than epigenetically modified regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Xiao1">[43]</xref>. If we assume during evolution we should see larger changes in the effects than in the causes, then these data are compatible to the hypothesis that epigenetic factors could modulate the binding of specific TFs. Moreover, the model-identified epigenomic mark that have strong interaction with Oct4 binding is H3K4me3, whose intensity is much larger in the Oct4 binding regions that contain only weak TFBSs than in the binding regions that contain strong TFBSs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). If Oct4 binding had been the cause of H3K4 tri-methylation, we would expect H3K4me3 to be stronger on the regions containing strong Oct4 sites. Thus, at least in the case of Oct4 and H3K4me3 interaction, the data disfavor TF binding as the cause of this interaction.</p>

<title>Model assumptions</title>
<p>First, a DNA sequence is associated with a physical state, which is defined by the combination of transcription factors bound to the sequence. When we consider one piece of genomic sequence a time, the physical state of a sequence can be regarded as the physical state of a cell. Second, TF-DNA binding has reached thermodynamic equilibrium, which implies the proportion of cells at each physical state does not change over time. Third, the binding affinity between a TF to any genomic location is a joint effect of multiple TFBSs in the “neighborhood” of this genomic location. Each TFBS has its own binding strength, and they may cooperate. Finally, the intensity of an epigenomic modification in this genomic neighborhood can influence TF binding.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4b">
<title>Model formulation</title>
<p>We model a genomic sequence (S) in a fixed epigenomic context as a physical system. Every TFBS in S can exist in one of the two physical states, occupied or not occupied by a TF. Thus, a sequence containing n TFBSs can exist in any of the total of 2<sup>n</sup> states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g001">Figure 1A</xref> shows the 2<sup>3</sup> states for a sequence containing 3 TFBSs). We use c to denote a state, and let C to denote all states. There is certain probability associated with every state of the system, denoted as P(c). Such a probabilistic distribution is called a Boltzmann distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-Buchler1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>From the perspective of a particular TF (named A), the event that A is bound to sequence S is equivalent to the union of some of states of S. In the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003367-g001">Figure 1</xref>, the event ‘A is bound’ is the union of States 2, 4, 5, 6, 7, and 8. We call these states the <italic>occupied states</italic> (<italic>O</italic>). Obviously, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The probability that A is bound to S is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We introduce the Boltzmann weight, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for every state <italic>c</italic>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the way that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Two factors contribute to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The first factor is the binding affinity between the TF (A) and every TFBS, which is jointly determined by the TFBS and the epigenomic context.

<title>Making inferences with the model</title>
<p>This model has two major applications. One is to predict the binding intensities of a TF throughout the genome in any cell type.

A third and relatively minor application is to learn the cooperativity between TFBSs in different epigenomic contexts.

<p>The model has two sets of models parameters, which are the cooperativity between TFBSs (<italic>ω<sub>A,B</sub></italic>) and the influence of each epigenomic modification (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). To train these model parameters, four inputs are required. These include the genome sequence, the PSWM of the TF, the epigenomic data (ChIP-seq and other forms), and the ChIP-seq data of the TF of interest. Let <italic>I</italic>(<italic>A</italic>) be the genome-wide distribution of binding intensities of transcription factor A. For example, if we segregate the human genome into 6 million 500 bp long windows, then <italic>I</italic>(<italic>A</italic>) is a vector of 6 million elements. Each element represents the ChIP-seq measured binding intensity in the corresponding window. Following previous notations, we use <italic>P<sub>A</sub></italic>(<italic>O</italic>) in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003367.e024">equation (1)</xref> to denote the model predicted binding probability of A in every window. We propose to learn the model parameters by maximizing the following target function<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003367.e051"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e051" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>corr</italic>(.) is the Pearson Correlation, and <italic>P<sub>A</sub></italic>(<italic>O</italic>) is a function of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>ω<sub>A,B</sub></italic>.</p>

<p>We implemented a maximization strategy to maximize <italic>f</italic>(<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>ω<sub>A,B</sub></italic>). The analytical form of <italic>P</italic>(<italic>A</italic>) can be explicitly expressed with a dynamic programming algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003367-He2">[28]</xref>.

We start with random initial parameters and repeat it 500 times to avoid local minima. In applications where the cooperativity among TFBSs is not of interest, we propose to ignore the cooperativity term (set <italic>ω<sub>A,B</sub></italic> = 1) and only maximize with respect to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003367.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
