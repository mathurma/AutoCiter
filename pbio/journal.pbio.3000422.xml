<abstract>
<p>Histone H3 and its variants regulate gene expression but the latter are absent in most ascomycetous fungi. Here, we report the identification of a variant histone H3, which we have designated H3V<sup>CTG</sup> because of its exclusive presence in the CTG clade of ascomycetes, including <italic>Candida albicans</italic>, a human pathogen. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> grows both as single yeast cells and hyphal filaments in the planktonic mode of growth. It also forms a three-dimensional biofilm structure in the host as well as on human catheter materials under suitable conditions. H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null (<italic>hht1/hht1</italic>) cells of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> are viable but produce more robust biofilms than wild-type cells in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Indeed, a comparative transcriptome analysis of planktonic and biofilm cells reveals that the biofilm circuitry is significantly altered in H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null cells. H3V<sup>CTG</sup> binds more efficiently to the promoters of many biofilm-related genes in the planktonic cells than during biofilm growth, whereas the binding of the core canonical histone H3 on the corresponding promoters largely remains unchanged. Furthermore, biofilm defects associated with master regulators, namely, biofilm and cell wall regulator 1 (Bcr1), transposon enhancement control 1 (Tec1), and non-dityrosine 80 (Ndt80), are significantly rescued in cells lacking H3V<sup>CTG</sup>. The occupancy of the transcription factor Bcr1 at its cognate promoter binding sites was found to be enhanced in the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> in the planktonic form of growth resulting in enhanced transcription of biofilm-specific genes. Further, we demonstrate that co-occurrence of valine and serine at the 31st and 32nd positions in H3V<sup>CTG</sup>, respectively, is essential for its function. Taken together, we show that even in a unicellular organism, differential gene expression patterns are modulated by the relative occupancy of the specific histone H3 type at the chromatin level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Histones are highly conserved proteins across eukaryotes. Variant histones, which are nonallelic isoforms of the canonical histones, may exist and differ from their canonical counterparts in the primary amino acid sequence and expression timing during cell cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref003">3</xref>]. These histone variants show sequence divergence that ranges from a stretch of a few amino acids to a large domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref005">5</xref>]. Genes encoding canonical histones are usually organized in tandem multicopy clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref006">6</xref>], whereas noncanonical histone variants are encoded by genes that are scattered throughout the genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref007">7</xref>]. Incorporation of histone variants at specific genomic loci is associated with cellular processes, including DNA replication, transcription, recombination and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref010">10</xref>]. Several lines of evidence suggest that histone variants and their covalent post-translational modifications (PTMs) play a key role in developmental processes such as the initiation and maintenance of pericentric heterochromatin, X chromosome inactivation, and germ cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref011">11</xref>]. Therefore, histone variants are involved in indexing the eukaryotic genome into many epigenomes. Multiple histone H3 variants are known to exist in animals, plants, and protists [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref012">12</xref>]. Noncanonical histone H3 variants are also known to be present in the fungal phyla of Basidiomycota and Zoopagomycota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref013">13</xref>]. However, it was long thought that only the canonical histone H3 is present in Ascomycota [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref014">14</xref>], a fungal phylum that includes budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and fission yeast <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref015">15</xref>]. Moreover, instead of histone H3 variant, a histone H4 variant (hH4v) is present in <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> with unknown function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref016">16</xref>].</p>
<p>Although unicellular, many yeast species are polymorphic in nature. A group of ascomycetes including <italic>Candida albicans</italic> in which CUG often codes for serine instead of leucine belong to the CTG clade. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is primarily a commensal in the oral cavity, digestive tract, and genital regions of a healthy individual [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref017">17</xref>] and yet is responsible for superficial or disseminated, often deadly infections. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> undergoes high-frequency phenotypic transitions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref018">18</xref>], among which a reversible switch from a single-celled oval yeast form to a filamentous hyphal form is thought to be required for its pathogenic lifestyle and is shown to be tightly linked with its virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref019">19</xref>]. These morphological switching events are associated with global changes in transcriptional profiles that usually occur over a short time span in response to cues from the host niche.</p>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, like many other microbes, has the ability to form surface-associated, matrix-embedded communities called biofilms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref020">20</xref>]. Biofilms can form both in vitro on abiotic surfaces and in vivo on biotic surfaces such as the oral and vaginal mucosa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref022">22</xref>]. Because biofilms are associated with a protective extracellular matrix, the cells in biofilms are more resistant to conventional antifungal drugs and host immune factors in comparison with the free-floating planktonic cells. Further, cross contamination through medical devices via biofilm is a major source of infection in hospitals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref024">24</xref>]. Under most conditions, both yeast and filamentous hyphal cells of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> are essential for proper biofilm formation. The hyphal cells provide a support scaffold required for the architectural stability of the biofilm structure formed by specific arrangements of yeast and hyphal cells. Thus, the ability of a cell to form hyphae is critical for proper biofilm growth and maintenance.</p>
<p>During biofilm development, cells attach to a surface and grow as a microcolony that develops into a complex three-dimensional structure held together by an extracellular matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref025">25</xref>]. During biofilm growth, many adhesins, which carry a C-terminal sequence for covalent attachment of a glycosylphosphophatidylinositol (GPI) anchor, are up-regulated compared with their expression in planktonic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref027">27</xref>]. Some of these adhesins are Enhanced Adherence to Polystyrene 1 (Eap1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref028">28</xref>], Hyphal Wall Protein 1 (Hwp1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref029">29</xref>], Repressed By <italic>TUP1</italic> (Rbt1), and members of the Agglutinin-Like Sequence (Als) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref032">32</xref>]. In addition, a transcriptional network of 6 master regulators (Efg1, Tec1, Bcr1, Ndt80, Rob1, and Brg1) and approximately 1,000 target genes of these transcription factors regulate biofilm development in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> both in vitro and in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref033">33</xref>].

<p>In this work, we analyzed a large number of fungal genomes, and we discovered the existence of a novel variant histone H3 that is unique to the CTG clade including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. We present the molecular basis of morphological switching events at the chromatin level modulated by the canonical and variant histone H3 proteins in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.

These changes are found to be conserved in the variant histone H3 of most CTG-clade species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Moreover, variations in the nucleotide sequences of <italic>HHT1</italic>, <italic>HHT2</italic>, and <italic>HHT21</italic> were inspected using genome sequence data available for 182 <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> isolates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref035">35</xref>]. Only 2 synonymous SNPs were identified in <italic>HHT1</italic>, indicating that the amino acid sequence of Hht1 protein is invariant across the 182 tested <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> strains.

Notably, these variations do not occur at the 3 positions where Hht1 differs from Hht2 or Hht21 in the primary amino acid sequence. The presence of serine (S) and threonine (T) at position 31 and 80, respectively, in the canonical histone H3 (<italic>HHT2</italic> and <italic>HHT21</italic>) is similar to that of the mammalian histone H3.3.

Among those with an altered expression, 164 genes were common to both planktonic and Spider biofilm transcriptome data sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Subsequently, we compared the altered gene-sets in the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutants grown either in the planktonic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s004">S4C and S4E Fig</xref>) or biofilm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s004">S4D and S4F Fig</xref>) condition with genes known to be expressed differentially in planktonic and biofilm modes of growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref033">33</xref>] and represented in the form of a heat map and Venn diagram.

<title>Loss of variant histone H3 induces biofilm gene circuitry during planktonic growth in vitro</title>
<p>Analysis of the transcriptome data revealed that gene expression profiles previously linked to biofilm formation were enhanced in the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutants compared with the wild type both in planktonic and biofilm conditions. Altered expression of a subset of critical biofilm-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g003">Fig 3A</xref>) was verified by quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>YWP1</italic>, a biofilm-repressed gene, was down-regulated in H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutants. Thus, the microarray data together with qPCR analysis established that H3V<sup>CTG</sup> contributes to the maintenance of the planktonic growth by repressing the biofilm growth promoting gene circuitry when cells are grown in planktonic conditions. This finding led us to investigate the biofilm-forming ability of the null mutant of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> compared with the wild type. To test this, wild-type SC5314 (<italic>HHT1/HHT1</italic>), H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutants LR107 and LR108 (<italic>hht1/hht1</italic>), and the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strain LR109 (<italic>hht1</italic>/<italic>hht1</italic>::<italic>HHT1</italic>) were allowed to form biofilm in 6-well polystyrene plates in the Spider medium at 37 °C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g003">Fig 3C</xref>, upper panel). A significant enhancement in biofilm growth of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutants compared with the wild-type and H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strains was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Together the results obtained thus far suggest that the gene circuit for biofilm development is activated in the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutants even when these cells are grown in planktonic conditions. To verify this possibility, we performed the biofilm assay at 30 °C in YPDU medium on silicone squares; biofilm formation was found to be enhanced in H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutants compared with the wild-type or the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g003">Fig 3C</xref> lower panel and 3E), confirming that deletion of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> promotes biofilm formation in YPDU medium at 30 °C.</p>

<p>(A) A heat map was generated for biofilm-related genes with altered levels of expression in the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutants compared with wild type. Yellow color represents up-regulation, whereas blue color represents down-regulation. Affected genes are arranged according to the step of biofilm development they are involved in. The arrowhead indicates the direction of maturation of biofilm.

<title>Absence of variant histone H3 enhances in vivo biofilm growth as well</title>
<p>Because of the presence of many uncharacterized host factors, in vivo biofilms may substantially differ from those formed in vitro. To examine whether absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> enhanced biofilm formation in vivo, a well-established rat venous catheter model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref043">43</xref>] was used. We inoculated catheters intraluminally with wild type (SC5314), H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutants LR107 and LR108 (<italic>hht1/hht1</italic>), or H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strain LR109 (<italic>hht1</italic>/<italic>hht1</italic>::<italic>HHT1</italic>) of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.

<title>Variant histone H3 acts as a molecular switch that favors planktonic growth over biofilm growth</title>
<p>Enhancement of both in vitro and in vivo biofilm formation in the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutant compared with the wild type motivated us to investigate the mechanism by which H3V<sup>CTG</sup> negatively regulates biofilm growth in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. To understand this mechanism at the molecular level, the V5 epitope was used to tag either the variant histone H3 (H3V<sup>CTG</sup>) or the canonical histone H3 (encoded by <italic>HHT21</italic> as described above). Based on the complementation assay, the V5-tagged H3V<sup>CTG</sup> (LR145 and LR146) was proved to be functional when expressed as the only copy in the cell (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Chromatin immunoprecipitation–quantitative PCR (ChIP-qPCR) analysis was performed either in the planktonic or biofilm growth conditions to determine the binding of both canonical and variant histone H3 to the promoters of a set of biofilm-induced and biofilm-repressed genes. The promoter of <italic>ORF19</italic>.<italic>874</italic>, which was unaltered in the genome-wide study above as well as in the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref033">33</xref>] during the planktonic to biofilm growth transition, was used to normalize the binding efficiency of histone H3 molecules in all ChIP-qPCR studies. The untagged parent strain (SN148) was used as a control to calculate the background enrichment. The promoters of biofilm-induced genes (<italic>BMT7</italic>, <italic>CAN1</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>HWP1</italic>, <italic>HGT2</italic>, <italic>JEN2</italic>, and <italic>SAP5</italic>), biofilm-repressed genes (<italic>NRG1</italic> and <italic>YWP1</italic>), and also of an uncharacterized gene (<italic>ORF19</italic>.<italic>7380</italic>), to which 5 of the 6 biofilm master regulators bind, were examined to study the occupancy of either canonical (Hht21-V5) or variant histone H3 (H3V<sup>CTG</sup>-V5). The occupancy of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> was significantly higher at the promoters of biofilm-related genes compared with that of the canonical histone H3 when the cells were grown in the planktonic mode of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s012">S1I Data</xref>). Therefore, we posit that a higher occupancy of the variant histone H3 at the promoters of biofilm genes may prevent access of gene expression modulators (transcription activators or repressors) required for induction of the biofilm gene circuitry under planktonic growth conditions. Further, the occupancy of the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> was compared in both planktonic and biofilm growth conditions. A significant drop in the binding of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> to the promoters of biofilm genes was observed during the transition from planktonic to biofilm growth, except at <italic>SAP5</italic> and <italic>NRG1</italic> promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). We also examined the occupancy of variant histone H3 to the gene body of biofilm-related genes in cells grown in planktonic and biofilm conditions. Similar to the promoter regions, we also observed a drop in the level of variant histone H3 in biofilm condition compared with the planktonic condition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). Further, we did not observe a similar trend of changes in the occupancy of canonical H3 to the promoters of biofilm genes between planktonic and biofilm conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These analyses reveal that the binding of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> to the promoter of each of the biofilm genes was more efficient in the planktonic than in the biofilm condition. Micrococcal nuclease (MNase) digestion was performed to determine the occupancy of these 2 histone H3 on the <italic>BMT7</italic> gene. Both total DNA MNase digestion and ChIP results show that both histone H3 can occupy the same regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). This also suggests the possibility of formation of heterotypic nucleosomes, which will be addressed in future studies. Moreover, we examined the total pool of histone H3 molecules bound to the promoters of biofilm genes in both planktonic and biofilm growth by ChIP assays using antihistone H3 antibodies. Our results show a drop in the binding of total histone H3 to the promoters of <italic>BMT7</italic>, <italic>CAN1</italic>, <italic>ECE1</italic>, <italic>HGT12</italic>, <italic>JEN1</italic>, <italic>SAP5</italic>, and <italic>NRG1</italic> in biofilm conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). To assess the occupancy of one of the biofilm master regulators, namely, Bcr1, to the promoters of biofilm-related genes, we performed ChIP-qPCR analysis in the wild-type or the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutant expressing Bcr1-myc. Binding of Bcr1-myc was analyzed on promoters of a set of genes that showed an altered (up-regulation or down- regulation) expression in the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutant by ChIP-qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The results of this analysis indeed confirmed that absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> enhances the binding of the biofilm master regulator Bcr1 to the promoters of these genes in the planktonic conditions. These results were in accordance with the gene expression profile further strengthening the fact that H3V<sup>CTG</sup> indeed plays a major role in repressing the biofilm promoting gene network during planktonic growth in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. Taken together with all the results presented so far, we propose a general model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g004">Fig 4F</xref>) that suggests H3V<sup>CTG</sup> is involved in modulating chromatin in a way that limits access of biofilm gene-specific transcription factors to the promoters of biofilm-related genes.</p>

(F) A proposed model to depict the role of the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> in creating repressive chromatin for the biofilm genes. In this model, during planktonic growth, H3V<sup>CTG</sup> is more efficiently bound to the promoters of biofilm genes compared with the canonical H3 (Hht21-V5), although they can form heterotypic nucleosomes. Possibly H3V<sup>CTG</sup> restricts binding of biofilm regulators to the promoters of target genes in the planktonic state, resulting in a tight regulation of their expression when cells grow in planktonic conditions. However, in the biofilm state, when nucleosomes containing the variant histone H3 are reduced, or in the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup>, an open chromatin structure is established that allows a more efficient access of biofilm regulators to the promoters of these genes. This causes either up-regulation of biofilm-induced genes (by transcription inducers) or down-regulation (by transcription repressors) of biofilm-repressed genes.

<title>Loss of variant histone H3 rescues biofilm-forming defects of mutants lacking master biofilm regulators</title>
<p>Previously, it has been shown that the overexpression of <italic>ALS3</italic> in the <italic>bcr1/bcr1</italic> mutant rescues the defects in biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref044">44</xref>].

Deletion of each of the 6 master regulators, namely, <italic>BCR1</italic>, <italic>BRG1</italic>, <italic>EFG1</italic>, <italic>NDT80</italic>, <italic>ROB1</italic>, and <italic>TEC1</italic>, has been shown to severely hamper biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref033">33</xref>]. To test whether the deletion of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> can rescue biofilm defects associated with the absence of biofilm master regulators, we deleted both copies of <italic>HHT1</italic> (H3V<sup>CTG</sup>) in each of the following mutant strains—<italic>bcr1/bcr1</italic>, <italic>brg1/brg1</italic>, <italic>efg1/efg1</italic>, <italic>ndt80/ndt80</italic>, <italic>rob1/rob1</italic>, and <italic>tec1/tec1</italic>—and examined the biofilm-forming ability of these double mutants by growing biofilms in YPD medium.

These results strongly suggest that variant histone H3 is a major regulator of biofilm formation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.

The double-mutant strain <italic>tec1/tec1 hht1/hht1</italic> formed enhanced biofilms compared with those formed by the <italic>tec1/tec1</italic> single mutant in both in vitro and in vivo conditions. Our results thus confirm that in the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup>, biofilm defects in the <italic>tec1/tec1</italic> mutant can be rescued both in vitro and in vivo.

<p>We were also interested to know the contribution of each of the 3 amino acids residues that are different between variant and canonical histone H3. To understand this, we generated single-point mutant strains of Hht1 at each of the positions 31, 32, and 80 similar to that of the canonical histone H3 sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). In addition, we were curious to know whether the enhancement in biofilm formation was specifically associated with the loss of the variant histone H3 or if it could be due to the loss of overall histone H3 levels in the cell. We examined the extent of biofilm formation in the null mutant of <italic>HHT21</italic> as well and did not observe any increase in biofilm formation. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). This confirms that the enhancement of biofilm growth is specifically associated with the loss of H3V<sup>CTG</sup>. In addition, we did not observe any significant differences in biofilm formation between wild-type and point-mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>). We also generated a double mutant at positions 31 and 32 of Hht1 to change the amino acid residues similar to those of the canonical histone H3 at the corresponding positions. The double mutant yielded a phenotype similar to that of the null mutants of variant histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6B and 6D</xref>). This suggests that co-occurrence of amino acid residues at positions 31 and 32 is essential for variant histone H3 function as a biofilm repressor during planktonic growth. This further confirms that the phenotype observed in null mutants of variant histone H3 is specifically associated with variant histone H3 and not due to the global levels of histone H3.</p>

<title>Variant histone H3 null mutant is hyperfilamentous</title>
<p>To test whether variant histone H3 has an effect on filamentation, we performed filamentation assays with wild-type SC5314 (<italic>HHT1/HHT1</italic>), H3V<sup>CTG</sup> (<italic>hht1/hht1</italic>) mutants LR107 and LR108, and the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strain LR109 (<italic>hht1</italic>/<italic>hht1</italic>::<italic>HHT1</italic>) on solid media. Colony wrinkling was enhanced in the mutant strains (<italic>hht1/hht1</italic>) compared with the wild-type (<italic>HHT1</italic>/<italic>HHT1</italic>) and the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strain LR109 (<italic>hht1</italic>/<italic>hht1</italic>::<italic>HHT1</italic>) at both 30 °C and 37 °C (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). This hyperfilamentation phenotype was specific to H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutants because null mutants of neither canonical histone H3 genes produced this phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). We also examined the extent of filamentation in the point-mutant strains. Our results confirm that the double mutant at positions 31 and 32 yields a phenotype similar to that of the null mutant of variant histone H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). The extent of filamentation was also found to be enhanced at the level of colonies derived from a single cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000422.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). Further, to test whether the increase in filamentation observed during growth on solid media can be found in liquid culture, hyphal growth was triggered in YPD containing fetal bovine serum at 37 °C. We did not observe any significant differences in the filamentation patterns between the wild type, the <italic>hht1/hht1</italic> mutant strains, the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strain LR109 (<italic>hht1</italic>/<italic>hht1</italic>::<italic>HHT1</italic>), and the <italic>hht21/hht21</italic> null mutant or point-mutant strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g006">Fig 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we performed a comparative transcriptome analysis of filamentation-specific genes between the wild type in filamentation inducing conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref045">45</xref>] and H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutant in planktonic and biofilm conditions.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p><italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is an opportunistic fungal pathogen capable of forming biofilms both in vitro and in vivo. Although the transcriptional regulation during the formation of biofilms has been studied, the molecular mechanisms at the chromatin level during this process are less understood. In this study, we identified a variant histone H3 that is exclusively present in the CTG-clade species, including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, but absent in all other ascomycetous fungi analyzed. The histone H3 variant, H3V<sup>CTG</sup>, is not essential for survival of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, but the null H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutant exhibits a more robust biofilm growth as well as enhanced filamentation on solid surfaces compared with the wild type. Supported by a series of evidence, we believe that the CTG-clade specific H3V<sup>CTG</sup> might have evolved to make chromatin less accessible for biofilm transcription modulators to favor the yeast and planktonic growth of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000422.g007">Fig 7</xref>). First, ChIP-qPCR analysis revealed that the occupancy of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> is higher at the promoters of biofilm-related genes compared with that of the canonical histone H3 in planktonic cells. Second, the occupancy of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> is reduced at the promoters of biofilm-specific genes during the transition of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells from planktonic to biofilm growth mode. Third, the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> enhances the binding of Bcr1, a master regulator of biofilm formation, to the promoters of the biofilm-related genes. Finally, deletion of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> rescues biofilm defects associated with 3 biofilm transcription factors, proposed as master regulators, of the biofilm gene circuitry. This repressive behavior of biofilm growth is associated specifically with H3V<sup>CTG</sup>, because alterations of the amino acid residues of Hht1 simultaneously at positions 31 and 32 to those of the canonical histone H3 yield phenotypes similar to those associated with the <italic>hht1</italic> null mutant.</p>

<title>The CTG-clade–specific histone H3 evolved as the molecular switch of morphological growth transitions in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</title>
<p>The variant histone H3 (H3V<sup>CTG</sup>) is less abundant than its canonical form in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> can either grow as free-floating individual cells in the planktonic mode in a flask or as a three-dimensional community on a biotic or abiotic surface to form biofilms. Relative occupancy of the canonical histone H3 remains unaltered on the promoters of several biofilm-related genes tested in planktonic and biofilm cells. On the other hand, occupancy of the variant histone H3, H3V<sup>CTG</sup>, is significantly higher on the promoters of the same set of biofilm genes in the planktonic cells compared with those grown in the biofilm conditions. Based on experimental evidence, we posit that the variant histone H3 nucleosomes make biofilm gene promoters less permissive for binding of transcription modulators (transcription activators or repressors) of biofilm-related genes. When H3V<sup>CTG</sup> levels drop, biofilm transcription modulators bind to the promoters to modulate the genetic circuitry to favor the biofilm mode of growth. Thus, we unravel a new mechanism modulated at the chromatin level by a CTG-clade–specific histone H3 variant to balance a medically relevant growth transition of a major human pathogen.

<p>Morphogenesis has been extensively studied as a potential pathogenic trait [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref046">46</xref>]. Most human fungal pathogens, including <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, <italic>Histoplasma capsulatum</italic>, <italic>Penicillium marneffei</italic>, <italic>Cryptococcus neoformans</italic>, and <italic>Coccidiodes immitis</italic> are dimorphic or polymorphic in nature. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells that are locked either in yeast (<italic>efg1 cph1</italic> double mutant) or in the filamentous form (<italic>tup1</italic> mutant) show compromised virulence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref047">47</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref048">48</xref>]. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells tend to form hyphal filaments at 37 °C. The hyperfilamentation nature of the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutant on solid surfaces even at 30 °C indicates that H3V<sup>CTG</sup> suppresses surface-associated filamentation genes at low temperatures.</p>
<p>The genome-wide transcriptome analysis suggests that the pathway most significantly affected in the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> is the biofilm regulatory network. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is one of the very few fungal species that can form an efficient biofilm in a healthy mammalian host. The biofilm circuit in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> probably evolved following divergence from closely related, nonpathogenic fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref033">33</xref>]. One important step in the biofilm development is the yeast-to-hyphal transition with hyphal filaments being essential components of a mature biofilm. For example, the <italic>bcr1</italic> mutant is defective in biofilm formation, and it also fails to form hyphae under specific conditions, underscoring the importance of hyphal filaments in biofilm formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref049">49</xref>]. Bcr1 is required for expression of cell surface adherence genes (<italic>ALS1</italic>, <italic>ALS3</italic>, and <italic>HWP1</italic>) that are also induced during hyphal growth, suggesting that several common genes play a role during both biofilm and hyphal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref027">27</xref>]. Genes, namely, <italic>CAN2</italic>, <italic>HWP1</italic>, and <italic>TPO4</italic>, are down-regulated in mutants of all 6 biofilm master regulators, whereas they are all up-regulated in the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutant during planktonic growth. This inverse correlation suggests that H3V<sup>CTG</sup> plays an antagonistic role in the biofilm regulatory circuitry compared with that of previously identified biofilm master regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref033">33</xref>]. Furthermore, we show that this circuit is not only derepressed in the planktonic condition but also in biofilm-induced conditions in the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup>. Taken together with these results, it is expected that the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> should enhance biofilm formation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>.</p>
<p>The most compelling evidence that H3V<sup>CTG</sup> acts as a negative regulator of biofilm development in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> came from an enhanced biofilm formation by H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutant cells both in vitro and in vivo conditions compared to the wild-type or the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> complemented strain. Further, the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutant formed an enhanced biofilm in a condition that generally favors planktonic growth. This is probably due to the formation of filaments on solid surfaces by H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutant cells at low temperatures and the fact that biofilm and filamentation genes are derepressed at this restrictive temperature.</p>
<p>In metazoans, histone H3 variants play a key role in the differentiation of embryonic stem cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref050">50</xref>]. During cellular differentiation, stem cells undergo dramatic morphological and molecular changes through selective silencing and activation of lineage-specific genes. Therefore, it may be possible that similar to metazoans, H3V<sup>CTG</sup> evolved to govern the morphogenetic switch in unicellular organisms such as yeast of the CTG clade. Along with various pathogenic traits, up-regulation of several adhesion factors in the absence of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> indicates that the variant histone H3 appeared in the CTG-clade species to maintain the balance between commensal and pathogenic states. <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> is a parasite because it primarily exists in a host. Thus, we propose that H3V<sup>CTG</sup> provides a balance on the pathogenic attributes of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic>, perhaps to enhance its success as a commensal. Studies are in progress to understand how chromatin changes modulated by this novel histone H3 variant bring genetic innovations to regulate one of the most dramatic morphological growth transitions in a medically relevant human fungal pathogen.</p>

Briefly, preprocessing includes (a) background correction (b) within array normalization and (c) fitting data to linear model. Finally, an empirical Bayes moderated statistics was applied to find significant changes in the expression levels. We used a cut-off of <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05 and |fold change| &gt; 1.5 for the differential expression of mutant over wild type to define differentially expressed genes. Differentially regulated genes were clustered using hierarchical clustering to identify significant gene expression patterns. All genes represented on the array are annotated using CGD database. The differentially regulated genes (up or down) were categorized under biofilm, cell cycle, transcription, and others based on the gene ontology annotations. Chi-square test was applied to know the significance of the categorized functions. Gene expression data have been deposited into the NCBI Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) portal under the accession number GSE72824.</p>

<title>Biofilm growth in Spider media at 37 °C and dry biomass estimation</title>
<p>To perform the genome-wide expression analysis in the biofilm-induced condition, biofilms were grown in vitro in Spider medium by growing the biofilms directly on the bottom of 6-well polystyrene plates (CELLSSTAR, 657160). Biofilms were developed as described by Nobile and Mitchell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref049">49</xref>]. Strains were grown in YPD overnight at 30 °C, diluted to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>) of 0.5 in 3 ml of Spider medium. The 6-well plates had been pretreated overnight with fetal bovine serum (FBS) and washed with 2 ml PBS. The inoculated plate was incubated at 37 °C for 90 minutes at 110 rpm agitation for initial adhesion of cells. Plates were then washed with 2 ml PBS, and 3 ml of fresh Spider medium was added, and plates were at 37 °C for 48 hours. Biofilm growth assays of the wild type, the H3V<sup>CTG</sup> null mutants, and the <italic>HHT1</italic> complemented strain were performed by diluting ON culture to an OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.2 in 3 ml Spider medium. To estimate the dry biomass of biofilms, biofilms were scrapped, and the content of each well was transferred to preweighed nitrocellulose filters. Biofilm-containing filters were dried overnight at 60 °C and weighed. The average total biomass for each strain was calculated from 3 independent samples after subtracting the mass of the empty filter.</p>

<title>In vitro biofilm growth in YPD medium at 30 °C and biomass determination</title>
<p>To examine the biofilm formation ability of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> mutant strains in YPDU medium at 30 °C, in vitro biofilm growth assays were carried out by growing biofilms on either the silicone squares substrate as previously described by Nobile and Mitchell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref049">49</xref>]. Biofilms were developed as described before, except in this case, YPDU was the medium of choice and the temperature was 30 °C. Finally, medium was removed, and the silicone squares gently washed with 1× PBS prior to being photographed. For dry biomass measurements, the medium was removed and 2 ml of 1× PBS was added to each well to remove unadhered cells. Biofilms were then scrapped, and the content of each well was transferred to preweighed nitrocellulose filter paper, dried, and weighed as described before.</p>

<title>CLSM for biofilm imaging</title>
<p>Biofilms were imaged as described before by Nobile and Mitchell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref049">49</xref>]. Biofilms were grown on silicone squares for 48 hours, gently washed with 1× PBS, and stained with 50 μg ml<sup>−1</sup> of concanavalin A-Alexa Fluor 594 (Invitrogen, C-11253) for 1 hour at 110 rpm. CLSM was performed at PPMS facility of Institut Pasteur using an upright LSM700 microscope equipped with a Zeiss 40X/ 1.0 W plan-Apochromat immersion objective. Silicone squares were placed in a petri dish, and the biofilms were covered with 1× PBS. Images were acquired and assembled into maximum intensity Z-stack projection using ZEN software (Zeiss).</p>

<title>In vivo rat catheter biofilm model</title>
<p>To form biofilm in vivo, the rat central-venous catheter infection model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref043">43</xref>] was used, as described previously Nobile and colleagues, Andes and colleagues, Nobile and colleagues, and Dalal and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref044">44</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref057">57</xref>]. For this specific pathogen free Sprague-Dawley rats weighing 400 g each were used. A heparinized (100 U/ml) polyethylene catheter with 0.76 mm inner and 1.52 mm outer diameters was inserted into the external jugular vein. The catheter was secured to the vein with the proximal end tunneled subcutaneously to the midscapular space and externalized through the skin. The catheters were inserted 24 hours prior to infection to permit a conditioning period for a deposition of host protein on the catheter surface. Infection was achieved by intraluminal instillation of 500 μl <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> cells (10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml). After a 4 hour dwelling period, the catheter volume was withdrawn, and the catheter was flushed with heparinized 0.15 M NaCl. Catheters were removed after 24 hours of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>albicans</italic> infection to assay biofilm development on the intraluminal surface by SEM. Catheter segments were washed with 0.1 M phosphate buffer (pH 7.2) fixed in 1% glutaraldehyde/4% formaldehyde, washed again with phosphate buffer for 5 minutes, and placed in 1% osmium tetraoxide for 30 minutes. The samples were dehydrated in a series of 10 min ethanol washes (30%, 50%, 85%, 95%, and 100%) followed by critical point drying. Specimens were mounted on aluminium stubs, sputter coated with gold, and imaged using a Hitachi S-5700 or JEOL JSM-6100 SEM in the high-vacuum mode at 10kV. Images were processed using Adobe Photoshop software.</p>

<title>ChIP</title>
<p>The ChIP assays were performed as described previously by Chatterjee and colleagues and Mitra and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref058">58</xref>]. Briefly, each strain was grown until exponential phase (approximately 2 × 10<sup>7</sup> cells/ml) or grown in biofilm condition for 24 hours, and cells were cross-linked with 1% final concentration of formaldehyde for 13 minutes. Chromatin was isolated and sonicated to yield an average fragment size of 300 to 500 bp. The DNA was immunoprecipitated with anti-V5 antibodies (final concentration 20 μg/ml) or anti H3 antibodies (Abcam, ab1791) or anti myc antibodies (Cal Biochem, OP10) and purified. The total, immunoprecipitated (IP) DNA, and beads only material were used to determine the binding of H3V<sup>CTG</sup> to the promoters of biofilm genes by qPCR, as described before. The template used was as follows: 1 μl of 1:100 dilution for input and 1 μl of 1:2 dilution for IP for H3-V5 ChIP and undiluted for H3 and myc ChIP. The conditions used in qPCR were as follows: 94 °C for 2 minutes; the 40 cycles of 94 °C for 30 seconds, 58 °C for 30 seconds, 72 °C for 45 seconds. The results were analyzed using CFX Manager Software. The graph was plotted according to the percentage input method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000422.ref059">59</xref>], and the formula for calculation is 100 × 2<sup>(adjusted <italic>Ct</italic> input − adjusted <italic>Ct</italic> of IP)</sup>. Here, the adjusted value is the dilution factor (log2 of dilution factor) subtracted from the <italic>C</italic><sub><italic>t</italic></sub> value of diluted input/IP.</p>
