We use a homology-based approach, utilizing comparisons with all human GPCRs, to detect and verify chicken GPCRs from translated genomic alignments and Genscan predictions. We present 557 manually curated sequences for GPCRs from the chicken genome, of which 455 were previously not annotated. More than 60% of the chicken Genscan gene predictions with a human ortholog needed curation, which drastically changed the average percentage identity between the human–chicken orthologous pairs (from 56.3% to 72.9%). Of the non-olfactory chicken GPCRs, 79% had a one-to-one orthologous relationship to a human GPCR. The <italic>Frizzled, Secretin,</italic> and subgroups of the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> families have high proportions of orthologous pairs, although the percentage of amino acid identity varies. Other groups show large differences, such as the <italic>Adhesion</italic> family and GPCRs that bind exogenous ligands. The chicken has only three bitter <italic>Taste 2</italic> receptors, and it also lacks an ortholog to human TAS1R2 (one of three GPCRs in the human genome in the <italic>Taste 1</italic> receptor family [TAS1R]), implying that the chicken's ability and mode of detecting both bitter and sweet taste may differ from the human's. The chicken genome contains at least 229 olfactory receptors, and the majority of these (218) originate from a chicken-specific expansion. To our knowledge, this dataset of chicken GPCRs is the largest curated dataset from a single gene family from a non-mammalian vertebrate. Both the updated human GPCR dataset, as well the chicken GPCR dataset, are available for download.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>Man and chicken are very different, but how is that difference related to our respective gene repertoire? The authors studied the family of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), which in man contains about 791 proteins. These are found in the cell membrane, where they recognize substances, thereby functioning as mediators of signals across the cellular membrane. GPCRs respond to physiologically important substances such as hormones and neurotransmitters. In this paper, the publicly available genomic sequence from the domestic chicken is used to identify the entire repertoire of GPCRs in this species. The authors found 557 GPCRs and compared the chicken and human receptors; they concluded that out of the 328 chicken receptors that are not involved in olfaction, more than 250 have a corresponding human receptor. The majority of the differences between the chicken and man are within three groups of GPCRs—the receptors for olfaction, bitter taste, and the receptors involved in the immune system. The chicken GPCR sequences obtained here will be useful for identification of GPCRs in other species that are more distantly related to man, such as fish or insects. The domestic chicken represents the leading experimental model among the avian species and also serves as an important source of food worldwide.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>RF was supported by the Swedish Brain Foundation (Hjärnfonden).

Besides bridging the gap between mammals and other vertebrates, the chicken represents the leading experimental model among the avian species and serves also as an important source of food worldwide.</p><p>The initial chicken genome annotation suggested between 20,000 and 23,000 protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>], which is similar to what has been estimated for the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b005">5</xref>]. It is, however, well known that automatic annotations of new genomes are error-prone, and tremendous work is left in annotation of the different protein families. The prediction of coding sequences of multi-exon genes is complicated, and one of the best programs, Genscan, has a sensitivity and specificity of about 90% for detecting exons, meaning that the average gene with about ten exons is very likely to have at least one exon wrongly predicted. Moreover, it has been estimated that the number of exons that have both splice sites correctly predicted by Genscan is as low as only 19% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b006">6</xref>]. This shows that the likelihood of correctly predicting multi-exon genes is fairly low. This has, of course, a substantial impact on subsequent analysis such as phylogeny and calculations of evolutionary distances, when gene predictions are used instead of curated full-length genes.</p><p>The superfamily of G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs) is one of the largest families of proteins in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b002">2</xref>] and probably also in most other vertebrate species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b007">7</xref>]. The GPCR family has approximately 800 members in man, and these participate in numerous important physiological functions and are also targets for many therapeutic drugs. Their natural ligands are particularly diverse including ions, organic odorants, amines, peptides, proteins, lipids, nucleotides, and photons, which are all able to activate GPCRs. The name GPCR indicates that these receptors interact with G-proteins, but the main common characteristic of GPCRs are seven stretches of about 20–35 consecutive amino acid residues that show a high degree of hydrophobicity and represent α-helixes that span the plasma membrane.</p><p>The complete repertoire of GPCRs has been analyzed for several vertebrate genomes such as the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>], mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b008">8</xref>], mosquito [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b010">10</xref>], and pufferfish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b011">11</xref>] genomes. The numbers of GPCRs in gene-prediction datasets from 13 eukaryotic genomes, not including the chicken genome, was also recently investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b007">7</xref>]. Most of the genome-wide analyses have, however, been performed on raw gene predictions which make reliable phylogenetic analyses impossible. Currently, only the repertoire of GPCRs in the human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>] and mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b008">8</xref>] genomes has been analyzed using curated-sequence datasets. Both physiological and structural features have been used to classify GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b014">14</xref>]. These classification systems were constructed before the completion of human and other vertebrate genomes and hence did not classify atypical receptors not yet identified, such as most of the <italic>Adhesion</italic> (long N-termini–transmembrane-7 [LN-TM7]) family receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b015">15</xref>] and the bitter-taste receptors. In addition, these classification systems did not phylogenetically subdivide the large rhodopsin family, which has approximately 660 members in humans, into groups. Recently, we performed large-scale systematic phylogenetic analyses, including the majority of the GPCRs in the human genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>]. This provided us with the GRAFS system showing five main families of GPCRs named <italic>Glutamate</italic> (G), <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> (R), <italic>Adhesion</italic> (A), <italic>Frizzled/Taste2</italic> (F), and <italic>Secretin</italic> (S). Moreover, we subdivided the large <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> family into four groups; α, β, γ, and δ. The grouping was performed with strict phylogenetic criteria where some atypical human receptors were placed into a group designated <italic>Other.</italic></p><p>In this paper, we scan the recently sequenced chicken genome for GPCRs, using a multitude of methods to obtain a nearly complete set of chicken GPCRs. We manually edit and verify, i.e., curate, the coding regions of each of the GPCRs (557 in total), to provide the first high-quality collection of GPCR sequences from the full genome of a non-mammalian species. We perform maximum-likelihood phylogenetic analysis on these chicken GPCRs together with 750 human GPCRs, which is an updated version of the dataset used previously ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>]; unpublished data), which comprises the entire human GPCR family. We present a strategy of detecting and verifying genes from a genomic assembly and evaluate the accuracy of Genscan predictions in relation to our homology-based gene-prediction approach.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and Verification of Chicken GPCRs</title><p>Initially, 102 known chicken GPCRs from the nr (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/Blast.cgi" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/BLAST/Blast.cgi</ext-link>) database at NCBI were identified using BLASTP with all human GPCRs as baits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>]. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we describe a four-step process of identifying an additional 455 GPCRs from the chicken genome. In step 1, we created a Genscan dataset from the Ensembl February 2004 assembly of the chicken genome (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ensembl.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ensembl.org</ext-link>).

After removal of multiple hits, 1,116 putative chicken GPCRs remained which, after removal of non-GPCRs using BLASTP, was reduced to 870. Finally, all these 870 GPCR-like sequences were manually inspected and corrected, pseudogenes were removed, and multiple hits representing the same protein were merged. The final result of step 1 was the identification of 390 new chicken GPCR sequences.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020054-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020054.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Flowchart Describing the Sequence Analysis Strategy Used in This Work</title><p>Briefly, in the first step, a Genscan dataset was created from the Ensembl February 2004 assembly of the chicken genome. These 30,165 predicted proteins were then searched against a human reference set using BLAST, and 53,294 proteins were selected as possible GPCRs. After removal of multiple hits, 1,116 potential proteins remained. After elimination of non-GPCRs, all 870 GPCR-like sequences were manually inspected and corrected, pseudogenes were removed, and multiple hits representing the same protein were merged. With the completion of step 1, the sequences of 390 new chicken GPCRs were identified. In step 2, a set of 505 putative chicken GPCRs were aligned together with a human reference set to the chicken genome. All sites with a human hit, but without a chicken hit, were extracted and manually processed. Step 2 identified 25 possible chicken GPCRs. In step 3, an initial phylogenetic analysis was performed to identify possible missing orthologs. These human receptor proteins were searched against the chicken genome. All hits with an <italic>E</italic>-value of better than <italic>E</italic> = 1e−6 were compared to all collected chicken GPCRs. A total of 22 new chicken GPCRs were identified in this way after manual assembly and verification. In the fourth and final step, 18 additional chicken GPCR-like sequences were identified using crude searches against the chicken genome with a selection of human GPCRs as baits. All hits with an <italic>E</italic>-value of better than <italic>E</italic> = 0.1 were manually compared with all previously identified chicken GPCRs.

In step 2, we aligned all human GPCRs as well as 505 putative chicken GPCRs against the chicken genome using TBLASTN. All genomic positions that were hit by a human GPCR, but not by a chicken GPCR, were manually inspected for additional new chicken GPCRs. Only the best hit from each search was considered. Step 2 identified 25 new chicken GPCRs.</p><p>In step 3, we first produced neighbor-joining phylogenetic trees for all chicken and human GPCRs. Subsequently, in all cases where a one-to-one orthologous relationship between a human and a chicken sequence was not present, we manually identified all human sequences that did lack an orthologous chicken sequence and used these to search the chicken genome using TBLASTN. All genomic positions containing a human hit but not a chicken GPCR were then manually inspected for additional new chicken GPCRs. This resulted in the identification of 22 additional chicken GPCRs.</p><p>In step 4, we used a strategy similar to that used in step 2, but here we used a limited number of GPCRs as baits and inspected all genomic positions, not only the top scoring, for additional new chicken GPCRs. This step identified 18 new chicken GPCRs. In total, 455 new chicken GPCRs were identified.

Here, wrongly predicted regions were excluded, new splice sites were selected to correct frame-shifted regions of the protein, and the most likely start codon was selected based on alignment with the human orthologous protein. In addition, missing regions were identified by the use of translated alignments against the genomic regions in those cases where those missing sequences were expected to be found from comparison with the human genome. To illustrate the importance of this process, we performed pairwise alignments between the corrected protein and the initial Genscan prediction for all non-olfactory sequences with a human ortholog from step 1.</p><p>From each of these alignments, the percentage identity between the sequences was calculated, using a scale where 100 means completely identical and 0 means no identity. The result of this comparison can be seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. It is evident that less than 41% of the sequences are correctly predicted. The mean percentage identity between the Genscan predictions and each corresponding protein in the curated dataset is 80.7% (median 58.6) with a large standard deviation of 25.3. It has to be noted here that flanking regions that cannot be aligned outside of the TM regions in the predictions were excluded from the comparison. If these were included, the difference would be even larger. One important point is that the percentage error in the Genscan prediction could, at the nucleotide level, be lower. For example, a wrongly predicted splice site could introduce a frame-shift that would have a significant impact on the predicted protein, although the number of wrongly predicted bases could be small.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020054-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020054.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Comparison between Curated and Non-Curated Chicken GPCR Sequences</title><p>(A) The chart describes the percentage identity between the original Genscan prediction and the manually curated version of the chicken proteins for 158 sequence pairs.

This is similar to the case with the human GPCRs, where 26 receptors could not be placed into any of the phylogenetic groups, and these are therefore placed into a group designated <italic>Other.</italic> It is important to note that the receptors in this group are, in general, not related to each other, although a few of these do have high sequence identity to one other receptor from the <italic>Other</italic> group. To assess possible sequence relationships between these and the human GPCRs, a BLAST database was built from the protein sequences of all the human GPCRs, and the 19 chicken GPCRs were compared against the database using BLASTP. In <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020054-t002">Table 2</xref>, we present the results from this analysis. It is interesting to note that one chicken GPCR, here designated ggNOVEL26, appears to lack clear similarity to any human GPCR using BLASTP alignments (cut off <italic>E</italic>-value &gt; 10). We chose to include this clearly atypical GPCR as it shows similarity to the 7tm_1 model, the model derived from the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> family of GPCRs, using the online version of RPS-BLAST. In step 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we use all atypical human GPCRs in low-stringency BLAST searches; the results of these low-stringency BLAST searches suggest that the majority of atypical GPCRs in chicken have been detected. We also searched with sequences from non-mammalian GPCR families. These were the cAMP-binding GPCRs from slime molds, the chemosensory GPCRs from nematodes, and the gustatory GPCRs from insects. We did, however, not find any GPCR from these families in the chicken.</p><table-wrap content-type="2col" id="pcbi-0020054-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020054.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>The Results of Pairwise Comparison of the Chicken GPCRs from the <italic>Other</italic> Group with the Human Dataset</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020054.t002" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb2col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="bottom"><hr/>Chicken GPCR</td><td valign="bottom"><hr/>Closest Human GPCR</td><td valign="bottom"><hr/>Closest Human GPCR Excluding <italic>Other</italic></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR88</td><td valign="bottom">GPR88 (1e&minus;55)</td><td valign="bottom">NPY2R (3e&minus;0.06)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR120</td><td valign="bottom">GPR120 (5e&minus;69)</td><td valign="bottom">NPY5R (3e&minus;10)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR135</td><td valign="bottom">GPR135 (7e&minus;73)</td><td valign="bottom">OPRL1 (3e&minus;11)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR139</td><td valign="bottom">GPR139 (1e&minus;169)</td><td valign="bottom">SSTR4 (1e&minus;12)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR141</td><td valign="bottom">GPR141 (1e&minus;47)</td><td valign="bottom">GPR34 (9e&minus;16)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR141b</td><td valign="bottom">GPR141 (4e&minus;064)</td><td valign="bottom">CCR3 (7e&minus;9)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR142</td><td valign="bottom">GPR142 (7e&minus;88)</td><td valign="bottom">SSTR4 (2e&minus;017)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPR146</td><td valign="bottom">GPR146 (3e&minus;59)</td><td valign="bottom">CMKLR2 (8e&minus;11)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggGPCR150</td><td valign="bottom">GPCR150 (3e&minus;81)</td><td valign="bottom">CHRM5 (0.006)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggIEDA</td><td valign="bottom">IEDA (1e&minus;0.08)</td><td valign="bottom">PTHR2 (5.5)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggIEDAb</td><td valign="bottom">IEDA (0.0)</td><td valign="bottom">TBXA2R (5e&minus;8)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggTRHR</td><td valign="bottom">TRHR (1e&minus;167)</td><td valign="bottom">NMU2R (2e&minus;24)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggTRHR2</td><td valign="bottom">TRHR (3e&minus;069)</td><td valign="bottom">BRS3 (2e&minus;017)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggNOVEL26</td><td valign="bottom">NA</td><td valign="bottom">NA</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggNOVEL7</td><td valign="bottom">CELSR2 (9e&minus;0.005)</td><td valign="bottom">CELSR2 (9e&minus;0.005)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggOA1</td><td valign="bottom">OA1 (1e&minus;125)</td><td valign="bottom">CELSR2 (0.02)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggPERVAR1</td><td valign="bottom">PERVAR1 (1e&minus;044)</td><td valign="bottom">CELSR1 (1.1)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggTM7SF1</td><td valign="bottom">TM7SF1 (0.0)</td><td valign="bottom">CCRL2 (0.001)</td></tr><tr><td valign="bottom">ggTM7SF1b</td><td valign="bottom">TM7SF1 (2e&minus;43)</td><td valign="bottom">EMR2 (2.7)</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt201"><p><italic>E</italic>-values are indicated within brackets.</p></fn><fn id="nt202"><p>NA, not available.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref> describes the repertoire of chicken and human GPCRs in the <italic>Adhesion</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), <italic>Glutamate</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), <italic>Frizzled</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>C), <italic>Taste 2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>D), and <italic>Secretin</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>E) receptor families.

None of the 22 chicken <italic>Adhesion</italic> GPCRs has previously been reported. Overall, there are 21 cases of one-to-one orthologous relationships between human and chicken <italic>Adhesion</italic> GPCRs, while 12 human <italic>Adhesion</italic> GPCRs lack a chicken ortholog. The adhesion family can be divided into groups I–VIII based on phylogeny [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b015">15</xref>]. Group I, which contains the lectomedin receptors (LEC1–LEC3) and the EGF-TM7-latrophilin–related protein (ETL) receptor, is relatively well conserved in the chicken, and only the LEC1 receptor is missing. Group II in the human consists of CD97 and four EGF-like modules containing mucin-like receptor proteins (EMR1–4) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b015">15</xref>]. This group does not have any chicken orthologs. Since CD97 is present in the teleost <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Takifugu rubripes</named-content> (unpublished data), this receptor appears to be have been lost in the lineage leading to the chicken, while the EMRs have probably expanded in mammals.</p><p>In group IV, the ortholog to human cadherin EGF LAG seven-pass G-type receptor 2 (CELSR2) is missing, while groups III and V are identical between the species regarding gene content. Group VI apparently has expanded in mammals or, more specifically, in humans. Chicken ggGPR111/115 may be the common ancestor of human GPR111 and GPR115 based on chromosomal localization and phylogenetic relationship. GPR111 and GPR115 are positioned in close proximity on human Chromosome 6p12.3 and may therefore be the result of a local duplication from the common ancestor GPR111/GPR115, still present as a single copy in the chicken. In group VII, there is a one-to-one relationship between the human and the chicken, while group VIII lacks a chicken ortholog to human GPR56.</p><p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>B describes the repertoire of chicken <italic>Glutamate</italic> family receptors.

Only one of the 15 chicken <italic>Glutamate</italic> family GPCRs has previously been reported in Genbank.

The genes for these orphan receptors are well conserved in the chicken, although human GPRC5A and GPRC5D may represent a duplication in mammals of <italic>GPRC5A/5D</italic> that we found in chicken.

Of these, nine chicken receptor proteins were previously known from the literature. The family displays an almost 100% ortholog conservation between the human and the chicken. Only the human frizzled 5 (FZD5) lacks a clear chicken ortholog. However, chicken ggFZDn1 could have a different location in the phylogenetic tree if the sequence was full-length. The fact that the FZD is so well conserved in the chicken may be explained by the family's important role in basal cell functions such as controlling cell fate, proliferation, and polarity during metazoan development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b034">34</xref>].</p><p>The human genome contains 25 functional human <italic>Taste 2</italic> receptors (T2Rs) responsible for detecting bitter-tasting compounds in addition to ten pseudo genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b035">35</xref>].

In humans, this group contains a total of 101 receptors, while we found 92 in the chicken genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>A; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020054-t001">Table 1</xref>). Several subgroups within the α-group are very well conserved. The melanocortin and EDGR have one-to-one orthologous pairs, while the prostaglandin receptor family (PTGxR) lacks a chicken ortholog for the human tromboxan receptor (TBXA2R), the prostaglandin E receptor 1, subtype EP1 (PTGER1), the prostacyclin receptor (PTGIR), and the prostaglandin D2 receptor (PTGDR).</p><p>The adenosine receptors (ADORAs) are relatively well conserved; however, human ADORA2B appears to be represented by two subtypes in the chicken, giving rise to ggADORA2Ba and ggADORA2Bb, where ggADORA2Ba appears to be evolving rapidly. All four chicken ADORAs have previously been cloned. In the databases, two unique sequences are named adenosine receptor 2B and, to avoid confusion, we have renamed those ggADORA2Ba and ggADORA2Bb according to our phylogeny. The chicken histamine receptor family (HRH) consists of ggHRH1, ggHRH2, and three human HRH3-like subtypes: ggHRH3, ggHRH3n1a, and ggHRH3n1b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). ggHRH3 is the ortholog of human HRH3, while the genes for ggHRH3n1a and ggHRH3n1b may represent a late local duplication in the chicken based on their close chromosomal localization on GG02. The chicken genome lacks the ortholog for the human muscarinic receptor 1 (CHRM1), while the adrenergic receptor family displays a one-to-one orthologous relationship between human and chicken receptors. This is also the case for the serotonergic receptor family, except for an extra copy of a HTR7-like subtype, ggHTR7n1, which possibly represents a subtype that was lost in humans.</p><p>The chicken genome contains five visual pigment genes, the rod pigment (rhodopsin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b041">41</xref>] and the four cone pigments—iodopsin (red) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b042">42</xref>], blue-sensitive opsin, violet-sensitive opsin, and green-sensitive opsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b043">43</xref>]. As previously described, the human <italic>OPN1LW</italic> (red) and <italic>OPN1MW</italic> (green) are the result of a local duplication on the X chromosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b044">44</xref>]. Besides these already known genes, we identified a novel opsin-related gene in the chicken: <italic>ggOPSINn1</italic> localized basally in the opsin-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). The ggOPN4n1 was previously called putative photopigment melanopsin but, based on the phylogenetic relationship within the melanopsin family (the OPN4s), we renamed it.</p><p>The TAR family has been subjected to different evolutionary events in different species; for example, several subtype-specific expansions both in zebrafish and rodent genomes. The human genome contains TAR1, TAR3, TAR4, TAR5, and PNR, while TAR2 is a pseudogene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b045">45</xref>]. However, the TAR2 subtype seems to be present as a functional receptor both in rodents and chickens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b045">45</xref>].</p><p>The β-group in the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> family consists of 43 human receptors (unpublished data) and 45 potential chicken receptors (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020054-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). This group contains mainly peptide-binding receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>] such as the neuropeptide FF, neuropeptide Y, ghrelin, orexin, and cholecystokinin receptors, the neurotensin receptors (NTSRs), and the prolactin-releasing hormone receptors (PRLHRs). We expanded this group with 20 new chicken GPCRs, including orthologs for human NTSR1, tachykinin 2 and tachykinin 3 receptors (TACR2 and TACR3), the motilin receptor, and the neuromedin U subtype 1 and neuromedin U subtype 2 receptors (NMUR1 and NMUR2) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The β-group contains as many as 37 one-to-one orthologous pairs between the human and chicken. However, the chicken genome appears to be missing an ortholog to the human NTSR2, while two NTSR subtypes are present in both human, mouse, rat, and bullfrog <italic>(Rana ridibunda)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b046">46</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b048">48</xref>].</p><p>The chicken genome contains six neuropeptide Y receptor (NPYR) subtypes compared to four subtypes in human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b050">50</xref>]. Besides NPY1R, NPY2R, NPY4R (PPYR1), and NPY5R—which both genomes contain—the chicken genome also contains NPY6R, homologous to human pseudogene <italic>npy6r,</italic> and NPY7R, homologous to zebrafish Npy7r [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b051">51</xref>]. NPY7R is most closely related to NPY2R, based on phylogeny, and appears to be an ancient relative to this gene, which is missing in mammals. Although <italic>npy6r</italic> is a pseudogene in the human, as well as in many other mammals, it is present as a functional receptor in the mouse, but appears to be missing completely in the rat [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b052">52</xref>]. Previous phylogenetic analysis of PRLHRs from fish, chicken, and mammals show that these receptors group with NPYRs with high bootstrap support [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b053">53</xref>]. Based on chromosomal localization and phylogenetic relationship, it was suggested that the tetraploidization events generated four copies of the ancient PRLHR gene—PRLHR1, PRLHR1b, PRLHR2, and PRLHR2b—which were differentially retained in different genomes. The mammalian genomes appear to contain only the PRLHR1 subtype, while the chicken genome contains PRLHR1, PRLHR1b, and PRLHR2, and the teleost genome from pufferfish contains the PRLHR1b and the PRLHR2b subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b053">53</xref>]. The chicken genome is missing the ortholog for the human orexin 1 receptor (HCRTR1), while the endothelin receptor family and the orphan GPR73 contain more subtypes than do the human families.</p><p>The γ-group contains receptors such as the chemokine, opioid, galanin, and somatostatin receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>]. The chicken genome contains 46 potential γ-group GPCRs, while the human genome contains 64 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020054-t001">Table 1</xref>; unpublished data). We expanded this group with 29 novel potential chicken GPCRs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020054-t001">Table 1</xref>). The main differences are in the chemokine receptor family, which has expanded in mammals, and in the formyl peptide-binding receptor family, which is missing in the chicken (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The human chemokine receptors are classified by their ligand-binding preferences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b054">54</xref>], thereby generating four GPCR subclasses of chemokine receptors; the CCRs, the CXCRs, XCR1, and CX3CR1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b054">54</xref>].</p><p>Compared to the human genome, the chicken genome apparently has lost several receptors from the CXCR subclass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). This may also be an effect of a mammalian expansion in this subclass, since several of these receptors have been cloned in the mouse but not yet found in fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b056">56</xref>]. However, orthologs to human CXCR1 and CXCR2 have been found in <italic>Xenopus laevis, Oncorhynchus mykiss,</italic> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Cyprinus carpio</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b059">59</xref>]. The CCR subclass has expanded in the chicken genome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). There exist at least three chicken orthologs to human receptors CCR2 and CCR5; ggCCR2/5n1a, CCR2/5n1b, and ggCCR5n1c. In addition human CCR8 is represented by two chicken orthologs: ggCCR8a and ggCCR8b (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The chicken ortholog to human GPR8 is apparently missing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). This receptor has, in the human genome, been shown to bind neuropeptide W [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b060">60</xref>]. Only mammalian genomes appear to contain both subtypes, while zebrafish hold two GPR7/GPR8–like sequences, which may be the result of a linage-specific duplication of a gene ancestral to mammalian GPR7 and GPR8 (unpublished data) in fish.</p><p>The somatostatin receptors 1–5 display a clear one-to-one orthologous relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). The chicken genome appears to have lost the melanin-concentrating hormone receptor (MCHR) 2; both subtypes can be found in mammals and teleosts (MCHR1 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. rubripes</named-content> and MCHR2 in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Danio rerio</named-content>). The urotensin II receptor (UTS2R) has an ortholog in chicken, ggUTS2R; however, two additional receptor proteins, which resembled the human UTS2R, were found—ggUTS2Rn1 and ggUTS2Rn2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). ggUTS2R and ggUTS2Rn2 are located in close proximity on chicken Chromosome 18; however, based on this phylogenetic analysis and the fact that both receptors have an ortholog in the teleost <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Tetraodon nigroviridis</named-content> (unpublished data), it is not likely that they represent a late chicken-specific gene duplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).</p><p>The fourth <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> family group, the δ-group, contains the olfactory receptors, the nucleotide-binding receptors, the glucoprotein receptors, several orphan receptors, and the mas-related G protein–coupled receptor (MRG) cluster 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). The glycoprotein receptors and the MRGs could have been placed in the γ- or δ-group because receptors from these groups hit other receptors from the γ- and δ-group with similar BLAST score. We chose, however, to place the glycoprotein receptors and the MRGs in the δ-group, based on phylogenetic topologies obtained using maximum-parsimony analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b009">9</xref>]. We expanded the chicken δ-group with 52 novel GPCRs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020054-t001">Table 1</xref>). The largest differences between the receptors in the δ-group in the human and chicken are three species-specific expansions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). The first case deals with an expansion in the chicken genome which comprises a total of eight homologs to human orphan receptor GPR43 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). The International Chicken Genome Sequencing Consortium identified 13 GPR43-like sequences in their initial estimation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>]. At first, we also identified more than eight GPR43-like sequences, but after searches against the most recent assembly (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start" xlink:type="simple">http://genome.ucsc.edu/cgi-bin/hgBlat?command=start</ext-link>), the number of sequences was reduced to eight. The differences may be due to assembly problems in the unlocalized genomic regions where the GPR43 homologs are situated and, as a result, different assemblies may give different outcomes.</p><p>The second case regards the MRG cluster which, in the human genome, contains one mas-1 oncogene receptor gene and nine MRGs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b061">61</xref>]. The chicken genome contains only one clear ortholog to this family, ggMAS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). However, the chicken genome also contains five other MRG-related genes. These genes may represent chicken-specific MRGs, as phylogenetic analysis groups these receptors separately when they are analyzed together with all human MRGs and members from mouse and rat mrgA, mrgB, and mrgC receptor families (unpublished data) (for nomenclature see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b061">61</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b062">62</xref>]).</p><p>The third case is the olfactory receptors. The human genome holds 388 functional olfactory receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b064">64</xref>], while the chicken genome contains at least 229. A majority of the chicken olfactory receptors (<italic>n</italic> = 218) represent an expansion of genes similar to the human <italic>01.01.01/OR5BF1</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>] (for nomenclature see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b065">65</xref>]). However, the eight functional chicken olfactory genes that have been cloned so far—<italic>COR1–6, COR7a,</italic> and <italic>COR7b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b066">66</xref>]—are all localized in close proximity on chicken Chromosome 5 and are not part of that expansion. Instead, receptors COR1–6 form a separate sub-tree close to group 11.31.01–11.31.05 of human olfactory receptors, all tightly positioned together on human Chromosome 11 (for phylogenetic tree, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020054-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>; for nomenclature, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b065">65</xref>]). Based on their phylogenetic relationship, the chicken COR1–6 and human 11.31.01–11.31.05 may share a recent common ancestor. In addition to these six chicken receptors, COR7a, COR7b, and the novel receptors ggOR62, ggOR220, and ggOR221 also position outside the 01.01.01/OR5BF1 gene expansion group. COR7a, COR7b, and ggOR220 group close to human olfactory receptors 11.47.01–11.47.03, while ggOR62 and ggOR221 group close to human receptors 11.44.01 and 15.02.01, respectively. All 229 chicken olfactory receptors represent unique genomic positions in the chicken assembly because Genscan was set to exclude predicted alternative transcripts.</p><p>All 557 reported chicken receptors can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020054-sd002">Dataset S2</xref> (description) and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020054-sd003">Dataset S3</xref> (sequences).</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Discussion</title><p>In this paper, we present a collection of 557 manually curated GPCR sequences from the chicken genome. The sequences were obtained through a four-step search procedure with a high degree of manual verification, and it is likely that this dataset contains most of the GPCR sequences present in the current assembly of the chicken genome. The aim of both the manual curation and the assembly step are to ensure that all pseudogenes, i.e., genes with coding regions interrupted by stop-codons, are excluded and that the exon–intron organizations are correct. It is well established that automatic prediction and annotation of proteins from genomic sequences is highly error-prone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b006">6</xref>]. We show that only 62 out of the 158 non-olfactory chicken GPCRs with a clear orthologous relation to a human GPCR were correctly predicted by Genscan (41%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). The manually corrected sequences differ, on average, by 19% from the original Genscan predictions. To show the significance of this fact with regard to subsequent analysis, we calculated the sequence identity between pairwise alignments of orthologous chicken and human sequence pairs for the corrected and uncorrected chicken GPCRs, and here again the difference is remarkable. We found that the average sequence identity was 56.3% between the human and non-edited chicken GPCRs, while the average sequence identity between the corresponding edited chicken GPCRs and the human sequences was 72.9% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). Because it is highly unlikely that Genscan errors make orthologs more similar, comparison between these numbers suggests that our manual curation has clearly improved the dataset.</p><p>It is interesting to note that in a study by Hillier et al. describing the initial annotation of the chicken genome, the overall average sequence identity between 10,094 protein sequences orthologous between the human and the chicken was found to be around 80% [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>]. It has to be noted that these sequences are all computer predictions on a draft genome assembly. The percentage identity could be even higher if it was based on curated sequences using the same reasoning as above. However, the dataset used by Hillier et al. contains only “core orthologs”, i.e., sequences that are conserved between the human, chicken, and <italic>Fugu</italic>. It is possible that the automatic procedure used to obtain these “core” sequence predictions has enriched the dataset for highly conserved sequences.</p><p>Our results suggest that the orthologous GPCRs are, in general, less well conserved between the human and the chicken than the average protein. This is also indicated by data presented by Hillier et al. where the gene ontology (GO) category “GPCR-signaling”, containing 323 orthologous pairs, was the 16th least-conserved category at primary-sequence level, out of 20 categories from the biological process GO-tree [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>]. According to the definition, this GO-class contains, apart from GPCRs, other proteins associated with the signaling cascade of GPCRs. Assuming that there are around 250 orthologous pairs representing GPCRs in this category (which is approximately what we identified), other proteins—such as G-proteins, peptides, and enzymes—constitute around 33% of the proteins in this GO category. Many of these proteins, for example the G-proteins, are generally known to be well conserved between species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b068">68</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that GPCRs, even when confounding factors such as gene duplications, expansions, and deletions are considered, evolve more rapidly than most other protein families.</p><p>GPCRs constitute 3.2% and 5.2% of the genes in the human and mouse genomes, respectively, considering that both these genomes have about 25,000 protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b005">5</xref>]. The main difference in the GPCR repertoire between the mouse and the human genomes can be attributed to gene expansions of olfactory receptors in mouse. The initial estimates of the chicken genome indicate that it also contains about 20,000–23,000 protein-coding genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>], and considering the number of GPCRs that we find, the overall percentage of GPCR is lower in chickens or between 2.2% and 2.4%. This difference can be explained by the fact that chicken has a lower number of olfactory receptors. If the olfactory receptors are excluded, the overall percentage of GPCR genes is 1.65% for the human genome and between 1.32% and 1.43% for chicken. We have previously shown that the percentages of all protein predictions that are GPCR sequences are, in general, similar in different vertebrates as well as in invertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b007">7</xref>]. The only large deviation between species was found to be related to large expansions of certain GPCR families, interestingly always receptors for non-endogenous ligands. Examples are the chemosensory receptors in the nematode <italic>(Caenorhabditis elegans),</italic> gustatory receptors in insects, and olfactory receptors in the mouse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b007">7</xref>]. The overall percentage of GPCRs for endogenous ligands is thus remarkably constant for all the bilateral species investigated in detail so far.</p><p>Our phylogenetic analysis with all known human and chicken GPCRs is the first detailed comparison between the repertoire of GPCRs in non-mammalian and mammalian species. This analysis shows the orthologous pairs of the chicken and human GPCRs, and we conclude that all the main groups of GPCRs, with the exception of <italic>Taste 2</italic> and the olfactory subset of the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> γ-group are, in general, well conserved between the human and chicken. The average sequence identity between orthologous pairs of chicken and human proteins is around 73% in their TM regions, but there is a considerable variation in identity between the different families and groups of GPCRs. The <italic>Adhesion</italic> family displays the lowest percentage identity (68.8%) between orthologous pairs, and this could be due to the fact that the <italic>Adhesion</italic> GPCRs utilize the TM regions mostly as a membrane-anchor and signal-transmission unit, and not primarily for complex ligand interactions.</p><p>FZD is well conserved between the human and the chicken, regarding both repertoire and primary sequence (81.4%), which could relate to their important role in basic functions such as controlling cell fate, proliferation, and polarity during metazoan development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b034">34</xref>]. In fact, FZD is the only GPCR family that is close to the figure of 80% conservation that is reported as the mean value for the entire set of orthologous pairs in the chicken and the human genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>]. It is also interesting to note that the proteins in the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> family β-group appear to evolve more slowly (77.3%) than the other <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> groups (69.2%–73.8%); this could be due to the fact that all ligands in this family are peptides and that peptide ligands may require more interaction points than smaller non-peptidergic substances—which is likely to conserve the structure and thus the amino acid sequence of the <italic>Rhodopsin</italic> β-group receptors.</p><p>According to our phylogenetic analysis, 259 of the 557 chicken receptors have a one-to-one ortholog in the human genome. It is, however, important to note that comparison of only two genomes may provide some wrong conclusions about orthologous relationships in individual cases. This is because deletions of one member in each of two related pairs in both species (double loss) may cause topology that wrongly indicates those genes that are orthologs. We used data from the rodent or fish genomes to clarify in more detail the true phylogenetic relationship in cases where no clear one-to-one orthologous relationships were present—for example TAR2 and NPY6R, which are both pseudogenes in the human but are functional in the mouse. Overall, the orthologous pairs for many of the GPCR groups are, in general, remarkably well conserved between the human and the chicken, despite the fact that this family of proteins appears to evolve relatively fast considering the primary sequence. For example, the <italic>Secretin</italic> and the <italic>Frizzled</italic> families display a one-to-one human–chicken orthologous relationship for all but one protein in each of the two families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">4</xref>E). However, the repertoire of GPCRs that contribute to the sensory systems such as smell, taste, and vision differ remarkably between the chicken and the human genomes.</p><p>Olfaction is mediated by GPCRs expressed in the olfactory epithelium, and it is one of the major neurosensory functions by which vertebrates such as humans and chickens investigate their external chemical environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b069">69</xref>]. The 388 functional olfactory receptors in the human genome can be divided into class I and class II based on phylogenetic criteria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b064">64</xref>]. The chicken genome contains at least 229 potentially functional class II olfactory receptors, while class I receptors appear to be missing. Class I olfactory receptors are present both in teleosts and in mammals, and have long been considered to recognize water-soluble odorants, while class II receptors mediate the effects of airborne odorants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b070">70</xref>]. A majority of the chicken olfactory receptors, 218 genes, represent an expansion of genes most similar to the human 01.01.01/OR5BF1 gene in class II [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b003">3</xref>] (for nomenclature, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b064">64</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b065">65</xref>]). It is not known which ligands these novel proteins recognize, but it is likely that these ligands are some kind of volatile airborne substance. Several studies have addressed the deficient homing ability in anosmic birds; these studies indicate that birds use the olfactory system for navigation, particularly in unknown terrain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b071">71</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b073">73</xref>]. Birds apparently also use the olfactory system for discriminating between individuals and finding their nests, for finding food, and for avoiding toxic insects and dangerous predators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b074">74</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b076">76</xref>]. One possibility could be that the large number of class II olfactory receptors could be involved in such functions.</p><p>The gustatory system in humans can detect and differentiate between hundreds of compounds, allowing us to avoid toxic compounds and to select nutritious food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b077">77</xref>]. Three of the five taste modalities—sweet, bitter, salt, sour, and <sc>l</sc>-glutamate (umami)—are mediated through GPCRs. Sweet and umami are mediated by the TAS1Rs which, in humans, consist of three different GPCRs—TAS1R1, TAS1R2, and TAS1R3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b023">23</xref>]—while bitter taste is mediated by the <italic>Taste 2</italic> receptor family (TAS2R) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b037">37</xref>]. The TAS1Rs function as protomers in heterodimeric complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b021">21</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b023">23</xref>], where the dimer complex between TAS1R1 and TAS1R3 is responsible for the <sc>l</sc>-glutamate taste (umami), whereas the combination of TAS1R2 and TAS1R3 detects sweeteners [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b024">24</xref>]. Intriguingly, chickens appear to lack an ortholog to human TAS1R2. This may imply that the chicken's mode of detecting sweet taste differs from that of humans, since the TAS1R2 unit, which is missing in the chicken, is the interaction point for sweet-tasting compounds such as aspartame and neotame, while the TAS1R3 unit is responsible for the intracellular signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b078">78</xref>]. However, sweet compounds such as lactisole, brazzein, and cyclamate have been shown to interact directly with the TAS1R3 unit [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b078">78</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b080">80</xref>], which could implicate a sweet-detecting ability despite the lack of a TAS1R2 unit.</p><p>The human genome contains 25 functional genes that code for T2Rs, which are responsible for detecting bitter-tasting compounds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b035">35</xref>]. Intriguingly the chicken genome contains only three bitter-tasting T2Rs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g004">Figure 4</xref>D). The closest human homolog to the novel ggT2Rn1 binds β-glucopyranosides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b038">38</xref>], while the closest human relatives to the novel chicken genes ggT2Rn2 and ggT2Rn3 are still orphans. The large sequence diversity among the 25 human T2Rs may explain how a limited number of receptors can sense the thousands of bitter compounds that humans can detect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b081">81</xref>], while in the chicken, the low number of T2Rs may indicate a relatively poor ability of chickens to select between bitter compounds.</p><p>Humans are trichromatic i.e., have the ability to discriminate between three different colors (wavelengths), while the chicken is tetrachromatic. The chicken genome contains five visual pigment genes; the rod pigment (rhodopsin) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b041">41</xref>] and the four cone pigments—iodopsin (red) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b042">42</xref>], blue-sensitive opsin, violet-sensitive opsin, and green-sensitive opsin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b043">43</xref>]. Besides these already known genes, we have identified a novel opsin-related gene in the chicken—ggOPSINn1 localized basally in the phylogenetic opsin-cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020054-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). This gene is closely related to the two forms of vertebrate ancient opsins (short and long) previously found in the zebrafish and roach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b082">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b083">83</xref>]. The long form in zebrafish has been found to function as a green-sensitive pigment, and immunoreactivity towards this splice variant has been detected in non-GABAergic horizontal cells in the zebrafish and roach retinas, and in cells surrounding the zebrafish diencephalic ventricle of thalamus, suggesting multiple roles in photosensory physiology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b082">82</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b083">83</xref>].</p><p>In summary, we scanned the recently sequenced chicken genome for GPCRs to obtain manually edited and verified coding regions of a total of 557 GPCRs. To our knowledge, this provides the first high-quality collection of GPCR sequences from a full genome of a non-mammalian species. Our phylogenetic analysis on the curated chicken GPCRs, together with 750 human GPCRs, clarifies the differences between the GPCR repertoires that may relate to the functional differences between these two species. Our curated GPCR dataset from the chicken genome could serve as a basis for annotating this important protein family in other vertebrates, as well as in invertebrates.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Generation of a Genscan dataset.</title><p>A set of in silico–predicted chicken genes was obtained from the February 2004 genome assembly by the following procedure.

All hits with an <italic>E</italic>-value of better than 0.1 were extracted into a temporary file. From this file, all duplicates, based on the Genscan number, were automatically removed using a custom made C++ program (available upon request). From the resulting single-copy set, the sequences that were true GPCRs were extracted by searching those against a database consisting of the entire RefSeq database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b088">88</xref>]—all human non-olfactory GPCRs and 347 human olfactory GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b065">65</xref>]. The chicken Genscan sequences that did not hit any of the human GPCRs among the five top hits in a BLASTP search with a cut-off at <italic>E</italic> = 10 were classified as non-GPCRs and removed. This resulted in 870 putative predicted chicken GPCRs. These were tentatively annotated by searching every hit against a database consisting of all human GPCRs using BLASTP with a cut-off at <italic>E</italic> = 10, with subsequent naming according to the most significant human hit with a gg (for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">G. gallus</named-content>) prefix. During manual editing, we found that many chicken GPCRs had to be built from several (sometimes more than 30) different predictions, which each contained only a small part of the final chicken GPCR sequence. After manual editing, 390 chicken GPCR sequences remained.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Identification of GPCRs from the chicken genome using TBLASTN (step 2).</title><p>A set of chicken GPCRs that were not found in the Genscan dataset was obtained in the following way.

In a similar way, best-in-chicken genome positions were identified for each human GPCR sequence using translated BLAST (TBLASTN) with a cut-off at 1e−6 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020054-b090">90</xref>]. The set of putative new chicken GPCRs was then identified as being the positions in the chicken genome that had an alignment with a human GPCR that was not overlapped by any chicken GPCR. The genomic material aligning to the human GPCR was downloaded, and a final version of each of the chicken GPCRs was manually assembled and edited.</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Identification of missing GPCRs from initial phylogenetic analysis (step 3).</title><p>An initial phylogenetic analysis was performed as described below, with the longest possible version of all sequences from each family and group, using both neighbor-joining and maximum-parsimony analysis.

For BLAST and BLAT, we also used standalone versions with local databases with these tools. All chicken proteins were edited under the following assumptions. (1) All splice sites are of the canonical (GT-AG) type. (2) The position of the splice sites, and hence the organization of exons and introns, are in general conserved between chicken and human orthologs. (3) When, in a small region, there were several possible splice sites that fulfill points 1 and 2, the one that gave an amino acid alignment most similar to the human ortholog was chosen. (4) The end of each predicted coding region was chosen as the first stop codon in the correct frame in the last exon. (5) The start codon was chosen as the methionine in the correct frame in the first exon that gave the best alignment to the human ortholog. In a few cases, an exon–intron boundary is clearly different between chicken and human and, in these cases, we attempted to identify that exon by translated alignments between the human ortholog and the smallest possible region in the chicken genome that could contain that exon.
