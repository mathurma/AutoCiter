				<article-title>Bats Keep Their Ear on the Ball</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Acquisition of food in many animal species depends on the pursuit and capture of moving prey. Among modern humans, the pursuit and interception of moving targets plays a central role in a variety of sports, such as tennis, football, Frisbee, and baseball. Studies of target pursuit in animals, ranging from dragonflies to fish and dogs to humans, have suggested that they all use a 
					<italic>constant bearing</italic> (CB) strategy to pursue prey or other moving targets. CB is best known as the interception strategy employed by baseball outfielders to catch ballistic fly balls. CB is a time-optimal solution to catch targets moving along a straight line, or in a predictable fashion—such as a ballistic baseball, or a piece of food sinking in water. Many animals, however, have to capture prey that may make evasive and unpredictable maneuvers. Is CB an optimum solution to pursuing erratically moving targets? Do animals faced with such erratic prey also use CB? In this paper, we address these questions by studying prey capture in an insectivorous echolocating bat. Echolocating bats rely on sonar to pursue and capture flying insects. The bat's prey may emerge from foliage for a brief time, fly in erratic three-dimensional paths before returning to cover. Bats typically take less than one second to detect, localize and capture such insects. We used high speed stereo infra-red videography to study the three dimensional flight paths of the big brown bat, 
					<italic>Eptesicus fuscus,</italic> as it chased erratically moving insects in a dark laboratory flight room. We quantified the bat's complex pursuit trajectories using a simple delay differential equation. Our analysis of the pursuit trajectories suggests that bats use a 
					<italic>constant absolute target direction</italic> strategy during pursuit. We show mathematically that, unlike CB, this approach minimizes the time it takes for a pursuer to intercept an unpredictably moving target. Interestingly, the bat's behavior is similar to the interception strategy implemented in some guided missiles. We suggest that the time-optimal strategy adopted by the bat is in response to the evolutionary pressures of having to capture erratic and fast moving insects.

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Echolocating bats forage on the wing in darkness. Their primary sensory system for hunting in the dark is echolocation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b001">1</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b002">2</xref>]. They emit short pulses of broadband sound, predominantly at ultrasonic frequencies, to derive information from the returning echoes. Bats engage in a natural version of the “homicidal chauffeur” game [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b003">3</xref>], preying upon small, fast, erratically moving insects that may fly in the open only for brief periods at a time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b006">6</xref>]. A bat therefore has a fleeting time window within which to detect, localize, and capture its prey. A complete insect chase from detection to capture typically takes less than one second [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b007">7</xref>]. The short time window available for capturing such highly maneuverable and unpredictable prey would suggest evolutionary pressure for the bat to adopt a pursuit strategy appropriate for its needs. Using high-speed video and audio recordings of the big brown bat 
				<italic>(Eptesicus fuscus)</italic> chasing tethered and free-flying insects in a laboratory flight-room, we show that the echolocating bat uses a previously undescribed pursuit strategy while capturing prey. We argue in this paper that this strategy minimizes time-to-capture of an unpredictably moving insect.
			</p>
      <p>Previous studies of fish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b008">8</xref>], dragonflies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b009">9</xref>], and humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b012">12</xref>] show that a wide variety of animals use a constant bearing (CB) strategy during pursuit. Here, the animal keeps the angle between its heading (velocity vector) and the target a constant as it closes the target range. Additionally, the animal attempts to move in a straight line—a condition that prevents spiral paths about a target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b012">12</xref>]. This strategy, as a means to detect a collision course with another object, has been known anecdotally for hundreds of years to sailors and more recently to airplane pilots and car drivers and is known as “constant bearing, decreasing range.” It was formalized in the 1960s in the human psychology literature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b013">13</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b014">14</xref>]. This research has led to the hypothesis that the CB strategy is widespread because it involves the use of a perceptual invariant—by simply nulling the rate of change in the visual angle to a target, animals can pursue a moving object [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b015">15</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>The CB strategy has been successful in explaining pursuit behavior when the target moves at constant velocity and the pursuer moves at constant speed. Under the condition of constant target velocity a pursuer following a CB strategy intercepts the target by moving along a straight line while holding a fixed target bearing (see

			</p>
      <p>If a pursuer is too slow (
				<italic>v<sub>p</sub> &lt; v<sub>T</sub>
				</italic> sin β), it cannot intercept the target, and there is no solution to 
				<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0040108-e001">Equation 1</xref>. If 
				<italic>v<sub>p</sub> &gt; v<sub>T</sub>
				</italic> sin β, then there are two solutions to 
				<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0040108-e001">Equation 1</xref>, only one of which causes the distance between the pursuer and the target to decrease.
			</p>
      <p>Under the condition of constant target velocity, when a pursuer follows a CB strategy, it intercepts the target in minimum time. We offer a proof of this by contradiction: when holding a CB, the pursuer follows a straight path 
				<italic>X′Z</italic> to intercept the target in time 
				<italic>T</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Suppose there is another path 
				<italic>X′PY</italic> (not necessarily a straight line) that would allow the pursuer to intercept the target in shorter time 
				<italic>T′,</italic> at position 
				<italic>Y</italic>. In that case
			</p>
      <p>
				<disp-formula id="pbio-0040108-e006"><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0040108.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>
			</p>
      <p>a contradiction, implying 
				<italic>X′Z</italic> is the shortest interception path available to the pursuer. This demonstrates that 
				<italic>ϕ,</italic> defined by 
				<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0040108-e001">Equation 1</xref>, is the optimum bearing that leads to interception in minimum time. Hence we will refer to this value as 
				<italic>ϕ<sub>opt</sub>
				</italic> in what follows.
			</p>
      <p>Bats often pursue targets that move unpredictably. The path of such a target may be broken into infinitesimally short linear segments each of constant velocity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). If the pursuer follows an optimum-bearing intercept path for each linear segment, then it minimizes time-to-intercept locally, for the duration of that segment. In general the optimum bearing 
				<italic>ϕ<sub>opt</sub>
				</italic> will vary from segment to segment. If the linear segments are long enough then the animal could still use the CB strategy to converge to the optimum bearing (given by 
				<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0040108-e001">Equation 1</xref>) for each segment. The pursuit will then consist of relatively long periods of CB, interspersed with short periods when the target adopts a new velocity and the pursuer converges to a new CB. A study on dogs catching Frisbees supports this idea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b016">16</xref>]. If the target motion is sufficiently erratic, however, an animal attempting to execute the CB strategy will never converge to the optimum bearing for any segment.
			</p>
      <p>In the case of an erratically moving target, a pursuer can maintain an optimum bearing using a different strategy. The velocities of the target and pursuer may be decomposed into two components, one parallel to the line joining them (e.g., along 
				<italic>U′U,</italic>
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) and one perpendicular to this line (transverse component). When an animal maintains optimum bearing, the transverse component of the velocities of the pursuer and target are matched. This means that the absolute direction to the target (the direction of the line 
				<italic>U′U,</italic> also described by the angle 
				<italic>α</italic>) remains constant. If the pursuer follows a constant absolute target direction (CATD) strategy where it maneuvers to minimize changes in the absolute direction to the target, the pursuer can maintain the optimum bearing for each instant of the pursuit. The pursuer can follow this strategy by adjusting both its direction of motion and its speed, ensuring 
				<italic>v<sub>p</sub> &gt; v<sub>T</sub>
				</italic> sin β as mentioned previously.
			</p>
      <p>In this study we investigated whether the pursuit of erratically moving insects by 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. fuscus</named-content> is best described as CB (as reported in many other animals) or whether the bat uses a CATD strategy to meet its behavioral requirements. Our results indicate that

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>We trained eight bats to fly in a large, dark, instrumented flight room and capture both tethered and free-flying insect prey. The bat and insect prey were recorded using two high speed infrared video cameras. The flight paths of the bat and its prey were reconstructed from the stereo video frames. Simultaneously, a custom built, U-shaped array of 16 microphones recorded horizontal cross-sections of the sonar beam pattern emitted by the bats. 
				<named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. fuscus</named-content> emits echolocation cries through the open mouth, so the axis of the sonar beam is aligned with the axis of the head. These measurements, therefore, allowed us to compute the horizontal direction of the bat's head as it chased its prey [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b017">17</xref>]. The bat was allowed to fly in the room for a random period of time (10–30 s), after which the insect prey was released into the room. Each bat was tested individually as it chased a single prey item presented in the room. A trial consisted of the release of the insect and the first attempt by the bat to capture it.

				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows that the bat's head is stabilized in space when it converges to the CATD strategy. The bat head direction is computed from the recorded sonar beam patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b017">17</xref>]. The bat locks its head onto its target during the high repetition rate stage of insect pursuit. This lock is maintained throughout the interception maneuver. This can be seen by inspection in 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and quantitatively in 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). From 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g003">Figure 3</xref>B it can be seen that when the bat converges to the optimum direction, it also converges to the CATD strategy (the absolute direction of the target remains constant, appearing as a flat line in 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g003">Figure 3</xref>B) even though its direction of flight keeps changing. Since the bat's head is locked to the target, the absolute direction of the head (black dots) remains constant during this phase of the pursuit. We use this observation to propose, in the discussion section, a biologically plausible mechanism by way of which the bat can achieve the computations required by the CATD strategy.

				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g004">4</xref>B). So in the vertical plane, the bat may not be trying to match up with the target until it gets very close.

      <p>These results show that the bat maneuvers to approach the instantaneous optimal bearing even when the target is moving erratically. In the horizontal plane the bat prefers to keep the absolute direction to the target (
				<italic>α</italic>), rather than the target bearing (
				<italic>ϕ</italic>), a constant. Thus the bat, unlike a variety of other animal species, does not use a CB strategy while following its prey. We propose that bats follow a CATD strategy. The bat adjusts its direction of flight and its speed of pursuit so as to maintain the 
				<italic>absolute</italic> direction to the target a constant during pursuit.

      <p>When the bat converges to (and maintains) the optimal bearing, the absolute direction to the target does not change. The CATD strategy produces a trajectory which, from the viewpoint of the target, makes the pursuer “appear” stationary against a distant background, and vice-versa. Such trajectories have been observed in the flights of male dragonflies engaged in territorial interactions and have been interpreted as camouflaging behavior on the part of the pursuing male [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b020">20</xref>]. Because motion camouflage is primarily useful for defeating visual detection and the bat reveals its presence and direction with the sonar vocalization, the CATD strategy is unlikely to be employed for camouflage. In ongoing work, we are interested in obtaining a sensorimotor feedback law for implementing the CATD strategy, and a recent paper deriving a feedback law for motion camouflage may serve as a useful guide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b021">21</xref>]. In the field of missile guidance, the CATD strategy is referred to as parallel navigation. Specific guidance laws to achieve parallel navigation have been developed since the 1940s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b022">22</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b023">23</xref>]. It appears that a common constraint—the need to intercept unpredictably moving targets as quickly as possible—has driven both engineers and nature to adopt the same strategy.
			</p>
      <p>We propose a simple mechanism that does not require the bat to explicitly compute the quantities in 
				<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0040108-e001">Equation 1</xref> in order to maintain CATD during pursuit. We have shown in an earlier study that the bat locks its head onto a target while chasing it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b017">17</xref>]. When the bat converges to a CATD strategy, the absolute direction of the bat's head in space is held constant, independent of the orientation of the body and the bat's velocity vector (see 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g003">Figure 3</xref> for an illustration). The bat could, therefore, maintain CATD by maneuvering to null any changes in head 
				<italic>direction</italic> as sensed by its vestibular system. Because the bat can obtain an accurate estimate of target range through its echolocation system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b024">24</xref>], it would also sense whether it is approaching the target while holding absolute target direction constant. Alternative mechanisms for following a CATD strategy may involve nulling the apparent motion of the acoustic background, assuming the background sources of noise are distant compared with the target. An interesting possibility is the cross-modal integration of the visual background with the auditory foreground: the bat could follow a CATD strategy by maneuvering such that silhouettes of foliage against the night sky, or the positions of the moon or bright stars (any distant, high contrast object) appear stationary with respect to the acoustically derived position of the target. Some previous modeling studies of bat pursuit behavior have suggested that bats can successfully capture insects using a nonpredictive strategy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b025">25</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b026">26</xref>], whereas another modeling study has proposed that bats use an internal model of target motion to predictively pursue an insect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b027">27</xref>]. Our experimental results show that the bat uses a functionally predictive strategy (CATD). The mechanism proposed here, however, allows the bat to implement this functionally predictive strategy without recourse to an internal model of target motion.
			</p>
      <p>From the experiments, we observe that the bat maneuvers to reduce 
				<italic>ϕ<sub>e</sub>
				</italic>, the deviation from the optimum direction. We model the experimentally observed data using a delay-differential equation (
				<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0040108-e005">Equation 5</xref>). In constructing this model we compared linearity between 
				<italic>dϕ<sub>e</sub>/dt
				</italic> and 
				<italic>ϕ<sub>e</sub>
				</italic> and 
				<italic>ϕ<sub>e</sub>
				</italic> over a range of delays in steps of 4.2 ms (the interval between the video frames) and found that a delay of 
				<italic>τ</italic> = 120 ms produced the best fit (see 
				<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g005">Figure 5</xref>). We hypothesize that this time delay is a combination of physical and biological time delays. Such time delays include 
				<italic>τ<sub>echo</sub>
				</italic> (the time delay between the emission and reception of the echo), 
				<italic>τ<sub>auditory</sub>
				</italic> (the time delay incurred in the central nervous system to process sensory input) and 
				<italic>τ<sub>motor</sub>
				</italic> (the delay due to pre-motor processing and due to the dynamics of the muscular and skeletal system coupled to the aerodynamics). Of these delay components 
				<italic>τ<sub>echo</sub>
				</italic> is the easiest to estimate: the maximum prey distance is about 2 m, leading to 
				<italic>τ<sub>echo</sub>
				</italic> ≤ 12 ms under room conditions. It is harder to obtain estimates for the other delays. Neural response latencies to echo stimuli in the bat midbrain can be less than 4 ms and greater than 20 ms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b028">28</xref>,
				<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b029">29</xref>]. A conservative estimate of 
				<italic>τ<sub>auditory</sub> =
				</italic> 20 ms, therefore, still leaves a major portion of the delay (about 90 ms or 75%) to be taken up by 
				<italic>τ<sub>motor</sub>
				</italic>. In this context, bat head movements with a latency of 100 ms are obtained from microstimulation of the bat superior colliculus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b030">30</xref>] (a midbrain structure implicated in orienting behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b031">31</xref>]). Interestingly, the overall delay of 120 ms that is obtained from our study of bat flight maneuvers is comparable to the latency of 100 ms obtained for human express saccades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b032">32</xref>].
			</p>
      <p>Since the bat could perform the computations for the CATD strategy by maneuvering to null rotational movements of the head, the bat could link its vestibular system to appropriate flight musculature via a “vestibulo-pursuit reflex,” much like the vestibulocollic reflex. Whereas the traditional vestibulocollic reflex serves to stabilize the head direction when the body posture changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b033">33</xref>], the proposed vestibulo-pursuit reflex would serve to stabilize the head direction by appropriately changing the bat's flight direction, enabling the bat to use its brainstem to perform the required CATD computations, using cortical input to modulate the computations over longer timescales.
			</p>
      <p>The bat's strategy is equivalent to following an intercept course to the target at every instant of time, assuming the target will continue moving at its current velocity. The CATD strategy has the important near-optimality property that under a piecewise linear approximation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) it minimizes time-to-intercept of unpredictably moving targets.

      <p>We used big brown bats 
				<italic>(E. fuscus)</italic> to study sonar guided flight. The sonar pulses produced by these bats are 2–20 ms long, and consist of multiple harmonics with the fundamental sweeping from approximately 60 kHz down to 22 kHz [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b034">34</xref>]. The bats change their pulse production rate (PPR) with behavioral state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b001">1</xref>]. When searching for prey the PPR is low (2–10 Hz), but as the bat detects and then approaches prey, the PPR rises, terminating in the attack phase (“terminal buzz” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b001">1</xref>]) where the PPR may be as high as 200 Hz. We trained eight bats to fly in a large (L7.3 m × W6.4 m × H2.5 m) laboratory room (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040108-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The room walls and ceiling were lined with sound-absorbent foam to reduce reverberations. The room was illuminated by dim, long wavelength light (&gt;650 nm, light from normal incandescent bulbs filtered through a filter plate: Plexiglas G #2711, Atofina Chemicals, Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, United States) to which the bat is insensitive [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b035">35</xref>]. Images from two high-speed video cameras (Kodak MotionCorder, CCD-based cameras, running at 240 frames/s, synchronized to 1/2 frame accuracy) (Eastman Kodak, Rochester, New York, United States) were used to reconstruct the three-dimensional flight path of the bats and the trajectory of the prey. The reconstruction was done using commercially available motion analysis software (Motus, Peak Performance Technologies, Englewood, Colorado). Simultaneously, a custom built, U-shaped array of 16 microphones recorded horizontal cross-sections of the sonar beam pattern emitted by the bats. Big brown bats emit their echolocation cries through the open mouth, so the axis of the sonar beam is aligned with the axis of the head. These measurements, therefore, allow us to compute the horizontal direction of the bat's head [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040108-b017">17</xref>].

      <p>The bats were trained to catch both free flying and tethered insects. Each bat was tested individually as it chased a single prey presented in the room. The free flying insects were a species of praying mantis 
				<italic>(Parasphendale agrionina)</italic>. The mantis was released by hand as the bat was flying around in the room. The mantises had their ears plugged with Vaseline to suppress ultrasound-triggered diving behavior. The mantises made erratic flight maneuvers after release into the room. The tethered insects were inch-long mealworms tethered by a length of monofilament fiber. The tethered insects were concealed in a trapdoor mechanism that was placed at random positions on the ceiling. The bat was allowed to fly in the room for a period of time (10–30 s) after which the prey was released from the trapdoor. The tethered insect was moved in sections of an arc after release by activating a motorized boom attached to the trapdoor assembly. Each bat was tested individually as it chased a single prey presented in the room. A trial consisted of the release of the insect and the first attempt by the bat to capture it.
