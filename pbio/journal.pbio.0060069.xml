        <p>Clock output pathways are central to convey timing information from the circadian clock to a diversity of physiological systems, ranging from cell-autonomous processes to behavior. While the molecular mechanisms that generate and sustain rhythmicity at the cellular level are well understood, it is unclear how this information is further structured to control specific behavioral outputs. Rhythmic release of pigment dispersing factor (PDF) has been proposed to propagate the time of day information from core pacemaker cells to downstream targets underlying rhythmic locomotor activity. Indeed, such circadian changes in PDF intensity represent the only known mechanism through which the PDF circuit could communicate with its output. Here we describe a novel circadian phenomenon involving extensive remodeling in the axonal terminals of the PDF circuit, which display higher complexity during the day and significantly lower complexity at nighttime, both under daily cycles and constant conditions. In support to its circadian nature, cycling is lost in bona fide clockless mutants. We propose this clock-controlled structural plasticity as a candidate mechanism contributing to the transmission of the information downstream of pacemaker cells.</p>

          <p>Circadian systems evolved as a mechanism that allows organisms to adapt to the environmental changes in light and dark which occur as a consequence of the rotation of Earth. Because of its unique repertoire of genetic tools, <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a well established model for the study of the circadian clock. Although the biochemical components underlying the molecular oscillations have been characterized in detail, the mechanisms used by the clock neurons to convey information to the downstream pathways remain elusive. In the fruit fly, the small ventral lateral neurons (LNv) are capable of synchronizing other clock cells relying on a neuropeptide named pigment dispersing factor. In this work we introduce a novel mechanism as a possible candidate for contributing to the transmission of information downstream of the small LNvs, involving clock-controlled remodeling of their axonal morphology. By labeling the entire neuronal membrane and analyzing the complexity of the axonal arbor at different times we showed that there is a circadian variation in the complexity of the axonal arbor. This phenomenon was not observed in flies carrying null mutations in two canonical clock genes, underscoring the dependence of the circadian clock for the structural plasticity of its pacemaker neurons.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Many organisms display daily rest–activity cycles, which are reminiscent of the sleep–wake cycles observed in humans. This rhythmic activity is sustained even in the absence of environmental light-dark cues, revealing its endogenous origin. Along the years, many of the components of the circadian clock responsible for generating and sustaining molecular rhythmicity have been identified and characterized in different model systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b002">2</xref>], but only recently a picture of how molecular rhythms operating at a single cell level are translated to overt rhythmic behavior is beginning to unfold in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
      <p>Rhythmic locomotor behavior in flies depends on an intact molecular oscillator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b003">3</xref>] operating within the circadian circuitry, which is comprised by three major neuronal clusters (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b005">5</xref>]). The small ventral lateral neurons (LNv) are at the top of the hierarchy because they command not only the pace of most of the remaining clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b006">6</xref>], but also direct rhythmic behavior in the absence of any other brain oscillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b007">7</xref>] or by themselves in a clockless mutant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b008">8</xref>]. The small LNvs send their projections towards the dorsal protocerebrum where some of the dorsal clusters are located [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b010">10</xref>], and release a neuropeptide known as pigment dispersing factor (PDF) in a circadian fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b011">11</xref>]. Supporting its link to clock-controlled locomotor behavior, <italic>pdf</italic> levels are affected in arrhythmic bona fide clock mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b013">13</xref>]. Moreover, PDF itself has been considered crucial in sustaining behavioral oscillations, after a thorough analysis of the effect of altering <italic>pdf</italic> levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b015">15</xref>] and its role in the synchronization between the different brain oscillators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b017">17</xref>], some of which have recently been shown to express PDF receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b020">20</xref>]. PDF levels in the dorsal protocerebrum change throughout the day likely not as the result of posttranslational peptide processing or transport per se but as a consequence of differential release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b011">11</xref>]. However, recent data suggests that PDF cycling in dorsal protocerebrum is not necessary for the maintenance of rhythmic behavior in DD, since overexpression of a fusion protein between the rat atrial natriuretic factor and the green fluorescent protein (GFP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b021">21</xref>] collapses the oscillation in PDF levels (measured as signal intensity) while behavioral rhythmicity is largely unaffected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b022">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>In experiments involving PDF staining at different times during a daily cycle we noticed that the arborizations of the small LNv dorsal projections changed between early morning and early night to a higher degree than that anticipated simply by the variation in PDF intensity. To characterize in depth these daily changes in the PDF circuit, a membrane-bound fluorescent reporter was used to mark the entire structure. Here we demonstrate that the circuit underlying rhythmic behavior undergoes cyclic changes in the topology of its dorsal termini under synchronizing light-dark cycles and even in the absence of environmental cues, underscoring its connection with the endogenous biological clock. Moreover, this daily variation in circuit structure is abolished in arrhythmic clock mutants (such as <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> and <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic>), further supporting its circadian nature. We propose that circadian remodeling of the PDF circuit reveals an additional layer of clock control towards the consolidation of rhythmic rest-activity cycles.</p>

        <title>Daily Changes in the Circuit Underlying Rhythmic Rest–Activity Cycles</title>
        <p>Rhythmic locomotor behavior heavily relies on the concerted action of the small LNvs. These PDF-expressing neurons extend their projections dorsally towards the protocerebrum forming an axonal stem, which halfway through its trajectory shifts towards the center of the brain and opens up into a 2-D axonal arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figures 1</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060069-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Expression of synaptobrevin-GFP (a presynaptic marker) supports the notion that these arborizations are axonal projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>G) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b023">23</xref>].</p>

        <p>PDF intensity levels cycle within the dorsal protocerebrum (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, left panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b011">11</xref>], but whether this cycling results in a modulation of its postsynaptic response has yet to be established; interestingly, dense-core vesicles reactive to a PDF-like peptide have been described in the dorsal protocerebrum of <italic>Musca</italic> and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b024">24</xref>], suggesting that their accumulation and release could be under clock control, as it appears to be the case for the dense-core vesicles found in the lamina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b025">25</xref>]. While characterizing these PDF changes at the dorsal protocerebrum in greater detail we noticed that the PDF signal displayed a distinct configuration at different times in the day, which could not be simply attributed to the circadian control of PDF levels. We speculated that this observation could also result from plastic changes in the anatomical properties of the axons themselves. In fact, daily and circadian changes in morphological features of the axonal projections have been reported in other circuits, although none of them has a clear connection with a specific physiological output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b028">28</xref>].</p>
        <p>In an attempt to characterize in depth daily changes in the PDF circuit, a transgenic line expressing a highly stable, membrane-tethered version of the GFP (mCD8-GFP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b029">29</xref>]) under the <italic>pdf</italic> specific promoter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b014">14</xref>] was used. Thus, mCD8-GFP recreates the entire PDF circuit, that is, the small and large LNvs somatas as well as their axonal and dendritic projections. By using a stable reporter as opposed to the neuropeptide itself should ensure that any observed variations in circuit morphology could not be attributed to its expression, post-translational processing or transport. Transgenic <italic>pdf-gal4;</italic> UAS-mCD8-GFP flies (from now on referred to as <italic>pdf</italic> &gt;mCD8-GFP) were synchronized to 12 h light: 12 h dark cycles to entrain their molecular oscillators. Young (0–3 d old) adult brains fixed at <italic>zeitgeber time</italic> (ZT) 2 and 14 (ZT2 and ZT14 indicate 2 h after lights ON and light OFF, respectively) were stained with anti-PDF and anti-GFP antibodies. These time-points were selected as they represent the peak and the trough of PDF intensity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b011">11</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>B shows representative images of each condition in a wild-type background. Not only did the PDF-associated signal change during early morning and early night (compare ZT2 to ZT14, left panel) but also and most strikingly, the circuit itself, revealed through GFP staining, underwent these daily fluctuations at the level of the dorsal projections. In the early morning, it showed a higher degree of arborization, including both more numerous and likely higher order axonal processes. In contrast, at nighttime, the circuit adopted a closed conformation, where fewer branches could be distinguished. A magnified view of these projections stained with the avidin-biotin complex method is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>C.</p>
        <p>The degree of axonal arborization was quantified by using an adaptation of Sholl's method to study the dendritic branching pattern [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b030">30</xref>]. As depicted in the cartoon in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>D the number of intersections between the concentric rings and the projections were determined. Representative images illustrating how the intersections were visualized and quantitated are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060069-sg002">Figure S2</xref>A. A significant difference in the axonal morphology was observed (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, non parametric Mann-Whitney test), whereby at nighttime there was a decrease in the complexity of the axonal arbor of the PDF circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>E), represented by fewer intersections. Noteworthy, when presynaptic structures were visualized using a synaptobrevin-GFP fusion protein, a differential pattern of vesicle distribution was observed, suggesting the possibility that the activity is concomitantly changing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>G and unpublished data). One possible scenario to account for this observation is that synaptic contacts are remodeled as a function of time of day, or alternatively, that the PDF terminals contact different targets at different times. At present we cannot exclude either possibility.</p>

        <title>Plastic Changes in the Circuit Underlying Rhythmic Behavior Have an Endogenous Origin</title>
        <p>Daily changes in axonal morphology could merely be the direct response to a changing environment, as opposed to be regulated by an endogenous mechanism. To determine whether this structural plasticity was under the control of the endogenous biological clock whole mount adult brains from flies kept under constant darkness (DD) were fixed and dissected at circadian time (CT) 2 and 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) during the second day after transfer to constant conditions (DD2). Under these conditions, a significant decrease in the total number of axonal crosses in brains examined during subjective night was found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g002">Figure 2</xref>C), when compared to those fixed during subjective day, consistent with a role of the circadian clock controlling axonal plasticity under both 12 h light/dark (LD) and DD conditions.</p>

        <p>This decreased scoring for the nighttime configuration suggests a reduced overall complexity of the PDF axonal arbor at subjective night. This, in turn, could either result from a reduced number of higher order projections rendering a less branched arbor of similar length, or from projections with a decreased length, giving rise to an arbor of similar complexity but shorter branches (see a schematic representation of possible mechanisms in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060069-sg002">Figure S2</xref>B). To distinguish between these possibilities the number of projections representative of each segment (rings 1 through 6 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figures 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060069-sg002">S2</xref>A) were compared, and significant differences were observed along the entire region both in LD and DD, with the exception of the most proximal section (ring 1), supporting the notion that the reported remodeling is unlikely the result of circadian extension/retraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figures 1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g002">2</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Helfrich-Forster described how the PDF-associated signal along the midline slowly disappears right after eclosion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b031">31</xref>]. Our experiments showed that not only did the neuropeptide signal decrease as the fly matured but also the GFP signal did, underscoring that this decrease most likely reflects a complete retraction of the PDF circuit itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060069-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). To discard a possible contribution of developmental changes to the cycling observed in circuit morphology at the dorsal protocerebrum 45 flies eclosed within a narrow 15 h-window kept under LD cycles were dissected at ZT2 and ZT14 during three consecutive days. Thus, flies dissected at ZT2 in the second or third day were older than those dissected the night before (at ZT14). When the analysis described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>D was performed, brains taken during the day displayed the characteristic open conformation, similar to that shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, upper panel, thus precluding the possibility that the changes in morphology followed a developmental program (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To explore whether such circadian changes persisted into adulthood, six and 12 day-old flies were analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). These timepoints were selected as they span a regular behavioral experiment. Interestingly, significant remodeling was observed even in older flies, reinforcing its relevance. No sexual dimorphism was found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060069-sg004">Figures S4</xref>A–B), although a higher inter individual variability was observed in female flies.</p>

        <title>A Functional Clock Is Required for Circadian Structural Plasticity</title>
        <p>Since this phenomenon was observed in the absence of direct effect of light on behavioral and molecular processes, we sought to determine the impact of the absence of a functional clock on the structure of the PDF circuit. Previous reports had described that both mutations affected the cycling in PDF intensity albeit to a different fashion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b011">11</xref>]. <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> mutants displayed constitutively low PDF immunoreactivity, meanwhile <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> mutants showed constantly high PDF signal. We introduced the <italic>pdf</italic> &gt;mCD8-GFP transgenes into the <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> and <italic>tim<sup>01</sup></italic> mutant background and quantified the number of branches during early morning and night (ZT2 and ZT14, respectively); given the lack of a functional clock any differences would be attributed to the environmental condition. No significant difference between ZT2 and ZT14 was found in either mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g003">Figures 3</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060069-g003">3</xref>C), further strengthening the involvement of the circadian clock in this process. The lack of rhythmicity could derive from different scenarios. Either the morphology of the dorsal projections in a mutant background would represent a given time point seen in wild-type brains (as interpreted for PDF staining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b011">11</xref>]), or, alternatively, the PDF circuit could display a unique conformation never present in wild-type flies, suggesting these genes could be playing additional roles to those ascribed to core clock function. Consistent with our observations, Cantera and colleagues have recently reported that branching of a motor neuron is severely affected in the absence of these clock proteins, whereby in <italic>per<sup>01</sup></italic> flies a reduced branching was observed, in stark contrast to the hyper branching characteristic of different <italic>tim</italic> null alleles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b028">28</xref>].</p>

        <p>Examples of structural plasticity have been reported along the years, such as the light-dependent changes in the axon terminals of bipolar cells in the rat retina [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b032">32</xref>] or the synaptic activity-dependent changes in the morphology of dendritic spines in cultured hippocampal neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b033">33</xref>]. Recently, Pyza and colleagues reported daily changes in the properties of the L1 and L2 interneurons of the visual system of the house fly and in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b027">27</xref>]; interestingly, they showed a circadian oscillation in the size and spacing of the varicosities (alleged sites of peptide release) from the LNvs into the fly eye. These changes were proposed to convey circadian information out from the large LNvs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b025">25</xref>].</p>
        <p>Here we describe circadian changes in the structure of the circuit underlying rest-activity cycles in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Such changes could result in differential activity within the circuit, fine-tuning the connection between the PDF circuit and its postsynaptic targets, or even reaching different targets along the day. Moreover, since PDF is responsible for synchronizing distinct clusters within the circadian network, this phenomenon could also impinge on the neuronal coupling between clock cells.</p>
        <p>Although the underlying molecular mechanisms sustaining the circadian changes in structural plasticity are not understood, alternative scenarios are envisioned. Differences in the complexity of the axonal arbor could reveal a continuous neurite addition and retraction, reminiscent of that responsible of refining the connection between the retinal ganglion cell axons as they project into the optic tectum [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b034">34</xref>] which has been shown to be based on correlated activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b035">35</xref>]. Alternatively, this phenomenon could uncover a dynamic fasciculation/defasciculation process. In clear favor of such possibility is the observation that a number of cell adhesion molecules are under circadian regulation (as reported by microarray analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b037">37</xref>]). The contribution of the cyclical accumulation and release of PDF containing vesicles to this phenomenon cannot be excluded.</p>
        <p>Given the fundamental role of the establishment of the proper synaptic connections in any functional neuronal network, the ability of a certain neuron to reach its targets in a spatially and temporally regulated manner relies on a highly orchestrated set of processes. The hierarchical organization of the circadian network is one of the most thoroughly characterized in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b038">38</xref>]. The transmission of information from pacemaker cells, those that occupy the highest level within this hierarchy, is crucial for structuring the downstream rhythmic rest-activity cycles.</p>
        <p>It has been shown that altering PDF expression in pacemaker cells or their electrical activity interferes with their proper output [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060069-b041">41</xref>]. In this work we introduce a plastic change in the morphology of the PDF circuit as a candidate novel mechanism for transmitting clock information on a time-dependent manner: most likely, a circadian regulated variation in the establishment of synapses between pacemaker cells and their post synaptic targets.</p>

          <p>(B) Alternative scenarios accounting for the structural plasticity observed in the dorsal protocerebrum. The differential complexity in the axonal arborizations of the PDF circuit during the day and night, reflected in fewer intersections in the latter, could derive from either higher order branches growing during the early day and disappearing later at night (additional branches), the lengthening and shortening of the more distal projections (retraction), or by controlling the degree of fasciculation of the major axonal processes (fasciculation), making it impossible to distinguish individual neurites at night (and thus retrieving a lower count). Although a clear picture has yet to emerge, we favor the notion of clock-controlled fasciculation (see text).</p>

The disappearance of both signals as flies aged (bottom panels) reveals that the absence of PDF signal in older flies could derive from pruning of these axons.
