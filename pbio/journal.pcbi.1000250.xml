                <p>Although it is known that mechanical forces are needed for normal bone
                    development, the current understanding of how biophysical stimuli are
                    interpreted by and integrated with genetic regulatory mechanisms is limited.
                    Mechanical forces are thought to be mediated in cells by
                    “mechanosensitive” genes, but it is a challenge to
                    demonstrate that the genetic regulation of the biological system is dependant on
                    particular mechanical forces in vivo. We propose a new means of selecting
                    candidate mechanosensitive genes by comparing in vivo gene expression patterns
                    with patterns of biophysical stimuli, computed using finite element analysis. In
                    this study, finite element analyses of the avian embryonic limb were performed
                    using anatomically realistic rudiment and muscle morphologies, and patterns of
                    biophysical stimuli were compared with the expression patterns of four candidate
                    mechanosensitive genes integral to bone development. The expression patterns of
                    two genes, Collagen X (ColX) and Indian hedgehog (Ihh), were shown to colocalise
                    with biophysical stimuli induced by embryonic muscle contractions, identifying
                    them as potentially being involved in the mechanoregulation of bone formation.
                    An altered mechanical environment was induced in the embryonic chick, where a
                    neuromuscular blocking agent was administered in ovo to modify skeletal muscle
                    contractions. Finite element analyses predicted dramatic changes in levels and
                    patterns of biophysical stimuli, and a number of immobilised specimens exhibited
                    differences in ColX and Ihh expression. The results obtained indicate that
                    computationally derived patterns of biophysical stimuli can be used to inform a
                    directed search for genes that may play a mechanoregulatory role in particular
                    in vivo events or processes. Furthermore, the experimental data demonstrate that
                    ColX and Ihh are involved in mechanoregulatory pathways and may be key mediators
                    in translating information from the mechanical environment to the molecular
                    regulation of bone formation in the embryo.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>While mechanical forces are known to be critical to adult bone maintenance and
                    repair, the importance of mechanobiology in embryonic bone formation is less
                    widely accepted. The influence of mechanical forces on cells is thought to be
                    mediated by “mechanosensitive genes,” genes which respond to
                    mechanical stimulation. In this research, we examined the situation in the
                    developing embryo. Using finite element analysis, we simulated the biophysical
                    stimuli in the developing bone resulting from spontaneous muscle contractions,
                    incorporating detailed morphology of the developing chick limb. We compared
                    patterns of stimuli with expression patterns of a number of genes involved in
                    bone formation and demonstrated a clear colocalisation in the case of two genes
                    (Ihh and ColX). We then altered the mechanical environment of the growing chick
                    embryo by blocking muscle contractions and demonstrated changes in the
                    magnitudes and patterns of biophysical stimuli and in the expression patterns of
                    both Ihh and ColX. We have demonstrated the value of combining computational
                    techniques with in vivo gene expression analysis to identify genes that may play
                    a mechanoregulatory role and have identified genes that respond to mechanical
                    stimulation during bone formation in vivo.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>It is widely accepted that there is a relationship between the morphology of skeletal
                structures and the mechanical forces acting upon them. Such a relationship begins in
                the embryo where the importance of muscle for normal bone formation has been clearly
                demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Rodriguez1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Pitsillides1">[2]</xref>; however, it is
                still not understood how biophysical stimuli are interpreted and integrated with the
                genetic regulatory mechanisms guiding bone development. Presumably gene activity
                within the skeletal tissues is influenced by mechanical stimulation but there is
                very limited information on how this might occur in the embryo. Up- and
                down-regulation of gene expression due to mechanical stimulation has been
                demonstrated under certain cell culture conditions, and these genes have been called
                mechanosensitive genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Rubin1">[3]</xref>. Most experiments revealing mechanosensitivity
                have placed cells under mechanical stimulation in culture and subsequently performed
                analyses to quantitatively compare the expression of many genes between stimulated
                and control cells, for example using microarray analysis (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Cillo1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Jackson1">[5]</xref>). Using
                such an approach, hundreds of potential mechanosensitive genes can be identified
                simultaneously; however, these experiments do not demonstrate the mechanosensitivity
                of a gene in an in vivo context. To establish that a gene plays a mechanoregulatory
                role during a particular process it is necessary to examine the sensitivity of the
                gene to mechanical stimulation in vivo.</p>
            <p>It is, however, more challenging to examine candidate genes in an in vivo context. To
                date, the study of Kavanagh et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Kavanagh1">[6]</xref> is unique in
                demonstrating a mechanoregulatory role for a gene during embryonic development in
                vivo by altering the mechanical environment. These authors examined the expression
                patterns of three signalling molecules which are implicated in regulating joint
                formation; growth and differentiation factor 5 (GDF-5), fibroblast growth factor-2
                (FGF-2) and FGF-4 in control and immobilised chick embryonic hindlimbs and showed
                that joint line FGF-2 expression was diminished in immobilised limbs, while the
                expression of the other two genes in the joint line was unaffected. They concluded
                that FGF-2 has a direct mechanoregulatory role in the cavitation process. Another
                approach has been to use computational modelling to identify candidate
                mechanosensitive genes, where regions predicted to be under high mechanical
                stimulation are correlated with the expression of certain genes. Henderson et al.
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Henderson1">[7]</xref>
                used a 2-D finite element model to predict patterns of growth-related stresses and
                strains generated during the growth of a skeletal condensation for comparison with
                in vivo expression patterns of “chondrogenic genes” and
                “osteogenic genes”. By comparing patterns of biophysical stimuli
                with gene expression data from transverse sections, they proposed that predicted
                patterns of pressure correspond with expression patterns of chondrogenic genes and
                that predicted patterns of strain correspond with patterns of osteogenic genes.
                Their model focussed exclusively on growth related biophysical stimuli and did not,
                therefore, examine the effect of embryonic muscle contractions.</p>
            <p>Considering embryonic bone formation specifically, a number of genes involved in key
                steps have been identified as mechanosensitive in in vitro cell culture assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Rubin1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Ehrlich1">[8]</xref>. These
                include genes encoding Collagen X (ColX), Fibroblast Growth Factor receptor2
                (FGFr2), Indian hedgehog (Ihh) and Parathyroid hormone-related protein (PTHrP). ColX
                encodes a structural protein synthesised by hypertrophic chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Kielty1">[9]</xref> that has
                been identified as playing a role in matrix mineralization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Kwan1">[10]</xref>, and was shown to be
                upregulated in in vitro cultures of bovine chondrocytes under cyclic tension and
                cyclic hydrostatic pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Wong1">[11]</xref> and in ex vivo mechanical stimulation of neonatal
                rabbit distal femoral condyle explants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Sundaramurthy1">[12]</xref>. FGFr2 is a
                positive regulator of chondrocyte proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Eswarakumar1">[13]</xref>, and has been
                shown to be downregulated following in vitro four point bending of MC3T3-E1
                preosteoblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Jackson1">[5]</xref> and upregulated in in vitro mechanical stimulation
                of bone marrow stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Li1">[14]</xref>. Ihh is also a positive regulator of
                proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-StJacques1">[15]</xref>, and controls the onset of chondrocyte
                hypertrophy primarily via PTHrP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Lanske1">[16]</xref>. Ihh signalling from the proliferative region is
                necessary to induce the differentiation of the perichondrium into an osteogenic
                tissue from which the first osteoblasts will differentiate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-StJacques1">[15]</xref>. PTHrP signalling
                has been shown to negatively regulate the switch from a proliferative immature
                chondrocyte to a post-proliferative mature hypertrophic chondrocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Weir1">[17]</xref>. Ihh and
                PTHrP have been shown to be upregulated by mechanical stimulation; Ihh and PTHrP in
                in vivo mechanical stimulation of rat mandibular condyles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Ng1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Ng2">[19]</xref>, Ihh in in vitro cyclic
                mechanical stimulation of embryonic chick chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Wu1">[20]</xref> and PTHrP in in vitro
                cyclic mechanical stimulation of rat growth plate chondrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Tanaka1">[21]</xref>.</p>
            <p>In this paper, we hypothesise that mechanical forces influence embryonic bone
                formation by regulating expression of mechanosensitive genes. To test this
                hypothesis, the involvement of four genes in transducing mechanical information from
                spontaneous muscle contractions during ossification was assessed; these are ColX,
                FGFr2, Ihh and PTHrP. The genes were selected for this study based on their
                importance for bone formation and evidence of their mechanosensitivity in vitro.
                Using a novel approach, the potential in vivo mechanosensitivity of these genes is
                initially assessed using computationally derived data on the biophysical
                environment. The candidate genes were first examined by correlating their expression
                patterns with patterns of biophysical stimuli across stages of development when
                ossification begins. We carried out a detailed analysis of expression of the 4
                candidate genes and, by using the results of finite element analyses based on 3-D
                rudiment morphologies and realistic muscle loading schemes described in a previous
                paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Nowlan1">[22]</xref>, we could compare the complex and time-dependant
                patterns of biophysical stimuli induced by embryonic muscle contractions with gene
                expression patterns at several timepoints. To corroborate the correlations found,
                the direct response of both the genes and the patterns of biophysical stimuli to a
                perturbation in the mechanical environment in vivo were examined. If genes whose
                expression patterns could be shown to have altered expression patterns in a
                perturbed mechanical environment, then this would provide strong evidence that genes
                mediate a genetic regulation of the response to mechanical information during
                embryonic bone formation.</p>

                <p>As described in detail in Nowlan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Nowlan1">[22]</xref> a set of finite
                    element analyses of embryonic chick hindlimb skeletal rudiments were created for
                    stages HH30, HH32 and HH34. At HH30 and HH32, the rudiments contain cartilage
                    only, while the periosteal bone collar is present at the mid-diaphysis at HH34.
                    Anatomically accurate rudiment and muscle morphologies were obtained for each
                    stage using Optical Projection Tomography (OPT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Sharpe1">[27]</xref>, and two animals at
                    each stage were analysed to ensure results were stage dependant rather than
                    animal-specific. In order to characterise the biophysical environment in the
                    absence of skeletal muscle contractions, simulations of the immobilised state
                    were carried out and compared with the previously published patterns.

                    muscles in extension, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The magnitude of the force per unit area value was also
                    adjusted in the paralysis simulations. From the study of Reiser et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Reiser1">[29]</xref>,
                    who reported the tension development in twitch and tetanic responses in normal
                    and immobilised chick embryos, we deduced that the tetanic force response from
                    the muscles in the immobilised chicks would be 75% of the twitch
                    response in normal embryos. We therefore adjusted the magnitude of each of the
                    muscle loads to 75% of the previously applied value.</p>

                        chondrocytes in the internal cartilage of the tibiotarsal rudiments, and
                        also in the perichondrium and periosteum (where present) at all three stages

                        2B–D</xref>). Expression in the hypertrophic region at stages HH30
                        and HH32 appeared as a band of increasing length at the mid-diaphysis. At
                        stage HH34, expression in the hypertrophic zone extended further proximal
                        and distal to the mid-diaphysis. On close examination in the hypertrophic
                        zones at HH32 and HH34 the staining for ColX appears not to be uniform with
                        more intense staining close to the perichondrium. While at HH30 the
                        expression in the hypertrophic zone and in the perichondrium are localised
                        at the mid-diaphysis, from HH32 onwards the proximo-distal extent of the

                        in the hypertrophic zone. A similar expression pattern was also seen in the
                        metatarsals of the hindlimb at stage HH34, where two distinct bands of

                        ‘Normal’ sections). At HH30, stimuli levels were
                    at a high level on the perichondrium at the mid-diaphysis of the rudiment. At
                    HH32, two concentrations of stimuli were apparent proximal and distal to the
                    mid-diaphysis, again on the surface of the rudiment, and by HH34, these
                    concentrations moved further apart along the length of the rudiment, proximal
                    and distal to the newly formed bone collar <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Nowlan1">[22]</xref>. Two genes showed a
                    correlation with the patterns of biophysical stimuli; ColX and Ihh, as their
                    expression followed patterns of events that reflect the stimuli patterns at the
                    same stages. ColX was found to be expressed in the region of hypertrophic
                    chondrocytes and in the region of the perichondrium where bone would soon form,
                    spreading proximally and distally beyond the hypertrophic zone domain at the
                    core at HH30 and HH32 and ahead of the bone collar at HH34. Therefore its
                    surface expression demonstrated a correlation with the patterns of biophysical
                    stimuli at each of the three stages examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the earlier stages examined,
                    Ihh was expressed uniformly across the pre-hypertrophic zone, in one
                    mid-diaphyseal region at HH30, and in two bands at increasing distances proximal
                    and distal to the mid-diaphysis at later stages, the expression bands moving
                    proximally and distally in synchrony with the biophysical stimuli at the
                    surface. Expression of Ihh was therefore at the same longitudinal position in

                        environment had an effect on skeletal development, the skeletons of controls
                        and embryos treated with the neuromuscular blocking agent DMB were compared
                        with particular focus on the tibiotarsus. The immobilisation treatment was
                        found to have a dramatic effect on overall skeletal morphology. Treated
                        embryos were smaller, with abnormal rib formation, joint contractures and
                        spinal curvature (results not shown); effects which had previously been
                        reported in other immobilisation studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Hosseini1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Hosseini2">[30]</xref>. It was found that the tibiotarsal rudiments
                        were significantly shorter in the immobilised group than in the control
                        group for all days of the experiment, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g007">Figure 7a</xref>. When the length of bone
                        (Alizarin red staining) in the tibiotarsus was measured, at day 8, most of
                        the rudiments had not yet undergone ossification and no significant
                        difference was found between the control and immobilised groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g007">Figure 7b</xref>). At day 9,
                        there was a trend indicating less bone growth in the immobilised embryos
                        than in controls, with no significant difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g007">Figure 7b</xref>). However, by day 11, a
                        statistically significant decrease in bone length was found in the
                        immobilised embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g007">Figure
                        7b</xref>). No significant difference in cartilage or bone growth was found
                        between the two sets of incubations (Set A and Set B, data not shown),
                        demonstrating that starting the treatments on day 5 or day 6 of incubation
                        yielded the same effect.</p>

                    <title>Effect of immobilisation on patterns of biophysical stimuli</title>
                    <p>When the state of rigid paralysis induced by treatment with DMB was simulated
                        in Finite Element Analysis, dramatic differences in pattern and magnitude
                        were observed when compared with the results from the normal skeletal
                        rudiments, as described in Nowlan et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Nowlan1">[22]</xref>. Two stimuli
                        were compared in detail, fluid velocity and maximum principal strain, as
                        shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g006">Figure 6</xref>. The
                        patterns observed previously in the normal models of one peak of stimuli
                        levels at HH30, and two increasing proximal and distal peaks at HH32 and
                        HH34 were not observed at all stages in the immobilised models. For example,
                        at HH30, no peak in stimuli was observed at the mid-diaphysis, while at
                        HH32, two very slight elevations in stimuli levels proximal and distal to
                        the mid-diaphysis can be seen on the ventral side, while no peaks were
                        obvious in the same regions on the dorsal side (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g006">Figure 6</xref>, HH30; HH32). A similar pattern
                        occurred at HH34, with low peaks proximal and distal to the newly formed
                        bone collar on the ventral aspect, with extremely low stimuli levels (in
                        comparison to the normal situation) and no obvious peaks on the dorsal side
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g006">Figure 6</xref>, HH34).
                        Levels of biophysical stimuli when plotted along ventral and dorsal paths
                        are consistently lower in the immobilised rudiments (at each stage), and
                        when we examine the levels of stimuli in a longitudinal section through the
                        rudiment, stimuli levels are also lower throughout the breadth of the
                        cartilage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g006">Figure 6</xref>). As
                        was previously reported for the normal situation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Nowlan1">[22]</xref>, in the
                        immobilised models peak stimuli levels at HH34 are significantly higher than
                        at HH30 or HH32.</p>

                    <title>Effect of immobilisation on mechanosensitive gene expression</title>
                    <p>Due to the correlation with patterns of biophysical stimuli, ColX and Ihh
                        were chosen for comparison between control and immobilized specimens at the
                        mid timepoint of the experiment (day 9, roughly HH33). Each gene was
                        examined in seven treated specimens and four control specimens; (of the ten
                        experimental and five control specimens at day 9, three were damaged in the
                        sectioning process). The analysis focussed on day 9 because, as it coincides
                        with an early stage in the ossification process, it maximised the chances of
                        seeing an effect on the candidate mechanosensitive genes.</p>

                        hypertrophic zone. In two treated specimens, expression in the perichondrium
                        did not extend proximally or distally beyond the hypertrophic zone as seen
                        in untreated specimens (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g008">Figure 8B and 8C with 8A</xref>). Out of the seven treated specimens
                        characterised for ColX at day 9, these differences were detectable in two
                        specimens, while the remaining five specimens showed no differences from the

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>In this study, we set out to test the hypothesis that mechanical forces influence
                embryonic bone formation by regulating certain mechanosensitive genes. In a first
                analysis, the expression patterns of four genes; ColX, FGFr2, Ihh and PTHrP, were
                characterised and compared with patterns of biophysical stimuli. ColX and Ihh
                expression patterns correlated with stage-matched patterns of biophysical stimuli,
                whereas FGFr2 and PTHrP expression patterns did not. This identified ColX and Ihh as
                potential mechanosensitive genes regulating ossification in the embryo. ColX and Ihh
                expression patterns followed the same dynamic sequence of events as the patterns of
                biophysical stimuli, with one peak of expression at the mid-diaphysis at the
                youngest stage (HH30), and two peaks progressively more proximal and distal to the
                mid-diaphysis at HH32 and HH34. The ColX expression at the surface (on the
                perichondrium) correlates with the locations of peak biophysical stimuli also at the
                surface, while Ihh expression in the pre-hypertrophic cartilage is at the same
                longitudinal position in the rudiment as, and adjacent to, the peak levels of
                biophysical stimuli. In order to corroborate the hypothesis that ColX and Ihh may
                act as mechanosensitive genes for bone formation in the chick limb, an
                immobilisation assay was established, where rigid paralysis was induced with the
                prevention of skeletal muscle contractions. The morphological analysis of the
                immobilised embryos clearly demonstrated the effect of an altered mechanical
                environment on skeletal development, with immobilisation leading to shorter
                tibiotarsi and decreased bone collar formation. Finite Element Analyses of skeletal
                elements under rigid paralysis indicated a dramatic alteration in patterns of
                biophysical stimuli both in terms of stage-dependant patterns of biophysical stimuli
                and magnitudes of stimuli in comparison with the normal case. Aspects of the
                expression of ColX and Ihh indeed showed altered expression patterns following
                immobilisation in a proportion of specimens; (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g009">9</xref>), corroborating their role in mechanoregulation
                pathways during ossification in the chick long bone.</p>
            <p>The identification of Ihh as mechanosensitive in vivo is of particular interest since
                this gene has been shown to be a key regulator of bone formation in the mouse, and
                in particular formation of the bone collar, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-StJacques1">[15]</xref>. The elevation of
                expression close to the periphery of the hypertrophic zone at later stages, as
                described in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Results</xref> section, was precisely
                the aspect altered in a number of immobilised specimens with an earlier and more
                obvious peripheral elevation when mechanical stimulation was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g009">Figure 9</xref>) – this
                indicates a more complex regulation of a gene by mechanical forces than a simple up-
                or down-regulation on the level of expression. Alterations in Ihh expression would
                affect the switch from a proliferative to a pre-hypertrophic chondrocyte leading to
                a shorter rudiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Wang1">[31]</xref>, and shorter rudiments were indeed found in the
                treated limbs. This indicates that mechanical stimulation may play a role in
                regulating the position and timing of proliferation of immature chondrocytes through
                Ihh signalling. As the simulations of the immobilised embryos did not exhibit a
                specific pattern in the region of the pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes that would
                explain the change in the Ihh gene expression profile, these results also indicate
                the involvement of one or more molecules interacting with Ihh in one or more
                mechanoregulatory pathways. Alteration to the expression of ColX was observed in the
                regions predicted to have highest concentrations of biophysical stimuli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g008">Figure 8B and 8C</xref>), where the
                expression in the perichondrium did not extend proximal and distal to the
                hypertrophic zone. The Finite Element simulations of the immobilised limbs indicated
                that peak stimuli levels at the perichondrium at all three stages were dramatically
                decreased due to rigid paralysis. It is possible that ColX may promote deposition of
                osteoid on the perichondrium in response to peak levels of mechanical stimulation,
                which would explain, at least in part, the reduced bone formation in the altered
                mechanical environment induced by immobilisation. Alternatively, it is possible that
                expression in the perichondrium does not extend beyond the hypertrophic region due
                to an increase in the length of the hypertrophic zone. An elevated rate of
                hypertrophy would lead to a shorter rudiment, as was indeed found in the immobilised
                specimens in this experiment. However, the altered expression profile of Ihh does
                not suggest an increase in the number of pre-hypertrophic chondrocytes. Therefore,
                it is likely that one or more other mechanoregulatory molecules are involved, and
                this will be a subject for future work.</p>
            <p>In this study, there was a certain amount of variability in the effect of the
                neuromuscular blocking agent, and the change in expression patterns of candidate
                mechanosensitive genes were not seen in all immobilised (drug-treated) specimens.
                This variability is not unexpected since the alteration to muscle contractions is
                effected by exposure to a pharmaceutical agent where the response to a set dose can
                vary across individual specimens. A variable response was also evident when movement
                in the experimental embryos was quantified; while movement was clearly reduced, it
                was not completely removed in all specimens. However, detectable changes in gene
                expression were seen for two different genes in multiple specimens, showing a
                repeatable effect, and the statistically significant decrease in rudiment length and
                bone formation serves as confirmation of the immobilisation treatment as a means of
                altering the mechanical environment. The magnitudes of the muscle loads applied for
                the embryos subjected to rigid paralysis may be an overestimation, because while we
                have assumed the same volume of muscle in our simulations, it has been widely
                reported that muscle mass is reduced in immobilised embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Hall1">[32]</xref>. However, as the models
                are likely to overestimate the muscle forces in a completely immobilised animal,
                this will only strengthen our findings of the dramatic effect on the biophysical
                environment due to paralysis. Another limitation of this research is that late long
                bone ossification events are significantly different in mammals and birds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Nowlan2">[33]</xref>, where
                the long bones of birds are formed primarily via periosteal ossification as opposed
                to a combination of periosteal and endochondral ossification in mammals. However,
                birds and mammals have the events preceding ossification in common, such as
                hypertrophy of the chondrocytes and formation of the periosteal bone collar, and
                therefore genes identified as being mechanosensitive in vivo in the chick are likely
                to have a similar role in the mammal.</p>
            <p>The study presented here has revealed the alteration of gene expression as a result
                of mechanical stimulation. Even though we have identified the in vivo
                mechanosensitivity of two genes in the developing limb, we do not know what
                signalling cascades prompted the change in ColX and Ihh expression patterns. For
                example, focussing on Ihh in particular, while it has been suggested that Ihh
                regulates proliferation of chondrocytes through the activation of stretch activated
                channels by mechanical stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Wu1">[20]</xref>, it remains to be discovered what transcription
                factors and other intracellular molecules form the link between stretch activated
                channels and upregulation of the gene. As ColX and Ihh have now been demonstrated to
                be involved in mechanosensitive pathways in vivo at specific developmental
                timepoints, this opens the possibility of dissecting the upstream mechanisms
                involved in the response.</p>
            <p>Many researchers have recognized the importance of the interaction between mechanical
                and biological factors for bone development. A range of biophysical stimuli
                parameters have been hypothesised to promote ossification, such as low levels of
                hydrostatic stress and principal strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Carter1">[34]</xref>, local stress and
                strain magnitudes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Claes1">[35]</xref> or low levels of octahedral shear strain and
                fluid velocity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Prendergast1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-Geris1">[39]</xref>. The results presented
                in this study suggest that biophysical stimuli promote ossification through the
                action of mechanosensitive genes, but it was not possible to determine a magnitude
                or level of any particular biophysical stimulus necessary for normal
                mechanosensitive gene expression. Although dramatic decreases in stimuli magnitudes
                were found between normal and immobilised simulations within stages, the immobilised
                stimuli magnitudes at HH34 are still higher than normal values at HH30 and HH32
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000250-g006">Figure 6</xref>). This may suggest
                that the cellular response of cells to mechanical forces in the embryo is not
                constant across different stages of development. It was also not possible from this
                study to conclude the precise nature of the mechanical stimulus, (such as strain or
                fluid flow), causing mechanotransduction. However, with new insight into the
                interactions between mechanical forces and mechanosensitive genes, computational
                simulations which incorporate biological and mechanobiological influences on
                ossification may now be further developed to include specific mechanosensitive
                genes. Van Donkelaar and Huiskes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-vanDonkelaar1">[40]</xref> have, in fact,
                already developed such a numerical model, simulating the PTHrP-Ihh control loop and
                its influence on growth plate development. The results of their simulation suggest
                that the mechanical stimulation of Ihh is likely to have a greater effect than
                stimulation of PTHrP, a result that was also suggested in this study, by the
                correlation of gene expression patterns with biophysical stimuli. Our identification
                of Ihh as being mechanosensitive in vivo further corroborates the findings of van
                Donkelaar and Huiskes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000250-vanDonkelaar1">[40]</xref>, and demonstrates that, with the identification
                of other mechanosensitive genes in vivo, and the subsequent development of more
                complex and detailed simulations, a deeper understanding of how biophysical stimuli
                are interpreted and integrated with the genetic regulatory mechanisms guiding bone
                development can be gained.</p>
            <p>The work presented here has provided a new insight into mechanoregulation of
                embryonic long bone ossification. This is the first study where finite element
                analyses of the embryonic limb using anatomically accurate rudiment and muscle
                morphologies have enabled comparison of predicted biophysical stimuli patterns with
                gene expression patterns, and the characterisation of the biophysical environment in
                the growing rudiment when skeletal muscle contractions are prevented. A means of
                corroborating candidate mechanosensitive genes was proposed and tested, revealing
                ColX and Ihh as mechanosensitive in vivo during embryonic bone formation, and also
                identifying them as potential key mediators in translating information from the
                mechanical environment to the molecular regulation of bone formation in the
            embryo.</p>
