<abstract>
<p>Long noncoding RNAs constitute a major fraction of the eukaryotic transcriptome, and together with proteins, they intricately fine-tune various growth regulatory signals to control cellular homeostasis. Here, we describe the functional characterisation of a novel pair of long intergenic noncoding RNAs (lincRNAs) comprised of complementary, fully overlapping sense and antisense transcripts Genomic Instability Inducing RNA (Ginir) and antisense RNA of Ginir (Giniras), respectively, from mouse cells. This transcript pair is expressed in a spatiotemporal manner during embryonic development. The individual levels of the sense and antisense transcripts are finely balanced during embryonic growth and in adult tissues. Functional studies of the individual transcripts performed using overexpression and knock-down strategies in mouse cells has led to the discovery that Ginir RNA is a regulator of cellular proliferation and can act as an oncogene having a preeminent role in malignant transformation. Mechanistically, we demonstrate that the oncogenic function of Ginir is mediated by its interaction with centrosomal protein 112 (Cep112). Additionally, we establish here a specific interaction between Cep112 with breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (Brca1), another centrosome-associated protein. Next, we prove that the mutual interaction between Cep112 with Brca1 is significant for mitotic regulation and maintenance of genomic stability. Furthermore, we demonstrate that the Cep112 protein interaction with Brca1 protein is impaired when an elevated level of Ginir RNA is present in the cells, resulting in severe deregulation and abnormality in mitosis, leading to malignant transformation. Inhibiting the Ginir RNA function in transformed cells attenuates transformation and restores genomic stability. Together, these findings unravel, to our knowledge, a hitherto-unknown mechanism of oncogenesis mediated by a long noncoding RNA and establishes a unique role of Cep112–Brca1 interaction being modulated by Ginir RNA in maintaining mitotic fidelity.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The growth of multicellular organisms is tightly regulated by cellular homeostasis mediated by cell division. This is achieved with the help of various proteins acting in a highly coordinated manner via intricately woven intercellular signalling pathways, which regulate cell division. Here, we identify a long noncoding RNA pair, which we named Genomic Instability Inducing RNA (Ginir)/antisense RNA of Ginir (Giniras), and explore its function in cellular homeostasis. We show that this RNA pair is expressed in a spatiotemporally regulated manner during development and is enriched in the brain. We find that Ginir acts as a dominant oncogene when Ginir transcript levels are overexpressed in mouse fibroblasts and that centrosomal protein 112 (Cep112) is its interacting protein partner. We also report that Cep112 interacts with breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (Brca1), a protein well known for its role in genome surveillance. Our data reveal that interactions between these two proteins are perturbed in the presence of excessive levels of Ginir RNA, which results in aberrant mitosis and drives the cells towards neoplastic transformation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The recent surge of information regarding evolutionary conservation, functionality, and annotation of sequences from the mammalian genome has revealed that a bulk of the transcriptome is noncoding and includes small and long noncoding RNAs (lncRNAs). FANTOM data sets of the human and mouse transcriptomes have emphasised that about 63% of the mammalian genome is pervasively transcribed, even from retrotransposon elements, and amongst them, more than 73% of genes show some form of antisense transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref002">2</xref>]. The advances made on the analyses of various transcriptomes followed by identification of several lncRNAs have led to the exposition of their regulatory roles in transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref003">3</xref>], posttranscriptional gene silencing (PTGS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref004">4</xref>], organogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref005">5</xref>], pluripotency, reprogramming, differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref006">6</xref>], and also epigenetic regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref007">7</xref>]. A multitude of lncRNAs have pathological roles in a variety of disease processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref008">8</xref>]. In particular, deregulations of lncRNAs have been correlated to several diseases that include α-thalassaemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref009">9</xref>], myotonic dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref010">10</xref>], Alzheimer disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref011">11</xref>], spinocerebellar ataxia type 8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref012">12</xref>], and also various cancers that include tumours of the central nervous system (CNS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref013">13</xref>], mammary gland [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref014">14</xref>], colon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref015">15</xref>], skin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref016">16</xref>], lung [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref017">17</xref>], and many more. Furthermore, the expression profiles of lncRNAs are considered to serve as biomarkers for cancer diagnosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref018">18</xref>]. Close to more than 500 temporally expressed S-phase-enriched lncRNAs have been recently identified from HeLa cells with potential prognostic value and oncogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref019">19</xref>]. The present knowledge about diverse functions mediated by many lncRNAs, especially those implicated in gene regulation, range from them functioning as a decoy like Tsix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref020">20</xref>], to their role in alternative splicing like metastasis-associated lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (MALAT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref021">21</xref>], to a few acting as a scaffold like P21-associated noncoding RNA DNA damage-activated (PANDA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref022">22</xref>] or as a sponge like taurine up-regulated gene 1 (TUG1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref023">23</xref>]. A multitude of lncRNAs regulate transcriptional networks by competing for a limited pool of microRNAs and thereby function as competing endogenous RNAs (ceRNAs) like hepatocellular carcinoma up-regulated lncRNA (HULC), cAMP response element binding protein (CREB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref024">24</xref>], differentiation antagonizing non-protein-coding RNA (DANCR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref025">25</xref>], H19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref026">26</xref>], and many more [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref027">27</xref>]. Recently, noncoding RNAs have been identified that act as enhancer RNAs, like Bloodlinc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref028">28</xref>], or function as allosteric modulators, like <italic>CCND1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref029">29</xref>]. The varied mechanisms through which they mediate gene regulation range from chromatin remodelling by either binding to polycomb repressive complex 1/2 (PRC1/2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref030">30</xref>] or by forming RNA–DNA triplexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref031">31</xref>], to acting as competitive inhibitors of target protein/RNA interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref031">31</xref>]. The lncRNAs can either directly interact with proteins or they can sequester proteins that are master regulators of cellular growth.</p>
<p>We here report the identification of an acutely transforming cDNA derived from the transcriptome of the mouse melanoma cells—Clone M3. This cDNA, upon transfection into mouse NIH/3T3 fibroblasts, formed foci of neoplastically transformed cells. The characterisation of the sequence of this acutely transforming gene was found to encode an lncRNA. We named this RNA as Genomic Instability-Inducing RNA (Ginir) because it exerted a regulatory role on cell proliferation and maintained genomic stability under conditions of normal cellular homeostasis. An increased expression level of Ginir in mouse fibroblast cells induced genomic instability and oncogenic transformation. Here, we provide a mechanistic insight about the oncogenic role of noncoding RNA Ginir in mouse cells. Our data exemplify that (i) Ginir RNA function is modulated by its full-length natural antisense transcript (NAT; Giniras), (ii) Ginir RNA targets centrosomal protein 112 (Cep112) and alters its subcellular localisation by binding to it, (iii) breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein (Brca1) and Cep112 proteins interact with each other in the absence of Ginir noncoding RNA, (iv) interaction of Cep112 protein with Brca1 protein is impaired in the presence of high levels of Ginir RNA, and (v) interference of Cep112–Brca1 interaction due to increased presence of Ginir RNA causes replicative stress and induces mitotic dysregulation, causing genomic instability, and thereby propels cells towards malignant transformation.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>DNA transfection assays have been successfully employed to identify the presence of putative proto-oncogenes and dominantly acting cellular oncogenes in a variety of mammalian cells, including human tumours [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref033">33</xref>]. We used an automatic directional cloning (ADC) approach to identify activated oncogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref034">34</xref>] using Clone M3 mouse melanoma cells as a paradigm. When the expression cDNA library—prepared from the poly A+ RNA of Clone M3 mouse melanoma cells—was introduced into mouse NIH/3T3 cells by transfection, several clones of cells with morphological features of oncogenic transformation, like the one shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1A Fig</xref>, were generated. Sequence determination of one of the cDNA clones rescued from the transformed cells led to the identification of a 557-nucleotides-long sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1B Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>This transforming cDNA sequence was unconventional because it encoded three putative ORFs, each with a short sequence of amino acids (aa) (ORF1–46 aa, ORF2–51 aa, and ORF3–104 aa) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). Of these three ORFs, only ORF1 and ORF2 were expressed as an N-terminal green fluorescent protein (GFP) fusion protein of sizes 38.1 and 39.1 kDa, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). However, the ectopic expression of each these two putative proteins neither yielded any discernible phenotype nor showed any oncogenic transformation <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>, as seen by the tumourigenicity assay in immune-compromised mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). Moreover, the expression of the sequence of 557 bases as a fusion RNA appended either to the 5′ or 3′ UTR of GFP was highly tumourigenic (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). These results together ruled out the possibility that the two distinct ORFs—ORF1 and ORF2—could specify oncoproteins. Instead, it suggested that the sequence of 557 nucleotides itself was functioning as a noncoding oncogenic RNA. The noncoding nature of this sequence was confirmed using software tools like Coding Potential Assessment Tool (CPAT) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1F Fig</xref>) and Coding Potential Calculator (CPC2) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1G Fig</xref>). The sequence of this transcript was extended using 5′ and 3′ rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) in both directions to obtain a 612-nucleotides-long extended sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). The 612-base-sequence data deposited at the National Center for Biotechnology Information (NCBI) bear the accession number EF649772.1. The ectopic expression of 612 nucleotides’ RNA in NIH/3T3 cells also caused oncogenic transformation like its 557-nucleotides-long counterpart. BLAST analyses indicated that the 612-nucleotides-long transcript sequence originated from an intronless genomic segment located at position A6q of the X chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and it was flanked by the genes coding for the proteins Leucine Zipper down-regulated in cancer-1 (LDOC1) and the melanoma-associated antigen-11 on its 5′ and 3′ ends respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).

<p>Because the 612-nucleotides-long RNA originated from an independent transcription unit having no overlap with these two adjacent protein-coding genes, its identity became obvious as lincRNA. Bioinformatic analyses of Ginir sequence demonstrated its part homology to several unannotated noncoding RNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). More significantly, a deregulated overexpression of this lincRNA resulted in genomic instability (see the section Ginir RNA expression in cells induces dsDNA breaks and activates DNA damage response (DDR) pathway proteins) accompanied by oncogenic transformation, demonstrating that it was functioning as a Ginir.</p>

This prompted us to examine if Ginir RNA was being expressed in cultured cells of embryonic origin like in NIH/3T3 cells and was also expressed during mouse embryonic development. When RNase protection assay (RPA) using RNA isolated from NIH/3T3 cells was performed using Ginir-specific sense and antisense hybridisation riboprobes, we found a completely overlapping antisense RNA to Ginir (Giniras) being transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<p>The poor representation of lncRNA sequences in the RNA-seq data is reported for several lincRNAs, and this is often ascribed to their low expression levels, spatiotemporal expression pattern, and near-universal alternative splicing of noncoding exons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref035">35</xref>]. With the finding that the Ginir RNA sequence predominately displays homology to several ESTs that are expressed during mouse embryonic development, it is possible that Ginir RNA expression might also have a characteristic spatiotemporal expression profile as seen with many other lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref037">37</xref>]. We therefore isolated RNA from developmentally timed whole mouse embryos and determined the expression of both Ginir and Giniras transcripts in them. The Ginir transcript was detectable during the embryonic developmental stages of 5.5 to 9.5 days and again at 13.5 days post coitum (dpc). By contrast, the Giniras transcript was clearly present in the intervals of 10.5 to 12.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Instead, a more prominent Giniras RNA expression relative to Ginir RNA expression was evident in some of the adult mouse tissues examined, which included brain, heart, lungs, spleen, pancreas, and kidney (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). These findings are consistent with an argument that Ginir RNA expression is more tightly coupled to proliferative stages of cells during embryonic development, whereas predominant Giniras RNA expression is associated with nonproliferative cells of the organs. When fluorescein amidite (FAM)-labelled Ginir-specific locked nucleic acid (LNA) probe (FAM-LNA-Ginir) and Texas Red–labelled Giniras-specific LNA probes (TxR-LNA-Giniras) were used on the whole embryos individually or together, it became clear that expression of Ginir, as well as Giniras RNA, was differentially regulated in various differentiating tissues during embryonic development. In 10.5-, 13.5-, and 14.5-dpc mouse embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), the presence of both Ginir and Giniras transcripts was detectable in appreciable amounts, particularly in the developing ventricles of the brain and forelimb, signifying that both these transcripts may have functions in the development of these tissues. Whereas Giniras transcript was found exclusively localised to emerging forelimb buds by stage 10.5 dpc, Ginir RNA was differentially localised to the spinal cord (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). By stage 13.5 dpc, a higher abundance of both Ginir and Giniras transcripts was marked in both brain and developing forelimb buds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g002">Fig 2F</xref>); this colocalised expression pattern of Ginir and Giniras RNA was restricted to specific regions of the forebrain and midbrain and persisted until 14.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Taken together, these findings demonstrated that Ginir was specifically expressed during embryonic development of brain, spinal cord, and forelimb buds at early to midgestational stages, whereas the Giniras expression followed temporally to Ginir function in developing tissues and significantly was more prominent in several adult tissues. These observations are in accord with reports that the expression of lncRNAs are spatially precise and are often restricted to particular structures or cell types of the brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref038">38</xref>]. It is well established that the brain is a complex organ and harbours the most transcriptional diversity amongst other somatic tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Overexpression of Ginir RNA in cultured cells induces oncogenic transformation</title>
<p>To address the function of the individual transcripts of the noncoding RNA pair Ginir and Giniras, we took advantage of our prior observations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s001">S1A Fig</xref>) that had demonstrated the foci-forming potential of Ginir RNA upon its ectopic expression in NIH/3T3 cells. To gain a mechanistic insight into their role in cell transformation, we generated stable cell lines of NIH/3T3 cells that overexpressed either the individual transcripts of Ginir or Giniras or both in combination (Ginir+Giniras) from the strong cytomegalovirus (CMV) promoter. The clone of cells stably expressing Ginir RNA (NIH/3T3-Ginir) had 16-fold-higher levels (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001) of Ginir transcript over endogenous level of expression in NIH/3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). Similarly, the stable clone of cells expressing Giniras RNA (NIH/3T3-Giniras) had 12-fold-higher amounts of Giniras transcript than its endogenous level of expression in NIH/3T3 cells (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.001). The RPA performed using NIH/3T3-Ginir cells confirmed overexpression of Ginir transcript as compared to Giniras (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3B Fig</xref>). We performed multiple transfections (<italic>n</italic> = 5) to generate several independent stable cell lines of NIH/3T3-Ginir, NIH/3T3-Giniras, and NIH/3T3-Ginir+Giniras overexpressing either transcript or both. For comparison, clones were generated with only the empty vector (NIH/3T3-EV), which served as the control. A few of the multiple independent clones of NIH/3T3-Ginir (termed here as clones A, B, and C) were randomly picked up for further studies. The expanded population of cells from these individual clones shared the following properties: they (i) appeared highly refractile, (ii) had lost contact inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3A</xref>), (iii) had a higher proliferative potential as measured by 3-(4, 5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2, 5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), and (iv) showed a higher percent of positivity for the proliferation marker Ki67 as compared to the cells derived from NIH/3T3-EV, NIH/3T3-Giniras, or NIH/3T3-Ginir+Giniras clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). The NIH/3T3-Ginir+Giniras transfectant clones showed proliferative potential comparable to NIH/3T3-EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). We picked the expanded cells of NIH/3T3-Ginir (Clone A) for further analysis <italic>in vitro</italic>. Fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) analysis of propidium iodide (PI)-stained cells of NIH/3T3-Ginir (Clone A) demonstrated an increased fraction of cycling cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>) as compared to NIH/3T3-EV cells. Clone A transfectant cells expressed higher levels of phosphorylated retinoblastoma protein (pRb), had increased levels of cyclins D1 and E (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3F Fig</xref>), showed increased clonogenicity in soft agar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3G Fig</xref>), and displayed higher invasion potential in a Matrigel assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3H Fig</xref>). The NIH/3T3-Ginir cells also demonstrated an increased migration rate in wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3I and S3J Fig</xref>) and exhibited a pronounced angiogenic potential in a chicken chorioallantoic membrane (CAM) experimental system (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3K Fig</xref>). Subcutaneous introduction of NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) cells rapidly formed malignant tumours in NOD/SCID mice at the injected sites within 2 weeks of injections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3D–3G</xref>), whereas mice injected with NIH/3T3-EV or NIH/3T3-Giniras cells did not develop tumours up to 95 days post injection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>). When the tumour forming potential of NIH/3T3-Ginir+Giniras cells was examined, they formed tumours of substantially reduced sizes (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001) and with a delayed onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3F and 3G</xref>).

<title>NIH/3T3-Ginir cells efficiently colonise lung tissue in a tail vein assay</title>
<p>A number of noncoding RNAs such as urothelial cancer associated 1 (UCA1), MALAT1, H19, and plasmacytoma variant translocation (PVT1) have been implicated in the promotion of metastasis of tumour cells, but evidence for a more direct role of these RNAs in this process is still lacking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref039">39</xref>]. Our findings that the NIH/3T3-Ginir cells had an enhanced migration potential in both 2D and 3D matrix assays in vitro led us to investigate whether Ginir RNA–induced tumour cells would also have detectable metastatic potential in a lung colonisation assay. To assay metastasis, we performed a standard tail vein assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref040">40</xref>]. For this, we introduced cells grown out from NIH/3T3-Ginir (Clones A and B) and NIH/3T3-Giniras cells through the tail veins of NOD/SCID mice. In addition, we also examined if the same cells could metastasise or colonise to any distant tissue when introduced through subcutaneous injections. These experiments demonstrated that NIH/3T3-Ginir cells generated numerous macroscopic foci of tumour cells in the lungs of the injected mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3H and 3I</xref>) within 6–8 weeks post injection of cells. This was also confirmed by the haematoxylin–eosin (HE) staining of the lung tissues of NIH/3T3-Ginir cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3J and 3K</xref>). These data contrasted with the results obtained from mice injected with similar numbers of NIH/3T3-EV or NIH/3T3-Giniras cells, which did not colonise tumour foci to lungs or any other tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g003">Fig 3H and 3I</xref>) up to 12 weeks. When NIH/3T3-Ginir cells (from Clones A and B) were introduced subcutaneously, not only did tumours develop at the injected site but also the colonisation of lungs in the injected mice could be seen by 11 weeks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3M Fig</xref>), which was also confirmed by HE staining of the lung tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s003">S3N Fig</xref>). These data demonstrated the potential of Ginir RNA to act as a metastasis-promoting noncoding RNA. In summary, our data establish that lncRNA Ginir functions as a metastasis-inducing oncogenic RNA.</p>
<p>To uncover differential gene expression, if any, we performed transcriptome sequencing and compared the RNA profiles of NIH/3T3, NIH/3T3-Ginir(A), NIH/3T3-Giniras, and Clone M3 cell lines. High-quality sequence reads were obtained with all the samples as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>, and a heatmap generated from the expression data is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s004">S4C Fig</xref>.

Gene Ontology (GO) analysis of the gene data sets and heatmap demonstrated that the enrichment terms were mainly concentrated to pathways important for cell cycle progression, cell division, RNA splicing, RNA processing, and cell–cell adhesion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s004">S4F and S4G Fig</xref>). An analysis of the cellular components involved in these processes indicated that most of these genes were localised to the centromeric regions of the chromosomes, the kinetochores, and the cell–cell adherens junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s004">S4H and S4I Fig</xref>).

<p>Next, we asked if a high level of Ginir expression was continuously required for the induction and/or maintenance of the transformed state or whether it involved a hit-and-run mechanism. To find this, we down-regulated Ginir expression in NIH-Ginir(A) and NIH-Ginir(B) cells by superimposing the expression of Ginir-specific short hairpin RNAs (shRNAs). The shRNAs were designed to target specifically two different regions of Ginir RNA sequence (sequences as specified in Materials and methods) and were termed as shGinir1 and shGinir2. Stable cell line clones expressing these shRNAs were generated, and expanded cells from them were used for further studies. We found that the Ginir RNA expression level had significantly decreased with shGinir1 and shGinir2 knock-down constructs in NIH/3T3-Ginir cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). The Ginir RNA–deficient NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) cells displayed a reversal of their refractive cell morphology and appeared more like NIH/3T3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). In addition, the same cells had a reduced proliferative potential in an MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), a lower fraction of cycling cells in the S+G2/M phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s005">S5C Fig</xref>), a decreased percent of positivity for Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g004">Fig 4D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), and an impaired 2D cell migration potential in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Importantly with shRNA-mediated Ginir RNA depletion, the cells formed smaller-sized tumours as compared to the parent NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) cells in the tumourigenicity assays done in NOD/SCID mice (<italic>P ≤</italic> 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>). The cells derived from the NIH/3T3-Ginir(B) clone also showed similar phenotypes and reduced tumourigenicity after the Ginir RNA levels were independently knocked down by introducing Ginir shRNAs 1 and 2 into them (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s005">S5D Fig</xref>). Thus, when Ginir RNA was down-regulated, it caused significant attenuation of tumour phenotype, indicating that a high level of Ginir RNA expression was continuously required for the maintenance of malignant transformation. Taken together, these data provide unambiguous evidence about the oncogenic nature of Ginir.</p>

<title>Knock-down of endogenous Ginir inhibits proliferation</title>
<p>To address the role of endogenous Ginir RNA, we used two mouse cell lines; one was NIH/3T3, and the other was B16F10 melanoma cell line. As stated previously, NIH/3T3 cells have basal levels of Ginir RNA expression, whereas B16F10 melanoma cells express high levels of Ginir RNA. We generated Ginir-deficient cell lines of both of them by expressing shRNA1 and shRNA2 in them. The down-regulation of Ginir RNA in NIH-shRNA1 and NIH-shRNA2 cells was confirmed by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). The NIH-shRNA Ginir1 and NIH-shRNA Ginir2 cells demonstrated a lower proliferative rate in MTT assay (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) and had decreased levels of Ki67 antigen expression (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.05) as compared to control cells generated by introducing a scrambled shRNA (NIH-shRNA Control) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s006">S6A Fig</xref>). Down-regulation of Ginir RNA altered the cell cycle kinetics by decreasing the population of cycling cells in the S+G2/M phase and increasing the proportion of cells in the G0/G1 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These data in combination with the Ginir RNA overexpression data cited earlier provide evidence for a role of Ginir RNA in maintaining homeostasis in the cell proliferation dynamics. Particularly in NIH/3T3 cells, moderate Ginir RNA expression positively regulated cell proliferation, and its reduced level was favourable for slow cycling, whereas its overexpression perpetuated unregulated growth and cell transformation.</p>

<p>We also generated Ginir-deficient B16F10 melanoma cells by the same procedure followed for NIH/3T3 cells and confirmed the down-regulation of Ginir RNA in these cells by RT-PCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). We used the Ginir RNA–deficient B16F10 cells to compare the growth and transforming potential of these cells with their parental B16F10 cells. The Ginir-deficient B16F10 cells exhibited a more differentiated morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), showed reduced proliferative potential in MTT assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5G</xref>), possessed a lower fraction of cells expressing KI67 antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s006">S6B Fig</xref>), and demonstrated decreased cell migration in wound healing assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5I and 5J</xref>). B16F10 cells are highly tumourigenic and metastatic in nature. Consistent with our tumour data obtained with NIH/3T3-Ginir cells and their NIH-GinirshRNA derivative cells displaying contrasting growth kinetics, we found that these experiments with B16F10 melanoma cells showed similar retardation of tumour growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5K</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). The reduced tumour size could result from a delayed initiation of tumour growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s006">S6C Fig</xref>) or could be an outcome of a decreased tumour volume due to an overall reduction in the tumour growth kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g005">Fig 5L</xref>). Ginir knock-down in B16F10 cells affected melanin production, resulting in reduced pigmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s006">S6D Fig</xref>) as compared to B16F10 cells. These data make us speculate that besides proliferation, Ginir RNA may also be involved in pigmentation.</p>

<title>More Ginir RNA is partitioned into the nucleus in the NIH-Ginir-transformed cells</title>
<p>To understand the function of Ginir RNA in cell transformation, it is important to know its subcellular localisation within the cells. To gain insight into this, we obtained RNA from the nuclear and cytoplasmic compartments of Clone M3, NIH/3T3-EV, NIH/3T3-Ginir, and NIH/3T3-Giniras cells. By using strand-specific primers for cDNA synthesis followed by RT-PCR, we measured Ginir and Giniras RNA levels in these two compartments. The Ginir RNA was found to be more abundant in the nuclear compartment of Clone M3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g006">Fig 6A</xref>) and NIH/3T3-Ginir cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g006">Fig 6C</xref>), whereas it was enriched in the cytoplasm of NIH/3T3-EV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) and NIH/3T3-Giniras cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) Furthermore, by in situ hybridisation using two independent Ginir sequence–specific LNA probes, we observed a more prominent partitioning of Ginir RNA to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g006">Fig 6E–6H</xref>) in NIH/3T3-Ginir cells, providing a direct support to the data obtained by RT-PCR experiments. Secondly, the localisation of Ginir RNA seen with the same two fluorescence in situ hybridisation (FISH) probes was specific, since a much reduced nuclear staining was observed in the Ginir knock-down cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). Cells treated with RNase A lacked any hybridisation fluorescence signal, confirming the specificity of binding of LNA probes to Ginir RNA but not to DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s007">S7A and S7B Fig</xref>). Like the data obtained with RT-PCR, the Giniras RNA localisation by LNA probe was seen mainly in the cytoplasmic compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s007">S7C Fig</xref>). In B16F10 melanoma cells, the Ginir RNA showed a prominent localisation to the nuclear compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g006">Fig 6E–6H</xref>). In summary, we demonstrate that the Ginir and Giniras RNAs are primarily compartmentalised to the cytoplasm in normal cells; however, Ginir RNA is mainly partitioned to the nuclear compartment in transformed cells.</p>

<title>Ginir RNA expression in cells induces dsDNA breaks and activates DNA damage response (DDR) pathway proteins</title>
<p>As a part of dsDNA damage response, ataxia–telangiectasia-mutated (ATM) kinase phosphorylates several downstream target proteins, which include the histone protein H2Ax, converting it to γH2AX [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref041">41</xref>]. We found that Ginir RNA overexpression either transiently or stably in NIH/3T3 cells increased the levels of γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g007">Fig 7A</xref>); also evident were high numbers of repair foci in their nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g007">Fig 7B and 7C</xref>). In comparison, such repair foci were considerably less in NIH/3T3-Giniras and NIH/3T3-EV cells. The observation that even transient expression of Ginir RNA in NIH/3T3 cells caused an increased expression of γH2AX indicated that the increase was due to a primary effect caused by Ginir expression and was not due to secondary effects of cell transformation. This notion was further supported by the observations that the number of γH2AX repair foci significantly decreased after Ginir expression was knocked down, as evident in NIHGinir-shGinir1 and shGinir2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g007">Fig 7D–7F</xref>). Consistent with the increased level of γH2AX foci, NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) or NIH/3T3-Ginir(B) cells showed activation of member proteins involved in DDR, which included meiotic recombination 11 (Mre11), Rad52, p53 binding protein 1 (53BP1), ATM/ataxia–telangiectasia and Rad3-related kinase (ATR)-Substrate, pATM, p53, and p21. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g007">Fig 7G</xref>). The DDR elicited by Ginir was further corroborated using a more direct DNA damage assay such as the comet assay, which demonstrated the presence of DNA damage signatures in NIH/3T3-Ginir cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). A significant finding was that NIH/3T3-GinirA, B, and C independent transfectant lines show lower amounts of Brca1 protein in them compared to NIH/3T3-EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g007">Fig 7I</xref>). Also, these cells accumulated a higher level of nuclear p53 and exhibited cytoplasmic expression of p21 protein, which are known to work together to impair DNA repair, compromise the tumour suppressor function of p53, and promote genomic instability. Thus, a higher Ginir RNA expression led to activation of DDR, resulting in increased cell survival, as no apoptosis was detected, and cells continued cycling with error-prone DNA synthesis. Taken together, our data indicate that Ginir overexpression leads to genomic instability.</p>

<p>In addition, the in situ localisation of Ginir RNA using LNA-FISH probes demonstrated a distinct Ginir RNA compartmentalisation to the nuclei of the transformed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8D</xref>) as well as to the multinucleated giant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Strong oncogenic signals are known to induce senescence, and it is possible that the giant cells arose because of Ginir RNA. The giant cell formation in NIH/3T3-Ginir cells was found unrelated to the normal senescence response by the criteria that these cells were not growth arrested and showed the expression of the proliferation marker Ki67 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8F</xref>). Furthermore, defects in spindle formation along with abnormal amplification of centrosome numbers were evident in multinucleated giant cells of NIH/3T3-Ginir cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8G</xref>). These features appeared specific to high Ginir RNA expression in these cells, since the NIHGinir-shGinir1 and NIHGinir-shGinir2 cells did not exhibit these defects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s008">S8A Fig</xref>). A large number (approximately 40%) of NIH/3T3-Ginir cells showed greater than 2 centrosomes per cell, and this abnormality in centrosome numbers induced because of Ginir were evident by staining of these cells with centrosomal markers like ɣ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8H</xref>) and aurora-related kinase 1 (Ark1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8I</xref>). The numerical effects on centrosome numbers (&gt;2 centrosomes/cell) induced by Ginir overexpression were quantified and occurred in a NIH/3T3-Ginir cell population to a larger extent (approximately 45%–50%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8J</xref>) as compared to control cells (<italic>P</italic> ≤ 0.0001). These defects in centrosome numbers were evident in both interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8H and 8I</xref>) and metaphase cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8K</xref>). More notably, knock-down of Ginir caused reversal to regulated mitosis manifested in terms of formation of regular bipolar spindles as evident by Ark1 staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g008">Fig 8G</xref>). Thus, high levels of Ginir RNA expression apparently accelerated karyokinesis but retarded cytokinesis, thereby generating multinucleated giant cells. The accelerated karyokinesis that was desynchronised from cytokinesis represented another manifestation of the failure of cell cycle arrest at spindle checkpoint, triggering a premature and abnormal spindle dynamics. A low Ginir RNA level may be necessary to maintain a normal and synchronised spindle dynamics, karyokinesis, and cytokinesis within these cells. Defects in cytokinesis and karyokinesis are known to induce chromosomal and genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref042">42</xref>]. In summary, these data show that excess Ginir RNA expression causes centrosomal defects and genomic instability, leading to mitotic dysregulation.</p>

<title>Ginir RNA modulates centrosome function by interacting with Cep112</title>
<p>A multitude of lncRNAs are known to mediate their functions by interacting directly with specific protein targets within cells. To determine whether such target proteins could be identified for Ginir RNA, we followed the approach of using biotin-labelled RNA affinity pull-down and RNA-immunoprecipitation (RIP) assays. In the pull-down assay, 5′-biotin-labelled full-length Ginir RNA was incubated with protein lysates prepared from various cell types for possible interactions to occur, and then, the proteins bound to Ginir RNA were pulled down by streptavidin capture beads. This strategy is detailed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">Fig 9A</xref>. The bound proteins recovered from the pull-down complexes were identified by mass spectrometry (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s014">S2 Table</xref>). Frequently detected interacting proteins of Ginir RNA obtained from NIH/3T3, NIH/3T3-Ginir cells, and mouse embryonic brain tissues were shortlisted on the basis of their high confidence index for matrix-assisted laser desorption ionisation time-of-flight mass spectrometry (MALDI-TOF) and sorted on the basis of their computed interaction scores using bioinformatics tools like RPISeq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref043">43</xref>] and catRAPID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref045">45</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s012">S1 Text</xref>). The data from multiple independent experiments using cells from different tissue sources and cultured cell lines consistently demonstrated Cep112, a centrosome-associated protein, as a strong interacting partner for Ginir RNA, as it had the highest interaction score (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s012">S1 Text</xref>). Cep112 (the centrosomal protein of 112 kDa), also known as <italic>Ccdc46</italic> or <italic>Macoco</italic>, is a centrosomal protein with ATPase domain and has 18 possible splice variants that can give rise to 12 protein isoforms (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). We found that NIH/3T3 cells expressed multiple isoforms of Cep112, and most prominent amongst them were the 112-, 66-, and 28-kDa isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">Fig 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9C Fig</xref>). This raised the question if some or all the Cep112 isoforms were interacting with Ginir RNA. The biotin RNA pull-down assays identified one prominent interacting isoform of 112-kDa size for Ginir RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">Fig 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9D Fig</xref>). Another isoform of Cep112 was of 66-kDa size, and it also showed interaction with Ginir, though detection of this isoform expression varied with the antibody source used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9D Fig</xref>). The interaction of Cep112 appeared specific to Ginir RNA, as other noncoding RNAs like HOX transcript antisense RNA (Hotair) and Giniras failed to interact with the same protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">Fig 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9D Fig</xref>). Similarly, another unrelated RNA from <italic>Xenopus</italic> species, termed as the Xenopus elongation factor (XEF) RNA, failed to interact with Cep112 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">Fig 9C</xref>). To eliminate the possibility of Ginir RNA binding nonspecifically to any protein, we performed blotting with β-tubulin antibody and found that there was no interaction of Ginir RNA with β-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">Fig 9C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9D Fig</xref>).

<title>Ginir RNA interacts with Brca1 and Cep112 proteins to affect their expression levels and cellular redistribution</title>
<p>The important components of the DNA damage response pathway are the twin repair proteins Brca1 and Brca2. Loss-of-function mutations in Brca1 and Brca2 result in increased mutation rates and induction of genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref047">47</xref>]. Low Brca1 protein expression levels are frequently found in various transformed cells or tumour cells. Consistent with this observation, we found a decreased expression level of Brca1 protein in NIH/3T3-Ginir cells as compared to NIH/3T3-EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g007">Fig 7I</xref>). We therefore sought to determine whether a low level of Brca1 expression in these cells was induced because of high levels of Ginir RNA expression. For this, we performed biotin RNA pull-down experiments using biotinylated Ginir RNA followed by immunoblotting with Brca1 antibody. In these experiments, a physical interaction of Ginir with Brca1 in vitro could be detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s010">S10A Fig</xref>) in elute II but not in elute I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10A</xref>).

Similarly, with RIP performed using two independent NIH/3T3-Ginir RNA expressing clones A and B, we obtained evidence for a weaker interaction of Ginir RNA with Brca1 as compared to Cep112 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10B and 10C</xref>).

<p>Besides its involvement in DNA repair, Brca1 protein has roles in centrosome function, and in cooperation with other centrosomal proteins, it plays a vital role in the nucleation and assembly of microtubules during chromosomal segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref048">48</xref>]. For instance, Brca1 protein regulates centrosome duplication and cytokinesis by interacting with other centrosomal proteins like Obg-like ATPase 1 (OLA1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref049">49</xref>], ninein-like protein(Nlp) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref050">50</xref>], and γ-tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref051">51</xref>]. These reports and our data prompted us to examine if interactions of Ginir RNA occur with either Cep112 and Brca1 proteins independently of each other or whether the Cep112 protein interacts with Brca1 protein. To determine this, we performed protein docking analysis using ZDOCK tool and found significant docking scores suggestive of a stable interaction between the C-terminal of Brca1 protein with a domain near the C-terminal region of Cep112 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10E</xref>). Next, to investigate the interaction between Cep112 and Brca1 proteins, we performed coimmunoprecipitation of Cep112 with Brca1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10F</xref>) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10G</xref>). Here, we found a strong interaction between these two proteins in NIH/3T3 cells. In another set of experiments, we overexpressed Flag-Cep112 in NIH/3T3 cells and obtained stable clones of cells expressing Flag-Cep112 protein, as was confirmed by western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10H and 10I</xref>). The interaction was further validated in Flag-Cep112-expressing cells, wherein we demonstrated coimmunoprecipitation of Brca1 with Flag tag antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10J</xref>) and vice versa (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s010">S10B Fig</xref>). A weaker interaction of Cep112 protein with Brca1 protein was found in NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10K</xref>). In NIHGinir-shGinir RNA knock-down cells, the interaction of Cep112 with Brca1 was significantly restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10K</xref>). These data strongly indicate that Cep112 and Brca1 proteins interact strongly in NIH/3T3-EV or NIH/3T3-Ginir-shGinir1 knock-down cells, but the interaction is weaker in NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) cells, where Ginir RNA expression level is high.</p>
<p>The localisation of Brca1 to the centrosomes was distinctly evident by coexpression of Brca1 with centrosomal marker protein γ-tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10L</xref>). Further, we detected interaction of Cep112 protein with Brca1 protein in centrosomes only in the NIH/3T3-EV cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10M</xref>) but not in the NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) cells. This could mainly be attributed to the fact that each of these two proteins was mislocalised from the centrosomes in these cells. Besides normal localisation of Brca1 to the nucleus, there was a specific enrichment of Brca1 protein to the centrosomes in NIH/3T3-EV cells. In contrast, in NIH/3T3-Ginir cells, Brca1 was seen mainly in the nucleus but was entirely absent from the centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10N</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s010">S10E Fig</xref>). The bioinformatics tools like CatRAPID also showed high interaction propensity (= 37) as well as high discriminative power (= 85) of Brca1 to bind to Ginir RNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s010">S10F Fig</xref>). By RNA-FISH, we obtained a specific localisation of Ginir RNA to the perinuclear region of the cells that may be centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10O</xref>). These data assume importance and may have significance in proliferation and oncogenesis, as this is the first evidence, to our knowledge, demonstrating interaction of two proteins Cep112 and Brca1 with each other and their dynamic localisation into centrosome, nuclear, and cytoplasmic compartments.</p>

<sec id="sec014">
<title>Ginir RNA disrupts interaction between Brca1 and Cep112 proteins</title>
<p>Next, we asked (1) as to how a higher Ginir RNA level induced a lower expression level of Brca1 and Cep112 proteins and (2) whether interaction of Cep112 protein with Brca1 protein was mediated through Ginir RNA. For this, we prepared cell lysates from NIH/3T3-Ginir cells (stable cell lines NIH-Ginir A, B, and C) and divided each of the protein lysates into two parts; one was treated with RNase mix (A, H, and III) to deplete RNA from them, and the second part received RNase inhibitor (RNasin) to protect the integrity of all RNAs present. When we used a specific Brca1 antibody to pull down Brca1 from each of these two samples, we found that the Brca1–Cep112 protein complex was present in the Rnase-treated cell lysates but was nearly absent in the lysates that were pretreated with RNasin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">Fig 10P</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s010">S10C and S10D Fig</xref>). This demonstrated that binding of an RNA to the Cep112–Brca1 protein complex disrupted their interaction or that this interaction did not occur in the presence of the RNA. In conclusion, we provide a strong evidence that a higher amount of Ginir RNA impairs interaction of Cep112 and Brca1 proteins, leading to their mislocalisation in the cells and thereby resulting in mitotic dysregulation (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g010">10N</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">9G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s009">S9H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s010">S10E</xref> Figs).</p>

<title>Genomic instability results from the down-regulation of Brca1 and Cep112 proteins</title>
<p>To understand as to how Ginir RNA regulates spindle dynamics and to generate independent evidence for the hypothesis of whether a collaboration of Cep112 protein with Brca1 protein is involved in this process, we examined NIH/3T3 cells in which the Cep112 and Brca1 proteins were individually down-regulated using two independent pools of specific small interfering RNAs (siRNAs) to each of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g011">Fig 11A and 11B</xref>). Cells that were depleted with Brca1 protein (NIH-siBrca1) showed complete absence of Cep112 protein, whereas cells depleted for Cep112 (NIH-siCep112) showed diminished levels of Brca1. These observations indicated that both these proteins were involved in their mutual stabilisation, and a knock-down of either proteins affected the cellular level of the other protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g011">Fig 11A and 11B</xref>). Thus, Ginir RNA, by interrupting interaction between these two proteins, destabilised them and decreased their individual levels. A feature that was common to the depletion of these two proteins was that the siBrca1- and siCep112-expressing cells had increased levels of γH2Ax (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g011">Fig 11C</xref>) and had an increased number of repair foci in their nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g011">Fig 11D–11G</xref>). Both the NIH-siCep112 (pool I) and NIH-siBrca1 (pool I) cells, when examined independently, shared a common feature, which was an overactivation of Ark1, and many cells showed abnormal spindle dynamics, a phenomenon also found in NIH/3T3-Ginir (A) cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g011">Fig 11H</xref>). Abnormal effects were also seen on centrosome numbers in NIH-siCep112 (pool II) and NIH-siBrca1 (pool II) cells, as was evident from ɣ-tubulin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g011">Fig 11I</xref>). Cells deficient in either Cep112 or Brca1 individually showed an abnormal number of centrosomes. We quantified these data regarding abnormalities in centrosome number and found that almost 40% of the NIH-siCep112 and NIH-siBrca1 cells showed &gt;2 centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g011">Fig 11J</xref>).</p>

<p>In summary, we found that Cep112–Brca1 interaction was perturbed upon Ginir RNA overexpression, and this had significant bearing on normal mitotic regulation, a process required for progression of high-fidelity cell division, as depicted in the form of a model in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g012">Fig 12</xref>. The same is explained schematically in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004204.s011">S11 Fig</xref>. The data reported here drive one to recognise the role of Ginir noncoding RNAs in mediating protein–protein interactions and regulating cell division with fidelity. Any dysregulation in these processes has high propensity to culminate in malignant transformation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we report the identification and functional characterisation of a novel lincRNA, termed Ginir because at high levels of its expression, it induces genomic instability in the target cells, leading to oncogenesis. We also provide mechanistic insight into its role as an RNA-promoting malignant transformation. This lincRNA was identified in Clone M3 mouse melanoma cells by a functional cloning approach, aimed to identify any activated, acutely transforming oncogene that might be functioning in Clone M3 melanoma cells. The expression clone inducing foci of transformed cells after transfection into the indicator NIH/3T3 recipient cells was found to contain a cDNA that was derived from a noncoding RNA named Ginir. Ginir is also expressed in cultured mouse embryonic fibroblast cells such as NIH/3T3 at low levels. However, when expressed at high levels in the same NIH/3T3 cells, it induces genomic instability and promotes cellular transformation. In this respect, it compares favourably with the known acutely transforming oncogenes that code for oncoproteins such as H-ras (Gly→Val), c-myc, et cetera. It is well known that c-myc expression remains at low levels in normal cells, but when the expression level of the c-myc protein is increased because of promotion of its transcription and translation by chromosomal translocations or retroviral promoter integration near to the gene, cellular transformation is promoted [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref053">53</xref>]. We found that Ginir RNA coexisted with a full-length antisense RNA (Giniras) in normal and malignant cells, suggesting that Giniras RNA may be a natural regulator of Ginir RNA functions in vivo. Ectopic expression of Giniras RNA using strong promoters did not show any special phenotype in NIH/3T3 cells per se, but when its overexpression was engineered in Ginir RNA–induced transformed NIH/3T3 cells, its oncogenic phenotype was blunted, supporting its role as a natural regulator of Ginir RNA function in vivo. We found evidence for Ginir RNA to have normal cellular functions, especially during mouse embryonic development, exhibiting a profile of expression that appeared to be developmentally regulated in a spatiotemporal manner.</p>
<p>Since the mammalian transcriptomes are rich in noncoding RNAs because of pervasive transcription, and since only about 2% of the noncoding RNAs are functionally annotated so far, it is very likely that many more lncRNAs will be found to act as protooncogenes. A gap exists in our knowledge about whether the majority of lncRNAs exhibit their biological function by following one or more mechanistic pathways or there are overlaps, or whether they elicit their transforming potential using mechanisms that are entirely distinct from those of protein-coding oncogenes. Hence, it is important to distinguish these RNA-mediated mechanisms from those of protein-mediated mechanisms of oncogenesis. Certainly, the mechanisms through which noncoding RNAs participate in transformation and tumour progression are varied and complex. Therefore, it is important to dissect out whether the lncRNAs regulate gene expression by functioning in <italic>cis</italic> or whether they act in <italic>trans</italic>. One of the recently reported Cancer Testis noncoding RNA, Thor, was shown to function as an oncogene by binding to an RNA-binding protein (RBP), insulin-like growth factor 2 mRNA-binding protein 1 (IGF2BP1), causing stabilisation of its target mRNAs like insulin-like growth factor 2 (IGF2) and CD44 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref054">54</xref>]. Another noncoding RNA, hypoxia-inducible factor 1-alpha (HIF-1a) coactivating RNA (HIFCAR), was shown to exert its oncogenic role as an HIF-1a coactivator and thereby regulate the HIF-1 transcriptional network, crucial for cancer development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref055">55</xref>]. Another noncoding RNA, noncoding RNA activated by DNA damage (NORAD), was induced after DNA damage and was shown to maintain genomic stability by sequestering PUMILIO proteins, which repressed the stability and translation of mRNAs involved in mitosis and DNA repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref056">56</xref>]. Most often, <italic>trans</italic>-acting lncRNAs function by modulating the activity or abundance of proteins or RNAs to which they directly bind. A key feature of these lncRNAs is that they often require stoichiometric interaction with their target molecules to exert measurable regulatory effects. Therefore, it is essential to carefully quantify the cellular copy number of lncRNAs and their target(s) and understand whether an lncRNA is competent to regulate many target genes or whether it is functioning by sequestering some specific abundant proteins. This necessitates the importance of maintaining a defined stoichiometry between the noncoding RNA molecules and their target RNAs or proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref057">57</xref>]. Yet, it is unclear as to how noncoding RNAs interact with their targets or as to how their expression influences cellular signalling. Although many studies have attempted to predict the putative mechanism of dysfunctional lncRNAs by using the bioinformatics approach, the lack of conserved sequences and the absence of functional motifs have posed complexity in defining their functions—especially so when the secondary or tertiary structures of lncRNAs play significant roles in their biological activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref058">58</xref>].</p>
<p>Ginir belongs to a small group of lincRNAs operating as relatively short-length RNA, in this case having only 612 nucleotides. The Ginir sequence is conserved in rat, implying that the sequence serves some essential function(s). The 557-nucleotides-long sequence isolated initially was later shown to be a subset of the 612-nucleotides-long Ginir RNA sequence, demonstrating that the 557-nucleotide sequence had all the information that was necessary and enough to induce oncogenic transformation in the cells. We used a 3-fold approach—namely, nuclease protection assay, strand-specific primer-mediated reverse transcription followed by PCR, and hybridisation in situ with fluorescently labelled LNA probes to establish that Ginir was transcribed in normal cultured cells as well as during early mouse embryogenesis. Its expression during early development indicated that Ginir transcription was required for normal cellular functions. While examining the relative abundance of Ginir transcripts in normal cultured cells and in tissues during early mouse development, we detected the presence of a complete antisense transcript to Ginir RNA in all of them. Because of its full antisense nature, we designated it as Giniras, which was also a noncoding RNA. During these experiments, we discovered that Ginir and Giniras lncRNAs existed as a pair of sense–antisense overlapping transcripts and that Giniras acted as a NAT to Ginir noncoding RNA. Several NATs are reported in mammals in accordance with the computational studies, which suggest that 15%–25% of mammalian genes are overlapping [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref059">59</xref>]. Several antisense transcripts to protein-coding genes like antisense intronic noncoding RASSF1 (ANRASSF1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref060">60</xref>], antisense noncoding RNA in the INK4 locus (ANRIL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref061">61</xref>], keratin type II cytoskeleton 7 antisense RNA 1 (KRT7-AS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref062">62</xref>], or Sirtuin 1 antisense RNA (Sirt1-AS) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref063">63</xref>] exist wherein they establish complex configurations as RNA–DNA duplexes and triplexes and thereby associate with regulatory proteins to affect the regulation of neighbouring regions. These regulatory mechanisms operate at pretranscriptional and transcriptional levels. A much less studied category is the class of natural double-stranded RNAs (ndsRNAs) that are expressed from interspersed genomic locations. Our data indicate that the Ginir/Giniras noncoding RNA pair is a validated example of ndsRNA. From a 500-Kb region located in chromosome 8, several hundreds of sense–antisense pairs are known to arise. For example, one pair from this region is shown to be expressed from chromosome 8q24.21, and it forms a stable ndsRNA molecule (nds-2a) that binds to regulator of chromosome condensation 1 (RCC1) and ras-related nuclear protein (RAN) and through the latter, with the mitotic RANGAP1-SUMO1-RANBP2 complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref064">64</xref>]. A similar phenomenon is reported in chick embryo development, wherein the stoichiometry in the expression of lncRNA male hypermethylated (MHM), and its antisense RNA is shown to be important for development of organs like gonads, limbs, heart, branchial arch, and brain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref065">65</xref>]. With a major number of noncoding RNAs not yet identified, it is possible a vast repertoire of ndsRNA exist, many of which could also be involved in regulating embryonic development and cell growth.</p>
<p>We provide evidence that the Ginir/Giniras pair exhibits contrasting effects on cell growth, like the other noncoding RNA pair X-inactive specific transcript (Xist)/Tsix that has opposing effects on X chromosome inactivation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref066">66</xref>]. This is like another lncRNA, ubiquitin carboxy-terminal hydrolase L1 (Uchl1), whose antisense Uchl1-AS expression is dependent on the embedded short interspersed nuclear element (SINEB2) (in its genomic loci) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref067">67</xref>]. Instead, a natural antisense RNA to MALAT1 is known to exhibit a feed-forward positive regulatory loop to MALAT1 by promoting its 3′ end cleavage and transcript maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref068">68</xref>]. Moreover, like the majority of lncRNAs, Ginir is also transcribed from a deserted region of the genome. Although these regions are largely considered as generating transcriptional noise, it is now known that these regions are rich in repeat elements, and they actively produce noncoding transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref069">69</xref>]. Although the factors governing evolution and the origin of noncoding RNAs are enigmatic, one possible factor driving lincRNA evolution and their biological functions is transposable element (TE) insertions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref070">70</xref>]. A significant fraction of lincRNAs, almost to an extent of 83% in humans and about 66% in mouse, contain an inserted TE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref071">71</xref>]. Rather, most of the mammalian genomes that include mouse and human are comprised of repetitive sequences such as TEs, tandem repeats (TRs), and local repeats (LRs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref070">70</xref>]. The locus for noncoding RNA FIRRE, which is required for pluripotency and adipogenesis, on the X chromosome is comprised of numerous LRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref072">72</xref>]. Analysis of the genomic locus of Ginir using genome browsers has revealed that the Ginir locus resides in the LINE1 region. It is recently shown that almost 50% of noncoding RNAs originate near long interspersed nuclear elements (LINE/L1) or SINE/Alu, and fewer than 15% originate in long terminal repeat (LTR)/endogenous retroviruses (ERVs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref073">73</xref>]. This is a minor disagreement from a report that has demonstrated significant enrichment of LTR/ERVs and depletion of LINE L1 and SINE/Alu at the start site of all lncRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref071">71</xref>]. It is considered that LINE/L1 sequences are enriched in brain-specific transcripts as compared with non-tissue-specific transcripts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref073">73</xref>], yet a statistical evaluation is lacking, and the data mining and analyses from different data sets for low-expression transcripts show variability. Hence, a detailed study is warranted about the presence of these repeats in noncoding RNAs. The fact that Ginir and Giniras are mainly expressed during embryonic development, are found enriched in the developing brain, and are present in other adult tissues (prominently Giniras is expressed) makes any kind of generalisation about a tissue-specific expression pattern or developmental presence of LINE1-encoded lncRNAs difficult. A new class of lncRNAs, termed chromatin-enriched RNAs (cheRNAs), that are tightly associated with chromatin is identified, and their presence is strongly correlated with expression of nearby genes. One of the members of this class of cheRNA is hemin-induced cheRNA downstream of foetal haemoglobin (HIDALGO), which is involved in erythroid differentiation. Werner and colleagues showed that these cheRNAs reside within class I TEs and are cell type specific and play important roles in lineage specification and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref074">74</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that during early embryonic development, Ginir transcripts were more abundant than the antisense Giniras transcripts. As the development progresses and organ development and differentiated tissues become more prominent, an up-regulation of Giniras expression is evident. Thus, it is plausible that a fine balance between the expression of Ginir and Giniras lncRNAs may be amongst the important molecular events during tissue morphogenesis in mouse embryos. LncRNAs like XIST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref075">75</xref>], H19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref076">76</xref>], HOTAIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref077">77</xref>], and regulator of reprogramming (RoR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref078">78</xref>] are described as vital players during embryonic development, but most of these RNAs are shown to be crucial during initial stages of development. XIST and H19 regulate processes like X chromosome inactivation and genomic imprinting, whereas HOTAIR and ROR affect the epigenetic changes by interacting with PRC2 complex and thereby determine embryonic stem cell fates. Except for some preliminary reports about lncRNAs like UCA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref079">79</xref>] and some recently reported ones like Pnky [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref080">80</xref>], FOXF1-adjacent noncoding developmental regulatory RNA (Fendrr) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref081">81</xref>], and AB063319 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref082">82</xref>], there are not many reports exemplifying the role of lncRNAs during tissue morphogenesis. One of the lncRNAs, termed lnc myogenic differentiation (MyoD), is encoded next to the MyoD gene and is directly activated by MyoD, thereby inhibiting proliferation and creating a permissive state for skeletal muscle differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref083">83</xref>]. Since the pace of cell division decreases and the state of differentiation increases during the later stages of embryonic development, we speculate that Ginir RNA modulates the pace of cell proliferation during development. Since Giniras is complementary to the entire length of Ginir, it can eclipse the entire sequence of Ginir by forming an RNA: RNA hybrid that thereby masks the functioning of important regulatory elements required for RNA: RNA or RNA: Protein interactions. More than 20 noncoding RNAs are linked to cancer. These include but are not restricted to lncRNAs like HOTAIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref084">84</xref>], Pvt1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref085">85</xref>], RoR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref086">86</xref>], prostate cancer–associated transcript 1 (PCAT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref087">87</xref>], ANRIL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref088">88</xref>], H19 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref089">89</xref>], nuclear enriched abundant transcript 1 (NEAT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref090">90</xref>], UCA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref091">91</xref>], lung adenocarcinoma transcript 1 (LUADT1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref092">92</xref>], colorectal cancer–associated lncRNA (CCAL) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref093">93</xref>], and many more. Certain lncRNAs like HOTAIR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref030">30</xref>], MALAT1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref094">94</xref>], and UCA1 are implicated in metastasis. Here, the involvement of most of them is more of an association than a cause of malignant transformation. For example, genomic loci encoding some of these lncRNAs are hotspots of epigenomic alterations, mutations, single-nucleotide polymorphisms, and somatic copy-number alterations, and thereby their expression levels are found enhanced in cancer. Expressions of some of these lncRNAs are indicators of good or bad prognostic factors, determinants of metastasis, and predictors of therapeutic responsiveness. However, Ginir RNA is distinct from all of them in that it is one of the unique lincRNAs that we unequivocally demonstrate to function singularly as an acutely transforming oncogene. Using several in vitro and in vivo assays, we have demonstrated that Ginir at high expression levels is tumourigenic and effectively potentiates migration, invasion, and metastasis and is also proangiogenic. Analyses of Ginir transcript abundance in oncogenically transformed cells show that it is more abundant in pathological cells compared to normal cells. Down-regulation of Ginir function by expressing Giniras RNA or using sequence specific shRNAs causes significant attenuation of tumourigenic potential of Ginir RNA–expressing cells.</p>
<p>To gain an insight into the mechanistic details of oncogenic transformation brought about by Ginir RNA, we created specific cell lines in which Ginir, Giniras, and Ginir+Giniras transcripts were expressed in abundance, using exogenously introduced transcript constructs. We also created cell lines in which a relatively high level of Ginir RNA was being expressed initially, which was subsequently brought down by coexpressing shRNAs that were specific to Ginir RNA sequences. The results from all these experiments are in accord with a model in which an excess of Ginir RNA was shown to be involved in deregulating a checkpoint that was involved in suppressing cellular proliferation or that was prolonging the cell cycle duration or both (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g012">Fig 12</xref>).</p>
<p>Our data indicated that when the level of Ginir expression in the tumour cells was down-regulated, or Ginir RNA was sequestered by its antisense partner Giniras, the cells apparently exited the transformed state in that they were no longer able to form credible tumours in mice. A coordinated loss of a set of related properties was indicative of a primary role that the Ginir overexpression had in orchestrating them. Because we detected the differential regulation of Ginir and Giniras transcription, our hypothesis that Ginir promoted proliferation, whereas Giniras retarded proliferation and promoted differentiation as a part of natural regulatory mechanism, becomes supported. Ginir-overexpressing cells showed a higher number of multinucleated giant cells having copious Ginir expression within nuclei. These types of giant cells are also formed during senescence, but they are not always multinucleated, and they are nonproliferative. The giant cells induced by Ginir, by contrast, were proliferative because mitotic and proliferative capacity was present in them, indicating that the nuclear divisions had been desynchronised from the cytokinesis. Thus, a specific property associated with Ginir-transformed tumour cells was that the mitotic dynamics persisted in the absence of cytokinesis, giving rise to giant multinucleated cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref095">95</xref>]. Such polyploid giant cells have also been cited as a repertoire of cancer stem cells and are likely responsible for their continuous generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref096">96</xref>].</p>
<p>In some cases of lncRNAs, an epigenomic alteration results from its nuclear localisation. We have demonstrated here that the multinucleated giant cells have an overabundance of Ginir RNA in their nuclei (more than the NIH/3T3-Ginir nuclei), suggesting that there may have been reprogramming of its epigenome. Thus, the giant multinucleated cells may represent cells qualified for dedifferentiation and most appropriate to acquire stem cell–like properties, which are hallmarks of high-grade tumours that were observable in the tumours induced by NIH/3T3-Ginir cells growing as xenografts in mice.</p>
<p>Our studies show that knocking down endogenous Ginir in normal cells diminished their proliferation. The mouse melanoma cells like B16F10, when made deficient for Ginir RNA, led to attenuation in their transformation-related properties in vitro and to tumourigenicity in vivo. These results underscore that Ginir and Giniras RNAs must be included in those control mechanisms for which proliferation needs to be modulated, and accordingly, the Ginir RNA and its negative modulator Giniras RNA expression during embryonic growth are coordinated. Mutations including deletions or genomic sequence alterations in Ginir or Giniras locus may prove to be embryonic lethal, precluding their isolation to delineate individual functions of these two RNAs using a genetic approach.</p>
<p>Our finding of an increased level of γH2Ax foci representing DNA double-stranded breaks being present in the cells with higher levels of Ginir RNA is the fallout of a compromised DDR pathway. A strong oncogenic stimulation apparently forces a cell to undertake a proliferation cycle without adequate preparation, thereby having increased episodes of replication fork stalling or replication fork collapse. Since single-stranded DNA and unreplicated ends accumulate beyond an accepted time delay, the surveillance machinery comprising the checkpoint kinases sense them as dsDNA breaks and activate DDR responses. To make this repair process efficient and error free, BRCA1 protein function is critically required. DNA damage after ionising radiation treatment results in accumulation of γH2Ax foci, which also activates the repair response, but an important difference is that growth arrest sets in immediately after the DNA damage. In the case of Ginir RNA overexpression, however, the γH2Ax foci accumulate in the nuclei without the onset of growth arrest. BRCA1 protein has multiple roles in cell physiology, and it interacts with a variety of proteins and noncoding RNAs in both cytoplasmic and nuclear compartments. During cell division, it performs a centriolar role in collaboration with the centrosome proteins like the Cep proteins. These proteins have been identified as components of the centrosome complex using a proteomics approach [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref097">97</xref>]. One of the members of the Cep family, Cep112, is demonstrated by us as a strong interactor of Ginir RNA. Our data demonstrate clearly that Brca1 stabilises the Cep112 protein by directly interacting with it and localising it to the centrosomal compartment. In the presence of an overabundant supply of Ginir RNA, both Brca1 and Cep112 proteins remain bound to the Ginir RNA and consequently Brca1:Cep112 protein–protein interaction is impaired. The disruption of this interaction also mislocalises the Cep112 and Brca1 proteins into different cellular compartments, thereby inhibiting their natural functions. We have provided convincing evidence in support of direct Cep112–Brca1 protein interaction, and further, we have demonstrated that interaction of Ginir RNA with Cep112 and Brca1 proteins deregulates centrosome functions and disrupts spindle assembly, thereby impairing mitotic regulation. Together, our data show that these processes promote defects in centrosome and spindle functions that include a desynchronised karyokinesis from cytokinesis, giving rise to multinucleated giant cells. All these effects together contribute to an increased genomic instability. Indeed, Brca1 is also known to interact with another lncRNA—DNA damage–sensitive RNA1 (DDSR1)—that is induced after DNA damage, wherein it promotes homologous recombination by regulating recruitment of DNA repair factors to double-stranded breaks after DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref098">98</xref>]. Several other lncRNAs like the recently identified NORAD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref056">56</xref>], another lncRNA-JADE, an activator of Jade1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref099">99</xref>], and RoR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref100">100</xref>] are critically involved in maintenance of genomic stability. Brca1, when recruited to centrosome, interacts with a plethora of centrosomal proteins like γ-tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref051">51</xref>], Nlp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref050">50</xref>], OLA1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref049">49</xref>], and KIAA0101 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref101">101</xref>], ensuring error-free centrosomal duplication and cytokinesis. Most importantly, a recent finding demonstrates binding of a Cep family protein (Cep72) to Brca1, thus disturbing centrosomal regulation by Brca1 and consequently triggering genomic instability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref102">102</xref>]. According to a recent report, Brca2 functions with Cep55 to regulate cytokinesis and ploidy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref103">103</xref>]. Recently, another member of the Cep family, Cep192, is shown to be important in the interphase-organising microtubules and cytoskeleton. Defects in targeting Cep192 for proteasome-mediated degradation by a member of the Fbxo family, F-box only protein 13 (Fbx13), was shown to cause accumulation of CEP192 and ɣ-tubulin at the centrosomes with the consequence of defects in cell motility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref104">104</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, we provide data on a novel interaction between Cep112 and Brca1 in NIH/3T3 cells, which is abrogated upon Ginir overexpression. Although interaction of Brca1 protein to other centrosomal proteins is known, this is a first report, to our knowledge, demonstrating interaction of Brca1 protein to a novel centrosomal protein Cep112. This interaction is important for stabilisation of the interacting proteins as revealed by our data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004204.g009">Fig 9I</xref>), and thus, any disruption in their interaction causes a decrease in the abundance of these proteins. Additionally, a high level of expression of Ginir RNA apparently affects the intracellular localisation of these proteins, thereby placing them away from their normal functional sites. We found that Cep112, which is a cytoplasmic protein with prominent localisation in the centrosome, was enriched in the nucleus in response to an elevated expression of Ginir RNA. The nuclear localisation of Cep112 could be an attribute of a decoying function of Ginir. In these cells, Brca1 protein was down-regulated and was nearly absent from the nucleus with a much-diminished presence in the centrosome in Ginir RNA–induced transformed cells. Thus, mislocalisation of these two proteins from their functional sites caused mitotic dysregulation and thereby served as crucial contributor to genomic instability.</p>
<p>Taken together, Ginir may be considered as an oncofoetal molecule like H19, as it shares a similar expression pattern with it during mouse embryonic development followed by its activation during adult tumourigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref105">105</xref>]. While our study establishes the effects of disequilibrium between Ginir/Giniras RNAs in cell growth regulation, still several questions remain unanswered, like the physiological roles of Ginir/Giniras RNAs during development. Undoubtedly, a detailed understanding of their biology would have tremendous ramifications in investigating the role of lncRNAs in fine-tuning gene expression and regulating tissue homeostasis. This could pave the way for designing novel therapeutic strategies for proliferative disorders like cancer. A detailed understanding of Ginir–Giniras equilibrium could open avenues for utilisation of NATs in disease, therapy, and molecular research.</p>

<p>The centrosome content was determined using the method described by Starita and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref113">113</xref>]. In brief, the centrosome number was determined for cells in both interphase and metaphase by staining them using ɣ-tubulin-specific antibody followed by Alexa Fluor–conjugated secondary antibody. The cells were visually scored for centrosome content using Leica SP5 II confocal system. At least 150 cells were counted, and cells with normal (1 to 2) and abnormal (&gt;2) centrosomes were individually scored, and a histogram was plotted as the percentage of cells with normal and abnormal centrosome numbers. The experiment was performed at least 3 times for each cell type.</p>

<title>Biotin RNA pull-down assay</title>
<p>Biotinylated pull-down assay with Ginir/Giniras probes was performed using the method described by McHugh and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref114">114</xref>]. Whole-cell lysates were harvested from 100-mm dishes. Ginir/Giniras specific riboprobes were synthesised using Megascript T7 Kit (Invitrogen) as per the manufacturer’s protocol. For preparing Ginir hot probe, 0.2 mM of biotinylated CTP (Biotin-14-CTP) (Invitrogen, #19519–016) was added to the reaction mix along with the PCR product to be used as the template. In another independent reaction, cold probe was synthesised using one-tenth of Bio-CTP as used in hot probe synthesis. Control unbiotinylated probe was synthesised with no biotin in the reaction mix. Using similar reaction mix, antisense (Giniras) and unrelated (Hotair, XEF) biotin probes were also synthesised using their respective PCR products as a template. All the tubes were incubated at 37 °C for 4 hours. After RNA synthesis, turbo DNase was added to digest template DNA. RNA was precipitated using the ammonium acetate precipitation method. All the probes along with controls were incubated with cell lysates and passed through streptavidin columns (μMACS Streptavidin Kit, Miltenyi Biotec, Bergisch Gladbach, Germany). Hot-bound, cold-bound, and no-biotin-probe-bound elutes were collected and resolved in SDS-PAGE along with the input fraction. The gel was stained with Coomassie Brilliant Blue. The specific protein bands were then purified by in-gel digestion (In gel digestion kit, Thermo Scientific) and analysed by MALDI-TOF. For validation of pull-down, immunoblotting of elutes with specific antibodies for Brca1 (1:2,000, Santa Cruz, # sc-7867) and Cep112 (1:2,000, Proteintech, # 24928-1-AP) was done.</p>

<title>RIP</title>
<p>Native RIP was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004204.ref115">115</xref>]. Briefly, cells were cross-linked using 1% formaldehyde for 30 minutes at RT and then pelleted. Later, cells were lysed using SDS lysis buffer (1% SDS, 10 mM EDTA, 50 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.1]) and RNasin (50 U/ml). Lysates were sonicated at high power for 4 minutes (30 seconds on-and-off cycle). After sonication, the insoluble elements were cleared by centrifugation at maximum speed for 10 minutes at 4 °C. The supernatant was then diluted 10-fold with IP buffer (0.01% SDS, 1.1% Triton X-100, 1.2 mM EDTA, 16.7mM Tris [pH 8.1], 167 mM NaCl, 1X PIC, RNasin [50 U/ml]). Then, 10% of the aliquot was preserved as an input sample and frozen at 80 °C until the reverse cross-linking step. The rest of the lysate was precleared with protein A/G beads and respective Isotype IgG overnight at 4 °C. One-ml aliquots were made of the diluted supernatant, and 0.5 μg of respective antibodies (Brca1, Cep112, and Gapdh) were added to each of the tubes. Respective Isotype IgG was used as negative control. Immune complexes were formed by slow mixing on a rotating platform at 4 °C overnight. Immune complexes were collected by adding 50 μl of protein A/G Agarose beads (Santa Cruz) followed by mixing by rotation at 4 °C for 2 hours. The beads were preblocked with yeast tRNA (Invitrogen, # AM7179) (50 μl of beads with 2 mg tRNA) by rotation mixing for 90 minutes at 4 °C. Immune complexes were then washed for 5 minutes each with low-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.1], 150 mM NaCl), high-salt buffer (0.1% SDS, 1% Triton X-100, 2 mM EDTA, 20 mM Tris HCl [pH 8.1], 500 mM NaCl), and LiCl buffer (0.25 M LiCl, 1% NP40, 1% deoxycholate, 1 mM EDTA, 10 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.1]). This was followed by two washes with TE buffer (Tris-EDTA [pH 8.0]). Immune complexes were then eluted in elution buffer (1% SDS, 0.1 M NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, RNasin—50 U/μl). Reverse cross-linking was done with 200 mM of NaCl at 65 °C for 2 hours. RNA isolation was done from elutes and input samples using TRIzol reagent (Invitrogen). Strand-specific cDNAs were prepared after DNase treatment followed by PCR amplification with gene-specific primers.</p>

<title>Protein coimmunoprecipitation</title>
<p>Cells were lysed in IP lysis buffer (Pierce) containing 1X PIC (Sigma-Aldrich). To evaluate RNA–protein interactions, 500 μg of lysate was treated with RNasin (200 U/ml), whereas the other 500 μg was subjected to treatment with RNase A (200 μg/ml, Sigma, # R4642), RNase III (0.05 U/μl, Invitrogen, #AM2290), and RNase H (5 U/μl, Invitrogen, # 18021–014) at 37 °C for 1 hour. The lysates were further used for immunoprecipitation using Dynabeads protein-A immunoprecipitation kit (Invitrogen, # 10006D), and the manufacturer’s protocol was followed. Two μg of antibodies to Brca1 (Santa Cruz, # sc-646), Cep112 (Santa Cruz, # sc-246163), Flag (Cell Signalling, # 2638), Rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz, # sc-2027), and Goat IgG (Santa Cruz, # sc-2028) were added to 50 μl of protein-A beads in 200 μl of antibody binding and washing buffer and incubated with rotation mixing at 4 °C for 6 hours. Antibodies were cross-linked to protein-A beads by incubating with dimethyl pimelimidate dihydrochloride (DMP) (Sigma, # D8388) in cross-linking buffer (0.2 M Triethanolamine [pH 8.2]) for 1 hour and 30 minutes at RT. Beads cross-linked with antibodies were then incubated with test lysates along with 1X PIC at 4 °C for 2 hours. Three brief washes in washing buffer were followed by elution in low-pH elution buffer (0.1 M glycine [pH 2.5]). The elutes were then run in SDS-PAGE along with input fractions and immunoblotted with respective antibodies.</p>

The data for NIH/3T3-Ginir(A) transfectant are shown at three different exposures (short time—exposure I, II) and exposure at longer time, whereas data for NIH/3T3-Ginir(B) transfectant are shown at only one exposure. Ub obtained post immunoprecipitation was also loaded along with eluted fractions. (E) Confocal microscopy images of cells stained with Brca1 antibody. Scale bars, 20 μm. Arrowheads point towards centrosomal localisation of Brca1. Nuclei were stained with DAPI. (F) CatRAPID-based prediction of interaction between Brca1 and Ginir represented as a map. Brca1, breast cancer type 1 susceptibility protein; Cep112, centrosomal protein 112; Ginir, Genomic Instability Inducing RNA; Giniras, antisense RNA to Ginir; IB, immunoblotted; Hotair, HOX transcript antisense RNA; IgG, immunoglobulin G; RNasin, RNase inhibitor; Ub, unbound fraction; XEF, Xenopus elongation factor.</p>
