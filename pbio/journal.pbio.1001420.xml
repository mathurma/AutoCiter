        <p>Comparative ChIP-seq data reveal adaptive evolution of insulator protein CTCF binding in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> species.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>Changes in the physical interaction between <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA sequences and proteins drive the evolution of gene expression. However, it has proven difficult to accurately quantify evolutionary rates of such binding change or to estimate the relative effects of selection and drift in shaping the binding evolution. Here we examine the genome-wide binding of CTCF in four species of <italic>Drosophila</italic> separated by between ∼2.5 and 25 million years. CTCF is a highly conserved protein known to be associated with insulator sequences in the genomes of human and <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Although the binding preference for CTCF is highly conserved, we find that CTCF binding itself is highly evolutionarily dynamic and has adaptively evolved. Between species, binding divergence increased linearly with evolutionary distance, and CTCF binding profiles are diverging rapidly at the rate of 2.22% per million years (Myr). At least 89 new CTCF binding sites have originated in the <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> genome since the most recent common ancestor with <italic>Drosophila simulans</italic>. Comparing these data to genome sequence data from 37 different strains of <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, we detected signatures of selection in both newly gained and evolutionarily conserved binding sites. Newly evolved CTCF binding sites show a significantly stronger signature for positive selection than older sites. Comparative gene expression profiling revealed that expression divergence of genes adjacent to CTCF binding site is significantly associated with the gain and loss of CTCF binding. Further, the birth of new genes is associated with the birth of new CTCF binding sites. Our data indicate that binding of <italic>Drosophila</italic> CTCF protein has evolved under natural selection, and CTCF binding evolution has shaped both the evolution of gene expression and genome evolution during the birth of new genes.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A large proportion of the diversity of living organisms results from differential regulation of gene transcription. Transcriptional regulation is thought to differ between species because of evolutionary changes in the physical interactions between regulatory DNA elements and DNA-binding proteins; these can generate variation in the spatial and temporal patterns of gene expression. The mechanisms by which these protein–DNA interactions evolve is therefore an important question in evolutionary biology. Does adaptive evolution play a role, or is the process dominated by neutral genetic drift? Insulator proteins are a special group of DNA-binding proteins—instead of directly serving to activate or repress genes, they can function to coordinate the interactions between other regulatory elements (such as enhancers and promoters). Additionally, insulator proteins can limit the spreading of chromatin condensation and help to demarcate the boundaries of regulatory domains in the genome. In spite of their critical role in genome regulation, little is known about the evolution of interactions between insulator proteins and DNA. Here, we use ChIP-seq to examine the distribution of binding sites for CTCF, a highly conserved insulator protein, in four closely related <italic>Drosophila</italic> species. We find that genome-wide binding profiles of CTCF are highly dynamic across evolutionary time, with frequent births of new CTCF-DNA interactions, and we demonstrate that this evolutionary process is driven by natural selection. By comparing these with RNA-seq data, we find that gain or loss of CTCF binding impacts the expression levels of nearby genes and correlates with structural evolution of the genome. Together these results suggest a potential mechanism of regulatory re-wiring through adaptive evolution of CTCF binding.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene regulation is a major driver in the generation of morphological diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Carroll1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-King1">[2]</xref>. Transcriptional regulators determine spatial and temporal patterns of mRNA level by binding to <italic>cis-</italic>regulatory DNA elements. Many previous studies have demonstrated that changes at the level of protein-DNA interactions can account for specific phenotypic differences observed in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Carroll1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Wray1">[3]</xref>. Genome-wide studies have shown that binding of transcriptional regulators evolves substantially between different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Borneman1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>. Although in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the binding profiles of some regulatory factors involved in embryonic development, such as the Twist protein, are relatively more conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Bradley1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref>. Yet it remains an open question to what extent such protein–DNA binding evolution is adaptively and functionally significant or whether it reflects drift. In order to address this question, regulatory factors must be mapped in multiple related species and the results interpreted in the light of intraspecific and interspecific <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory DNA variation.</p>
      <p>Insulator proteins participate in the marking of boundaries for genomic regulatory units by binding to DNA insulator elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Geyer1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Negre1">[13]</xref>. These protein–DNA complexes are thought to function as barriers against the spread of heterochromatin or to regulate enhancer–promoter communications by preventing inappropriate interactions, although the precise molecular mechanism by which they act is not known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Phillips1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Gaszner1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Valenzuela1">[15]</xref>. Recent studies have suggested that insulator complexes may also participate in the global nuclear organization of active and inactive chromatin domains via mediating intra-/interchromosomal interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Gerasimova1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Handoko1">[19]</xref>. The broad functions possessed by insulator proteins make them a key player in transcriptional regulation, and significant efforts have been made to elucidate where they interact with DNA in multiple species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Negre1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Cuddapah1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Kim1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Jiang1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>CTCF (CCCTC binding factor) is the only known DNA binding insulator protein conserved between human and fly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Moon1">[25]</xref>. In vertebrates, this 11 zinc-finger protein is shown to be crucial in processes of epigenetic imprinting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Murrell1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Bell1">[27]</xref>, X chromosome inactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Filippova1">[28]</xref>, and associated with various complex human diseases including cancer and diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Fu1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Demars1">[31]</xref>. Genome-wide studies revealed that CTCF widely associates with human chromosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Kim1">[20]</xref>, and its binding profile is reported as individual and allele specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-McDaniell1">[32]</xref> with considerable variation between different cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Cuddapah1">[18]</xref>. In <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, as one of the five known insulator proteins, CTCF binds to the well-characterized insulator elements in the <italic>Bithorax complex</italic> region, which demarcate different <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory units corresponding to different parasegmental expression patterns of three important developmental genes: <italic>Ubx</italic>, <italic>Abd-A</italic>, and <italic>Abd-B</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Karch1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Mihaly1">[36]</xref>. Genome-wide chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) studies performed in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> revealed a consensus motif similar to the human and vertebrate ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Negre1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Bushey1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Holohan1">[23]</xref>. Limited cell-type-specific binding of CTCF was also observed in these studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Negre1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Bushey1">[22]</xref>. The fact that CTCF is a conserved protein with a major role in gene regulation and genome organization makes it an appealing candidate to evaluate how changes in the DNA sequence drive conservation, birth, and death of functional CTCF binding sites and the subsequent impact of these changes on gene regulation. Further, a very recent comparative study in multiple mammalian lineages shows that CTCF binding evolution in mammals is likely to be driven by retrotransposon expansions and that newly gained CTCF binding events are functional <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>. However, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, it is not known whether CTCF binding evolution follows a similar pattern or if it is independent of transposable element (TE) activity.</p>
      <p>To study the evolution of genome-wide CTCF protein binding in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we carried out comparative ChIP-seq experiments in four closely related species: <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>. The three species <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> diverged from <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> about 2.5, 6, and 25 million years ago <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Powell1">[37]</xref>, respectively, providing the opportunity to observe binding dynamics in a context of increasing evolutionary distances.</p>

        <p>To map CTCF binding in the genomes of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, we used chromatin collected from white pre-pupae (WPP) at puparium formation, a developmental stage induced by rising titres of the metamorphosis hormone 20-hydroxyecdysone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-White1">[38]</xref>. WPP has easy-to-distinguish morphology, and this stage lasts only about 20 minutes, thus allowing the collection of developmentally synchronized animals within and between species.

        <title>CTCF Binding Evolves Rapidly</title>
        <p>A straightforward way to assess binding conservation or divergence is to directly compare the boundaries of identified peak regions between each species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s027">Table S7</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) with genome-wide alignment. However, by using independent analyses in each species, actual conserved binding sites are likely to be identified as diverged between species due to false negatives being scored as “diverged.” To avoid this problem and to quantitatively explore the evolutionary dynamics of CTCF binding profiles across species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), we developed a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–centric analysis approach to examine the between-species CTCF occupancy on orthologous DNA sequences in light of within-species binding variation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s006">Figure S6</xref>, also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In brief, instead of directly comparing the binding region boundaries between each species, the approach we took translated uniquely mapped sequence reads in the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species into <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s021">Table S1B</xref>), thus allowing quantitative modeling of within- and between-species read number data using an ANOVA-like linear categorical model to partition variances of local read number data in each binding region. We thus identified <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific, non–<italic>D. melanogaste</italic>r–specific, and shared binding events for each paired species accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s025">Table S5</xref>). Our method yields highly reliable conservation and divergence information of the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding sites between each species since the False Positive Rate (identifying shared binding sites as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> specific) of the linear categorical model is estimated to be 0.35% using simulated data (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and the overall analysis pipeline error rate (False Positive Rate plus False Negative Rate) is estimated to be less than 2% using a “gold standard” data set (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). However, since different <italic>Drosophila</italic> genomes have different assembly and annotation quality, which are all based on and are poorer than the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome, inevitably the translated read number data from some regions of the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species will be smaller than they would be in an ideal situation. As a result, there is generally reduced power in detecting non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific binding events compared to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific and shared binding events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s024">Table S4</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Evolutionary dynamics of CTCF binding profiles at the <italic>Bithorax complex</italic> region. The four colored wiggle file tracks show the ChIP CDP enrichment scores estimated from our quantitative analysis pipeline for the four species: <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (blue), <italic>D. simulans</italic> (green), <italic>D. yakuba</italic> (orange), and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> (purple). The four tracks are at the same scale, with the height of each curve at each coordinate denoting the enrichment score values. In the top panel, the blue arrows point to examples of conserved binding events across the four species, and the red arrows point to examples of diverged binding events between species. The fifth track shows the boundaries of previously identified insulator elements (in sky blue). The last track shows the genes in the genomic region. (B) Number of conserved and diverged binding events. From left to right, the three bar plots show the number of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific (pink), shared (blue), and non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (D.xxx, yellow) specific binding events between each of the species pairs (<italic>D. melanogaster/D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster/D. yakuba</italic>, and <italic>D. melanogaster/D. pseudoobscura</italic>) for all binding events possibly identified (All, left), Two-Way Orthologous Binding events (TWOB, middle), and Four-Way Orthologous Binding events (FWOB, right). TWOB is defined as a binding event identified in regions where the sequence identity between the two compared species is &gt;50%. FWOB is defined as a binding event identified in regions where the sequence identity across all four species is &gt;50%. (C) Linear increase of pair-wise binding divergence with species divergent time. The binding divergence is calculated as the percent of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding events not shared with the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species in each pair-wise comparison. Different shaped and colored points represent different groups of binding events as indicated by the legend. The red dashed line depicts the fitted linear regression line of TWOB binding divergence with divergent time. (D) Evolutionary groups of CTCF binding events. Top panel, representative dynamic binding profiles in the four <italic>Drosophila</italic> species (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, blue; <italic>D. simulans</italic>, green; <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, orange; <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, purple) illustrating examples of 15 mutually exclusive evolutionary groups of binding status. The height at each binding curve denotes the ChIP CDP enrichment score estimated from our analyses pipeline. For each evolutionary group, the <italic>y</italic>-axes of the four binding curves are at the same scale. The first row of the lower table shows the Boolean conservation score corresponding to the binding profiles, where 0 indicates absence of binding event and 1 indicates the presence of binding events. The second and third rows of the lower table summarize the number of all binding events (second row) and FWOB events (third row) falling into each evolutionary group. The last row of the lower table shows the inferred evolutionary age for different groups of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding events using Parsimony methods. * As for the evolutionary group with boolean conservation score 0,1,1,1, there is no instance identified in our analyses, so the representative binding profile in the figure is generated by artificially modifying another binding profile to represent the specific category.</p>

        <p>Because loss of orthologous sequences among species is often driven by large-scale genome evolution instead of local nucleotide substitutions or small insertion-deletions (indels) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Clark1">[40]</xref>, diverged CTCF binding events in regions with or without orthologous sequences have different biological interpretations. With a criterion of at least 50% sequence identity for orthology assignment, we identified binding events in orthologous regions between each species pair, which we refer to as two-way orthologous binding (TWOB). Similarly, we identified binding events in regions with orthologous sequence counterparts in all four species and refer to those as four-way orthologous binding (FWOB).</p>
        <p>With the analysis pipeline described above, we identified 2,267 binding events for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s025">Table S5</xref>). Since genome assembly imperfections and gaps among the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species lead to an underestimate of binding events in these genomes, we used the percentage of diverged binding events with respect to <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which has the best refined genome assembly map, to measure pair-wise binding divergence. Naturally, the rate of binding site evolution must be greater than the error rate (&lt;2%) in order to be detected. For the different species pair-wise comparisons with <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, approximately 20%, 30%, and 70% (19.67%, 29.11%, and 74.06% of all binding sites; 17.34%, 28.05%, and 68.37% of TWOBs; and 15.24%, 26.31%, and 68.06% of FWOBs) were identified as diverged from <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s025">Table S5</xref>). These values are not only consistent with each other but also highly comparable to divergence rates estimated with different parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s025">Table S5</xref>), or with a subset of sites filtered for high input sequence coverage (“high sequence coverage sites”) to ensure that the binding evolution was not an artifact of low sequence coverage in one or more of the species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s026">Table S6</xref>) or using alternative methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s027">Tables S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s028">S8</xref>). When plotted against species divergence time, these values show a clear linear trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). We fit a simple linear regression for the TWOBs, and we estimated the divergence rate of CTCF binding as 2.22% per Myr (Student's test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <italic>R</italic>-squared&gt;0.99). This divergence rate is lower than synonymous substitution rates (6.34% per Myr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Clark1">[40]</xref>) but substantially higher than the protein sequence divergence rate (1.19% per Myr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Clark1">[40]</xref>) and non-synonymous nucleotide substitution rate (0.4% per Myr, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Clark1">[40]</xref>) in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, indicating that, although constrained, CTCF binding evolves relatively rapidly. This linear pattern of binding divergence remains stable when different peak calling stringencies were applied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s025">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s026">S6</xref>).</p>
        <p>Estimates of binding divergence/conservation rates can depend on the choice of analysis methods, which have different associated false positive and false negative rates. In order to gain an unambiguous comparison of binding divergence between CTCF and other transcription factors in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, we also applied our analysis pipeline to previously published Twist comparative data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref> and reciprocally applied the He et al. method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref> to our data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s028">Tables S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s029">S9</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s030">S10</xref>). In both comparisons, we obtained a larger estimate of binding divergence in the CTCF data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s028">Tables S8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s029">S10</xref>), indicating that CTCF binding is evolving faster than binding of the developmental regulatory transcription factor Twist.</p>

        <title>New CTCF Binding Sites Originate Frequently</title>
        <p>By combining between-species binding appearance and absence results, we grouped CTCF binding events into 15 different evolutionary categories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Regardless of evolutionary category, we found that CTCF binding events are distributed similarly between various genomic locations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s031">Table S11</xref>), showing no biases in binding evolution according to genomic position. We next inferred the evolutionary age of each <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding site by assigning its origination on the <italic>Drosophila</italic> phylogeny with parsimony (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s032">Table S12</xref>). Whether we examined all binding sites or considered only FWOBs, more than 60% (1,533/2,267 for all binding and 655/1,030 for FWOBs) of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding sites originated after the split of the <italic>melanogaster</italic> group from <italic>pseudoobscura</italic> group, and thus less than 40% were inherited from the common ancestor of these two major clades (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Notably 89 FWOBs were newly gained specifically on the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), leading to a conservative estimate of ∼36 binding gains per million years (89 binding events/2.5 Myr since last common ancestor of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. simulans</italic>). Interestingly, there are only 39 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific new genes identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Chen1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Zhang1">[42]</xref>, resulting in an average of ∼16 gene gains per Myr. This result indicates that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> new regulatory elements bound by CTCF are evolving at a higher rate than new genes. In contrast to the large number of newly gained binding sites, there are no FWOBs identified as lost in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Although underdetection of non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding sites in our analysis could lead to failure in observing <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lineage-specific loss, the asymmetric patterns of CTCF binding site gains are also observed along the <italic>D. simulans</italic> branch (85 gains and five losses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), the <italic>D. yakuba</italic> branch (113 gains and 21 losses, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), or when taking only the three species in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> group into consideration (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s007">Figure S7</xref>) or when using only high-sequence coverage sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s033">Table S13</xref>), indicating that gain of binding is evolutionarily favored. This pattern is not likely due to ascertainment biases of highly conserved genomic regions associated with FWOBs, because we also observed large numbers of binding gains and small numbers of binding losses for binding events genome-wide (i.e., the pattern holds for sites that have not been filtered for sequence conservation) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s007">Figure S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s033">Table S13</xref>).

Because motifs are special sequence features associated with protein–DNA interactions, we next examined the relationships between motif evolution and CTCF binding evolution. For each species pair, we counted the number of species-specific motif occurrences in the corresponding orthologous sequences of each binding site. Binding sites that contained at least one motif in both sequences were defined to have conserved motifs.

        <p>We next examined genomic DNA variation associated with CTCF binding events for signatures of selection. We first assessed whether purifying selection may play a role in shaping CTCF binding evolution. Purifying selection acting on polymorphic variants is expected to keep them at lower frequencies in a population, leading to a relatively higher number of segregating sites and therefore a more negatively skewed Tajima's D value than expected under neutrality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Tajima1">[44]</xref>. We calculated Tajima's D using DNA polymorphism data from 37 <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> inbred lines (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.dpgp.org" xlink:type="simple">www.dpgp.org</ext-link>) for the core consensus binding motifs (CTCF-motif sites) identified within the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TWOBs and FWOBs. As expected, the distribution of Tajima's D values for nonsynonymous sites is negatively skewed compared to the synonymous sites (Wilcox rank sum test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;2.2e-16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). This pattern also extends to the CTCF-motif sites when they are compared to synonymous sites in neighboring protein-coding genes (Wilcox rank sum test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, the distribution of Tajima's D values for CTCF motifs within CTCF binding sites is comparable to 3′UTR and 5′UTR sequences, while it is significantly more negatively skewed than intergenic sequence (Wilcox rank sum test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.02). Thus, CTCF binding appears to be subject to stronger purifying selection than synonymous and intergenic genomic sequences. To explore whether these trends varied depending on evolutionary conservation of binding, we separated the TWOB CTCF-motif sites into subgroups associated with conserved binding (conserved TWOB) and diverged binding (diverged TWOB). We observed a more negatively skewed Tajima's D distribution in the former group (Wilcox rank sum test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar analyses of CTCF motifs within FWOB binding sites were carried out by designating binding events with evolutionary age &lt;2.5 Myr as young FWOB and &gt;6 Myr as old FWOB. Again a more negatively skewed Tajima's D distribution was observed in the old FWOB group (Wilcox rank sum test, <italic>p</italic> = 0.11; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). We observed similar patterns of Tajima's D in the CTCF-201 sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s009">Figure S9</xref>) as well as in high-sequence coverage sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s010">Figure S10</xref>). These results indicate that the more conserved CTCF binding sites are subject to stronger purifying selection and therefore are more constrained than the less conserved sites, as one might expect.</p>
        <p>Using the same polymorphism data and employing <italic>D. yakuba</italic> as an outgroup, we counted the number of fixed and polymorphic nucleotides within CTCF motifs present within different classes of binding sites. Overall, significant excesses of fixed nucleotide changes are observed in groups of CTCF binding sites (except FWOB and Old_FWOB groups) when compared to synonymous nucleotide changes at nearby genes (Chi-square test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s034">Tables S14</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s035">S15</xref>), indicating that positive selection has shaped CTCF binding evolution. By extending the McDonald-Kreitman test framework <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-McDonald1">[45]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Bierne1">[47]</xref>, we estimated α, the proportion of between-species divergence fixed by positive selection for each subgroup of sites (as described earlier for Tajima's D; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We found that the young FWOB sites show a significantly higher shared α value (0.25, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) than the old FWOB sites (0.25 versus −0.0673; log likelihood ratio test for group comparison, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), and a similar trend was observed between diverged TWOB (0.2237, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and conserved TWOB sites (0.2237 versus 0.0526; log likelihood ratio test for group comparison, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Since synonymous sites are usually constrained by codon usage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Powell2">[48]</xref>, we also used a set of pre-characterized small introns that are believed to have evolved neutrally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Parsch1">[49]</xref> as a neutral reference. Again we observed that the diverged TWOB (0.3598, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) and young FWOB sites (0.4265, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) shared significantly higher α values than their counterparts (log likelihood ratio test for group comparison, all <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). The same pattern remains when using <italic>D. simulans</italic> as an outgroup (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s012">Figure S12</xref>) or using CTCF-201 sites for the calculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s011">Figure S11</xref>). This trend of higher shared α from more diverged sites is also observed in the high-sequence coverage sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s013">Figure S13</xref>). These observations indicate that gain of new CTCF binding events are likely driven by positive selection. To further confirm the role of positive selection in the birth of new CTCF binding events, we carried out a multilocus HKA test (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Hudson1">[50]</xref>; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). By comparing the young sites to the old sites as well as the neutral small introns, we observed significantly reduced polymorphism in the young sites, suggesting strong directional positive selection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s036">Tables S16</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s037">S17</xref>).</p>
        <p>In order to test whether this phenomenon of selection-driven binding evolution is CTCF specific or more general, we applied the same population genetic analysis to the available comparative data for Twist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref>. Consistent with the higher binding conservation level, we observed a stronger purifying selection signal and weaker positive selection signal in Twist binding sites than in CTCF binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s020">Figure S20</xref>). Interestingly, we found a similar pattern of a higher positive selection signature in the diverged binding sites than the conserved sites for Twist (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s020">Figure S20</xref>).</p>

        <title>CTCF Binding Evolution Is Associated with Expression Divergence</title>
        <p>Since CTCF participates in transcriptional control through organizing and delineating regulatory domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Geyer1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Negre1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Handoko1">[19]</xref> and gain of CTCF binding appears to be driven by positive selection, naturally we wondered if there were any detectable effects on gene expression. We measured mRNA transcript abundances for WPP samples in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> using RNA-seq (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s021">Table S1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s018">Figure S18</xref>) and estimated the interspecies expression change for every orthologous gene pair between <italic>D. melanogaster/D. simulans</italic> and <italic>D. melanogaster/D. yakuba</italic> through a generalized linear model framework, cataloging the evolutionary status of each gene as either “stable” or “diverged” (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) thereafter.</p>
        <p>We focused on the nearest genes to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> TWOB sites and grouped them into genes near conserved TWOB sites and genes near diverged TWOB sites. Since diverged TWOBs resulted from either binding gain in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or binding loss in <italic>D. simulans</italic> or <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, regulation of these genes by CTCF might have been altered. Consistent with this hypothesis, the proportion of genes with diverged expression near diverged TWOB sites is significantly greater than near conserved TWOB sites (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). We obtained a similar result when comparing between genes near young FWOB sites and genes near old FWOB sites (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Moreover, the proportions of genes with diverged expression near conserved TWOB and near old FWOB sites are smaller than the genome-wide average (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>). Such correlation is also observed when using microarray data for inferring gene expression divergence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s014">Figure S14</xref>) as well as when using high-sequence coverage sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s015">Figure S15</xref>).

            <p>(A–B) CTCF binding evolution is associated with gene expression evolution. The bar plots show the proportion of genes with diverged expression between (A) <italic>D. melanogaster/D. simulans</italic> and (B) <italic>D. melanogaster/D. yakuba</italic> comparisons associated with different groups of CTCF binding sites: Genome-wide (black), Conserved TWOB (pink), Diverged TWOB (green), Old FWOB (orange), and Young FWOB (light purple). The table below each bar plot shows the number of genes with diverged and conserved gene expression in the corresponding comparisons and associated with the corresponding CTCF binding sites. For each groups of CTCF binding sites, the associated genes are the union of the nearest gene to each binding site. The evolutionary status of gene expression (conserved or diverged) is determined using triplicate WPP mRNA-seq data through a generalized linear regression framework. Label abbreviations are the same as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Significance levels: * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; one-sided Fisher's exact test. (C–E) CTCF binding evolution is correlated with new gene origination. The four colored wiggle tracks in each of the plots show the ChIP CDP enrichment scores of the four species (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, blue; <italic>D. simulans</italic>, green; <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, orange; <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>, purple) across different genomic regions.

Indeed, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, adaptive gene expression has been linked to adaptive <italic>cis-</italic>DNA evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Holloway1">[53]</xref>. We thus hypothesized that the stronger positive selection signature observed in the diverged TWOBs might stem from the sites being associated with diverged expression that has more directly been subject to natural selection. We calculated and compared α values for two additional subgroups of TWOB sites: diverged TWOBs near genes with divergent expression and conserved TWOBs near genes with conserved expression. Consistent with our hypothesis, we observed a larger difference in α values between these two subgroups than between all conserved and diverged TWOBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s016">Figures S16</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s017">S17</xref>).</p>

        <title>CTCF Binding Evolution Is Correlated with the Origin of New Genes</title>
        <p>CTCF binding sites in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have been associated with syntenic break points, consistent with their role in delineating the regulatory architecture of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Negre1">[13]</xref>. We wished to determine whether CTCF binding evolution correlates with any other genome structural evolution. New genes are defined as genes recently originated in a clade, and they provide the opportunity to add new functions to a genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Long1">[54]</xref>. We found that among 42 young genes that are essential for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Chen1">[41]</xref>, eight show the origin of new CTCF binding sites within 5 kb flanking regions. All eight show phylogenetic correspondence between the appearance of newly evolved CTCF binding sites and the appearance of the associated new gene. Seven new genes exhibit a new CTCF binding site near their 3′ end. For example, <italic>TFII-A-S2</italic> (CG11639) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Chen1">[41]</xref> is a newly originated gene through gene duplication in the <italic>melanogaster</italic> subgroup, and a CTCF binding site is observed near its 3′ end in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. simulans</italic>, and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> but not in <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). A similar example is the gene <italic>CheB93a</italic> (CG15503) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Chen1">[41]</xref>, which originated before the split of <italic>melanogaste</italic>r subgroup from <italic>D. ananasae</italic> as a tandem duplicate of its parental gene <italic>CheB93b</italic> (CG31438) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001420-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). We also found a CTCF binding site near the 3′ end of the RNA gene <italic>sphinx</italic> (CR34154) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Wang1">[55]</xref>, which originated in the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> branch and is implicated in courtship behavior of male flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Dai1">[56]</xref>. The association of newly evolved essential genes with newly evolved CTCF binding sites is highly significant compared to old essential genes with conserved CTCF binding sites (Kolmogorov-Smirnov test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;1e-6; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s019">Figure S19</xref>).</p>
        <p>How are new binding sites generated? Point mutations are observed in numerous case studies linking <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory sequence change to phenotypic consequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Wray1">[3]</xref> and therefore are considered as the main source of binding site evolution in many theoretical works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Carter1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-MacArthur1">[59]</xref>. In a mammalian CTCF comparative study, Schmidt et al. presented compelling evidence that CTCF binding sites are driven by retrotransposon expansions, especially in the rodent lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>. We investigated whether TEs might also be associated with CTCF binding site evolution in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. For all the CTCF binding sites identified in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, only slightly more than 1% (27 out of 2,267) overlap with annotated TEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Kaminker1">[60]</xref>. This rate is extremely low compared to rodent species in which around 20% of CTCF binding sits are contained within SINE elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>, indicating that it is not the primary mode of generating binding site diversity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. However, for the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> lineage-specific binding sites, approximately 6% (15 out of 261) of these sites overlap with a TE, resulting in a significant excess of new binding sites overlapping with TEs (Fisher's exact test, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s038">Table S18</xref>). Thus it is possible that a minority of newly arisen CTCF binding sites have resulted from TE insertions, but the majority of new binding sites are likely originating through mutation selection processes at the nucleotide level.</p>

      <p>Ever since King and Wilson proposed the importance of gene regulation for phenotypic variation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-King1">[2]</xref>, evolution of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements has been under intensive investigation with an emphasis on enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Ludwig1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Hare1">[62]</xref> and transcription factor binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Borneman1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref>.

Despite their functional importance, the origin and evolution of insulator complexes remained largely uncharted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Raab1">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Heger1">[64]</xref>. Only very recently was the first comparative ChIP-seq study on CTCF in mammalian species published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>. Here, we presented a formal evolutionary genetic analysis of CTCF-related insulator elements in multiple <italic>Drosophila</italic> species.</p>
      <p>We found that CTCF binding is highly evolutionarily dynamic, with about 70% of binding events diverged between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>. This high level of evolutionary divergence is consistent with a recent mammalian study, in which the CTCF binding conservation between human and mouse was estimated to be around 30% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>. While in mammalian species, CTCF binding profiles are more conserved than tissue-specific transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>; in <italic>Drosophila</italic> species, we observe higher binding divergence of CTCF than the developmental transcription factor Twist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref>. In fact, the high degree of binding divergence observed in liver-specific transcription factor CEBPA and HNF4A has led to a proposal of neutral drift underlying binding evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt1">[7]</xref>. However, the population genetic analysis of binding divergence of both the Twist data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref> and our CTCF data indicates that both purifying and positive selection are active forces in CTCF binding evolution. Although previous studies on <italic>Drosophila</italic> noncoding DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Andolfatto1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Haddrill1">[65]</xref> and DNA foot-printing-derived TFBS sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He2">[66]</xref> have suggested the role of positive selection, here we present the first genome-wide evidence in support of positive selection using protein-binding-associated DNA mapped in vivo.</p>
      <p>Our observation that young binding sites exhibit a signature of positive selection mimics the pattern observed with young genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Chen1">[41]</xref>, indicating that the origination of new binding sites is driven by positive selection. Further, the association between CTCF binding divergence and gene expression divergence indicates that change in CTCF binding has functional consequence. The fact that CTCF binding origination in multiple species coincided with new gene appearance also reinforces this functional view of binding change. The binding changes of this insulator protein may well result in regulatory rewiring through structurally redefining regulatory domains. We predict that this might be a universal mechanism in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory evolution since CTCF protein is highly conserved across the metazoans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Heger1">[64]</xref>. Indeed, in mammalian species, lineage-specific CTCF binding sites are observed to demarcate both chromatin and gene expression domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Schmidt2">[9]</xref>. Consistent also with the functional relevance of evolutionary changes in CTCF binding profiles, we observed that old and conserved CTCF binding sites are subject to stronger purifying selection and that expression levels of genes near these conserved sites are less likely to diverge. Together these observations indicate that functional constraints maintain conserved binding. This meshes well with the study on Twist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-He1">[8]</xref>, in which He et al. found that the most developmentally important genes in early embryo development have the most conserved Twist binding. In summary, we have provided evidence that the evolution of CTCF binding in <italic>Drosophila</italic> species is adaptive.</p>

We then normalized the CDP scores by multiplying corresponding ratio scores generated according to sequencing depth, and for each species, we calculated the mean CDP enrichment score (defined as the mean CDP score of ChIP samples minus mean CDP score of input samples) and mean CDP fold enrichment score (defined as the ratio of mean CDP of ChIP samples over mean CDP score of input samples). We performed a permutation-simulation procedure to empirically find the threshold values for the mean CDP enrichment score. We first permutated the experimental label (“ChIP” or “input”) of the CDP scores and then randomly sampled 10,000 coordinates to obtain their mean CDP enrichment score; we repeated the process 100 times and built a “Null” distribution for mean CDP enrichment scores. The 99th percentile of the positive values of the distribution is taken as our threshold for peak calling, which ensures an FDR&lt;1%. We performed peak segmentation using the threshold in a way similar to TAS (Tiling Analysis Software, Affymetrix). We identified regions with at least 50 bp above the threshold and merged neighboring regions if the distance in between is less than 100 bp. We then filtered out peak regions for which the summit coordinate had a mean CDP fold enrichment score of less than 2. We have also calculated, for each identified peak region, the q value (Poison <italic>p</italic> value after multiple testing correction) associated with read number enrichment between ChIP and input samples for each species using raw read count data, and all q values&lt;0.001.</p>
        <p>The summit peak coordinates of each identified peak regions were used to infer genomic positions of all the binding events. We designated a CTCF binding event/site as “intronic” or “exonic” if the summit coordinate is within boundaries of an annotated intron or exon, respectively. The remaining binding events/sites were then categorized into “promoter” or “intergenic” groups based on the distance of the peak summit coordinate to the nearest gene transcription start site (TSS): if the distance is &lt;1 kb, we labeled it as “promoter”; otherwise, “ intergenic.”</p>

          <title>2. The <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–centric quantitative analysis pipeline</title>
          <p>We developed a <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–centric quantitative analysis pipeline to partition read count data variation within and between species and to directly identify conserved and diverged peaks between each pair of the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species and <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (<italic>D. simulans</italic>/<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba/D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>D. pseudoobscura/D. melanogaster</italic>). Briefly, we translated all 36 bp uniquely mapped sequence reads in non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> (i.e., <italic>D. simulans</italic>, <italic>D. yakuba</italic>, and <italic>D. pseudoobscura</italic>) species into <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> genome using LiftOver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001420-Kuhn1">[70]</xref> with all default parameters, except a match of 0.5. We then generated CDP scores using the LiftOver sequence reads for each non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species using QuEST (version 2.0). For each species pair considered, the CDP scores from each sample were then normalized by multiplying a normalizing value calculated as follows:<disp-formula id="pbio.1001420.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001420.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>
          <p>An ANOVA-like linear categorical model described below was then applied to the normalized CDP scores at each coordinate to obtain species-specific ChIP enrichment score estimates, difference of species-specific ChIP enrichment score estimates (the interaction term), and their associated <italic>p</italic> values.<disp-formula id="pbio.1001420.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001420.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>In the model, Y is defined as the observed sequence data, by inputting the normalized CDP scores transformed from sequence read count data of the two species at a specific genomic coordinate. <italic>Experiment</italic> here is a categorical variable (dummy variable) indicating the CDP score source as ChIP or input; <italic>Species</italic> is the other categorical variable, indicating the species source of the CDP score (either <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> or <italic>non</italic>–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>); <italic>Experiment×Species</italic> is the interaction term between experiment types and species types. <italic>B<sub>E</sub></italic>, <italic>B<sub>s</sub></italic>, and <italic>B<sub>I</sub></italic> are the associated coefficients with the variables to be estimated, and <italic>ε</italic> is the residual error term.</p>
          <p>We then smoothed these tracks of ChIP enrichment score estimates as well as the −log10 transformed <italic>p</italic> values for each chromosome by averaging 100 bp sliding windows with each step moving 1 bp. We first identified candidate regions of ChIP enrichments in both species. We then directly identified <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific binding sites, non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific binding sites, and shared binding sites. For a binding peak to be identified as shared, it must satisfy the following two requirements: (1) the ChIP enrichment scores in both species are above the threshold and (2) the <italic>p</italic> values associated with ChIP input comparison are significant (−log10 transformed <italic>p</italic> value&gt;20). We took a conservative approach in identifying diverged binding sites. For a binding peak to be identified as <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific, it must satisfy the following three conditions: (1) the ChIP enrichment scores in <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> are above the chosen threshold (see below and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s025">Table S5</xref>), but in the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species, the score must be below the threshold; (2) the <italic>p</italic> value associated with the ChIP/input comparison must be significant; and (3) the <italic>p</italic> value associated with the species-specific ChIP effect must be significant. We similarly identified the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>–specific binding sites. We have used a set of different thresholds (0.35, 0.4, 0.5, and 1.0; also see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s025">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001420.s026">S6</xref>) to identify the diverged and conserved binding sites. The results presented in the main text are based on the threshold 0.4, which is empirically determined in the permutation-simulation procedure for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> data as described in the section “Peak Calling.” The reason to use this threshold are (1) it is empirically determined and (2) all the non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> data have been translated and normalized to be comparable to the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> data. We applied the other thresholds to test the robustness of observed patterns under looser criteria (0.35) and more stringent criteria (0.5 and 1.0).</p>
          <p>Using data simulation, we estimated the False Positive Rate (the rate of identifying conserved binding sites as diverged) of the linear model as 0.35%. The simulation was performed by pooling all the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> ChIP sample sequence reads together and randomly sampling the same number of reads for each ChIP replicate from the pool to build a simulated ChIP sequence read data set. Similarly, we obtained a simulated input data set. We performed our analysis pipeline with the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> data and the simulated data. Ideally, we would identify all the binding sites as shared between <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and the simulated data but found 0.35% of them are identified as diverged.</p>
          <p>As an alternative method, we also estimated the overall error rate (False Positive Rate plus False Negative Rate) for misidentifying the pair-wise evolutionary status of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding sites of the whole analysis pipeline as &lt;2% using a set of 100 randomly sampled CTCF binding sites that were manually curated as a “gold standard.” Briefly, we curated 100 random <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding peaks by manually inspecting the raw data wiggle file. We then looked at the corresponding othologous regions as well as 2 kb flanking region of the orthologous sequences in each non–<italic>D. melanogaster</italic> species. If we identified any peak using this method, we defined the <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding peak as shared, and otherwise, not shared. The percentage of discrepancy between human eye curation of raw count data and our analysis pipeline are taken as the overall error rate. From the pipeline with the empirical thresholds, we identified 2,267 binding sites for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, which shows &gt;95% overlap with the binding sites identified previously using triplicate data. We estimated pair-wise binding divergence as the percentage of <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> binding sites that is not shared with the other species.</p>

Briefly, we randomly picked two out of our three replicates for each species to match the structure of analysis He et al. performed.
