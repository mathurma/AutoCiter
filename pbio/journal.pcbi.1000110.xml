Yet fitness landscapes are vast and complex, and thus we know relatively little about the long-range constraints they impose on evolutionary dynamics. Here, we exhaustively survey the structural landscapes of RNA molecules of lengths 12 to 18 nucleotides, and develop a network model to describe the relationship between sequence and structure. We find that phenotype abundance—the number of genotypes producing a particular phenotype—varies in a predictable manner and critically influences evolutionary dynamics. A study of naturally occurring functional RNA molecules using a new structural statistic suggests that these molecules are biased toward abundant phenotypes. This supports an “ascent of the abundant” hypothesis, in which evolution yields abundant phenotypes even when they are not the most fit.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Evolutionary biology tells us much about the immediate fate of a mutation once it appears, but relatively little about its long-term evolutionary implications. Major evolutionary transitions from one trait to another may depend on a long sequence of interacting mutations, each arising by chance and surviving natural selection. In this study, we characterize the network of mutations that connect diverse molecular structures, and find that this network biases evolution toward traits that are readily produced by one or a short sequence of mutations. This bias may prevent the evolution of optimal traits, a phenomenon they call the “ascent of the abundant.”</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by a grant from the James F.

In contrast to Fisher's panselectionist views <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Fisher1">[10]</xref>, Wright suggested that fitness valleys—low-fitness genotypes separating high-fitness genotypes—may preclude simple incremental evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Wright1">[9]</xref>. He argued that adaptation depends on both the structure of the fitness landscape (that is, the spectrum of possible mutations) and demographic conditions. Since the 1930s, the theory of evolutionary constraints has matured, but is largely premised on hypothetical fitness landscapes or very local estimates of mutational effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Gavrilets1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Stadler1">[12]</xref>.</p><p>For most phenotypes of interest, we cannot yet model complete fitness landscapes. It requires knowing the fitnesses across large sets of genotypes, typically too vast to exhaustively study either empirically or computationally. There are, however, a few biologically important phenotypes for which this is tractable. In particular, Eigen and Schuster pioneered the study of RNA molecules, using RNA secondary-structure folding algorithms as tractable genotype-to-phenotype maps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Stadler1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Fontana1">[13]</xref>. In their model, the genotype of a molecule is its primary sequence and the phenotype is its predicted minimum free energy secondary structure; fitness is based entirely on the similarity of a phenotype to an ideal target structure. Through extensive sampling (that is, folding many diverse sequences) and evolutionary simulations, this system has motivated and clarified several important ideas in modern evolutionary theory, including error catastrophes, quasispecies, neutral networks, and punctuated equilibria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Eigen1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Cowperthwaite2">[23]</xref>.</p><p>The most influential concept to emerge from these RNA studies is that of “neutral networks”, which are sets of genotypes with identical fitness that are interconnected by neutral mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Schuster1">[15]</xref>. In the RNA model, the genotypes in a neutral network are sequences that fold into the same shape and are connected to each other by paths of neutral point mutations. The neutral networks of RNA and protein molecules appear to share three basic characteristics: (i) most neutral networks are small (contain few genotypes), whereas relatively few are large (contain many genotypes); (ii) large neutral networks are mutationally adjacent to a greater diversity of phenotypes than small neutral networks; and (iii) large neutral networks span the entire sequence space <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Schuster1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Reidys1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Wagner1">[26]</xref>.</p><p>Based on these characteristics, researchers have proposed that large neutral networks should facilitate evolution by allowing populations to explore vast regions of regions of fitness landscapes through neutral drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Schuster1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Huynen1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Reidys1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Wagner1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000110-Wagner2">[27]</xref>.

If large neutral networks are almost exclusively connected to other large neutral networks, then populations will easily move among common phenotypes, but be unable to evolve rare phenotypes. Theoretical and computational characterizations of RNA fitness landscapes suggest that this may, in fact, be the case.

In particular, they are each mutationally connected to the majority of the shapes that are adjacent to the entire neutral network (typically &gt;75%). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000110-g002">Figure 2</xref> also reports the number of components (Nc), the maximum Hamming distance between a pair of sequences in a single component (Dmax), and the maximum shortest path length between a pair of sequences in a single component (Dspl) for the neutral networks in the 12-mer landscape.

We used logistic regression analysis to ask which of contiguity or thermostability better distinguishes naturally occurring molecules from their random permutations. We regressed molecule class (natural or random permutation) on contiguity statistic and (separately) on thermostability. The area under a receiver operating curve (ROC) gives the probability that a model correctly assigns a binary variable (natural or random molecule) to its proper group. The logistic model for contiguity yielded an area under the ROC of 0.82, which is good; the model for thermodynamic stability yielded an area under the ROC of 0.62, which is poor.

We specifically address the possibility that the abundance bias may be driven by thermostability. Our simulation study shows that abundant shapes will evolve in the absence of natural selection for thermostability, and our analysis of natural RNA molecules indirectly suggests that thermostability alone cannot account for the bias toward abundant shapes. We believe that both processes have probably contributed to the prevalence of abundant shapes: (i) natural selection for thermostability and/or other beneficial molecular properties that correlate with abundance and (ii) the underlying structure of the mutational network. We contend that the second process is important and perhaps has precluded the evolution of functionally optimal molecules.</p><p>In closing, we have further characterized the relationship between phenotype abundance and mutational connectivity, and explored its evolutionary implications. The abundance of a phenotype positively correlates with the probability of randomly mutating to that phenotype and negatively correlates with the probability of randomly mutating away from that phenotype to alternative phenotypes. Consequently, the evolutionary potential of a phenotype critically depends on its abundance, and mutational networks therefore can fundamentally constrain evolution. As we learn more about the structure of mutational networks, we can gain new perspectives on the history and function of natural systems and better methods for artificially selecting molecules with desired functions. Characterizing mutational networks remains a formidable challenge, particularly when we consider more complex phenotypes and sources of variation beyond simple point mutations. We can approach these larger landscapes using statistical shortcuts, like the contiguity statistic introduced here, that indirectly provide information about the global structure of the fitness landscape, or by designing farther-reaching mutagenesis experiments.</p></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors thank J.
