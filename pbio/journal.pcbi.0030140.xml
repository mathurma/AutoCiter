Many computational methods predict unstructured regions by training on outliers in otherwise well-ordered structures. Here, we introduce an approach that uses a neural network in a very different and novel way. We hypothesize that very long contiguous segments with nonregular secondary structure (NORS regions) differ significantly from regular, well-structured loops, and that a method detecting such features could predict natively unstructured regions. Training our new method, NORSnet, on predicted information rather than on experimental data yielded three major advantages: it removed the overlap between testing and training, it systematically covered entire proteomes, and it explicitly focused on one particular aspect of unstructured regions with a simple structural interpretation, namely that they are loops. Our hypothesis was correct: well-structured and unstructured loops differ so substantially that NORSnet succeeded in their distinction. Benchmarks on previously used and new experimental data of unstructured regions revealed that NORSnet performed very well. Although it was not the best single prediction method, NORSnet was sufficiently accurate to flag unstructured regions in proteins that were previously not annotated. In one application, NORSnet revealed previously undetected unstructured regions in putative targets for structural genomics and may thereby contribute to increasing structural coverage of large eukaryotic families. NORSnet found unstructured regions more often in domain boundaries than expected at random. In another application, we estimated that 50%–70% of all worm proteins observed to have more than seven protein–protein interaction partners have unstructured regions. The comparative analysis between NORSnet and DISOPRED2 suggested that long unstructured loops are a major part of unstructured regions in molecular networks.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The details of protein structures are important for function. Regions that do not adopt any regular structure in isolation (natively unstructured or disordered regions) initially appeared as a curious exception to this structure–function paradigm. It has become increasingly clear that unstructured regions are fundamental to many roles and that they are particularly important for multicellular organisms. Structural biology is just beginning to apprehend the stunning diversity of these roles. Here, we focused on unstructured regions dominated by a particular type of loop, namely the natively unstructured one. We developed a method that succeeded in the distinction between well-structured and natively unstructured loops. For the development, we did not use any experimental data for unstructured regions; when tested on experimental data, the method performed surprisingly well. Due to its different premises, the method captured very different aspects of unstructured regions than other methods that we tested. We applied the new method to two different problems. The first was the identification of proteins that may be difficult targets for structure determination. The second was the identification of worm proteins that have many interaction partners (more than seven) and unstructured regions. Surprisingly, we found unstructured regions of the loopy type in more than 50% of all the promiscuous worm proteins.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The work was supported by grants U54-GM074958–01 from the Protein Structure Initiative of the US National Institutes of Health to the Northeast Structural Genomics Consortium and 2R01-LM07329–01 from the National Library of Medicine.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Schlessinger A, Liu J, Rost B (2007) Natively unstructured loops differ from other loops.

In the last few years, many studies have shown that often the lack of a unique, native 3-D structure in physiological conditions can be crucial for function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b021">21</xref>]. Such proteins are variously called <italic>disordered</italic>, <italic>unfolded</italic>, <italic>natively unstructured</italic>, or <italic>intrinsically unstructured</italic> proteins. A typical example is a protein that adopts a unique 3-D structure only upon binding to an interaction partner and thereby performs its biochemical function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b006">6</xref>]. The better our experimental and computational means of identifying such proteins, the more we realize that they come in a great variety: some adopt regular secondary structure (helix or strand) upon binding, and some remain loopy. Some proteins are almost entirely unstructured, and others have only short unstructured regions. The more we can recognize short unstructured regions, the more we realize that the term “unstructured protein” would be misleading, as most unstructured proteins have relatively short unstructured regions. There is no single way to define unstructured regions. Here, we define an unstructured region as that which lacks unique 3-D structure by one of the following experimental techniques: circular dichroism (CD) spectroscopy, nuclear magnetic resonance (NMR) spectroscopy, X-ray crystallography, or proteolysis experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b009">9</xref>]. Thanks to the outstanding data collection by the Dunker group, we could also describe this as regions that are the minimal common denominator between all proteins collected in DisProt [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b010">10</xref>]. However, as we learned from prediction methods, DisProt and similar databases cover only a small fraction of all unstructured regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g001">Figure 1</xref>), and as we learned from recent experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b013">13</xref>], there are many unstructured regions covered neither by these databases nor by existing prediction methods.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030140-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030140.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Putative “Map” of Unstructured Regions</title><p>Proteins with unstructured regions are likely to occupy large portions of sequence space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b042">42</xref>] as sketched by the light-gray inner rectangle. The space of all proteins with unstructured regions is likely to be considerably larger than what today's experimental techniques capture. The rounded darker gray rectangle labeled <italic>experiment</italic> sketches proteins for which some experimental method annotated natively unstructured regions. While most NORS regions (predicted long loops, striped gray ellipse) are likely to be natively unstructured, many unstructured regions are not NORS; i.e., they contain helices and strands even in their native form. Previous methods for the prediction of unstructured regions (left lens) are optimized to somehow reflect today's experiments. In contrast, the method introduced here (NORSnet, right lens) is developed based on predictions. This is an advantage because it avoids the bias of today's experimental techniques in a field that is just beginning to grasp its own dimensions, and it is a disadvantage because performance on today's datasets appears somehow limited.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030140.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig></sec><sec id="s1b"><title>Unstructured Regions Can Be Defined and Recognized in Many Ways</title><p>Methods that predict unstructured regions from sequence are mushrooming. Fast methods identify regions with high net charge and low hydrophobicity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b015">15</xref>], monitor the differences in amino acid propensities between unstructured and other regions (GlobPlot) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b016">16</xref>], or identify motifs associated with regions depleted of regular structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b018">18</xref>]. Most methods are based on a different definition of disordered region that has been introduced by the Dunker group [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b019">19</xref>]: residues for which X-ray structures do not have coordinates are considered as disordered. Methods based on this concept used neural networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b023">23</xref>] or support vector machines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b024">24</xref>]. The meetings for the Critical Assessment of Structure Prediction (CASP) have exclusively assessed disorder predictions on subsets of the “noncoordinate” data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b026">26</xref>]. The major drawback of this approach is that the Protein Data Bank (PDB) is biased toward proteins for which structures can be determined; natively unstructured proteins are underrepresented in the PDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>]. This may be one reason why most prediction methods tested by Oldfield et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b012">12</xref>] missed a substantial number of the proteins with unstructured regions identified in a large-scale NMR study spinoff from structural genomics. Other sequence features are predictive of disorder. For example, functionally flexible regions are identified from known structures through molecular dynamics simulation and can be generalized through machine learning. The Wiggle method provides predictions that overlap with unstructured regions even though it is focused on a different aspect of protein flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b028">28</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s1c"><title>Regions with No Regular Secondary Structure Provide Alternative</title><p>Our group identified long regions with no regular secondary structure (NORS), which are stretches of 70 or more sequence-consecutive surface residues with few or no predicted helices and strands [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>]. NORS regions showed considerable overlap with proteins predicted to have long unstructured regions by various disorder predictors. NORS regions are overrepresented in eukaryotes (over five times more than in prokaryotes), overrepresented in regulatory and interacting proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b029">29</xref>], and share biophysical properties with unstructured regions. In addition, when natively unstructured regions are cocrystallized with their binding partner, they are still enriched in nonregular structure compared with globular proteins; ∼45% and ∼31% of the residues are in coils, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b004">4</xref>]. Somewhat surprisingly, the method for predicting regular secondary structure in NORS regions, PROFsec (a profile-based neural network secondary structure predictor) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b032">32</xref>], accurately predicts the secondary structure state in unstructured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b004">4</xref>].</p><p>NORS regions capture only one particular aspect of unstructured regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The major advantages of our focus on NORS regions are that this definition implies a simple structural interpretation, and that we can reliably identify thousands of such regions by scanning entire organisms. The thresholds for the minimal length (70 residues) and for the definition of “largely loop” were optimized in order to minimize the identification of any of these stretches in the PDB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>]. This procedure does not explicitly use any information about a protein other than its prediction of secondary structure and solvent accessibility. Thus, it mainly identifies extreme cases (e.g., highly exposed and long loop regions). Since many unstructured regions are shorter, one of our objectives was to capture much shorter NORS-like regions while ascertaining that we would not confuse long, well-structured loops with unstructured regions. One disadvantage of our focus on NORS was that some unstructured regions contain secondary structure elements (helix or strand) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b004">4</xref>]; i.e., not all unstructured regions are captured by NORS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s1d"><title>Eukaryotic Disordered Regions Challenge Structural Genomics</title><p>One goal of structural genomics is the determination of a 3-D structure representative for every protein family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b034">34</xref>]. Unstructured regions have not impeded structural genomics so far because almost all consortia have focused on bacterial proteins in order to increase the structure-to-clone ratio. However, consortia that focus on eukaryotes, such as the Northeast Structural Genomics (NESG) Consortium, or the Center for Eukaryotic Structural Genomics (CESG) have to carefully exclude such problematic targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b036">36</xref>]. More than 10,000 proteins have been cloned and more than 3,000 proteins have been purified by NESG. Many of these did not adopt regular structure, possibly because they have unstructured regions that were not filtered out by our original filter, which discarded targets containing NORS regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b029">29</xref>]. To speed up structure determination we need to increase the sensitivity in identifying unstructured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b011">11</xref>] (i.e., one goal of the development was to end up with a method that would be complementary to existing methods for the identification of unstructured regions).</p><p>Our first hypothesis was that NORS regions share commonalities that distinguish such long unstructured loops from well-structured loops. If so, we should be able to somehow distinguish between the two types of loops at least in the sense that all loops predicted to be unstructured by our method ought to have different average features from other loops. We assumed that the neural network would pick up local correlations in amino-acid preferences for the different structural states. Our second hypothesis was that what distinguishes NORS regions from regular loops is exactly what makes regions become unstructured. If so, our method for the identification of NORS regions would also accurately predict unstructured regions.</p><p>Here, we describe NORSnet, a new method that extends our NORS concept to also detect shorter (30–70 residues) NORS-like regions. The method was developed without ever using proteins with experimentally known unstructured regions. Instead, it was optimized to distinguish predicted NORS from all other regions. This unique approach, unprecedented in any machine learning method competing in a real-life application with other methods, has three important advantages. First, the data used for development and testing do not overlap. Since NORS regions were predicted from sequence, we can identify thousands of such regions. Our dataset was “dirty” in the sense that it contained many false negatives (all residues in PDB were considered to be well-structured during training) as well as some false positives (incorrect NORS predictions). This was the second major advantage: the positives (unstructured regions) sampled entirely sequenced organisms without any major bias with respect to this particular flavor of unstructured regions. Thereby, we identified unstructured regions that were missed by methods trained on more specialized datasets. The third advantage was that the resulting method explicitly focused on one feature of unstructured regions with a structural interpretation, namely that they are loops. Although we could have assessed NORSnet on any existing dataset due to the lack of overlap, we added a new set with experimental data about unstructured regions different from existing data. Note that both sets differed from each other as well as from the set used for development.</p><p>Our three major results confirmed our hypothesis: (1) training on predictions succeeded in developing a powerful prediction method; (2) long loops are a major component of what is picked up by existing methods predicting unstructured regions; and (3) well-ordered and unstructured loops differ. In conjunction with existing methods, the one that we introduce here will allow the focus on particular structural aspects.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Accurate Distinction between Unstructured and Regular Loop Regions</title><p>We trained our system on NORS regions that had been predicted by our previous high-accuracy/low-coverage method [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b029">29</xref>] for the identification of very long regions depleted of predicted helices and strands (NORSp; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). Technically, the task was to separate between all residues predicted to be in a NORS region and all residues in the PDB. As we used neural networks for this task, the typical assessment of accuracy usually involves a cross-validation experiment. For the first time in our work, we did not do this. In fact, we completely ignored the performance of the network on the task it optimized. Our hypothesis simply was that the only aspect that consistently separates extreme NORS regions from all residues in the PDB are the building blocks for a particular type of unstructured regions, namely the NORS-like loopy ones. Therefore, we measured performance on rather different datasets and separation tasks.</p><p>First, we established success by predicting <italic>well-structured loops</italic> and <italic>NORS-like loops</italic> for DisProt, which consists of proteins with experimentally characterized unstructured regions. A total of 88% of the residues predicted by NORSnet were also predicted to be loops by PROFsec, while only 51% of the residues predicted as loops in DisProt also appeared NORS-like. In other words, most regions identified by NORSnet appeared to be in loops. Conversely, many loops were not predicted by NORSnet. Since residues in loops were identified through prediction, this difference may have been caused by prediction mistakes. To rule this out, we collected a set of 45 sequence-unique proteins that had been added to the PDB after we had completed developing our method (September 2005 to June 2006). We found that NORSnet classified only 1% of loop residues (Dictionary of Secondary Structure of Proteins states T, S, L) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b037">37</xref>] as natively unstructured regions. In other words, NORSnet largely succeeded for these new proteins. In fact, it predicted only one region in these structures to be unstructured, namely a stretch in the HIV type 1 P6 protein of 52 residues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b038">38</xref>], the NMR structure of which indicated depletion of regular secondary structure. This protein has been shown to undergo conformational changes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b038">38</xref>], suggesting that our method correctly identified it as unstructured.</p><p>Very long NORS regions differ statistically from regularly structured or well-ordered loops [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>]. In general, unstructured regions that are not NORS-like tend to be more loopy than well-structured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b004">4</xref>]. Here, we showed that our ability to distinguish between well-ordered and unstructured loops was also successful for much shorter loops.

Predicted unstructured regions by NORSnet, however, differed in their composition from regular loops, flexible loops, and from any type of disorder that has been described previously (unpublished data) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b044">44</xref>].

For instance, the regions identified by our method contained significantly more cysteines than other PDB proteins and, within these, more than the set of residues unresolved in electron density maps. Thus, methods trained on unresolved residues, such as DISOPRED2, are likely to miss these regions. Furthermore, methods using pairwise energy potentials, such as IUPred, to predict unstructured regions are also likely to miss these regions, as many cysteines typically coincide with many paired cysteine bonds that significantly contribute to protein stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b041">41</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Proteins with Unstructured Regions Accurately Identified</title><p>About 30%–60% of all eukaryotic proteins have been estimated to contain unstructured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b042">42</xref>].

A more explicit way to demonstrate that methods focus on different aspects is the analysis of their predictions by Venn diagrams.

DISOPRED2 and NORSnet identified the same 73 proteins, but each correctly identified proteins that the other missed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). This agreement supported our initial hypothesis that many unstructured regions are loopy (considerable overlap in true positives). But the most important result was that the two methods complemented each other. At the same 100% accuracy threshold, the combined method (DISOPRED2 + NORSnet) identified more proteins than any of the two individual methods and missed only two proteins that DISOPRED2 correctly identified.

All these observations suggested that the aspect of unstructured regions most relevant to hubs might actually be the unstructured loops.</p><p>While NORSnet has some ability to identify unstructured regions that are often involved in binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g006">Figure 6</xref>), it may miss many of these regions due to their enrichment in regular secondary structure (helix, strand) in their bound form. We may therefore wonder why NORSnet identified so many worm hub proteins to have unstructured regions in the first place. Interestingly, many of the hubs had several modules/domains, some of which were predicted not to contain unstructured regions. Some of these modules were DNA-binding domains (such as Homeobox domains) or protein–protein interaction binding motifs (such as EGF repeats). The majority of the unstructured regions predicted by NORSnet in these hubs bridged connections between well-structured domains: these bridges were often on the surface (unpublished data). At first glance, the fact that these regions were predicted to be unstructured might seem biologically unimportant. However, there are several possible biological consequences of the abundance of hubs with unstructured loops. These exposed unstructured/loopy regions might serve as sites for proteolysis, allowing some parts of the protein to undergo proteolytic degradation under different cellular conditions. Such differential degradation could allow different modules of the same protein to be functional under different conditions.</p><p>Alternatively, these long connecting loops might function as extremely flexible connecting linkers that facilitate the modules to adopt different orientations, thereby allowing the binding of different targets or binding similar targets in different fashion. Each of these alternatives could be at the heart of a different function. These two hypotheses may explain some of the regulatory characteristics of hub proteins.</p><sec id="s2c1"><title>Mapping the sequence space of proteins with unstructured regions.</title><p>Most likely, unstructured regions and NORS regions occupy slightly different parts in sequence space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Indications for the overlap between NORS and unstructured regions are that both are enriched in proline and both depleted of glycine ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b039">39</xref>] and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Some experimentally observed unstructured regions have been shown to contain cysteines. For instance, Zinc fingers often become structured only upon binding zinc. Nevertheless, most previous studies of unstructured regions did not find cysteines to be overrepresented with respect to well-structured regions in the PDB. This may be due partially to the fact that in well-structured proteins cysteines often stabilize disulfide bonds. Methods optimized to identify regions missing in electron density maps from X-ray crystallography are therefore likely to miss many of the cysteines in unstructured regions. In contrast, NORSnet captured cysteines in unstructured regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In addition, the differences between DISOPRED2 and NORSnet that were revealed both by our head-to-head comparison on different sets of proteins with unstructured regions and by our analysis of protein hubs pointed to the different types of unstructured regions that we may have to separate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030140-g001">Figure 1</xref>). To complicate matters further, some proteins with unstructured regions may look just like any regular protein, while others may be generically different. Consequently, some of the proteins with unstructured regions may be missed by any prediction method.</p></sec><sec id="s2c2"><title>Refining target selection for structural genomics.</title><p>One goal of structural genomics projects is to contribute considerably to the increase in the fraction of proteins with known 3-D structures. To achieve this goal, 3-D structures are experimentally determined for representatives of as many large families as possible [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b070">70</xref>]. In particular, the large structural genomics initiatives financed by the Protein Structure Initiative (PSI) from the US National Institutes of Health (NIH) systematically target the experimental determination of structures for large families without representatives of known structure. Structural genomics also aims at making 3-D structures more readily accessible to nonstructural molecular biology and at reducing the costs and difficulty of determining structures. All of these goals require high-throughput determination of 3-D structures. This implies that experimental high-throughput pipelines have to move on if structure determination fails for some families, and that targets are also chosen with the objective to increase the throughput. This does not imply that PSI consortia “go for the low-hanging fruits.” Quite to the contrary, they have succeeded where many small-scale studies have failed.</p><p>Membrane proteins and proteins with unstructured regions are the two major types of proteins that are not only avoided by conventional small-scale structural biology but also by structural genomics efforts. Due to the fact that proteins with unstructured regions are much more abundant in eukaryotic organisms, consortia that focus on eukaryotes, such as NESG and CESG, have to carefully avoid such difficult targets. In the last six years, thousands of proteins have been cloned, expressed, and purified by NESG. Although the NESG target selection filtered out many domains with strong predictions for the presence of unstructured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b036">36</xref>], many were left for which biophysical data suggested that they contain unstructured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b013">13</xref>].</p><p>We applied NORSnet to 11,587 putative NESG targets that had already passed our previous and cruder NORS filter (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030140-t001">Table 1</xref>). Using two different cutoffs, NORSnet predicted that 13%–20% of the previously filtered targets have unstructured regions. Although NORSnet was not optimized to identify very short unstructured regions (≤30 residues), NORSnet predicted 47%–58% of the proteins to contain such regions. The same filter would not have excluded any of the proteins that succeeded in the experimental pipeline, suggesting that the application of NORSnet could have increased the structure–clone ratio. However, the ultimate proof for this assumption will have to wait until another hundred or so experimentally determined structures are added by NESG to the PDB in the next year(s).</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030140-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030140.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>NORSnet Predictions for Structural Genomics Targets</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030140.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Predicted Subset<sup>a</sup></td><td><hr/>DisProt Cutoff<sup>b</sup></td><td><hr/>NESG Cutoff<sup>b</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Non-NORS</td><td>28.2&percnt;</td><td>32.4&percnt;</td></tr><tr><td>Very short NORS (&le;30 residues)</td><td>58.4&percnt;</td><td>47.0&percnt;</td></tr><tr><td>Short NORS (&le;70 residues)</td><td>7.0&percnt;</td><td>10.2&percnt;</td></tr><tr><td>Long NORS (&gt;70 residues)</td><td>6.4&percnt;</td><td>10.4&percnt;</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p><sup>a</sup>Predicted subset: non-NORS marks protein sequences for which no residue was predicted to be in a NORS region by NORSnet; very short NORS marks proteins that were predicted to have NORS regions that are &le;30 residues long.

Natively unstructured regions do not necessarily contradict this structure–function paradigm. Nevertheless, a variety of proteins require unstructured regions in order to function as domain linkers, filling material, and detergents. For other proteins with unstructured regions, changes in the environment (e.g., pH change, presence of target) or posttranslational modifications can trigger the formation of a regular 3-D structure that will then again determine function. In an evolutionary sense, the required changes/modifications constitute an integral part of the function and are therefore likely to be somehow encoded in the sequence of such proteins. The unusual aspect is that the key structural feature of these proteins is to keep regions natively unstructured or adaptable. The experimental and in silico identification and characterization of proteins with unstructured regions is evolving into an increasingly important challenge for structural biology. In facing this challenge, it becomes increasingly clear that the term “unstructured” describes a rather mixed bag of phenomena from regions that alter between different conformations to those that remain molten globule-like, and from regions that adopt regular helices and strands to those that remain intrinsically loopy.</p><p>Here, we present NORSnet, a neural network–based method that revisited the task of identifying unstructured regions from a different angle than that taken by other methods. It focuses on the distinction between unstructured and well-structured loops. The success in this undertaking confirmed our initial hypothesis, namely that short unstructured loops resemble very long unstructured loops (NORS regions). Our application of machine learning was rather unconventional in two ways. First, we trained on positives (predicted NORS) that did not contain the feature we sought to predict (short unstructured loops) and on negatives (all regions in the PDB) that contained regions that we wanted the method to predict as positives; i.e., we implicitly hoped that our development would fail for many cases. Second, we did not optimize any parameters on the dataset used for assessing the performance of our method. Due to the difference in our approach, NORSnet complemented existing methods that optimize on previous datasets of unstructured regions. Consequently, NORSnet will enable the application of additional filters for structural genomics. Last, through a comparison between our new and other prediction methods, we confirmed the importance of unstructured regions for protein–protein interactions. Moreover, we specifically touched on the importance of unstructured loops for network complexity.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s3"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s3a"><title>Dataset of NORS regions.</title><p>We created our dataset of residues in natively unstructured regions (“positives”) in the following way. We grouped all proteins from 62 entirely sequence proteomes into domain-like families using CHOP and CLUP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b071">71</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b072">72</xref>]. We identified proteins with long NORS regions by the application of NORSp; i.e., all residues that are located in a stretch of &gt;70 consecutive residues with &lt;12% predicted helix or strand [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b029">29</xref>] by PROFsec [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b032">32</xref>] and have at least one contiguous segment longer than ten residues predicted to be on the protein surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b073">73</xref>]. The hope was that all residues in this pool have commonalities that we could extract through machine learning, and that will also be shared by proteins with unstructured regions much shorter than 70 residues. Due to the fact that PROFsec is especially accurate for natively unstructured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b004">4</xref>], the noise in these data that originated from the prediction mistakes was likely very low. To distinguish between proteins with and without unstructured regions, we needed a set of “negatives” (i.e., residues that are well-structured). For this, we chose a sequence-unique subset of globular protein structures from the PDB. Technically, this sequence-unique subset was taken from the EVA server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b075">75</xref>]. Specifically, the sequence redundancy was removed above HSSP (a measure for sequence-proximity) similarity values of 0 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b076">76</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b077">77</xref>] (corresponding to &lt;22% pairwise sequence identity for long alignments). Any pair of sequences between training and testing sets that could be aligned at PSI–BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b078">78</xref>] E-values of &lt;10<sup>−3</sup> according to our standard procedure of three automated iterations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b079">79</xref>] was also removed. To further amplify the signal from well-structured regions in the negative set, we also excluded all loops longer than 30 residues. Our datasets were not fully clean in the sense that our negative set of well-structured PDB proteins certainly contained some residues that did not appear in the X-ray structure (which were implicitly treated as well-structured), and that the positive set (predicted NORS) might contain some regular, ordered regions. However, due to the immense size of both datasets and to our use of neural networks, we did not worry about such outliers. In fact, our particular generation of a prediction-based training set that is more than ten times larger, and certainly more representative, than sets used previously might be the most important difference to all previous methods. In the context of a different problem, we showed how beneficial the use of prediction-based sets with errors might be [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b080">80</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Training and testing set.</title><p>To optimize the parameters of the method, we trained the network on 90% of the sequences and tested it on the remaining 10%.

In the first benchmark, we used DisProt proteins that have unstructured regions longer than 30 residues as positives and a sequence-unique subset of 173 PDB X-ray structures as negatives. The latter subset was taken from the EVA server [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b074">74</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030140-b075">75</xref>], and did not include sequences that were in the original training set. One particular advantage of testing our method on DisProt was that we did not have to run any additional cross-validation experiment since we used different proteins; respectively, the same proteins with different labels (<italic>all</italic> residues from PDB in DisProt were explicitly treated as “well-structured” by our training procedure).</p></sec><sec id="s3d"><title>NESG dataset.</title><p>To further validate the method, we tested it on a set of proteins from the NESG consortium. The positive set included 30 proteins that were identified to have unstructured regions (“NESG unfolded”), and the negative set included 170 recently determined protein structures. Both sets were identified as such by the NESG consortium. The definition of “unstructured region” was as follows: (1) HSQC (heteronuclear single quantum correlation) was high signal to noise and very low dispersion; and (2) hetNOE (heteronuclear Overhauser effect) data was clean negative (G. T. Montelione, personal communication). Using this set contributed to the removal of two types of biases in DisProt and similar databases. (1) Structure determination method: the negative set was almost equally divided between X-ray and NMR structures. (2) Length bias: while usually sequences selected for NMR structure determination are shorter than for X-ray determination, the NESG consortium reduced this artifact by using both methods in parallel to determine the structures of the same sequences. Thus, the length distribution of the NESG unfolded set is similar to the one of the folded set, in contrast to DisProt database, which consists of some much longer sequences (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030140-st001">Table S1</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s3e"><title>Protein–protein interaction set.</title><p>For the large-scale predictions of proteins that are involved in protein–protein interactions, we used the IntAct database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ebi.ac.uk/intact</ext-link>).
