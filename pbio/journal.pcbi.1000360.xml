                <p>Identification of pathways involved in the structural transitions of biomolecular
                    systems is often complicated by the transient nature of the conformations
                    visited across energy barriers and the multiplicity of paths accessible in the
                    multidimensional energy landscape. This task becomes even more challenging in
                    exploring molecular systems on the order of megadaltons. Coarse-grained models
                    that lend themselves to analytical solutions appear to be the only possible
                    means of approaching such cases. Motivated by the utility of elastic network
                    models for describing the collective dynamics of biomolecular systems and by the
                    growing theoretical and experimental evidence in support of the intrinsic
                    accessibility of functional substates, we introduce a new method,
                        <italic>adaptive anisotropic network model</italic> (<italic>a</italic>ANM),
                    for exploring functional transitions. Application to bacterial chaperonin GroEL
                    and comparisons with experimental data, results from action minimization
                    algorithm, and previous simulations support the utility of <italic>a</italic>ANM
                    as a computationally efficient, yet physically plausible, tool for unraveling
                    potential transition pathways sampled by large complexes/assemblies. An
                    important outcome is the assessment of the critical inter-residue interactions
                    formed/broken near the transition state(s), most of which involve conserved
                    residues.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Most proteins are biomolecular machines. They perform their function by
                    undergoing changes between different structures. Understanding the mechanism of
                    transition between these structures is of major importance to design methods for
                    controlling such transitions, and thereby modulating protein function. Although
                    there are many computational methods for exploring the transitions of small
                    proteins, the task of exploring the transition pathways becomes prohibitively
                    expensive in the case of supramolecular systems. The bacterial chaperonin GroEL
                    is such a supramolecular machine. It plays an important role in assisting
                    protein folding. During its function, GroEL undergoes structural transitions
                    between multiple forms. Here, we are introducing a new methodology, based on
                    elastic network models, for elucidating the transition mechanisms in such
                    supramolecular systems. Application to GroEL provides us with biologically
                    significant information on critical interactions and sequence of events
                    occurring during the chaperonin machinery and key contacts that make and break
                    at the transition. The method can be readily applied to other supramolecular
                    machines.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Many proteins assume more than one functional conformation, stabilized by ligand
                binding or changes in environmental conditions. A typical example is the bacterial
                chaperonin GroEL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Sigler1">[1]</xref>, a widely studied ATP-regulated molecular machine
                and member of heat shock protein Hsp60 family. GroEL assists in unfolding and
                refolding misfolded or partially folded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Saibil1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Horovitz1">[4]</xref>. It is
                composed of two back-to-back stacked rings, each containing seven subunits of 60
                kDa. Each subunit is, in turn, composed of three domains, equatorial (E),
                intermediate (I) and apical (A). GroEL works together with the co-chaperonin, GroES.</p>
            <p>The activity of GroEL-GroES complex entails a series of allosteric transitions in
                structure, triggered by ATP binding and hydrolysis, described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g001">Figure 1</xref>: In the absence of
                nucleotide binding, both rings assume the closed (T) state, designated as T/T state
                for the two rings. Cooperative binding of seven ATP molecules to the subunits in one
                of the rings, hereafter referred to as the <italic>cis</italic> ring, drives the
                conformational change of these subunits to the ‘open’ (R) state,
                thus leading to the R/T form of the <italic>cis/trans</italic> rings. The R/T form
                exposes a number of hydrophobic residues at the apical domains of the
                <italic>cis</italic> ring subunits. These groups attract the unfolded or partially
                folded peptide (substrate) to be encapsulated in the cylindrical chamber following
                the attachment of GroES (R′/T form of <italic>cis/trans</italic> rings).
                ATP hydrolysis provides the energy needed to process (unfold/refold) the substrate
                and leads to the state R″/T. This process is terminated upon binding of
                seven ATP molecules to the adjoining (<italic>trans</italic>) ring, hence the term
                ‘negative cooperative effect’ induced by ATP binding. The
                structure with ADP and ATP molecules bound to the respective <italic>cis</italic>
                and <italic>trans</italic> rings (R″/R form) favors the opening of the
                GroES cap and release of the peptide and ADP molecules to start a new cycle, this
                time, with the roles of the former <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>
                rings being inverted.</p>

                    <p>GroEL consists of two rings, <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>,
                        which assume the states: T: ATP-free; R: ATP-bound prior to substrate
                        (peptide) and co-chaperonin (GroES) binding; R′: ATP-, substrate-
                        and GroES-bound; R″: ADP-, substrate- and GroES-bound. Subunits in
                        the T state are shown in red, R in cyan; R′ in green, R″
                        in blue, and the cap in purple. ATP and ADP are shown by blue and orange
                        boxes. Successive events/reactions along the cycle are (A) binding of seven
                        ATPs to induce the binding of the unfolded substrate (orange), (B)
                        co-chaperonin binding, (C) ATP hydrolysis, (D) ATP binding to
                        <italic>trans</italic> ring subunits, (E) release of ADPs, substrate (folded
                        or partially folded) and GroES from the <italic>cis</italic> ring, (F)
                        initiation of a new cycle where the roles of the <italic>cis</italic> and
                            <italic>trans</italic> rings are inverted. Top-middle and bottom-left

            <p>Of interest is to understand the molecular basis of the negative cooperative effect
                triggered upon binding of seven ATP molecules to the <italic>trans</italic> ring
                (step E in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g001">Figure 1</xref>). ATP
                binding induces in this case a structural change on the cap-binding region at a
                distance of 65 Å. Understanding the mechanism of this allosteric signaling
                is of fundamental importance because of the critical role chaperonins play in
                preventing aggregation and regulating folding <italic>vs.</italic> degradation
                events.</p>
            <p>Several studies have been published on the allosteric pathways and dynamics of GroEL
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Thirumalai1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Horovitz2">[19]</xref> since the original
                determination of the ADP-bound complex (R″/T) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Xu1">[20]</xref>. These studies provide
                valuable insights into the successive states involved in the chaperonin cycle. The
                elucidation of allosteric transition mechanisms has been a challenge, however, both
                experimentally and computationally, due to the transient nature of the high energy
                conformers between the states, the multiplicity of pathways, and the large size of
                this biomolecular system.</p>

                    inaccessible for systems of the order of megadaltons like GroEL. Coarse-grained
                    models and methods appear as the only tractable tools in such cases. Perhaps the
                    most comprehensive computational study of GroEL allosteric dynamics is that of
                    Hyeon, Lorimer and Thirumalai, where the T→R→R″
                    transition has been examined by Brownian dynamics (BD) simulations using a

                <p>Recent years have seen a revival in normal mode analyses (NMAs) of proteins,
                    after realizing that coarse-grained models such as the ENM provide information
                    on functional and robust modes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Bahar1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Bahar2">[45]</xref>. ENMs have been
                    recently used for exploring the transition pathways between known end
                    conformations: Kim <italic>et al.</italic> proposed to interpolate between the
                    end points by controlling the <italic>distances</italic> between the nodes,
                    rather than the position vectors so as to avoid unrealistic deformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Kim1">[46]</xref>.
                    Onuchic and coworkers extended the concept of minimal frustration to transitions
                    between basins modeled as ENMs, and examined the coupling between the strains in
                    dihedral angles and local unfolding events (also termed
                    <italic>cracking</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Miyashita1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Whitford1">[48]</xref>. Maragakis and
                    Karplus explored the transition of adenylate kinase between its T and R forms
                    using a combination of steepest descent and conjugate peak refinement algorithms
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Maragakis1">[49]</xref>. More recently, Chu and Voth presented a
                    double-well ENM model for exploring the conformational transitions of G-actin
                    and adenylate kinase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Chu1">[50]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The success of these studies suggests that ENM-based methods may serve as a first
                    approximation for exploring the transitions between not-too-distant pairs of
                    functional states. Here we present a new approach based on the anisotropic
                    network model (ANM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Doruker1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Atilgan1">[52]</xref> to this aim, and
                    apply it to the allosteric transitions of the GroEL-GroES complex
                    (∼8,000 residues, or ∼1 MDa). The approach, referred to as <bold>

                    </bold><bold>ANM</bold>), utilizes the ANM modes to guide the complex along the
                    directions intrinsically favored by its instantaneous inter-residue contact
                    topology.</p>
                <p>The ANM is based on the following assumptions: (i) the experimentally resolved
                    structures are assumed to represent an energy minimum, (ii) the structures are
                    modeled as a network, the nodes of which represent the individual amino acids,
                    (iii) the positions of the nodes are identified by those of the
                    α-carbons, (iv) all pairs of nodes separated by a distance shorter than
                    a cutoff distance of r<sub>c</sub> are connected by an elastic spring, (v) a
                    uniform force constant is assumed for all pairs regardless of amino acid type.
                    Thus, the structure is subject to a sum of harmonic potentials corresponding to
                    all connected (bonded or non-bonded) amino acids. The structural coordinates are
                    used to derive the <italic>3N-6</italic> orthonormal modes of motion, called ANM
                    modes, uniquely defined for each equilibrium structure of <italic>N</italic>
                    modes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Doruker1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Atilgan1">[52]</xref>. The ANM is now
                    widely used in exploring protein dynamics and assessing the global (lowest
                    frequency modes) in particular, in view of the observed robustness and
                    functional relevance of these modes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Bahar1">[41]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Bahar2">[45]</xref>,

                    study, the potential of the system is approximated by the sum of two harmonic
                    ANM potentials adopted for the end states, along with a softening term that
                    ensures a smooth transition between them. As will be explained below, the
                    softening term (and the corresponding parameter <italic>β</italic>; see
                        <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>) is not used in the
                    <italic>a</italic>ANM generation of the pathways, but in the comparison of the
                    results against those predicted by other methods.</p>
                <p>Multiple paths (or subsets of ANM modes) exist for the passage between the
                    endpoints. The recruitment of the particular subsets of modes results from a
                    tradeoff between minimizing the path length and selecting the direction of the
                    lowest increase in internal energy. The ‘shortest’ path is
                    by definition the interpolation between the two endpoints. However, this path
                    usually incurs unphysical strains in internal coordinates, and is, thereby,
                    unfavorable from energetic point of view. In the other extreme case of movements
                    along the lowest-lying (softest) modes, on the other hand, these particular mode
                    directions may not necessarily lead to the target. The selected pathway will
                    thus depend on the relative importance of environmental (<italic>path
                    length</italic>) or internal (<italic>conformational energy barrier</italic>)
                    constraints (see below).</p>
                <p>The results are organized in two sections: First (<italic>Section I</italic>), we
                    present the results for the R″←→T transition of a
                    single GroEL subunit (<italic>N</italic> = 514
                    residues). These calculations serve two purposes: benchmarking our results
                    against those obtained by action minimization method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Elber3">[29]</xref>, and estimating the
                    effect of different choices of parameters. These data are then utilized in the
                    second part (<italic>Section II</italic>) where we examine the intact chaperonin
                    allosteric cycle and compare with experimental data and other simulations.
                    Notably, a small subset of low frequency modes are found to drive the transition
                    at early stages, succeeded by the recruitment of increasingly larger subsets of
                    modes (yet not exceeding 4% of the entire spectrum) to overcome the
                    energy barrier. Native contacts are closely maintained throughout significant
                    portions of transition pathways, except for the close neighborhood of the energy
                    peak, also called putative transition state (PTS), where a major redistribution
                    in intra- and inter-subunit contacts takes place. The results provide new
                    insights and testable hypotheses on the mechanistic involvement of conserved
                    residue pairs in critical interactions.</p>

                    <p>(ii) The number <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of modes of motion recruited at iteration
                        <italic>k</italic> is based on a threshold squared cosine,
                            <italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic>, that defines the maximal angular
                        departure between the instantaneous displacement direction and that
                        targeted. To this end, we evaluate the <italic>cumulative squared cosine</italic><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e027" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>and we select the minimal number of modes, starting from the
                        low frequency end of the spectrum, that satisfy the inequality
                            [<italic>C</italic>(<italic>m<sub>A</sub></italic><sup>(<italic>k</italic>)</sup>)]<sup>2</sup><italic>≥F<sub>min</sub></italic>.
                        It can be shown (see derivation in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000360.s008">Text S1</xref>) that
                                <italic>C</italic>(<italic>m<sub>A</sub></italic><sup>(<italic>k</italic>)</sup>)
                        is identical to the correlation cosine between the instantaneous deformation
                        and distance vectors, i.e.,<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e028" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula></p>
                    <p>Therefore, the threshold <italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic> ensures the
                        selection of the <italic>smallest</italic> subset of modes to drive the

                        by more than a specified correlation cosine
                            (<italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic><sup>½</sup> ) from the target

                        complete set of modes leads, by definition, to
                            <italic>C</italic>(<italic>3N-6</italic>) = 1.
                        By selecting a subset, we let the molecule undergo a structural change that
                        is not necessarily toward the endpoint, but along the coordinates
                        energetically favored by its architecture.</p>

                        small (1.5 Å in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t001">Table 1</xref>). The total number of iterations,

                <p>The allosteric cycle undergone by a given subunit can be summarized as
                    T→R→R′→R″→T. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t002">Table 2A</xref> lists the RMSDs

                        <italic>cis</italic> ring subunits in different forms of the complex. The
                    RMSD between R′ and R″ is 1.50 Å, which is lower
                    than the resolution of these structures, while those between different states

                    R′ and R″, and the resolution of existing structural data,
                    is to condense the allosteric cycle into T→R→R″ (or

                                state. This type of transition occurs both in steps A and D of the
                                allosteric cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g001">Figure 1</xref>) at the respective <italic>cis</italic> and

                                its conformation along mode 1 alone, the RMSD from state R decreases
                                from 5.21 to 3.40 Å, and upon further recruiting modes 2
                                and 3, the RMSDs decrease to 3.05 and 2.83 Å,
                                respectively. Interestingly, the end state (R) also tends to move
                                toward the state T, if deformed along its mode 1. These results
                                support the view that the T form possesses an intrinsic tendency to
                                assume its ATP-bound conformation R, prior to ATP binding, and it is
                                also readily recovered upon nucleotide release.</p>

                                major role, to decrease the RMSD to 8.19 Å. This step is
                                triggered upon ATP hydrolysis, which apparently favors mode 2. Yet,
                                it is remarkable that the contribution of three modes from both ends
                                is sufficient to reduce the RMSD to 4.19 Å.</p>

                        as to move efficiently toward the endpoint. Slowest modes refer here to
                        lowest-lying eigenvalues, or softest modes. Recruiting three modes from both

                        Å, as opposed to the original RMSDs of 5.21, 12.35 and 12.33

                        allosteric transitions of the intact GroEL.</p>
                    <p>An interesting observation is the sequential order of events: first the E and
                        I domains almost stick to each other and move coherently as a single rigid
                        body, while the A domain undergoes an upward tilting and simultaneous
                        twisting. These movements of the A domain are completed in the first half of
                        the transition pathway from T to R″. Then, slight rearrangements
                        in the relative positions of the E and I domains occur, which expose the top
                        portion of the A domain to bind the substrate and GroES. This sequence of
                        events is consistent with the two-stage transition explored by the TMD

                    <title>Which modes?</title>
                    <p>The number of modes involved in the transition between substates has been a
                        question raised in a number of studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Petrone1">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Yang2">[59]</xref>.
                            <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t001">Table 1</xref> lists the
                        number of modes, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, recruited at each step as the molecule travels between
                        the end points. An important observation is the increased involvement of
                        higher frequency modes as we proceed away from the original state. In
                        another words, the slow modes play an important role at the initial stages
                        of deformation, and continue to play a role throughout the entire
                        trajectory, although they are gradually complemented by increasingly larger
                        subsets of higher frequency modes. The dominance of low frequency modes is
                        consistent with the previously noted driving role of large scale motions in
                        GroEL allostery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>.</p>
                    <p>Due to the limits of applicability of the harmonic potential, it is arguable
                        how far away from the original energy minima we can extend the quadratic
                        approximation. In the trajectory of

                        than 4 Å. Only six low frequency modes out of the complete set of
                        1536 ANM modes accessible to the starting conformation (R″) are
                        recruited to reach this stage, along with seven slowest modes accessible to
                        state T. Low frequency modes are known to be robustly determined by the
                        overall shape and contact topology of the examined structure, i.e., they are
                        insensitive the specific interactions and nonlinear effects, hence the broad
                        use of ENMs in NMAs in recent years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Cui1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Nicolay1">[60]</xref>. This property emphasized in several reviews

                        is also supported by the close agreement between the low frequency modes
                        from quasiharmonic analysis of MD trajectories and those from coarse-grained
                        NMA; see, for example, references <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Rueda1">[61]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Teotico1">[62]</xref>. The fact that such a large portion (up to
                        2/3) of the reconfiguration occurs via these robust modes lends support to
                        the applicability of <italic>a</italic>ANM. A small portion near the PTS
                        needs, however, to be interpreted with care, as will be further analyzed
                        below.</p>
                    <p>In a strict sense, the normal modes provide information on the direction of
                        motion near an energy minimum, and steps along these modes will be accurate
                        to the extent that they are infinitesimally small. In order to examine how
                        the step size <italic>s<sub>A</sub></italic><sup>(<italic>k</italic>)</sup>
                        (or <italic>s<sub>B</sub></italic><sup>(<italic>k</italic>)</sup>) affects
                        the course of structural reconfiguration, we repeated our calculations with
                        various scaling factors <italic>f</italic> in the range
                        0.1&lt;<italic>f</italic>&lt;1. As described above
                        <italic>f</italic> = 1 allows for taking

                        be safely adopted to avoid unrealistic deformations in backbone geometry. In
                        particular, we monitored the C<sup>α</sup>-positions and
                            C<sup>α</sup>-C<sup>α</sup> bond lengths, which refer to
                        bonded and non-bonded interactions in the coarse-grained model used here, to
                        verify that the conservative steps generated with this scaling factor avoid
                        steric clashes between residue pairs and unrealistic fluctuations in bond

                    <p>Toward assessing the consistency of our results with those predicted by other

                        The resulting trajectory, called the steepest descent pathway (SDP), led to
                        the energy profile shown by the black curve in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g004">Figure 4B</xref>. The barrier height is slightly
                        lower than that obtained by <italic>a</italic>ANM, while the shape of the
                        energy profile shows close resemblance: a peak around
                            <italic>x</italic>(<italic>n</italic>) = ∼0.52,
                        preceded by minimal energy cost for an extended portion of the reaction

                    <p>Toward a more critical analysis of the modes that contribute to the SDP, we

                    <p>Calculations performed above for a single subunit demonstrated that the
                        transition pathways between the functional forms of the single subunit can
                        be delineated by the <italic>a</italic>ANM algorithm. In particular, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000360.s001">Figure
                        S1</xref> showed that a few low frequency modes can account for a
                        significant portion of the structural changes that take place between the
                        functional forms. We now explore the allosteric transitions in the intact
                        chaperonin. We begin by examining if/how the low frequency modes play
                        equally an important role in the allosteric dynamics of the intact GroEL.</p>
                    <p>The counterparts of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t003">Table
                        3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000360.s001">Figure S1</xref> for the intact chaperonin are <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t004">Table 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000360.s002">Figure
                        S2</xref>. Here, the major difference is the fact that the changes occur via
                        non-degenerate modes that maintain the heptameric symmetry of the GroEL
                        structure, similar to the previously noted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Rader1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Tama2">[65]</xref>
                        dominant role of non-degenerate ANM modes in enabling the maturation of
                        icosahedrally symmetric viral capsids. Results are listed for the first 1, 3
                        and 6 non-degenerate modes. Note that the set of ANM modes accessible to the
                        GroEL complex is larger than that of the single subunit by a factor of 14.
                        We might thus expect to recruit a larger number of modes in the low
                        frequency regime to achieve the same fractional contribution to observed
                        changes. However, it is again striking to observe that six non-degenerate
                        modes are sufficient to generate intermediates that are almost half way
                        through the transition between the end points. The original RMSD values of
                        6.72, 10.85 and 11.54 Å between the end states of the three
                        respective steps T/T→R/T, R/T→R′/T and
                        R″/R→T/R are reduced to 3.26, 6.35 and 7.87 Å
                        upon moving along these modes (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t004">Table 4</xref>). The gradual decreases in the
                        RMSDs as the intact chaperonin reconfigures along these modes are shown in

                        T/T→R/T→R″/R. These three states are selected
                        because they differ by an RMSD of 6.72 Å and 11.03 Å,
                        respectively (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t002">Table
                        2</xref> part B). R′/T and R″/T differ from
                        R″/R by less than 3 Å, which is comparable to the
                        resolution of the structures, hence their exclusion from the above scheme.
                        The results are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t005">Table 5</xref>. The energy profile along the transition

                        of the intact chaperonin, and discuss our results in relation to previous

                    <p>Experiments conducted with Arg197Ala mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Yifrach1">[67]</xref> pointed to the
                        functional role of the salt bridge between E386 and R197 on adjacent
                        subunits in the <italic>cis</italic> ring. This inter-subunit salt-bridge
                        was also noted in early cryo-EM studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Ranson2">[68]</xref>. It forms in
                        the T state of the ring (1GR5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>), and it has been proposed to be an essential
                        component of the positive intra-ring cooperativity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Yifrach2">[69]</xref>. The
                        R″ state of the same ring (1GRU) indicates, on the other hand, a
                        new salt bridge, formed between E386 and K80 (on the E domain of the
                        neighboring subunit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g007">Figure
                        7D</xref>). The <italic>a</italic>ANM results shed light to the mechanism of
                        this interchange of salt bridges. The separation between E386 and R197
                        α-carbons, originally equal to 15.7 Å (their charged ends
                        being separated by 3.2 Å), gradually increases by the downwards
                        motion of the intermediate domain. After 18 iterations (for
                        T/T→R/T), the distance between E386 and R197 becomes larger than
                        that between E386 and K80, and K80 replaces R197 to form a salt bridge with
                        E386 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).
                        Afterwards, R197 moves dramatically away from E386, led by the opening of
                        the apical domain. Meanwhile the downward movement of helix M continues
                        until the distance between the C<sup>α</sup>-atoms of the new
                        salt-bridge-forming residues E386 and K80 reduces to 8.6 Å.</p>

                    <title>Comparison with the results from recent BD simulations</title>
                    <p>A recent examination of the time evolution of salt-bridges formed/broken at
                        the steps T→R and R→R″ of the GroEL allosteric
                        cycle brought attention to a number of key interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>.
                        Those results have been obtained by Hyeon, Lorimer and Thirumalai, by
                        performing BD simulations, for a dimer, using state-specific Go-like
                        potentials for the end points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, they
                        differ from ours in their method, model and parameters. Yet, in order to see
                        if similar trends could be detected in spite of the differences in the
                        methodology, we undertook a careful examination of the formation/breakage of
                        salt bridges along the <italic>a</italic>ANM predicted reaction coordinates.</p>
                    <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g008">Figure 8</xref> displays our
                        results for the respective T→R (panel A) and

                        subunits obtained by aANM for the intact chaperonin. These are the
                            C<sup>α</sup>-C<sup>α</sup> distances between intra- or
                        intersubunit salt-bridge forming residues, plotted as a function of reaction
                        coordinate. Interestingly, particular pairs or residues exhibit a smooth
                        increase/decrease in their distance, whereas others are more sluggish. The
                        former group of pairs which readily associate/dissociate may be viewed as
                        driving interactions. We notice, for example, the smooth decrease in
                        K80-D359 distance along with increase in D83-K327 distance (panel B),
                        indicative of the compensating formation and breakage of these two
                        intra-subunit salt bridges prompted at an early stage of the
                        R→R″ transition. These changes undergone early on are in
                        sharp contrast to the salt bridges involving E257 and E386, which exhibit
                        strong resistance to dissociate or associate (panels A and B). The leading
                        role of K80-D359 and D83-K327 is in agreement with the mechanism observed in
                        BD simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>. The formation of the K80-D359
                        salt-bridge has been pointed out therein to be the major driving force for
                        the R→R″ transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>. Also, this
                        formation has been pointed out to be coupled to the dissociation of D83-K327
                            <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>. Other similar features include the fast
                        increase in R58-E209 and decrease in P33-N153 distances at short times
                        during T→R, in contrast to the slower responses of D83-K327 and
                        E257-R268 at the same stages (panel A), succeeded by the high stability of
                        P33-N153 during R→R″, the resistance of E257-K321 and
                        E257-R322 to come closer at the initiation of T→R, in contrast to
                        their predisposition to dissociate at the onset of R→R″.
                        Finally, it is interesting to notice that the non-monotonic behavior of the
                        pair E257-R268 in panel B conforms to previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>
                        ensemble-averaged behavior for the same pair; while that of R197-E386
                        observed here departs from the smooth increase previously reported.</p>

                    <p>In the interest of making an even more stringent, quantitative comparison
                        between the two sets of data, we have considered the relative rates of
                        formation/rupture of different salt bridges. Our approach does not contain
                        ‘time’ explicitly. Instead we have the ‘number
                        of iterations’. In order to evaluate the relative time dependence
                        of the salt bridge formation/breakage events, we normalized one of our
                        curves, called ‘reference curve’, with respect to its
                        counterpart obtained <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref> by Hyeon <italic>et al.</italic> (2006).
                        This permitted us to plot the accompanying time dependence of all other salt
                        bridges as a function of time (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000360.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and determine the best fitting
                        kinetic data. The results, compiled in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t006">Table 6</xref> exhibit striking quantitative

                    <title>Critical interactions formed/broken at the transition involve conserved
                        residues</title>
                    <p>The above results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g008">Figure
                        8</xref>) reveal that certain interactions play a key role in stabilizing
                        particular states, once formed. For example, the inter-subunit E257-R268
                        salt bridge appears to be crucial for the T state of the
                        <italic>cis</italic> ring; whereas the inter-subunit hydrophobic contact
                        I305-A260 seems critical to stabilizing the R″ state. These
                        interactions are usually disrupted only at the PTS.</p>
                    <p>Toward a more systematic assessment of such critical interactions, we focused
                        on the changes in native contacts occurring at the PTSs. A set of 2028
                        native contacts are shared between the R and R″ states (native
                        contacts being defined as C<sup>α</sup>-C<sup>α</sup>
                        distances lower than 7 Å, in the present model) while the two
                        respective states exhibit 137 and 105 distinctive native contacts. The
                        questions are: How does the number of native contacts vary along the
                        transition pathway? Which contacts among those differentiating the two end
                        structures are maintained along the trajectory and which ones are broken or
                        formed only at the transition state?</p>
                    <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g009">Figure 9A</xref> displays the
                        time evolution of native contacts observed for a single subunit during the
                        transition R→R″; and panel B shows its counterpart for
                        inter-subunit contacts observed in the complex. Clearly, most of the native
                        contacts remain unchanged throughout a large portion of the trajectory,
                        while significant changes occur near the PTS, both with regard to the
                        disruption (<italic>top</italic> panel) and formation
                        (<italic>bottom</italic> panel) of contacts. Trajectories generated by

                        almost identical results, confirming the strong preference of the molecule
                        to redistribute native contacts only in the vicinity of the PTS, while the
                        large portions of the trajectories are enabled by minimal changes in native

                <p>GroEL is a molecular machine that has been broadly studied in recent years using
                    both experimental and theoretical or computational methods. Yet, a
                    structure-based analysis of the transition of the intact chaperonin between its
                    functional forms has been held back by the large size of the chaperonin. The
                        <italic>a</italic>ANM method is proposed as a first approximation toward
                    approaching this challenging task.</p>
                <p>The conformational transition results from the competition of two counter effects
                    at a minimum, one intramolecular, and the other intermolecular: (1) any
                    deformation away from the original equilibrium states involves an uphill motion
                    along the energy surface, but the lowest frequency motions incur the lowest
                    ascent in energy (intramolecular); (2) longer pathways experience higher
                    frictional resistance from the surroundings, such that the shortest pathway may
                    be favored (intermolecular) at the expense of internal strains. In the
                    <italic>a</italic>ANM model, one can balance these two counter effects by

                <p>Central to the development of this methodology were approximations and parameters
                    that needed to be critically tested, hence our extensive examination of the
                    transitions of a GroEL subunit and comparison with the results from other
                    methods, including SDP (action minimization), MD simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Ma2">[11]</xref> and
                    experimental studies. Multiple pathways were explored to this aim by varying the
                    parameters <italic>F<sub>mi</sub></italic><sub>n</sub> and <italic>f</italic>,
                    which control the respective direction and size of the <italic>a</italic>ANM
                    steps. It is conceivable that multiple routes are accessible between the two
                    endpoints, given the multidimensional character of the energy landscape. For
                    example, broad transition state ensembles have been observed by Hyeon, Lorimer
                    and Thirumalai in their simulations of the GroEL allosteric transitions using a
                    self-organized polymer model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>. However, one or more are more probable, and
                        <italic>a</italic>ANM method by definition aims at sampling such probable
                    (structurally favored) paths. Of interest was to identify the common features,

                    them those most closely agreeing with the data from other methods and
                    experiments. Notably, the generated pathways invariably exhibited the following

                    optimal parameter for further calculations for the intact chaperonin. A
                    discriminative feature that supported this parameter was the position of the
                    energy barrier along the reaction coordinate, in accord with SDP. The close
                    neighborhood of the energy barrier is indeed the region most sensitive to the
                    choice of parameters. Notably, this region involves local rearrangements
                    (RMSD&lt;2 Å) comparable (or below) the resolution of examined
                    structures. Therefore the results in this regime should be interpreted with

                    for the R→R″ transition (listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t007">Table 7</xref>) have been verified to be robustly
                    reproduced over a relatively broad range of <italic>a</italic>ANM parameters
                            (0.4&lt;<italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic>≤0.7 and
                        0.2≤<italic>f</italic>≤0.5). Another observation in strong

                    <italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic> = 0.5 is the
                    striking qualitative and quantitative agreement between the dynamics of
                    salt-bridges observed here and those found by BD simulations with
                    state-dependent energy functions and parameters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Hyeon1">[18]</xref>, presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g008">Figures 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000360.s004">S4</xref>, and

                <p>The application of <italic>a</italic>ANM to GroEL therefore elucidates not only
                    highly probable pathways or the hierarchic contribution of modes to achieve the
                    transition; but it also provides insights into key interactions that initiate
                    the transition (e.g., formation of the K80-D359 salt-bridge), or those that
                    form/break at the transition state(s). Such inter-subunit contacts disrupted and
                    formed at the PTS are illustrated at the respective panels A and B of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000360-g010">Figure 10</xref>. Notably, the
                    majority of the residues involved in these critical interactions are highly
                    conserved (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t007">Table 7</xref>), and
                    some of them have been observed in previous site-directed mutagenesis
                    experiments to affect GroEL machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Fenton1">[74]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Sun1">[77]</xref>. The
                    importance of the other identified critical contacts to the functional
                    transitions of the chaperonin remains to be further established by experiments.</p>
                <p>On a practical side, the major utility of the method lies in its application to
                    the transitions of supramolecular systems beyond the range of exploration of
                    other computational methods. The computing time in the present method is several
                    orders of magnitude shorter than that required in regular MD or BD simulations.
                    Here, sampling the transition pathway of the intact GroEL (of approximately
                    8,000 residues) takes less than 255 min CPU time (or about 33 hr real time) on a
                    2G Hz Linux server. The method has its own limitations, however. The modes
                    predicted by the ANM are those exclusively based on inter-residue contact
                    topology. No specific interactions are taken into consideration. So, the routes
                    predicted here are those selected assuming that mechanical effects purely based
                    on geometry dominate the dynamics. However, specific interactions may become
                    more important as more localized changes are simulated, and these are usually
                    manifested by changes in side chain reorientations, which are beyond the range
                    of <italic>a</italic>ANM calculations. We note in particular that there are
                    well-defined ways to define transition rates through reactive flux theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Chandler1">[78]</xref>,
                    optimize reaction coordinates and estimate reaction rate coefficients (see for
                    example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000360-Best1">[79]</xref>), which are not addressed in the present study.</p>
                <p>Finally, from a broader perspective, it is worth noting that this type of
                    calculation is possible only to the extent that the conformational changes
                    intrinsically favored by the overall architecture comply with those required to
                    achieve the biological function (or the allosteric cycle, here). In principle,
                    the configurations are defined in a <italic>3N</italic>-dimensional space,
                    defined by <italic>3N</italic>-coordinates (provided that we adopt a
                    coarse-grained description of <italic>N</italic> position vectors, one per
                    residue). Here, we let the molecule move in the subspace of 5–6
                    coordinates only predicted by the ANM, and we can see that more than ½
                    of the trajectory along the conformational space is traversed by the molecule by
                    simply moving along these soft coordinates. High frequency modes need not be
                    recruited until the energy barrier is approached. The conformational changes are
                    therefore effectuated to a large extent through low frequency modes, which are
                    the least expensive (from energetic point of view), or the most favorable (from
                    entropic point of view) modes among a multitude (3<italic>N-6</italic> of them)
                    of possible modes/directions of reconfiguration. This brings up the issue of a
                    possible evolutionary selection of 3-dimensional structures (or inter-residue
                    contact topologies) whose energy landscape is most conducive to functional
                    changes in conformation. The selection of a conformational changes entropically
                    favored by the structure, in order to achieve biological function, appears to be
                    a common property of proteins, as also evidenced for ubiquitin in a recent study

                <p>To explore the transition pathway between the initial and final conformations of

                    determined as follows: first we evaluate the values

                            <italic>s<sub>Bm</sub></italic><sup>(<italic>k</italic>)</sup> that

                    a unique combination of these parameters (or the sizes |<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>| and |<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>| instantaneous displacements) which leads to the minimal
                        |<italic>d</italic><sup>(<italic>k</italic>)</sup>|. However, the step sizes
                    that meet this criterion may be too large to be extrapolated using a quadratic
                    approximation away from the energy minimum, and the energy cost of the induced
                    deformations may be excessively high and not accurately accounted for by the
                    harmonic approximation. Instead, we take a fraction <italic>f</italic> of the
                    calculated values, i.e., we implement displacements that scale with

                    Calculations repeated with different <italic>f</italic> values support the use
                    of relatively small values for two reasons: First, the smaller steps avoid
                    unphysical distortions in the structure (see Supporting Information); second, if
                    a larger displacement along a given mode direction is more productive, the same
                    mode is selected in the succeeding iteration (see for example how modes 1, 3, 4
                    etc. are selected multiple times at the initial steps of the trajectories in
                        <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000360-t001">Table 1</xref>.) Therefore,
                    in principle, we would like to take steps that are as small as possible.
                    However, the simulations become increasingly time-consuming (due to larger
                    number of iterations) with decreasing step size. Our calculations suggest that
                    the value <italic>f</italic> = 0.2 leads to
                    sufficiently small step sizes along with computationally tractable iterations.</p>
                <p>Finally, instead of picking a fixed <italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic> throughout
                    the entire trajectories, <italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic> can be chosen
                    dynamically, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000360.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (for <italic>k</italic>&gt;1). In the first iteration,
                    only the first dominant mode is used to deform the system. The results with this
                    choice of dynamic
                    <italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic><sup>(<italic>k</italic>)</sup> were found to
                    yield results comparable to
                    <italic>F<sub>min</sub></italic> = 0.4−0.5
                    and SDP results (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000360.s006">Figure S6</xref>). The use of this empirical
                    relationship has the advantage of eliminating the variable
