                <p>Identification of early mechanisms that may lead from obesity towards
                    complications such as metabolic syndrome is of great interest. Here we performed
                    lipidomic analyses of adipose tissue in twin pairs discordant for obesity but
                    still metabolically compensated. In parallel we studied more evolved states of
                    obesity by investigating a separated set of individuals considered to be
                    morbidly obese. Despite lower dietary polyunsaturated fatty acid intake, the
                    obese twin individuals had increased proportions of palmitoleic and arachidonic
                    acids in their adipose tissue, including increased levels of ethanolamine
                    plasmalogens containing arachidonic acid. Information gathered from these
                    experimental groups was used for molecular dynamics simulations of lipid
                    bilayers combined with dependency network analysis of combined clinical,
                    lipidomics, and gene expression data. The simulations suggested that the
                    observed lipid remodeling maintains the biophysical properties of lipid
                    membranes, at the price, however, of increasing their vulnerability to
                    inflammation. Conversely, in morbidly obese subjects, the proportion of
                    plasmalogens containing arachidonic acid in the adipose tissue was markedly
                    decreased. We also show by in vitro Elovl6 knockdown that the lipid network
                    regulating the observed remodeling may be amenable to genetic modulation.
                    Together, our novel approach suggests a physiological mechanism by which
                    adaptation of adipocyte membranes to adipose tissue expansion associates with
                    positive energy balance, potentially leading to higher vulnerability to
                    inflammation in acquired obesity. Further studies will be needed to determine
                    the cause of this effect.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>Obesity is characterized by excess body fat, which is predominantly stored in the
                    adipose tissue. When adipose tissue expands too much it stops storing lipid
                    appropriately. The excess lipid accumulates in organs such as muscle, liver, and
                    pancreas, causing metabolic disease. In this study, we aim to identify factors
                    that cause adipose tissue to malfunction when it reaches its limit of expansion.
                    We performed lipidomic analyses of human adipose tissue in twin pairs discordant
                    for obesity—that is, one of the twins was lean and one was obese—but
                    still metabolically healthy. We identified multiple changes in membrane
                    phospholipids. Using computer modeling, we show that “lean” and
                    “obese” membrane lipid compositions have the same physical
                    properties despite their different compositions. We hypothesize that this
                    represents allostasis—changes in lipid membrane composition in obesity
                    occur to protect the physical properties of the membranes. However, protective
                    changes cannot occur without a cost, and accordingly we demonstrate that
                    switching to the “obese” lipid composition is associated with higher
                    levels of adipose tissue inflammation. In a separate group of metabolically
                    unhealthy obese individuals we investigated how the processes that regulate the
                    “lean” and “obese” lipid profiles are changed. To
                    determine how these lipid membrane changes are regulated we constructed an
                        <italic>in silico</italic> network model that identified key control points
                    and potential molecular players. We validated this network by performing genetic
                    manipulations in cell models. Therapeutic targeting of this network may open new
                    opportunities for the prevention or treatment of obesity-related metabolic
                    complications.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>Obesity is characterized by excess body fat, which is predominantly stored in the
                adipose tissue. Obesity is considered one of the pathological features of metabolic
                syndrome (MetS), which also includes insulin resistance, hypertension, and
                dyslipidemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Reaven1">[1]</xref>.
                Although not all obese individuals develop metabolic and cardiovascular
                complications, the clustering of these conditions of MetS suggests there may be
                pathogenic mechanisms common to all these phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Virtue1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Srensen1">[3]</xref>.</p>
            <p>The specific mechanisms that may lead from obesity towards the higher risk of
                metabolic complications such as insulin resistance and type 2 diabetes (T2D) remain
                elusive. Our preferred nonexclusive hypothesis is the “adipose tissue
                expandability” hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Virtue1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Virtue2">[4]</xref>, which states that obesity-associated metabolic
                complications such as insulin resistance are due to the finite capacity of adipose
                tissue to expand and therefore to store energy. In fact, once this limit of
                expansion is reached and the storage capacity of adipose tissue is exceeded, the
                lipids become deposited ectopically, leading to potentially toxic effects in
                peripheral tissues via the excessive accumulation of reactive lipid species.</p>
            <p>In support of the pathogenic role of limited adipose tissue expandability and
                functionality we have previously shown in a genetically obese leptin-deficient mouse
                (ob/ob) model that ablation of adipogenic PPARγ2 (the POKO mouse) leads to a
                65% decrease in adipose tissue mass as compared to ob/ob mouse, accumulation
                of reactive lipids in pancreatic islets, liver, and muscle, and severe insulin
                resistance and diabetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-MedinaGomez1">[5]</xref>. Interestingly, adipose tissue of the POKO mouse is also
                characterized by an altered membrane phospholipid profile, characterized by
                diminished levels of plasmalogens, the most abundant ether lipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-MedinaGomez1">[5]</xref>. The
                opposite experimental paradigm, increasing the capacity of adipose tissue expansion
                by overexpressing adiponectin in white adipose tissue of ob/ob mice (the AdTG-ob/ob
                mouse), led to a considerably improved metabolic profile as compared to ob/ob mouse
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Kim1">[6]</xref>. Based on
                this evidence we hypothesized that adaption to the demands posed by
                positive-energy-balance-induced adipose tissue expansion may challenge the
                homeostatic mechanisms controlling phospholipid composition and their associated
                biophysical properties. However, given the importance of membrane lipid composition
                and fluidity to maintain the topology, mobility, or activity of membrane-bound
                proteins, and to ensure normal cellular physiology, we also speculated that the
                process of adipose tissue expansion should also incorporate allostatic adaptations
                aiming to maintain membrane functionality for as long as possible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Oresic1">[7]</xref>, particularly
                under metabolically challenging conditions. In this respect we speculated that
                exhaustion of these allostatic adaptations may determine the maximal limit of
                expansion and may coincide with metabolic perturbations.</p>
            <p>Investigations of adipose tissue “lipidome,” covering a global profile of
                structurally and functionally diverse lipids, provide a unique opportunity to pursue
                accurately and sensitively studies profiling hundreds of molecular lipids in
                parallel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Han1">[8]</xref>. The
                spatial complexity of lipid metabolism presents a challenge for the study of the
                global lipidomic profiles. Studies of lipidomic profiles in the context of
                biochemical pathways may shed light on processes behind the synthesis of or
                regulation by specific lipids, but cannot address how these changes translate into
                lipid membrane properties and affect cellular physiology. However, molecular
                modeling tools and large scale computing capacities are becoming available that
                facilitate modeling of lipid bilayers in the context of their composition and
                function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Niemel1">[9]</xref>, thus
                opening new opportunities to interpret regulation and changes of global lipidome
                also in the spatial and physiological context.</p>
            <p>Given the recent increase in the prevalence of obesity and MetS, it is clear that on
                top of their unquestionable polygenic component, other environmental factors such as
                lack of physical activity or high caloric diets are likely contributors to their
                progressive acceleration. However, individual heterogeneity in genetic and
                environmental profiles makes the search for specific clues and mechanisms
                facilitating adipose tissue expansion and its related metabolic complications in a
                general population a daunting task. One suitable clinical study design setting to at
                least homogenize and eliminate the genetic component of this challenge is the twin
                design. Study of monozygotic (MZ) twin pairs, discordant for body weight, provides
                an opportunity to explore the initial effects of acquired obesity and related
                complications since these individuals share not only an identical genetic background
                at the DNA sequence level, but also early life events and family environment.
                Identification of mechanisms behind the traits related to acquired obesity and MetS
                is also relevant from the therapeutic point of view, as these mechanisms may point
                to targets for specific disease phenotypes that are not related to specific genetic
                makeups.</p>
            <p>To obtain a global view of human adipose tissue lipidome in different degrees of
                acquired obesity, here we perform lipidomic analyses of adipose tissue in twin pairs
                discordant for obesity but still metabolically compensated. In parallel, we studied
                more evolved states of obesity by investigating a separate set of morbidly obese
                subjects. Information gathered from these experimental groups was used for molecular
                dynamics (MD) simulations of lipid bilayers using bioinformatics approaches, and the
                conclusions were further supported by in vitro adipocyte confirmatory studies. This
                approach uncovered the potential physiological mechanisms by which adipocyte
                membranes adapt to adipose tissue expansion associated with positive energy balance,
                ultimately leading to obesity. Furthermore, we demonstrate how in extreme obesity,
                failure of this adaptation is associated with the pathological metabolic
                manifestation of obesity.</p>

                <title>Twin Study Design</title>
                <p>We first investigated acquired obesity independent of genetic influences in 13 MZ
                    twin pairs discordant for body mass index (BMI), and nine BMI-concordant MZ twin
                    pairs, of which five pairs were overweight (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s008">Table S1</xref>).
                    The obese individuals were young adults and were considered healthy obese, i.e.,
                    with no clinical comorbidities, and thus in the early stages of the development
                    of obesity. In this cohort, we have previously found that obese individuals, as
                    compared to their healthy lean twins, already show signs of insulin resistance
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilinen1">[10]</xref>,
                    exhibit a pro-inflammatory serum lipidomic profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilinen2">[11]</xref>, have diminished
                    mitochondrial DNA copy number and dysregulated expression of mitochondrial
                    pathways such as branched chain amino acid catabolism, and have elevated
                    inflammatory and immune response pathways in the adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilinen3">[12]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Analysis of the weight-discordant twin pairs showed that the obese twins were on
                    average 15.2 kg (20%, 5.3 kg/m<sup>2</sup>) heavier than the non-obese
                    twins and had more fat subcutaneously, intra-abdominally, and in the liver
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s008">Table
                        S1</xref>). Average adipocyte diameter was 17% larger in the obese
                    than in the non-obese twins, and, interestingly, there was also a very high
                    degree of intra-pair similarity of fat cell size (FCS) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s001">Figure S1</xref>).
                    As expected, adiponectin levels were lower, and leptin and hsCRP levels higher,
                    in the obese twins. The obese twins were also more insulin resistant, as
                    evidenced by the lower M-value and higher fasting plasma glucose and serum
                    insulin levels. Among the dietary intake variables, the proportional intake of
                    polyunsaturated fatty acids (PUFAs) was 26% lower in heavy twins as
                    compared to their lean counterparts (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The analysis
                    of weight-concordant twin pairs showed no intra-pair differences in FCS,
                    adipokines, or insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s008">Table S1</xref>).</p>

                <title>Adipose Tissue Lipidome in Acquired Obesity</title>
                <p>To characterize the adipose tissue lipidome in acquired obesity, we applied the
                    global lipidomics approach using ultra performance liquid chromatography coupled
                    to mass spectrometry (UPLC-MS). The analysis was performed in positive ion mode
                    (ESI+), which is sensitive to neutral lipids (such as triacylglycerols) and
                    major phospholipid classes such as phosphatidylcholines (PCs),
                    phosphatidylethanolamines (PEs), and sphingomyelins. A total of 313 lipids were
                    detected and quantified in each of the 44 samples analyzed. Additionally, free
                    cholesterol was determined by gas chromatography coupled to mass spectrometry
                    (GC-MS), and the data were included in the lipidomic dataset. Since we
                    considered that adipocyte size might be a factor affecting membrane and cell
                    lipid composition, we investigated the lipidome redistribution in relation to
                    the cell size. Thus, following the calibration with internal standards we
                    further normalized the data by the total amount of detected phospholipids in
                    each sample. This allowed us to investigate the relative compositional changes
                    of adipose tissue lipids.</p>
                <p>When comparing the weight-discordant twins, lipidomic analysis revealed
                    characteristic differences in cellular phospholipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The dominating characteristic of
                    adipose tissue in the obese twins was the elevation of PUFA-containing
                    phospholipids, which were predominantly ether lipids, and proportional
                    diminishment of phospholipids containing shorter and more saturated fatty acids.
                    These lipids were clustered according to BMI in both the discordant and
                    concordant twin pairs, suggesting that these observed changes are characteristic
                    of adipose tissue expansion per se, irrespective of genetic makeup. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g001">Figure 1B</xref> further illustrates
                    this by showing the normalized concentrations of the most abundant significantly
                    altered lipids. The most abundant PUFA-containing ether lipids were confirmed to
                    be plasmalogens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Partial least squares regression of lipidomic data
                    related to FCS showed that the changes in the top-ranking lipids associate with
                    the increase of adipocyte cell size in obesity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

                    selective, showing both functional group as well as fatty acid specificity. It
                    is known that PUFAs are selectively targeted to plasmalogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Gaposchkin1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Brites1">[14]</xref>, which

                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Notably,
                    among the elevated plasmalogens observed in the obese individuals, the fatty
                    acid dominantly esterified in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 position is arachidonic
                    acid and not docosahexanoic acid (DHA), which is also commonly found in
                    plasmalogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Gaposchkin1">[13]</xref>.</p>
                <p>To investigate whether specific global fatty acid compositional changes occur in
                    the adipose tissue in response to weight gain, we analyzed fatty acid profiles
                    in weight-discordant twin pairs. We found marked differences in several fatty
                    acids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s009">Table
                        S2</xref>), which included diminishment of stearic (C18:0), linoleic
                    (C18∶2n6), and α-linolenic (C18∶3n3) acids and elevation of
                    palmitoleic (C16∶1n7) and arachidonic (C20∶4n6) acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In relation to
                    known dietary intake, the data are consistent with diminished PUFA intake
                    (decreased linoleic and α-linolenic acids), while other changes appear to
                    reflect an induced specific program of fatty acid desaturation and elongation
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), which leads
                    to elevated palmitoleic acid via desaturation of palmitic acid, and to elevated
                    long-chain PUFAs up to arachidonic acid, but not to DHA. The specific changes in
                    PUFA composition are consistent with the observed changes in phospholipids.
                    However, the elevation of esterified palmitoleic acid in the adipose tissue of

                <p>The observed remodeling of membrane phospholipids in expanding adipocytes of
                    obese twins suggests that these changes may also have an effect on membrane

                    in vitro model systems and from atomic-scale MD simulations of lipid bilayers
                    that an increase in PUFA content will increase membrane fluidity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Huster1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Ollila1">[19]</xref>. The

                    are dependent on the fluidity through packing and degree of order in the

                    fluidity is poorly understood and has not yet been modeled using MD
                    simulations.</p>
                <p>To study the consequences of altered lipidomic profiles on membrane biophysical
                    properties, we performed atomic-scale MD simulations of eight different membrane
                    systems. Based on measured abundance of differentially regulated lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the following lipid
                    types were used in simulations: PC(16∶1/18∶0),
                    PC(P-16∶1/18∶0), PC(16∶0/20∶4),
                    PC(P-16∶0/20∶4), PE(16∶0/20∶4), and
                    PE(P-16∶0/20∶4). Structures of PC(16∶0/20∶4) and
                    PC(P-16∶0/20∶4) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g003">Figure 3A</xref>. In addition to six one-component
                    bilayers composed of these lipids individually, we also studied two additional
                    mixtures of PC(16∶1/18∶0) and PE(P-16∶0/20∶4) with PE
                    concentration of 59 mole percent (low BMI mix) and 70 mole percent (high BMI
                    mix). The mixtures were designed to mimic the compositional difference between
                    the obese and non-obese twins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The selection of the specific six lipid molecules was
                    motivated by the need to characterize specific effects due to three different
                    types of structural changes observed in the lipids: (1) functional group (PE
                    versus PC), (2) vinyl-ether versus ester bond in <italic>sn</italic>-1 position,
                    and (3) degree of saturation in the <italic>sn</italic>-2 chain. There is reason
                    to stress that considering all possible lipid combinations in membranes is not
                    feasible because of the major computational cost. Therefore, the above choice of
                    the eight model systems aims to clarify the overall effects on membrane fluidity
                    arising from the three different structural changes observed in lipids, but with
                    a reasonable cost. Yet the total simulation time is major, about 1 µs.</p>

                    average surface area per lipid, describing the overall packing of the lipids
                    within the membrane plane. The larger the area per lipid, the more fluid the
                    membrane is. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g003">Figure 3C</xref> shows
                    that when plasmalogens are replaced with the corresponding ester lipids, the
                    area per lipid increases by about 0.01–0.02 nm<sup>2</sup>. An increase of
                    0.07–0.09 nm<sup>2</sup> is found when PE is replaced by PC headgroup.
                    Finally, increasing the unsaturation of PC acyl chains increases the average
                    surface area per lipid by 0.02–0.03 nm<sup>2</sup>. Together, membrane
                    fluidity is promoted by decreasing plasmalogen concentration, using PC instead
                    of PE headgroup, and increasing PUFA content. The snapshots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g003">Figure 3D</xref> illustrate different
                    packings and thus different degrees of fluidity in four of the studied
                    bilayers.</p>
                <p>As expected, membrane thickness is negatively correlated with area for all
                    studied systems. Furthermore, increased lateral packing correlates with a higher
                    conformational order of the acyl chains. To illustrate this point, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g003">Figure 3C</xref> shows the inverse of
                    molecular order parameter (<italic>S</italic><sub>mol</sub>) averaged over the
                    saturated segments of the <italic>sn</italic>-1 acyl chains. It is clear that
                    the <italic>sn</italic>-1 chains of plasmalogens are more ordered than the
                    corresponding chains in the ester-bonded lipids.</p>
                <p>To our surprise, no marked differences in the surface area and thus fluidity are
                    observed when high and low BMI lipid mixtures are compared (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). The data therefore suggest that
                    the increased fluidity due to elevated PUFA content in membrane phospholipids is
                    compensated for by decreased fluidity of the elevated PE plasmalogen lipids,
                    with the final result that there is no change in membrane fluidity and
                    thickness. The membrane clearly has compensatory mechanisms to maintain its
                    fluid nature.</p>

                <p>Next, we investigated the regulatory mechanisms that may be behind the observed
                    lipid remodeling. Because of the intrinsic complexity of lipid metabolism,
                    interactions of multiple components are likely involved in the regulation of
                    lipid changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Oresic2">[22]</xref>. To capture such functional interconnections between
                    the biological entities, we considered a network-based approach to be more
                    suitable than studies of differential expression changes at the individual gene
                    level. We selected ten clinical variables, 31 lipid-metabolism-related genes
                    from the published dataset <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilinen3">[12]</xref> obtained from the same samples used in the present

                    As the only “input” variable, we used dietary PUFA intake (PUFA
                    percent). To distinguish direct and indirect interactions of these variables, we
                    utilized the QPGRAPH method, which has been previously applied to study gene
                    regulatory networks based on microarray data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Castelo1">[23]</xref>. The key idea of QPGRAPH
                    is to use partial correlations as a measure of dependency and build an
                    undirected Gaussian graphical model where the variables are connected if and
                    only if their partial correlation is significantly non-zero. Unlike the pairwise
                    measure of associations, e.g., Pearson correlation coefficients, partial
                    correlation provides a stronger criterion for dependency by adjusting for
                    confounding effects, and thus removes spurious associations to a large extent.
                    This is particularly favorable for such an integration of multiple layers of
                    information, as it inherently filters out false positives by discovering only
                    those direct interactions with high confidence.</p>

                    percent was connected to CD36, an important fatty acid transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Hajri1">[24]</xref>, which was
                    further connected to fatty acid elongase Elovl6. In such a network context,
                    identification of genes connected to many other genes or variables of interest,
                    i.e., so-called network hubs, is of particular interest. For example, despite
                    not being differentially regulated itself, Elovl6 appears to be an important
                    hub, with seven connections, including desaturase SCD1. Among the other
                    important regulators of lipogenesis, PPARγ was significantly down-regulated
                    in obese twins, and, along with fatty acid elongase Elovl4, which was not
                    differentially regulated, was associated with the decreased fatty acid ratio of
                    C22:5 versus C20:5, a step which appears to affect the balance between the
                    amounts of arachidonic acid and DHA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In agreement with earlier findings

                    upstream regulator of the lipid remodeling observed in obese twins, sensitive to
                    dietary stimulus such as relative decrease in PUFA intake. To gain further
                    insights we hypothesized that ablation of Elovl6 in the 3T3-L1 adipocyte cell
                    line might reveal a mirroring lipid pattern. In fact, lipidomic analysis of
                    preadipocytes and mature adipocytes revealed that ablation of Elovl6 leads to a
                    lipid profile opposite to the one observed in obese twins, thus supporting our

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>Adipose tissue is a highly active endocrinometabolic organ whose main role is to
                provide efficient storage and mobilization of lipids to fulfill bioenergetic
                demands. Adipocyte function depends on the homeostasis of important cellular lipid
                mediators and lipid structural components of biological membranes required for
                accurate functional responses. These lipid functions are interconnected, e.g., the
                membrane lipids also serve as precursors of lipid mediators. Modern lipidomics
                technologies enable characterization of cellular lipidomes across multiple
                structural and functional groups. However, the analysis and interpretation of data
                from such datasets are commonly limited to the level of biochemical and signaling
                pathways. In this study, we presented a new approach to study global lipidomes in
                tissues and cells by combining cellular lipid networks with lipid membrane modeling.
                This strategy enabled us to identify adaptive mechanisms that may lay behind the
                characteristic remodeling of the adipose tissue lipidome in response to
                positive-energy-balance-induced adipose tissue expansion during the evolution of
                obesity.</p>
            <p>There is evidence suggesting that the total number of adipocytes in humans tends to
                remain constant during a lifetime <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Spalding1">[28]</xref> under physiological conditions. Consequently the excess
                lipid load in acquired obesity poses an extra layer of stress on the adipose tissue,
                which can be compensated by increasing the size of the adipocytes and/or
                overstimulating the normal processes of adipocyte turnover in the adipose tissue.
                This relative stability of the adipose tissue cellular composition requires active
                regulatory mechanisms. In agreement with this perspective, our data show that FCS is
                increased in obese individuals relative to their lean twins in weight-discordant MZ
                twin pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g006">Figures 6C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s001">S1</xref>). We also
                observed a high degree of intra-pair similarity of FCS in weight-concordant MZ twin
                pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s001">Figure
                    S1</xref>), which suggests a strong genetic component tightly regulating FCS.
                These changes in cell size may lead to and/or be affected by minor variations in
                membrane composition, resulting in changes in membrane fluidity and lateral pressure
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Niemel1">[9]</xref>. It would
                be expected that these changes would consequently affect the membrane protein
                function and thus cellular physiology. In this context we consider adipose tissue
                expansion in response to positive energy balance to be a challenge for the
                maintenance of membrane integrity and function, requiring potent adaptive allostatic
                responses.</p>
            <p>With adipose cell expansion, more phospholipids have to be incorporated into the
                cellular membranes. However, this process also requires a very accurate quality
                control system that ensures that irrespective of the available lipid pool, the
                composition of the membrane and its functionality is appropriate in expanding
                adipocytes and newly recruited adipocytes. We found that the expansion of adipose
                tissue is accompanied by a proportional increase of PUFA-containing ether lipids and
                a decrease of more saturated and shorter-chain ester-bound lipids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g001">Figure 1</xref>). These changes were also
                reflected in the altered fatty acid composition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Given that no increase was observed in
                saturated short-chain fatty acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure 2</xref>), it is unlikely that de novo fatty acid synthesis could
                explain the observed fatty acid profile. Of interest, proportional dietary intake of
                PUFA was lower in obese twins than in their lean counterparts, and this was
                reflected in the diminished linoleic and α-linolenic acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure 2</xref>). However, paradoxically, the
                concentration of arachidonic acid was increased in the obese twins, as was also
                reflected in the altered profile of the phospholipids. Notably, this increase was
                specific to arachidonic acid since there was no difference between the levels of DHA
                of the obese and lean twins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure
                    2</xref>). The observed lipid changes are not systemic since we have previously
                shown that the ether lipids are down-regulated in the serum of the obese twins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilinen2">[11]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Our findings support the view that positive energy balance leading to obesity
                initiates a program of membrane lipid remodeling in the adipose tissue, involving
                increased biosynthesis of unsaturated fatty acids including arachidonic acid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In agreement with
                earlier findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Fonteh1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Murphy1">[31]</xref>, arachidonic acid is actively incorporated into the
                membrane phospholipids and selectively targeted to ethanolamine plasmalogens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g001">Figure 1</xref>). However, if the only
                membrane compositional changes were these specific changes in the fatty acid
                composition, the membrane would become more fluid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Ollila1">[19]</xref>. Instead, our membrane
                simulations showed that the targeting of PUFAs to ether lipids, and preferentially
                to the most abundant ethanolamine plasmalogen, helps to maintain membrane
                biophysical properties. In fact, it is known that a relative increase in the PE/PC
                ratio contributes to increasing the rigidity of the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Vance1">[32]</xref> and therefore compensating for
                increased fluidity mediated by unsaturated fatty acids. Here we also provided
                evidence based on biophysical modeling that supports the view that the presence of a
                vinyl-ether bond in the <italic>sn</italic>-1 position of phospholipids contributes
                to further stiffening of the membrane.</p>

            <p>The adaptation of adipose tissue membranes in obesity may carry a price. In fact,
                plasmalogens can serve as antioxidants against reactive oxygen species and might
                thus protect the cells from oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Morand1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Zoeller1">[34]</xref>. However, when
                arachidonic-acid-containing plasmalogens are under oxidative stress, they become
                precursors of arachidonic-derived lipid mediators such as leukotrienes and
                hydroxyeicosatetraenoic acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Fonteh1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Murphy1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Khaselev1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Hall1">[36]</xref>. These reactive lipids are important mediators of
                inflammatory response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Goetzl1">[37]</xref>. Thus, this remodeling process occurring in the membranes
                may make the adipocytes more vulnerable and prone to inflammatory responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g007">Figure 7</xref>), in agreement with the
                elevation of inflammatory pathways in the obese twins of weight-discordant twin
                pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilinen3">[12]</xref>. In
                the context of inflammation, a crucial step in the observed lipid remodeling is the
                relative decrease of C22:6 (DHA) and C22:5 as compared to C20:5, leading to a
                relative increase of arachidonic acid content relative to DHA in acquired obesity
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g002">Figure 2</xref>). In contrast to
                arachidonic-acid-derived lipid mediators, the DHA-derived lipid mediators tend to
                have anti-inflammatory properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Serhan1">[38]</xref>. We propose that stimulation of fatty acid elongation
                from C20:5 to C22:5 and desaturation from C22:5 to C22:6 could be one strategy to
                maintain the membrane function in acquired obesity, while also avoiding the
                collateral damage of increasing the vulnerability of adipose tissue to
                inflammation.</p>
            <p>We observed a high degree of linearity in FCS variation in weight-discordant twin
                pairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000623.s001">Figure
                    S1</xref>). This suggests that adipocytes of these relatively modestly obese
                twins are still within the range of normal expansion and meeting the demands imposed
                by their specific nutritional demands. However, this physiological process appears
                to be disrupted in states of excessive adipose expansion beyond homeostatic capacity
                in morbidly obese subjects, characterized by decreased concentrations of
                ethanolamine plasmalogens compared to the “healthy obese” twins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). In morbidly obese
                individuals, fasting serum insulin does not correlate with FCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). The two diabetic subjects in this
                group had, in fact, the smallest FCS, indicating that the limit of adipocyte
                expandability may have been reached. Identification of pathways involved in
                regulation of early adaptation to excess lipid load is important, since these
                pathways might provide clues about prediction, prevention, or treatment of
                obesity-related metabolic complications.</p>
            <p>We used the network approach, rather than a simpler gene expression level analysis,
                to determine critical nodes that could control adipose tissue lipidome remodeling.
                Doing so, we detected Elovl6, which, while not changed on an mRNA expression level
                itself, appeared to be connected to multiple different factors involved in
                controlling adipose tissue lipidome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g004">Figure 4</xref>). To validate that perturbations in Elovl6 function were
                capable of mediating at least some of the changes observed in the obese twins, we
                used a cell line to validate our network. Consistent with our hypothesis, knockdown
                of Elovl6 in 3T3-L1 adipocytes mirrored the results found in the obese twins,
                therefore suggesting that the observed lipid remodeling may be amenable to genetic
                modulation.</p>
            <p>As a potential limitation of the study, lipidomic analysis was performed in adipose
                tissue biopsies and not in isolated adipocytes. It is known that obesity is
                associated with the infiltration of inflammatory cells in the adipose tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Weisberg1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Xu1">[40]</xref>. We have in fact
                observed elevation of multiple inflammatory and immune pathways in the obese twins
                in our sample <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilinen3">[12]</xref>. However, adipocytes and their lipids constitute most of
                the adipose tissue pool per unit volume, and it is therefore unlikely that the
                observed large change in phospholipid composition is due to changes in percent
                cellular composition of the adipose tissue. Furthermore, if that were the case, the
                lipidome changes observed in morbidly obese subjects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000623-g006">Figure 6</xref>) would have followed the same trend, but
                to an even greater extent, as observed in the obese twins.</p>
            <p>One of the advantages of the twin study setting in the context of understanding human
                obesity is the possibility to explore the initial effects of acquired obesity and
                related complications independent of genetic makeup. The weight differences between
                the twins in the discordant pairs began to emerge at 18 y of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Pietilainen1">[41]</xref>, and diet
                appears to be the major factor behind these differences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000623-Bogl1">[42]</xref>. The discordant pairs were of the
                same age (mean ± standard deviation  = 25.6±1.2
                y) as the concordant pairs (25.7±1.2 y); therefore, age cannot be considered
                a confounding factor in our study. The fact that it was extremely challenging to
                find even this number of MZ twin pairs discordant for weight (only 14 pairs out of
                the cohort of 2,453 twins born in Finland in the years 1975–1979, among which
                adipose tissue was available from 13 pairs) and the fact that the obesity phenotypes
                found were within a narrow range, suggest a strong genetic and early environmental
                basis for susceptibility to obesity. Therefore, our study design offers considerable
                advantages over other types of studies in humans where groups with different obesity
                phenotypes also differ for their genotypes.</p>
            <p>In summary, we have used a novel approach to study cellular lipidomes, and our study
                proposes an allostatic mechanism by which normal membrane function is maintained in
                the expanding adipose tissue at the expense of increasing its vulnerability to
                inflammation. The lipid remodeling seems to be triggered by the proportional
                decrease of PUFA content and is controlled by a complex network involving fatty acid
                desaturation and elongation. If small molecules could modulate this network for both
                membrane functional maintenance and vulnerability to inflammation, new opportunities
                may arise for the prevention or treatment of obesity-related metabolic
                complications.</p>
