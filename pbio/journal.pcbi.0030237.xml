Creating presence–absence profiles of orthologous genes is now a common and powerful way of identifying functionally associated genes. In this approach, correctly determining orthology, as a means of identifying functional equivalence between two genes, is a critical and nontrivial step and largely explains why previous work in this area has mainly focused on using presence–absence profiles in prokaryotic species. Here, we demonstrate that eukaryotic genomes have a high proportion of multigene families whose phylogenetic profile distributions are poor in presence–absence information content. This feature makes them prone to orthology mis-assignment and unsuited to standard profile-based prediction methods. Using CATH structural domain assignments from the Gene3D database for 13 complete eukaryotic genomes, we have developed a novel modification of the phylogenetic profiling method that uses genome copy number of each domain superfamily to predict functional relationships. In our approach, superfamilies are subclustered at ten levels of sequence identity—from 30% to 100%—and phylogenetic profiles built at each level. All the profiles are compared using normalised Euclidean distances to identify those with correlated changes in their domain copy number. We demonstrate that two protein families will “auto-tune” with strong co-evolutionary signals when their profiles are compared at the similarity levels that capture their functional relationship. Our method finds functional relationships that are not detectable by the conventional presence–absence profile comparisons, and it does not require a priori any fixed criteria to define orthologous genes.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>The vast number of protein sequences being determined by the international genomics projects means that it is not possible to functionally characterise all the proteins through direct experimentation. One of the more successful electronic methods for detecting functionally associated genes has been through the comparison of genes' phylogenetic profiles. This method is based on the hypothesis that two functionally related genes will show very similar presence–absence profile patterns throughout different organisms. Whilst these methods have grown increasingly sophisticated, they have largely been based on detecting functionally homologous genes in different species (technically known as orthologous genes) and thus better suited to prokaryotic genomes, where this can be done more easily. We have developed a new type of hierarchical phylogenetic profile by subdividing protein families into subclusters in different sequence identity levels. This new approach encapsulates a more realistic model of the functional variation that uneven natural selection pressure produces on different protein families and organisms, and it can detect functional relationships between protein families without the initial application of rigid sequence similarity thresholds or complex protocols for orthology assignment. These advantages are especially useful in eukaryotes since the larger average size of eukaryotic multigene families makes them more prone to orthology mis-assignment than in prokaryotes.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement> We thank the EU ENFIN Network of Excellence (JAGR), the EU BioSapiens Network of Excellence (CY), and the Wellcome Trust for funding the Gene3D resource.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="13"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Ranea JAG, Yeats C, Grant A, Orengo CA (2007) Predicting protein function with hierarchical phylogenetic profiles: The Gene3D Phylo-Tuner method applied to Eukaryotic genomes.

The approach assumes that two functionally related proteins will have been inherited or eliminated in a codependent fashion through speciation. Therefore, by examining correlated presence–absence patterns in different genomes, it is possible to infer protein co-evolution and a functional relationship.</p><p>After the original idea was published [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b001">1</xref>], the phylogenetic profile method was improved or reinterpreted in many different ways. For example: through the application of more complex logical rules to associate and compare protein profiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b002">2</xref>]; the use of domain profiles instead of whole proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b003">3</xref>]; refining the algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b004">4</xref>]; or integration of species phylogenetic information [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b006">6</xref>].</p><p>Although the phylogenetic profile method can be improved by integrating new sources of information, in all cases the prediction quality of this method depends on two critical steps: the selection of the reference species sample and the determination of which proteins are orthologues. Typically the latter is done using a “Reciprocal Best Hits” (RBH) approach with similarity determined by the BLAST algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b008">8</xref>] and an E-value cutoff for potential orthologues. In fact, these two steps have different impacts on the prediction quality. The reference species problem can be avoided by simply increasing the sample size with new genomes until a certain number has been reached. However, there are many problems, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b011">11</xref>], in determining orthology (two genes from two different species that derive from a single gene in the last common ancestor), especially the separation of orthologues from paralogues (genes that derive from a single gene that was duplicated within a genome). Multigene families that exist within one genome can also exhibit functional overlap and substitutability between the members.</p><p>The fact that genes evolve at different rates, due to both uneven natural selection pressure on their functions and different species having different mutation rates—e.g., rodents accumulate point mutations more rapidly than apes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b012">12</xref>] —implies that the evolutionary rates of proteins may vary over several orders of magnitude in the different gene families [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b013">13</xref>]. This rate variation makes it difficult to choose a single similarity E-value cutoff that can be broadly applied to identify those orthologues most likely to have retained similar functionality.</p><p>The multigene family problem is particularly challenging in eukaryotic genomes wherein the percentage of genes present in multiple homologous copies is much higher than in prokaryotic genomes. However, the higher percentage of multigene families is not the only problem that makes it more difficult to correctly assign orthologous relationships in eukaryotic species. In contrast to prokaryotes, accurate identification of ORFs (open reading frames) is complicated in eukaryotes by noise from domain rearrangements, more complex gene architectures, and a higher presence of noncoding regions. Furthermore, in eukaryotes there is a weaker correlation between the number of ORFs and the phenotypic complexity of an organism. This is probably due to a number of reasons, perhaps most significantly the greater use of RNA-based regulatory mechanisms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b014">14</xref>].</p><p>We have developed a novel modification of the phylogenetic profile method that bypasses several of these problems, especially the orthology—or functional equivalence as it can also be perceived—detection problem, and can detect interacting multigene families. This method is particularly applicable to identifying functional networks in eukaryotes, which have so far proven intractable.</p><p>Our approach is based around protein domains, since these are the most elemental units of protein function. Furthermore, this allows us to bypass confusion caused by domain rearrangements. For this study we have used the domain annotation from the Gene3D database, which stores CATH assignments for complete genomes. The first key modification is that we do not consider the presence–absence of domains but the number of copies of the domain. The second key modification is that we subcluster all the domains at ten levels of sequence identity from 30% to 100%. We then create profiles for every domain family and the subclusters within it, which enables the identification of distinct functional subgroups within domain families.</p><p>Although it is clear that there are always exceptions to any evolutionary model that can be proposed, the co-evolutionary hypothesis implicit in our model supposes that gene copy number in two functionally related protein clusters (superfamilies or subclusters) will vary in a related fashion. In our approach, domain occurrence profiles are built at many identity levels, and therefore it is expected that two protein clusters will “auto-tune” with a significant correlation signal when their profiles are compared at the similarity levels that retain their functional relationship. Therefore, domain occurrence profiles were compared all against all (superfamilies and subclusters) to identify correlations in domain copy number variation in all the different identity levels. Our method found strong co-evolutionary signals amongst functionally related multigene domain families that could not have been predicted by the conventional presence–absence comparison of profiles proposed by Pellegrini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b001">1</xref>].</p><p>This new approach has a number of features that make it especially useful for eukaryotic genome analysis. Firstly, phylogenetic profiles based on protein domains can detect functional relationships that are not detectable using phylogenetic profiles of whole proteins, reducing the noise that protein domain rearrangements produce, particularly in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b003">3</xref>]. Secondly, it uses domain occurrence profiles instead of presence–absence profiles. The latter are less effective in eukaryotic genomes as they do not account for the wide variation in gene copy number observed in eukaryotes. And thirdly, the method applied does not require a priori any fixed E-value cutoff to define orthologous groups. Because domain clusters are built at several discrete identity levels, the method takes into account much of the variation that uneven selection pressure produces on sequence and functional conservation.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Calculating the Information Content of Eukaryotic and Prokaryotic Profiles</title><p>Using CATH structural domain assignments from the Gene3D database for 13 complete eukaryotic genomes and 106 complete prokaryotic genomes, all superfamily domains found in eukaryotes and prokaryotes were clustered at ten sequence identity levels (from 30% to 100%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Each domain was hence assigned a unique identifier composed of the four-part CATH code and a ten-part hierarchical cluster code allowing the simple creation of profiles. Occurrence profiles across species were calculated for all the identity and superfamily levels in these two phyla. Subsequently 10,005 eukaryotic and 28,080 prokaryotic profiles with sufficient taxonomic representation (present in six or more species) were selected for further analysis (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030237-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030237.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Building Gene3D Phylogenetic Occurrence Profiles</title><p>(A) Domain family assignments at different cluster levels: the different sequence identity levels are indicated (s30, 30% sequence identity; s35, s40, etc.); circles represent sequences from different species (colours), grouped by sequence identity.</p><p>(B) Matrix of occurrence profiles for different clusters (superfamilies and their derived sequence identity subclusters).

One of these calculations is related to the presence–absence pattern of the domain clusters throughout the different species, and it is similar to that used by other groups (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b003">3</xref>]). This will be referred to as R+/− information content. The other measure is related to the variation in gene copy number throughout the species in the profiles, and this will be referred to as Ro or occurrence information (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>The profiles of the eukaryotic clusters show significantly higher Ro information content values than the prokaryotic profiles for all sequence identity levels except the s100 level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). In contrast, the R+/− information content in eukaryotic profiles is constantly and significantly less than in prokaryotes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figure 2</xref>B). These results seem to be explained by the differences in the gene copy distributions and average cluster sizes between the two phyla. Eukaryotic genomes show average cluster sizes of around two gene copies per species, and therefore a higher proportion of multigene clusters than in prokaryotes, whose protein clusters are about one copy per species at all identity levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figure 2</xref>C).</p><fig id="pcbi-0030237-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030237.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption><title>Comparison between Eukaryotic (Blue) and Prokaryotic (Red) (A) Ro and (B) R +/− Information Content Averages at Different Sequence Identity Levels (<italic>x</italic>-Axis); and (C) Average Cluster Size (Average Number of Gene Copies per Species along the <italic>x</italic>-Axis)</title><p>Standard deviations are also shown (blue and red dashed lines).

In contrast, lower average cluster sizes of one gene copy per species, distributed throughout a higher number of species, give rise to profiles with lower Ro and higher R+/− information content in the prokaryotic profiles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">2</xref>B).</p><p>These results indicate that except for the s100 level, eukaryotic genomes have a high proportion of multigene families whose phylogenetic profile distributions are poor in R+/− information content. This feature of eukaryotic profiles makes them prone to orthology mis-assignment and bad models for the standard phylogenetic prediction methods of the “1/0 gene presence–absence” type. In contrast, a majority of the eukaryotic profiles show high Ro information content not previously exploited in conventional correlated profiles analyses. There are no prokaryotic profiles with Ro information content above 0.1, except for at the superfamily level (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Therefore, because we wanted to focus on the analysis of the previously neglected multigene families, without applying conventional 1/0 phylogenetic profile comparisons, only the cluster profiles with Ro ≥ 0.1 were selected for further analysis.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Removing the Effect of Genome Size Correlation on Profile Comparison in Eukaryotes</title><p>In many cases a high correlation amongst multigene families and genome size variation has been observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b015">15</xref>]. This is likely to lead to spurious correlations between occurrence profiles due to their correlation with genome size. To analyse the effect on occurrence profile comparison, correlations with genome size were calculated for all the profiles in the eukaryotic matrix (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p><p>At all sequence identity levels, eukaryotic profiles show a bias toward higher genome size correlation values compared to the prokaryotic sample (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">Figure 3</xref>A).

Whatever the causes, this tendency of eukaryotic profiles to correlate with genome size increases the probability of profile pairs having high similarity scores due to this spurious shared tendency.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030237-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030237.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption><title>Analysis of the Genome Size Correlation Effect on the Eukaryotic Profile Similarity Calculation</title><p>(A) Average genome size correlations (<italic>y</italic>-axis) of eukaryotic (blue) and prokaryotic (red) profiles at different sequence identity levels (<italic>x</italic>-axis) and their corresponding standard deviation (vertical dashed lines).</p><p>(B) Percentage distribution of profiles (<italic>y</italic>-axis) by their Ro information values (<italic>x</italic>-axis), for profiles from the real model (black) and from the GS random model (red), having gene representations in six species (continuous line) and in 12 species (dashed lines); the Ro = 0.4 boundary is also shown (vertical black dashed line).</p><p>(C,D) Percentage distribution of profile pairs (<italic>y</italic>-axis) with (C) Ro &gt; 0.4 and (D) Ro ≤ 0.4 for different Ed bins (<italic>x</italic>-axis) for the real matrix (blue), and for the GS (pink) and the PS (yellow) models.</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030237.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>To estimate the effect that genome size correlation has on the Euclidean distance (Ed) score used to measure profile similarity (see Material and Methods), the Ro information content and the profiles' Eds were calculated and compared for the random and the real matrix models (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">Figure 3</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">3</xref>D; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref> for description of the random and real matrices). Ro information values of the GS (random model—Genome Shuffling) profiles' matrix distribute similarly to those of the real profiles' matrix except for universally distributed clusters (e.g., clusters present in 12 eukaryotic species, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). GS profiles of these universally distributed clusters show a clearly differentiated distribution with significant bias toward higher Ro values than the real cluster profiles (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p><p>Ed comparison of the profile pairs shows that GS profiles with Ro values above 0.4 contribute most to the error in the similarity calculations associated with genome size correlation (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). This observation is reversed and the GS distribution is shifted to higher distance classes when similarities are calculated for profiles with Ro below 0.4 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">Figure 3</xref>D and compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g003">Figure 3</xref>C). Therefore Ro = 0.4 appears to be a good selection boundary to reduce the genome size correlation error on profile similarity calculations. As observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, this Ro = 0.4 boundary only affects eukaryotic profiles at the lowest sequence identity level and also shows that universal and highly populated superfamilies are more likely to generate spurious similarity scores due to their probable correlation with genome size (as also observed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b015">15</xref>]).

The Phylo-Tuner method's precision in distinguishing TP from FP cases is around 90% in the highest Z-score bin (Zs ≤ −3.5), drops to around 80% in the lower Z-score bin range (between −3.5 and −3.0), and in all cases gradually decreases to the random proportion of 50% when the Z-score values are in the range −1.0 to −0.5.</p><p>If the Phylo-Tuner method's precision rates are assessed over the entire Z-score distributions of all compared cluster pairs, we see that almost 90% of the 2,344 pairs (formed by 352 different clusters) with Zs ≤ −3.5 (2,109 pairs) are true functionally related clusters. If the slightly lower Z-score boundary is considered (Zs ≤ −3.0), around 80% of the 5,255 pairs (736 different clusters) found below this Z-score value (4,204 clusters pairs) would be expected to correspond to TP predictions. Files containing predicted pairs with Zs ≤ −3.0, and information to generate the profile matrix and perform validation of the Phylo-Tuner method using GO, are provided on the ftp site <ext-link ext-link-type="ftp" xlink:href="ftp://ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">ftp://ftp.biochem.ucl.ac.uk/</ext-link> pub/ gene3d_data/ CURRENT_RELEASE/ PHYLOTUNER/. (We also provide files with the new prediction results using an updated profile matrix with 26 eukaryotic species at the same ftp site).</p><p>Also interestingly, for all cluster pairs with Zs ≤ −3.0, only 3% correspond to instances of domains that frequently co-occur in the same proteins. This indicates that the Phylo-Tuner is able to identify a strong co-evolutionary signal between domains that is not simply due to their fusion in the same gene.</p><p>These results clearly indicate that multigene eukaryotic protein clusters with similar phylogenetic profiles tend to be functionally related and confirm the evolutionary theory behind the Phylo-Tuner method, which holds that functionally linked eukaryotic multigene families have co-evolved and varied their numbers of gene copies in a codependent fashion throughout the speciation process.</p><p>The specificity and sensitivity of the method were not calculated due to the difficulty in obtaining reliable datasets for true negative and false negative predictions. It is highly probable that two functionally related protein families divide into clusters at different levels that retain some functionally related intersections from the parental families, but in many cases without similar profiles. Therefore, whilst it is expected that highly significant profile similarities would indicate highly functionally related protein clusters, it is not necessarily true that functionally related clusters always present profiles with high similarity. This lack of transitivity makes it very difficult to establish with real confidence the false negative predictions produced by the method, and therefore how the method's sensitivity rate varies with respect to the profile similarity Zs.</p><p>Similarly, we do not have a reliable dataset of functionally unrelated protein clusters (true negative predictions) to estimate the Phylo-Tuner method's specificity, since the GO annotation of the domain sequences in our dataset is clearly incomplete (∼50%) and restricted to the human genome; therefore, many functional relationships have probably been missed from the functionally related clusters' datasets.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Comparing the Performance of Phylo-Tuner with the Presence–Absence Phylogenetic Profiles</title><p>Ed and binary (present–absent) or bit distances (Bds) were calculated for all cluster profile pairs on the same matrix of 3,721 protein clusters and assessed with the same procedure as described in the former section (for the Bd calculations all cluster profiles were converted into the presence–absence type).

We have found that by exploiting the Ro information resource in eukaryotic profiles, the Phylo-Tuner method is able to find co-evolutionary signals amongst functionally related multigene families (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g004">Figure 4</xref>) that could not have been predicted by the standard presence–absence profile methods (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g005">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g007">7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030237-sg002">Figure S2</xref>).</p><p>We have demonstrated that two protein clusters will “tune” with a significant correlation signal when their profiles are compared at the sequence similarity levels that capture their functional relationship (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g006">Figures 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g006">6</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g007">7</xref>A, and 7B; and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030237-sg003">Figures S3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030237-sg004">S4</xref>A). Therefore, subdividing protein families into discrete sequence identity levels is a novel implementation of phylogenetic occurrence matrices with three main advantages. Firstly, it takes into account the wide variation in gene copy number observed in eukaryotes. Secondly, it encapsulates a more realistic model of the variation that uneven natural selection presser produces on different protein families and organisms. Thirdly, it does not require the initial application of rigid similarity E-value boundaries or complex protocols for orthology assignment. This last advantage is especially useful since the bigger average size of eukaryotic multigenes families makes them more prone to orthology mis-assignment than in prokaryotes.</p><p>Regarding protein families clustered at different sequence identity levels, it would clearly also be possible to use other approaches to clustering, for instance based on discrete subdivisions of phylogenetic trees. That is, selecting protein clusters associated with different nodes within each family's phylogenetic tree and generating the occurrence profiles from these tree-based subdivisions.</p><p>Protein cluster profiles in prokaryotes typically show an average representation of one copy per species (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). This feature of gene copy distributions in prokaryotes allows the prediction of specific functional relationships between proteins using “presence–absence” profiles and standard profiling methods. However, protein clusters in eukaryotic genomes are frequently represented by more than one gene copy per organism (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g002">Figures 2</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g006">6</xref>B, and 7B). Therefore, whilst the Phylo-Tuner method can clearly detect functional relationships between eukaryotic protein clusters, because there is generally more than one gene copy per species, it cannot identify the specific orthologues involved in the functional association amongst all the homologous genes within the same cluster.</p><p>To illustrate this point by referring to one of the examples described above, the pair of protein clusters comprising the N-terminal beta-catenin binding and the Maf-SKN-1-like transcription factor domains (see second row in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030237-t001">Table 1</xref>) are each represented by 12 paralogous genes in the human genome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030237-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). Although, the Phylo-Tuner method significantly reduces the uncertainty in selecting two specific profiles of functionally related clusters amongst thousands of possibilities, some uncertainty still remains with respect to the specific coupling of the 12 pairs of interacting genes from these human protein clusters.</p><p>Therefore, to reduce the remaining uncertainty associated with the identification of the orthologous genes involved in the specific functional association for a particular organism, it would clearly be valuable to combine the Phylo-Tuner method with other prediction methods, such as those exploiting the correlation of phylogenetic tree topologies between superfamilies, i.e., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030237-b023">23</xref>].

Therefore, the probability that two sequences will share the “recombinase activity” annotation by chance is much less likely than if they shared the “kinase activity” one.

The percent precision distribution (right-hand, <italic>y</italic>-axis) is shown for the analysis with homologous pairs (blue line) and without (red line) for all Zs value bins (<italic>x</italic>-axis for both distributions). Standard deviations are also indicated for the FP rates (vertical lines). Precision percentages were calculated based on the TP and FP frequencies for every Zs bin in the “no homologous pairs” sample, using for this new analysis the same profile matrix (with 3,721 protein clusters) and following the same procedure as described in the section Validation of Associated Profiles With GO Annotations and SS Scores (Material and Methods) and the section Assessment of Profile Similarity and Predicting Functionally Related Clusters (Results/Discussion). It can be seen in this plot that the TP rate in the “no homologous pairs” sample drops slightly from 0.041% to 0.035% in the highest Zs class (≤−3.5), compensated by a proportional decrease of the FP rate in the same Zs bin, giving virtually no variation in the precision ratio compared to the original analysis. For the remaining Zs bins, no significant differences are observed in the TP rate, the FP rate, or the precision values, demonstrating that no significant upward bias of the precision ratio is caused by the inclusion of homologous pairs in the analysis.</p><p>(60 KB PPT)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030237-sg007" mimetype="application/mspowerpoint" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030237.sg007" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S7</label><caption><title>Pairwise Ed Distributions by Percentage</title><p>Pairwise Ed (<italic>x</italic>-axis) distributions by percentage (<italic>y</italic>-axis).</p><p>(A) The homologous (blue line) and the nonhomologous (red line) pairs.</p><p>(B) Distributions for the clusters in the homologous 3.40.50.300 superfamily (blue line) against the rest of clusters in the matrix (red line). Using the same matrix of 3,721 protein clusters referenced above, the Ed distributions of homologous and nonhomologous pairs were calculated independently and compared between both sets (A). Homologous pairs count for only 6% of all pair comparisons, and these pairs therefore have a low statistical weight in the whole statistical analysis. From this comparison it can be seen that the homologous pairs show a very slight bias toward lower Eds. However, if the Ed distribution of homologous pairs from the superfamily 3.40.50.300 (a superfamily which is large enough for significant statistical comparison) is compared with the distance distribution for all the remaining 3.40.50.300 nonhomologous clusters (B), no significant difference is seen. Therefore, the likelihood of finding significant partners within or outside the superfamily are practically the same. These results indicate the possibility that homologous clusters could be co-evolving in a similar manner to nonhomologous pairs when a functional association between them is retained in evolution. For this reason, the co-evolution signal arising from the comparison of homologous profiles is retained within the Phylo-Tuner analysis.</p><p>(61 KB PPT)</p></caption></supplementary-material><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030237-sg008" mimetype="application/mspowerpoint" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030237.sg008" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S8</label><caption><title>Percentage of Profile Pairs in Each Ed Bin for Eukaryotic Profiles with Gene Representation in Six or More Organisms</title><p>Percentage of profile pairs (<italic>y</italic>-axis) in each Ed bin (<italic>x</italic>-axis) for eukaryotic profiles with gene representation in six or more organisms (A) and in five or more organisms (B), for the real matrix (blue), the GS model (pink, GS), and for the PS model (yellow, PS).</p><p>(C) Analysis of the increase in precision obtained by having at least six species in the profile.
