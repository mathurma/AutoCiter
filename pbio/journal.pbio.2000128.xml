<abstract>
<p>Positive-strand RNA viruses build extensive membranous replication compartments to support replication and protect the virus from antiviral responses by the host. These viruses require host factors and various lipids to form viral replication complexes (VRCs). The VRCs built by Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) are enriched with phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) through a previously unknown pathway. To unravel the mechanism of PE enrichment within the TBSV replication compartment, in this paper, the authors demonstrate that TBSV co-opts the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound active form of the endosomal Rab5 small GTPase via direct interaction with the viral replication protein. Deletion of Rab5 orthologs in a yeast model host or expression of dominant negative mutants of plant Rab5 greatly decreases TBSV replication and prevents the redistribution of PE to the sites of viral replication. We also show that enrichment of PE in the viral replication compartment is assisted by actin filaments. Interestingly, the closely related Carnation Italian ringspot virus, which replicates on the boundary membrane of mitochondria, uses a similar strategy to the peroxisomal TBSV to hijack the Rab5-positive endosomes into the viral replication compartments. Altogether, usurping the GTP-Rab5–positive endosomes allows TBSV to build a PE-enriched viral replication compartment, which is needed to support peak-level replication. Thus, the Rab family of small GTPases includes critical host factors assisting VRC assembly and genesis of the viral replication compartment.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plants, animals, and humans are threatened by positive-stranded RNA viruses, which are one of the major groups of intracellular pathogens. To support robust virus replication, these viruses subvert intracellular membranes and co-opt host proteins into virus-induced replication compartments. Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) is a model virus used in yeast to dissect the roles of lipids and proteins in virus replication. In this work, the authors show that one of the two TBSV replication proteins interacts with the guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-bound Rab5 small GTPase, which allows the virus to take advantage of phosphatidylethanolamine (PE)-rich endosomes to build viral replication compartments consisting of peroxisomes. Peak level of TBSV replication depends on the co-opted abundant PE-rich Rab5-positive membranes in plants, too.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All RNA viruses with positive-strand genomes replicate in close association with subcellular membranes in plant or animal cells. The virus-induced membranous structures representing the viral replication compartment help sequester viral proteins, viral RNAs, and co-opted host factors in confined areas for efficient viral replication complex (VRC) assembly and robust viral RNA replication, while also protecting the viral RNA from cellular defense mechanisms. Many viruses orchestrate membrane deformations, leading to generation of vesicle-like membrane invaginations with narrow openings towards the cytosol that harbor VRCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref002">2</xref>]. Current virology research is aimed at gaining deeper insights into the formation of viral replication compartments (frequently called replication organelles), which depends on interaction of viral replication proteins with subcellular membranes, lipids, and various co-opted host factors.</p>
<p>The fascinating new picture emerging with tombusviruses is the complex rearrangements of cellular membranes, alteration of metabolic processes, and recruitment of a surprisingly large number of host proteins for novel proviral functions. Tomato bushy stunt virus (TBSV) usurps cellular membrane remodeling proteins, including the endosomal sorting complex required for transport (ESCRT) machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref005">5</xref>], sterols, and phospholipids, to induce an elaborate membranous replication compartment harboring numerous vesicle-like structures in peroxisomal boundary membranes that support robust tombusvirus replication in a protective microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref006">6</xref>].</p>
<p>Genome-wide screens in connection with proteome-wide studies and lipidomics have revealed the possible roles of hundreds of host proteins in tombusvirus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref010">10</xref>]. In addition to the recruitment of host proteins, tombusviruses also take advantage of various cellular lipids for VRC assembly and regulation of virus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref011">11</xref>]. For example, phosphatidylethanolamine (PE) is essential for the formation of VRCs in an in vitro replicase assembly assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref012">12</xref>] and affects tombusvirus replication in vitro, in yeast and plant cells. PE and phosphatidylcholine (PC) are also important for the replication protein-driven recruitment of viral RNA into membranous VRCs and for the activation of the RdRp function of viral p92 replication protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous high throughput screens revealed that Rab5 (Ypt52, Ypt53, and Vps21 in yeast) and associated proteins, such as Gdi1 (Rab GTPase-binding protein) and Vps41 (a member of the HOPS complex), affected TBSV replication in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref015">15</xref>]. Rab5/Vps21 is a key regulator of early endosomal biogenesis, maturation, and homotypic and heterotypic fusions. The early endosomes obtain their cargoes, such as endocytic vesicles, from the Trans-Golgi network or from the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref016">16</xref>]. Activation of Rab5 requires binding to the target membrane (endosomal vesicles and early endosome) via its prenyl anchor and interaction with guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref017">17</xref>], which promotes nucleotide exchange from guanosine diphosphate (GDP) to GTP. The activated GTP-loaded form of Rab5 then recruits effectors, which promote the formation of late endosomes (also called multivesicular bodies) via fusions and generation of intraluminar vesicles. The model plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has three Rab5 orthologs. AtRab5A (RHA1) and AtRab5B (ARA7) show similar domain organization and C-terminal prenylation with the human Rab5C and the yeast Vps21, whereas AtRab5C (ARA6) is unusual, with N-terminal palmitoylation and N-myristoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Among the many open questions regarding tombusvirus replication is the pathway/mechanism of efficient PE enrichment at the sites of replication. A previous study based on a genetic approach in yeast indicated that the PE-synthesizing enzymes could be separately deleted without detrimental effects on tombusvirus replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref012">12</xref>]. Therefore, these enzymes might play overlapping roles, or PE enrichment depends on intracellular redistribution of PE in cells.</p>
<p>In this paper, we have discovered an unexpected connection between the Rab5-positive endosomes and tombusvirus replication. Specifically, tombusviruses interact with Rab5 small GTPase that results in recruitment of endosomal lipids, most importantly PE, to peroxisomes or mitochondria for different tombusviruses. Altogether, this work demonstrates a new critical proviral function for Rab5 in generation of PE-enriched viral replication compartments.</p>

<title>Tombusviruses Recruit the Endosomal Rab5 Small GTPase into the Viral Replication Compartment in Yeast Cells</title>
<p>To gain insight into the putative role of Rab5 small GTPase in TBSV replication, we co-expressed red fluorescent protein (RFP)-tagged Vps21 (the major Rab5 protein in yeast) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref020">20</xref>] with blue fluorescent protein (BFP)-tagged p33 replication protein in wild-type (wt) yeast cells, followed by confocal imaging.

<title>Interaction between p33 replication protein and yeast Rab5 ortholog Vps21p.</title>
<p>(A) Confocal laser microscopy images show the partial co-localization of TBSV BFP-tagged p33 or the CIRV BFP-tagged p36 replication proteins with the RFP-tagged Vps21p protein in wt yeast cells. Differential interference contrast (DIC) images are shown on the right. Scale bars represent 2 μm. (B) The split ubiquitin assay was used to test binding between TBSV p33 or CIRV p36 and Vps21p in wt (NMY51) yeast. The bait p33/p36 was co-expressed with the shown prey proteins. The mutant Vps21Q<sub>66</sub>L is locked into the active GTP-bound stage, whereas the mutant Vps21S<sub>21</sub>L is locked into the inactive GDP-bound form. <italic>SSA1</italic> (HSP70 chaperone) and the empty prey vector (NubG) were used as positive and negative controls, respectively. The left panel shows p33:Vps21p interactions; the right panel demonstrates that comparable amounts of yeasts were used for these experiments. (C) Pull-down assay including the 10xHis-tagged yeast Vps21 and the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> Rab5B proteins with the C-terminal (soluble) portion of the TBSV p33 (T33C) and CIRV p36 (C36C) replication proteins. Top panel: western blot analysis of the captured cellular proteins with the maltose-binding protein (MBP)-affinity purified p33C/p36C was performed with anti-His antibody. The negative control was MBP. Lane 7 shows molecular weight markers. Bottom panel: comassie blue-staining of protein gel with the purified MBP-p33C (the C-terminal soluble portion of TBSV p33), MBP-p36C (the C-terminal soluble portion), and MBP. (D) Decreased TBSV repRNA accumulation in <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast. To launch TBSV repRNA replication, we expressed His<sub>6</sub>-p33 and His<sub>6</sub>-p92 from the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter, and DI-72(+) repRNA from the galactose-inducible <italic>GAL10</italic> promoter in the parental (BY4741) and in <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast strains. FLAG-tagged Vps21 or its mutants were expressed from the copper-inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter. The yeast cells were pre-cultured for 12 h at 29°C in 2% glucose SC minimal media, and then for 22 h at 23°C in 2% galactose SC minimal media supplemented with 50 μM CuSO<sub>4</sub>. Northern blot analysis was used to detect DI-72(+) repRNA accumulation. The accumulation level of DI-72(+) repRNA was normalized based on 18S rRNA levels (second panel from top). Bottom panels: western blot analysis of the accumulation level of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged p33, His<sub>6</sub>-p92, and FLAG-Vps21 proteins using anti-His and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. Note that FLAG-Vps21 forms a double band due to prenylation (a lipidation type of posttranslational modification) that is required for binding to the endosomal membrane. The faster migrating band represents the prenylated form of Vps21 (depicted by an arrow), whereas the unmodified form is depicted by an open arrowhead. The total protein samples were stained with coomassie blue. Each experiment was performed three times. (E) Decreased CIRV repRNA accumulation in <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast. See further details in panel D. (F) Decreased TBSV repRNA accumulation in <italic>vps9Δmuk1Δ</italic> yeast. See further details in panel D.

Denaturing PAGE analysis of in vitro tombusvirus replicase activity in the CFEs. Note that this image shows the repRNAs made by a full cycle of replicase activity, producing both (-) and (+)-strands in vitro. The CFEs contained the same amount of total yeast proteins. Each experiment was performed three times. (I) Comparable activities of the tombusvirus replicases assembled in CFE membrane fractions prepared from either wt or from <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast.

<p>Because the above experiments indicated that Rab5 might be recruited to the viral replication compartment, we tested interaction between the replication proteins and the yeast Vps21p using membrane yeast two-hybrid (MYTH) assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref021">21</xref>]. Interestingly, strong interaction was detected between the p33 replication protein and a mutant Vps21Q<sub>66</sub>L that is locked into the active (GTP-bound) stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref022">22</xref>], while the wt Vps21p or a mutant Vps21S<sub>21</sub>L that is locked into the inactive (GDP-bound) form showed reduced interaction with p33 in the MYTH assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The experiments with the CIRV p36 replication protein showed comparable results, demonstrating strong interaction with the constantly active Vps21Q<sub>66</sub>L mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Pull-down experiments with purified recombinant replication proteins also supported direct interaction between the C-terminal, cytosol-exposed region of the tombusvirus replication proteins, and Vps21p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, lanes 2–3). Altogether, these data support a model that the tombusvirus replication proteins directly interact with the active form of Rab5/Vps21p.</p>

<title>Deletion of Rab5 Inhibits Viral Replication in Yeast</title>
<p>To test if Rab5 provides an important function during tombusvirus replication, we generated a yeast strain lacking all three Rab5 genes (<italic>vps21Δ ypt52Δ ypt53Δ</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref023">23</xref>] and measured TBSV or CIRV repRNA levels by northern blotting. These experiments demonstrated that tombusviruses replicated only at a ~15% level in the absence of Rab5 proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>, lanes 3–4 versus 1–2). Complementation of tombusvirus replication by expression of wt Vps21p in <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast supported almost wt level of viral RNA accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>, lanes 5–6), demonstrating that a single Rab5 gene provides enough proviral function for viral replication. Interestingly, expression of the active GTP-bound form Vps21Q<sub>66</sub>L in <italic>vps21Δ ypt52Δ ypt53Δ</italic> yeast also complemented the proviral function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>, lanes 9–10), whereas expression of the GDP-bound form Vps21S<sub>21</sub>L could not provide the missing function (lanes 7–8). The lack of complementation was also observed when Vps21S<sub>21</sub>L was expressed to a high level from a high copy plasmid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>), confirming that, unlike the active GTP-bound form Vps21Q<sub>66</sub>L, the GDP-bound form Vps21S<sub>21</sub>L cannot complement TBSV or CIRV replication in <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast. Expression of other small GTPases, such as the Ypt7p (Rab7 homolog, affecting late endosome to vacuole transport), Ypt6p (Rab6 homolog, involved in early endosome to Golgi retrograde transport), or Ypt32p (Rab11 homolog, mediating budding of post-Golgi vesicles from the trans-Golgi) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref024">24</xref>], could not complement Rab5 proviral function in <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Thus, Rab5 seems to have specific pro-tombusvirus function.</p>
<p>Similar to other GTPases, Rab5 also requires GEFs for activation, which are provided by Vps9p and Muk1p in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref017">17</xref>]. Testing of tombusvirus replication in <italic>vps9Δmuk1Δ</italic> yeast revealed poor repRNA replication for both TBSV and CIRV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>, lanes 4–6 versus 1–3). Similar to the situation observed in <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> yeast, the accumulation level of both replication proteins of TBSV and CIRV was reduced in <italic>vps9Δmuk1Δ</italic> yeast. Altogether, these data support the model that tombusviruses co-opt the active GTP-bound form of Rab5 for proviral function.</p>
<p>Testing the activity of the in vitro assembled tombusvirus replicase based on purified recombinant replication proteins in yeast cell-free extracts (CFEs) revealed similar activities for wt or <italic>vps21Δypt52Δypt53Δ</italic> CFEs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1H</xref>), including the membrane fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). The results likely reflect the differences in cell-based and cell-free assays, because the latter performs only a single full round of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref025">25</xref>]. In contrast, cells support multiple rounds of tombusvirus replication during a 22 h incubation period. Therefore, we suggest that the proviral function of the co-opted Rab5 is required at the peak time (late stage) of tombusvirus replication, although it might not be limiting at the early stage of replication, which is in line with the ~15% level of replication in yeast lacking Rab5 orthologs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref>).</p>

<p>To study if the recruitment of Rab5 into the replication compartment is comparable in case of a full TBSV infection of <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants, we observed the subcellular distribution of RFP-AtRab5B by confocal microscopy. Interestingly, we found that AtRab5B was intensely co-localized with the peroxisomal marker (GFP-SKL, matrix targeted), which showed the characteristic TBSV-induced aggregated forms of peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, top). AtRab5-containing membranes frequently formed circles around the peroxisomal matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, second panel from the top). Similar structures, including peroxisome-localized Rab5B-containing membranes, were visible when <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants were infected with Cucumber necrosis virus (CNV, a very close relative of TBSV) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). As expected, uninfected <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants did not show co-localization of the peroxisomal GFP-SKL and the early endosomal AtRab5b and also lacked aggregated peroxisomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, the lowest panel). CIRV-infected <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants showed the intensive co-localization of AtRab5B and the mitochondrial marker (mito-EGFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2C</xref>), including areas showing the characteristic CIRV-induced aggregated mitochondria. Uninfected <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> plants did not show localization of AtRab5b to the mitochondria and also lacked aggregated mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, the lowest panel). Thus, all these <italic>in planta</italic> experiments showed the robust recruitment of AtRab5B into the viral replication compartments. In addition, the aggregated round-shaped membranous structures visible in TBSV or CNV-infected plant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) are similar to those detected when p33 is visualized with antibody and PE is detected with biotinylated duramycin (which specifically interacts with PE, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), suggesting that these structures are extensive virus-induced membrane deformations that contain co-opted Rab5. The enrichment of PE at replication sites during TBSV or CIRV replication is based on a specific process and is not due to condensation of membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref012">12</xref>]. Indeed, PC detected by fluorescently labeled monoclonal antibody was not enriched at replication sites during TBSV or CIRV replication (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm that plant Rab5 is recruited into the viral replication compartment via the interaction with the p33 or p36 replication proteins, we have performed bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) experiments in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves. The confocal microscopic images revealed the localization of p33-AtRab5B complex (detected via BiFC) in the replication compartment (detected via RFP-p33) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). As expected, the large replication compartments contained the viral dsRNA and the peroxisomal marker (RFP-SKL) as well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2E</xref>, lower panels). We have obtained comparable BiFC results with the CIRV p36-AtRab5B complex, which is present in the replication compartments formed at the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Pull-down experiments with purified recombinant replication proteins further supported direct interaction of TBSV p33 and CIRV p36 with AtRab5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, lanes 5–6). Altogether, the data from yeast and plant cells strongly support the model that Rab5 is recruited by the viral replication proteins into the viral replication compartments in peroxisomes and mitochondria, respectively, during TBSV and CIRV replication.</p>

<p>To study if the plant Rab5 might play similar role in tombusvirus-driven PE enrichment in the replication compartment, we expressed dominant negative AtRab5B and Rab5C mutants in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> leaves replicating TBSV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g003">Fig 3C</xref>).

Comparable results were obtained with CIRV. Indeed, expression of dominant negative Rab5B mutant inhibited CIRV replication by ~80% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g003">Fig 3F</xref>) and interfered with the enrichment of PE at the mitochondrial replication compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g003">Fig 3G versus 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s006">S6C and S6D Fig</xref>). Thus, these data highlighted the involvement of Rab5 in PE enrichment at either peroxisomal or mitochondrial replication sites.</p>
<p>To examine if Rab5 is localized in PE-enriched compartments in the presence of tombusvirus replication proteins, we co-expressed GFP-AtRab5B with p33-RFP and detected PE in the same plant cells. We found that the TBSV replication compartment decorated by p33-RFP showed highly enriched PE content and co-localized with AtRab5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s007">S7A Fig</xref>) and peroxisomal marker (GFP-SKL or AtPex13-GFP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g004">Fig 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s007">S7B Fig</xref>).

<p>Because the membrane of the early (Rab5-positive) endosome is rich in PE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref028">28</xref>], recruitment of the GTP-bound Rab5 by tombusviruses might lead to enrichment of PE in the viral replication compartment. To test if PE level is high in the Rab5-positive endosomes in yeast and plant cells, we examined the subcellular distribution of PE with RFP-Vps21 in yeast and AtRab5B in plant cells lacking viral components. Interestingly, Vps21 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g005">Fig 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s008">S8A Fig</xref>) and AtRab5B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s008">S8B Fig</xref>) were localized in PE-enriched membranes in yeast and plant cells.

<p>Addition of the fluorescent NBD-PE to the yeast culture media resulted in the highest enrichment of NBD-PE in the Rab5-positive endosomes (see comparison with RFP-Vps21 endosomal marker) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g005">Fig 5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s008">S8C Fig</xref>), while NBD-PE was not enriched in the Trans-Golgi network based on the Tlg1 marker protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g005">Fig 5D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s008">S8D Fig</xref>).

<p>The enrichment of the endogenous PE or the exogenous NBD-PE in the tombusvirus-induced replication compartment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref012">12</xref>] versus their high-level, Rab5-positive endosomal distribution in the absence of viral components (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g004">4C and 4F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g005">5</xref>) suggests that tombusviruses recruit the Rab5-positive endosomes to the sites of replication. Accordingly, this is supported by the direct interaction between the viral replication proteins and the active GTP-Rab5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1</xref>), which is localized to the endosomal membranes via its prenylated C-terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref016">16</xref>].

<p>PE is synthesized by phosphatidylserine (PS) decarboxylase (Psd1p or Psd2p, involved in de novo synthesis of PE from PS) or by using ethanolamine by Ept1p and Cpt1p [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref030">30</xref>]. Among these enzymes, only Psd2p is present in the endosomal membranes. However, deletion of <italic>PSD2</italic> does not affect TBSV replication in yeast, likely due to the complementing effects of the other PE-producing enzymes/pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s010">S10 Fig</xref>).

Therefore, TBSV might be able to recruit PE more efficiently when PE is only synthesized in the endosomes by Psd2, although this enzyme is not fully required, likely due to the rapid transfer of PE in the cells via the endosomal pathway from other subcellular compartments (see also the NBD-PE distribution, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g005">Fig 5C</xref>).</p>

<title>The Role of the Actin Network in Recruitment of Rab5-Positive Endosomes into the Viral Replication Compartment</title>
<p>The above data support the recruitment of Rab5-positive endosomes to the replication compartment.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>(+)RNA viruses build large replication compartments or organelles during the infection process to support viral replication in a protected subcellular environment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref033">33</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref036">36</xref>]. Although building of the replication compartments is driven by viral replication proteins, viruses have to co-opt an unknown number of host proteins, cellular membranes, and lipids, and even alter cellular metabolism to accomplish these large and intricate subcellular structures. Tombusviruses and yeast serve as simple model systems to identify the host factors involved and to dissect the mechanisms required for building the viral replication compartments. The use of two different tombusviruses, TBSV utilizing primarily the peroxisomal membranes while CIRV usurps the mitochondrial outer membranes, allows for studying the similarities in building the replication compartments in different subcellular niches.</p>
<p>In this work, we have found a major role for Rab5 small GTPase in the formation of tombusvirus replication compartment. The observed direct interaction between the viral replication proteins (either TBSV p33 or CIRV p36) and the active GTP-bound form of Rab5 allows tombusviruses to co-opt Rab5 to the replication compartments, which is required for robust replication. Accordingly, we observed little tombusvirus replication in the absence of the three Rab5 orthologs in yeast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1</xref>) or when dominant negative forms of plant Rab5 were expressed in <italic>N</italic>. <italic>benthamiana</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Co-opting of the endosome-localized GTP-bound Rab5 by tombusviruses facilitates the recruitment of endosomes, as indicated by capturing of the endosomal PI3P lipid in the replication compartment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s009">S9 Fig</xref>). Although we have not characterized this in detail, PI3P might have a role in TBSV replication. Furthermore, the endosomal compartment contains ESCRT proteins/complexes, which might also facilitate their recruitment into TBSV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref037">37</xref>]. The endosomal membrane also contains Psd2p PS decarboxylase involved in de novo synthesis of PE from PS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref030">30</xref>], which could possibly further enrich PE in the replication compartment. Indeed, increased PE synthesis has been shown in yeast or plants replicating tombusviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref012">12</xref>]. Altogether, the tombusviral replication organelles have similar components with Rab5-positive endosomes, including high PE content, ESCRT proteins, Rab5 GTPase, and PI3P. Moreover, the TBSV replication organelles show multivesicular body (MVB)-like structures, which are morphologically similar to late endosomes/MVBs formed from Rab5-positive endosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>The presented data reveal that one major benefit for tombusviruses to recruit the Rab5-positive endosomes via replication protein–Rab5 interaction is the surplus of PE-rich endosomal membrane utilized to build the large PE-enriched replication compartment. Accordingly, in vitro, yeast-based and plant works have shown the great dependence of tombusviruses on high enrichment of PE in VRCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref012">12</xref>]. The high PE level likely facilitates the stable formation of spherules due to the known feature of PE to induce negative membrane curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref041">41</xref>] and the activation of the tombusvirus RdRp [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results also reveal that both the peroxisomal TBSV and the mitochondrial CIRV use similar strategies with high efficiency to hijack the Rab5-positive endosomes into the viral replication compartments. Tombusviruses utilize the actin network to accomplish this feat in plant cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s014">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000128.s015">S3</xref> Videos). It is known that tombusviruses manipulate the actin network via blocking the function of Cof1p (cofilin/ADF), which is an actin filament depolymerizing factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref042">42</xref>]. Due to the p33-driven inhibition of Cof1p activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref043">43</xref>], the actin filaments are stabilized during tombusvirus replication, facilitating the efficient transport of cargoes to the replication compartments. Accordingly, the large replication compartments are located at the crossroads of actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref032">32</xref>]. Based on these observations, we propose that one of the major functions of the (virus-mediated) stabilized actin filaments is to deliver the Rab5-positive endosomes captured via replication protein–GTP-Rab5 interaction to the sites of replication to build the large and protective replication compartment that is initially formed on either peroxisomal (in case of TBSV) or mitochondrial membranes (in case of CIRV). Thus, the replication protein–GTP-Rab5 interaction might be needed mostly during the peak replication period that coincides with the appearance of large replication compartments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref044">44</xref>]. Indeed, the role of Rab5 was minimal during cell-free replication, which consists of only one full cycle of RNA synthesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Altogether, our current model predicts that, after the assembly of a limited number of tombusvirus VRCs at peroxisomal or mitochondrial membranes to support initial replication, tombusviruses recruit the Rab5-positive endosomes to channel large amount of PE-rich membranes for new VRC assembly, leading to the formation of MVB-like replication organelles at the latter stage of replication. Thus, hijacking Rab5-positive endosomes is critical for tombusvirus replication to reach to peak level by providing additional PE-rich membranes and possibly other host factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000128.g007">Fig 7</xref>).</p>

<title>A model on the roles of p33-mediated recruitment of Rab5-positive endosomes in the formation of large tombusviral replication compartments.</title>
<p>At the early stage of tombusvirus replication, TBSV-induced spherule formation may take place in the existing peroxisomal membranes. At the peak time of replication, occurring at a late stage at which point the viral components are much more abundant due to ongoing translation of viral RNAs, however, a portion of p33 molecules co-opt the PE-rich Rab5-positive endosomes via p33–GTP-Rab5 interaction using the actin cables. These processes lead to the formation of large replication compartments containing aggregated peroxisomes fused with PE-rich Rab5-positive endosomes, providing the suitable microenvironment for building numerous spherules harboring the active tombusvirus VRCs. We envision similar early and peak/late stages with CIRV, except the involvement of mitochondria in building the viral replication compartment.</p>

<p>It is known that other (+)RNA viruses co-opt small cytosolic GTPases to boost virus replication. For example, enteroviruses co-opt Arf1 small GTPase and its guanine nucleotide exchange factor GBF1 to recruit downstream effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref046">46</xref>]. One of these effectors is phosphatidylinositol-4-kinase IIIbeta, which generates PI4P-rich membranes that are needed for recruitment of the viral RdRp and the formation of the viral replication organelle. Some enteroviruses also co-opt the recycling endosomal compartment through Rab11 small GTPase to enrich sterols in the viral replication organelles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>RNAi-based down-regulation of Rab5A and Rab7L1 inhibited Hepatitis C virus (HCV) replication, suggesting that these small GTPases are host factors for HCV [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref048">48</xref>]. Moreover, HCV recruits Rab5 and Rab7 into foci containing the NS4B replication protein, which remodels host membranes to form HCV replication complexes. Expression of dominant negative mutant of Rab5 inhibited the NS4B foci formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref049">49</xref>]. HCV replication also depends on Rab27a, which controls membrane trafficking, microvesicle transport pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref050">50</xref>], and Rab1, which is recruited to lipid droplets by the NS5A replication protein to promote viral replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref051">51</xref>]. Similarly, Dengue virus (DENV) takes advantage of Rab18, which facilitates the recruitment of fatty acid synthase and NS3 replication protein to lipid droplets, probably to facilitate sufficient lipid supply for membrane proliferation needed for DENV replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref052">52</xref>].</p>
<p>Although the proviral functions of plant Rab small GTPases have not yet been defined in detail, the role of the Golgi-localized NbRABG3f is important for <italic>Bamboo mosaic virus</italic> replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref053">53</xref>]. Also, Arf1 small GTPase binds to the p27 replication protein of <italic>Red clover necrotic mosaic virus</italic>, and inhibition of Arf1 activity disrupted VRC assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref054">54</xref>]. Small GTPases of the secretory pathway also affect the replication of potyviruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000128.ref055">55</xref>]. Thus, the emerging view is that replication of both animal and plant RNA viruses greatly depends on a subset of small GTPases of the secretory/endocytic pathways, likely offering targets for future antiviral interventions.</p>

<title>Summary</title>
<p>In this work, we demonstrate that tombusviruses subvert Rab5-positive endosomes to build complex replication compartments involving either peroxisomes or mitochondria. These events supply the proviral PE to facilitate the membranous microenvironment during peak-level viral replication. This hijacked cellular pathway for supporting PE enrichment in the viral replication compartment might provide an intriguing target for disease control.</p>

FLAG-tagged Vps21, Ypt6, Ypt7 and Ypt32, respectively, were expressed from the copper-inducible <italic>CUP1</italic> promoter based on low copy number plasmids. The yeast cells were pre-cultured for 12 hours at 29°C in 2% glucose SC minimal media, and then for 22 h at 23°C in 2% galactose SC minimal media supplemented with 50 μM CuSO<sub>4</sub>. Northern blot analysis was used to detect DI-72(+) repRNA accumulation. The accumulation level of DI-72(+) repRNA was normalized based on 18S rRNA levels (second panel from top). Bottom panels: Western blot analysis of the accumulation level of His<sub>6</sub>-tagged p33, His<sub>6</sub>-p92 and FLAG-Vps21, Ypt6, Ypt7 and Ypt32 proteins using anti-His and anti-FLAG antibodies, respectively. Note that FLAG-Vps21, Ypt6, and Ypt7 form a double band due to prenylation (a lipidation type of posttranslational modification) that is required for binding to the subcellular membrane. The faster migrating band represents the prenylated forms (depicted by an arrow), while the unmodified form is depicted by an open arrowhead. The total protein samples were stained with coomassie blue. Each experiment was performed three times.</p>
