Here, we examined whether this functional organization is disrupted in Alzheimer's disease (AD). Task-free fMRI data from 21 AD subjects and 18 age-matched controls were obtained. Wavelet analysis was applied to the fMRI data to compute frequency-dependent correlation matrices. Correlation matrices were thresholded to create 90-node undirected-graphs of functional brain networks. Small-world metrics (characteristic path length and clustering coefficient) were computed using graph analytical methods. In the low frequency interval 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, functional brain networks in controls showed small-world organization of brain activity, characterized by a high clustering coefficient and a low characteristic path length. In contrast, functional brain networks in AD showed loss of small-world properties, characterized by a significantly lower clustering coefficient (p&lt;0.01), indicative of disrupted local connectivity. Clustering coefficients for the left and right hippocampus were significantly lower (p&lt;0.01) in the AD group compared to the control group. Furthermore, the clustering coefficient distinguished AD participants from the controls with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 78%. Our study provides new evidence that there is disrupted organization of functional brain networks in AD. Small-world metrics can characterize the functional organization of the brain in AD, and our findings further suggest that these network measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish AD from healthy aging.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a brain disorder characterized by progressive impairment of episodic memory and other cognitive domains resulting in dementia and, ultimately, death. Functional neuroimaging studies have identified brain regions that show abnormal brain function in AD. Although there is converging evidence about the identity of these regions, it is not clear how this abnormality affects the functional organization of the whole brain. In order to characterize the functional organization of the brain, our approach uses small-world measures, which have also been used to study systems such as social networks and the internet. We use graph analytical methods to compute these measures of functional connectivity brain networks, which are derived from fMRI data obtained from healthy elderly controls and AD patients. The AD patients had significantly lower regional connectivity, and showed disrupted global functional organization, when compared to healthy controls. Moreover, our results indicate that cognitive decline in Alzheimer's disease patients is associated with disrupted functional connectivity in the entire brain. Our findings further suggest that small-world measures may be useful as an imaging-based biomarker to distinguish AD from healthy aging.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded by grants from the Alzheimer's Association (NIRG-04-1060) and the NIH (NS048302; 5R01HD047520-03).</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="11"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Alzheimer's disease (AD) is a neurodegenerative disorder characterized by progressive impairment of episodic memory and other cognitive domains resulting in dementia and, ultimately, death.

To our knowledge, this is the first study to examine alterations in global functional organization and connectivity in AD patients using fMRI data. Graph metrics–clustering coefficient and characteristic path length—were used to measure and characterize global functional organization in the brain. The main finding of our study is that functional brain networks in AD consistently showed lower clustering but similar characteristic path lengths compared to controls, which suggests disrupted global functional organization in AD. Our findings also suggest that small-world network characteristics might be useful as an imaging biomarker for AD.</p><p>The characteristic path lengths were low (λ∼1) and showed no significant differences between the AD group and the control group, suggesting short distances between distinct brain regions in both groups. This finding suggests an organization consisting of multiple short alternative paths between nodes in functional brain networks in both groups.</p><p>The most interesting finding of our study was the lower levels of clustering observed in the AD group. Clustering coefficient is a measure of local efficiency or the fault-tolerance of a network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Strogatz1">[21]</xref>. The difference in clustering coefficients in the AD group as compared to the control group was observed at a correlation threshold at or near a subject's average correlation (to ensure an equivalent number of edges across subjects), and the clustering coefficient was significantly lower in the AD group, suggesting loss of local efficiency in AD. Similarly, values for σ, a measure of small-worldness, were significantly lower in the AD group compared to the control group, suggesting loss of small-world properties in AD.</p><p>Analysis of global efficiency in functional brain networks showed that the networks exhibit small-world properties indicated by smaller E<sub>global</sub> values compared to random networks, but this measure was not significantly different. This finding parallels results obtained with measures of characteristic path length.</p><p>Regional analysis of differences in clustering coefficients as a function of correlation thresholds showed that the left and the right hippocampal regions differed significantly between groups. In contrast, the clustering coefficient of the precentral gyrus did not differ between groups. This suggests disrupted connectivity from the hippocampus to other regions of the brain in AD. This finding is consistent with our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Greicius1">[10]</xref> showing that AD reduced functional connectivity of the hippocampus within a specific network of regions—the default mode network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Raichle1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Greicius2">[28]</xref> that includes the posterior cingulate and lateral temporoparietal cortices. It is also consistent with the study by Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Wang1">[16]</xref> showing altered hippocampal connectivity to several neocortical regions in the early stages of AD. Other studies have reported decreased intrahippocampal synchrony of low frequency BOLD fluctuations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Li1">[17]</xref> during a task-free scan. Taken together, these findings point to significantly altered local and global hippocampal network connectivity in AD.</p><p>Analysis of the group differences in the regional connectivity across several broadly defined anatomical regions demonstrate that AD patients not only showed decreased intratemporal, temporo-thalamus, temporo-corpus striatum, thalamo-occipital and thalamo-frontal connectivity but, surprisingly, also showed increased intrafrontal, frontal-prefrontal, and fronto-corpus striatum connectivity. These findings are in line with the recent study by Wang et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Wang2">[29]</xref> which not only reported decreased connectivity between a number of regions, but also increased prefrontal connectivity in AD. As suggested by fMRI studies showing increased prefrontal activation in AD during task performance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Gould1">[30]</xref>, these findings suggest that patients with AD may rely on increased prefrontal connectivity to compensate for reduced temporal connectivity. An intriguing (and testable) hypothesis is that the ability to make such compensatory changes in frontal lobe connectivity may account in part for the “cognitive reserve” phenomenon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Stern1">[31]</xref> that allows some patients to perform better than others despite equivalent pathological burdens.</p><p>Small-world characterization is well-suited for analyzing anatomical and functional brain networks at the system level because these networks are complex and optimally connected to minimize information processing costs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Bassett1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Sporns1">[33]</xref>.

This network of intrinsic, task-free functional interactions between 90 cortical regions was also shown to have small-world properties–high clustering coefficient and low characteristic path length. The small-world architecture was confirmed by Achard et al., who also reported that the small-world properties were salient in the frequency interval 0.03 to 0.06 Hz <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Achard1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Bassett1">[32]</xref>.

Recently, Stam et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Stam2">[25]</xref>. reported that the architecture of whole-brain functional networks derived using scalp EEG is disrupted in AD. They observed that a 21-node network constructed using EEG data collected from subjects with AD showed loss of small-world properties characterized by longer characteristic path length with relative sparing of the local clustering.</p><p><xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000100-t002">Table 2</xref> provides a comparison of results obtained from our study to all of the above-mentioned results on the small-world characterization of functional brain networks.

The small-world metrics reported by Stam et al. analyzing beta-band EEG in controls and AD subjects are also largely consistent with our results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Stam2">[25]</xref>. It is interesting to note that whereas we report similar characteristic path lengths but different cluster coefficients between AD and controls, the EEG study found the converse (characteristic path lengths differed between AD subjects and controls but cluster coefficients did not). We believe that this discrepancy may be related to significant volume conduction in scalp EEG data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Menon1">[38]</xref> which may reduce sensitivity to detect differences in short-range connectivity while enhancing the relative sensitivity to detect differences in long-range connectivity. Other methodological differences may also contribute–the use of synchronization likelihood as their association measure, which unlike wavelet correlation is sensitive to non-linear coupling. Also, the poor spatial resolution of scalp EEG limits the network to mainly cortical regions, unlike our fMRI study where the network comprised of cortical as well as sub-cortical regions, which is a relative strength of our study.</p><table-wrap id="pcbi-1000100-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000100.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><title>Comparison of number of nodes in the graph (N), normalized characteristic path length (λ), normalized clustering coefficient (γ), and small-world measure (σ) from our study with previously published results on small-world characterization of functional brain network constructed using EEG, MEG, and fMRI data.</title></caption><!--===== Grouping alternate versions of objects =====--><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi-1000100-t002-2" mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000100.t002" xlink:type="simple"/><table><colgroup span="1"><col align="left" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/><col align="center" span="1"/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">Data</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">N</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">λ</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">γ</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">σ</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">fMRI of healthy human subjects (Our study)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">90</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.05</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.74</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.66</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">fMRI of human subjects with AD (Our study)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">90</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.042</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.56</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.497</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">EEG of healthy human subjects (Stam 2006)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">21</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.07</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.58</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.476</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">EEG of human subjects with AD (Stam 2006)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">21</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.12</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.6</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.428</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">EEG of healthy human subjects (Micheloyannis 2006)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">28</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.0</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.0</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">MEG of healthy human subjects (Stam 2004)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">126</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.8</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">4.2</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.3</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">fMRI of healthy human subjects (Salvador 2005)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">90</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.09</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.08</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.91</td></tr><tr><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">fMRI of healthy human subjects (Achard 2006)</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">90</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">1.09</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.37</td><td align="left" colspan="1" rowspan="1">2.18</td></tr></tbody></table></alternatives></table-wrap><p>To address the extent to which clustering coefficients serve as a sensitive biomarker to distinguish AD from healthy aging, we examined γ values in the two subject groups. The clustering coefficient is a measure of efficiency in network connectivity. It distinguished AD subjects from controls with a sensitivity of 72% and specificity of 78%. These values approach the sensitivity and specificity reported for other imaging biomarkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Greicius1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Rabinovici1">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Ramani1">[41]</xref> and are close to the range considered clinically relevant by a recent Working Group on biomarkers in AD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-The1">[42]</xref>. With some improvements in the technique—decreasing the number of nodes in the network for example—the clustering coefficient may therefore prove to be an effective biomarker for AD, though prospective studies will be required to validate its effectiveness. In addition to its promise as a diagnostic aid, the clustering coefficient merits investigation as a functional marker of response to treatment.</p><p>This study has two main limitations. First, in evaluating its efficacy as a biomarker, it will be critical to assess this metric not only in AD and normal subjects, but in subjects with non-AD dementias and related conditions to ensure that these findings are specific to AD and not to dementia or other neurodegenerative disorders more generally. The second limitation pertains to the fact that most of the AD patients (14 of 21), and none of the controls, were taking an acetylcholinesterase inhibitor. Similarly, 12 of 21 AD patients, and none of the controls, were taking memantine, an NMDA-receptor antagonist. While we doubt that these differences in medication exposure could account for the differences in clustering coefficients in AD subjects we cannot exclude that possibility in the current study.</p><p>In conclusion, we have demonstrated that fMRI-derived functional brain networks in AD show loss of small-world properties. Our findings suggest that cognitive decline in AD is associated with disrupted global functional organization in the brain.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Participants</title><p>Twenty one subjects with AD and eighteen age-matched control subjects participated in this study after giving written, informed consent.

For the frequency range 0.01 to 0.05 Hz, the correlation values of 108 pairs of anatomical regions out of a total 4005 pairs were significantly lower in the AD group as compared to the control group while only 42 correlation values showed a significant increase in the AD group (p&lt;0.01, corrected for multiple comparisons). To get an idea of average differences in the global functional organization in the two groups, we investigated the regional connectivity at a coarser level of granularity. Ninety anatomical regions of our network were grouped into eight higher-level anatomical regions using the grouping defined by Tzourio-Mazoyer et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-TzourioMazoyer1">[45]</xref>. The <italic>prefrontal lobe region</italic> consists of the superior frontal gyrus (dorsolateral, orbital, medial, medial orbital), the middle frontal gyrus, the middle frontal gyrus (orbital), the inferior frontal gyrus (opercular, triangular, orbital), the olfactory gyrus, the gyrus rectus, and the anterior cingulate. The <italic>other parts of frontal lobe region</italic> consists of the precentral gyrus, the supplementary motor area, the median cingulate, and the rolandic operculum. The <italic>occipital lobe region</italic> consists of the calcarine fissure, the cuneus, the lingual gyrus, the superior occipital gyrus, the middle occipital gyrus, and the inferior occipital gyrus. The <italic>temporal lobe and the medial temporal region</italic> consists of the superior temporal gyrus, the temporal pole (superior, middle), the middle temporal gyrus, the inferior temporal gyrus, the heschl gyrus, the fusiform gyrus, the hippocampus, the parahippocampal gyrus, and the amygdala. The <italic>parietal lobe region</italic> consists of the postcentral gyrus, the superior parietal lobule, the inferior parietal lobule, the supramarginal gyrus, the angular gyrus, the precuneus, the paracentral lobule, and the posterior cingulate gyrus. The <italic>corpus striatum region</italic> consists of the caudate nucleus, the putamen, and the pallidum. Each higher level anatomical region consists of regions from both the hemispheres. Differences in mean correlation coefficients for 4005 pairs were aggregated into 32 pairs and the resulting differences were then normalized. (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000100-Liang1">[52]</xref>). In the aggregation step, the number of decreased (−1) or increased connectivities (+1) for each of the 32 pairs ( = (8×8)/2) was counted. For example, to identify differential connectivity between the <italic>prefrontal lobe region</italic> and the <italic>occipital lobe region</italic> the number of decreased or increased connectivities between all pairs of sub-regions belonging to the <italic>prefrontal lobe region</italic> and <italic>occipital lobe region</italic> was counted. Since each brain region has a different number of sub-regions, the aggregated differential connectivity count was normalized by the number of possible connections between pairs of sub regions belonging to the two brain regions under investigation.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi.1000100.s001" mimetype="application/msword" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000100.s001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Table S1</label><caption><p>Regions of whole brain functional network ranked in ascending order of the p-value (computed using growth curve modeling) and then descending order of absolute difference between the clustering coefficient values of the AD group and the control group.</p><p>(0.18 MB DOC)</p></caption></supplementary-material></sec></body><back><ack><p>The authors would like to acknowledge Drs.
