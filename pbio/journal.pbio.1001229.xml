        <p>Inclusion or exclusion of single codons at the splice acceptor site of mammalian genes is regulated in a tissue-specific manner, is strongly conserved, and is associated with local accelerated protein evolution.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Thousands of human genes contain introns ending in NAGNAG (N any nucleotide), where both NAGs can function as 3′ splice sites, yielding isoforms that differ by inclusion/exclusion of three bases. However, few models exist for how such splicing might be regulated, and some studies have concluded that NAGNAG splicing is purely stochastic and nonfunctional. Here, we used deep RNA-Seq data from 16 human and eight mouse tissues to analyze the regulation and evolution of NAGNAG splicing. Using both biological and technical replicates to estimate false discovery rates, we estimate that at least 25% of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs undergo tissue-specific regulation in mammals, and alternative splicing of strongly tissue-specific NAGNAGs was 10 times as likely to be conserved between species as was splicing of non-tissue-specific events, implying selective maintenance. Preferential use of the distal NAG was associated with distinct sequence features, including a more distal location of the branch point and presence of a pyrimidine immediately before the first NAG, and alteration of these features in a splicing reporter shifted splicing away from the distal site. Strikingly, alignments of orthologous exons revealed a ∼15-fold increase in the frequency of three base pair gaps at 3′ splice sites relative to nearby exon positions in both mammals and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Alternative splicing of NAGNAGs in human was associated with dramatically increased frequency of exon length changes at orthologous exon boundaries in rodents, and a model involving point mutations that create, destroy, or alter NAGNAGs can explain both the increased frequency and biased codon composition of gained/lost sequence observed at the beginnings of exons. This study shows that NAGNAG alternative splicing generates widespread differences between the proteomes of mammalian tissues, and suggests that the evolutionary trajectories of mammalian proteins are strongly biased by the locations and phases of the introns that interrupt coding sequences.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In order to translate a gene into protein, all of the non-coding regions (introns) need to be removed from the transcript and the coding regions (exons) stitched back together to make an mRNA. Most human genes are alternatively spliced, allowing the selection of different combinations of exons to produce multiple distinct mRNAs and proteins. Many types of alternative splicing are known to play crucial roles in biological processes including cell fate determination, tumor metabolism, and apoptosis. In this study, we investigated a form of alternative splicing in which competing adjacent 3′ splice sites (or splice acceptor sites) generate mRNAs differing by just an RNA triplet, the size of a single codon. This mode of alternative splicing, known as NAGNAG splicing, affects thousands of human genes and has been known for a decade, but its potential regulation, physiological importance, and conservation across species have been disputed. Using high-throughput sequencing of cDNA (“RNA-Seq”) from human and mouse tissues, we found that single-codon splicing often shows strong tissue specificity. Regulated NAGNAG alternative splice sites are selectively conserved between human and mouse genes, suggesting that they are important for organismal fitness. We identified features of the competing splice sites that influence NAGNAG splicing, and validated their effects in cultured cells. Furthermore, we found that this mode of splicing is associated with accelerated and highly biased protein evolution at exon boundaries. Taken together, our analyses demonstrate that the inclusion or exclusion of RNA triplets at exon boundaries can be effectively regulated by the splicing machinery, and highlight an unexpected connection between RNA processing and protein evolution.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The split structure of eukaryotic genes impacts gene expression and evolution in diverse ways. Most directly, the presence of introns enables multiple distinct mRNA and protein products to be produced from the same gene locus through alternative splicing, which is often regulated between tissues or developmental stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Wang1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Graveley1">[2]</xref>. Alternative inclusion or exclusion of exons—“exon skipping”—can generate protein isoforms with distinct subcellular localization, enzymatic activity or allosteric regulation, and differing, even opposing, biological function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Cascino1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Cooper1">[5]</xref>. Splicing is often regulated by enhancer or silencer motifs in the pre-mRNA that are bound by splicing regulatory proteins that interact with each other or with the core splicing machinery to promote or inhibit splicing at nearby splice sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Black1">[6]</xref>. Such enhancer and silencer motifs are common throughout constitutive as well as alternative exons and their flanking introns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Fairbrother1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Zhang1">[9]</xref>. In turn, the presence of splicing regulatory motifs in exons, and their higher frequency near splice junctions, impacts protein evolution. For example, the frequencies of single nucleotide polymorphisms (SNPs) and amino acid substitutions are both reduced near exon-exon junctions relative to the centers of exons as a result of selection on exonic splicing enhancer motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Fairbrother2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Parmley1">[11]</xref>. Thus, a gene's exon-intron structure and its evolution are intimately linked.</p>
      <p>Alternative 3′ and 5′ splice site use, in which longer or shorter versions of an exon are included in the mRNA, are among the most common types of alternative splicing in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Wang1">[1]</xref> and can generate protein isoforms with subtly or dramatically differing function. For example, production of the pro-apoptotic Bcl-xS or the anti-apoptotic Bcl-xL protein isoforms is controlled through regulated alternative splice site usage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Boise1">[12]</xref>. Binding of splicing regulatory factors between the alternative splice sites or immediately adjacent to one site or the other can shift splicing toward the (intron-) proximal or distal splice site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Black1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Wang3">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Matlin1">[14]</xref>, providing a means to confer cell type-specific regulation. The distance between the alternative splice sites can vary over a wide range, from hundreds of bases to as few as three bases in the case of NAGNAG alternative 3′ splice sites.</p>
      <p>NAGNAG alternative splicing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) has been observed in vertebrates, insects, and plants, and is known to be very common. Bioinformatic analyses of expressed sequence tag (EST) databases have identified thousands of examples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Hiller1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Daines1">[18]</xref>. However, most of the mechanisms known to regulate other alternative 3′ splice site pairs, particularly those that involve binding of regulatory factors between the sites, or much closer to one site than the other, cannot apply to NAGNAGs because of the extreme proximity of the two sites. Thus, regulation of NAGNAGs is more difficult to envisage. Furthermore, analyses of select genes using PCR and capillary electrophoresis approaches reached differing conclusions about NAGNAG tissue specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Hiller1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tadokoro1">[20]</xref>, and several authors have argued that NAGNAG splicing is purely stochastic, is not evolutionarily conserved, and is not physiologically relevant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Chern1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Dou1">[22]</xref>. However, analyses of NAGNAG splicing at a genome-wide scale have been hampered by the impracticality of distinguishing such similar isoforms by microarray hybridization and the insufficient depth of EST databases for assessment of tissue specificity.</p>

      <p>In order to assess the abundance and potential regulation of NAGNAG splicing events genome-wide, we analyzed polyA-selected RNA-Seq data generated using the Illumina HiSeq platform from 16 human tissues at depths of ∼8 Gbp per tissue, similarly deep RNA-Seq data that we generated from eight mouse tissues, and data generated by the modENCODE consortium across a developmental time course in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. NAGNAG isoforms can be uniquely distinguished by short reads that overlap the splice junction, and the quantity of data available from each tissue in human and mouse typically represented at least 80-fold mean coverage of the transcriptome, a depth sufficient to detect potential tissue-specific differences in many cases. Sequence features were identified which can shift splicing toward the proximal or distal NAG, providing clues to regulation. We also analyzed the impact of NAGNAGs on exon evolution, obtaining evidence that NAGNAGs dramatically accelerate addition and deletion of sequence at the beginnings of exons.</p>

        <title>Many Human NAGNAGs Are Regulated Across Tissues</title>
        <p>Our initial analyses used the Illumina Body Map 2.0 dataset of polyA-selected RNA-Seq data from 16 human tissues (adipose, adrenal, brain, breast, colon, heart, kidney, liver, lung, lymph node, ovary, prostate, skeletal muscle, testes, thyroid, and white blood cells) sequenced at depths of ∼80 million paired-end 2×50 bp reads per tissue. This sequencing depth generates ∼8 Gbp of data, representing &gt;80-fold coverage of the human protein-coding transcriptome. Enumerating all possible NAGNAG splicing events, we mapped both ends of each read against NAGNAG splice junctions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Isoform ratios were estimated across all tissues as “percent spliced in” (PSI or ψ) values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), representing the fraction of mRNAs that use the intron-proximal splice site, thereby including the second NAG in the mRNA. The reliability of such RNA-Seq-based estimates of isoform abundance has been established previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Katz1">[23]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Using a conservative approach that has comparable power to detect each of the major types of alternative splicing events, we estimated that NAGNAGs comprise slightly more than 20% of reading frame-preserving alternative splicing events in coding regions, making NAGNAGs the most common form of protein-producing alternative splicing after exon skipping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In all, more than 2,000 NAGNAG events were detected in protein-coding regions of human genes where both isoforms were expressed at ≥5% in at least one tissue. Strikingly, 73% of these NAGNAGs showed evidence of tissue-specific regulation (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 by multinomial test). Furthermore, approximately 42% were “strongly regulated,” with changes in ψ of at least 25% between tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s012">Table S1</xref>). For example, a NAGNAG in the gene encoding FUBP1, a transcriptional regulator of MYC, undergoes dramatically different splicing between kidney and lymph node (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Here, we report absolute rather than relative differences in splicing levels, e.g., a change from 10% to 35% between tissues is considered an increase of 25%, not 250%, and the largest difference in ψ between tissues is defined as the “switch score” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Wang1">[1]</xref>. Other genes containing NAGNAGs with switch scores of 50% or more included HOXD8, CAMK2B, ATRX, CAPRIN2, and MLLT4 (a complete list of human genes containing alternative NAGNAGs, sorted by switch score, is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s013">Table S2</xref>). Technical replicates—sequencing of the same RNA-Seq libraries with 75 bp single-end reads at depths of ∼50 million reads per tissue—yielded similar estimates of NAGNAG abundance and regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s014">Table S3</xref>).</p>

        <title>Regulated NAGNAGs Are Selectively Conserved between Primates and Rodents</title>
        <p>Regulation that contributes to fitness is expected to be evolutionarily conserved. A previous study reported the existence of selection against alternatively spliced NAGNAGs in coding sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Hiller2">[24]</xref>. Nevertheless, some NAGNAGs are quite deeply conserved, e.g., a NAGNAG that generates an arginine insertion/deletion in a RNA-binding domain of the splicing factor PTBP2 (also known as nPTB or brPTB). Both isoforms of this NAGNAG event are observed in ESTs from human, mouse, and chicken, and the potential for alternative splicing is conserved at the sequence level to lizard (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Consistent with this example, a previous analysis of EST databases suggested that a subset of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs are under purifying selection in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Hiller3">[25]</xref>. We systematically assessed the global conservation of NAGNAG isoform levels using RNA-Seq data generated from eight mouse tissues (brain, colon, kidney, liver, lung, skeletal muscle, spleen, and testes). Restricting to the set of NAGNAGs which were alternatively spliced in human (both isoforms expressed at ≥5% in at least one tissue), we found that NAGNAGs which were strongly regulated were approximately 10 times more likely than unregulated NAGNAGs to exhibit alternative splicing in their mouse orthologs, and vice versa (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). This large and consistent increase in conservation of alternative splicing with increasing switch score suggests that regulated NAGNAGs are much more likely to contribute to organismal fitness, and therefore to be selectively maintained, than are alternatively spliced events which do not exhibit tissue specificity. If NAGNAG alternative splicing were selectively neutral, then we would not expect to see a correlation between the observed degree of tissue specificity in one species and conservation of alternative splicing in the other species.</p>
        <p>NAGNAG isoform levels were very well correlated between biological replicates, consisting of individual mice of strains C57BL/6J and DBA/2J, whose genomes differ to an extent similar to that of unrelated humans (<italic>r</italic> = 0.96, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), demonstrating the robustness and reproducibility of these RNA-Seq-based estimates of NAGNAG ψ values. Similar numbers of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs were detected in mouse as in human, with 28% of alternatively spliced NAGNAGs in mouse exhibiting evidence of tissue-specific regulation and 8% being strongly regulated across the eight tissues studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s015">Table S4</xref>). Many orthologous NAGNAGs in human and mouse exhibited tissue-specific regulation in both species, e.g., NAGNAGs in FUBP1, CAMK2B, CAPRIN2, and ATRX (a complete list of alternative NAGNAGs in mouse is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s016">Table S5</xref>). The higher fraction of regulated NAGNAGs detected in the human data probably results from a combination of factors, including the greater number of tissues sampled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s001">Figure S1</xref>), the diverse genetic backgrounds of the human samples, and intrinsically higher read coverage variability in the human RNA-Seq data used. Comparing technical replicates of human tissues, which capture variability in sequencing, we estimated false discovery rates (FDRs) for discovering strongly regulated NAGNAGs ranging from ∼0.8% to ∼13.3%, with a mean FDR of 4.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast, comparing biological replicates of mouse tissues, which capture all major sources of variability (tissue collection, library preparation, sequencing, and individual-specific splicing differences), we estimated FDRs ranging from 0.6% to 1.9%, with a mean of 1.1% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Using these estimated FDRs, and extrapolating the mouse data to 16 tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s001">Figure S1</xref>), we estimated that between 12% and 37% of NAGNAGs are strongly regulated across tissues in mammals, making strong regulation a fairly common occurrence—though somewhat less common than for other types of splicing events. The relatively small differences between samples of the same tissue from mice whose genomes differed to an extent comparable to that of unrelated humans (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) suggested that inter-individual variation contributed less than other sources of variation (e.g., tissue-specific differences) to the variations observed between the human libraries.</p>

        <p>Orthologous human and mouse NAGNAGs exhibited high quantitative conservation of isoform levels. This was particularly true when the difference between the proximal and distal 3′ splice site scores—using a method that scores the strength of the polypyrimidine tract and AG region—was conserved (Spearman's ρ = 0.67, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The correlation decreased somewhat in cases where the differences in 3′ splice site scores were less conserved (ρ = 0.54, <italic>p</italic> = 0.013 for test of equality of correlation using the Fisher transformation; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting that changes in relative 3′ splice site strength may contribute to species-specific differences in NAGNAG splicing. Notably, many NAGNAGs with diverged splice site scores were alternatively spliced in one species but constitutively spliced in the other, suggesting relatively rapid evolution of 3′ splice site positions.</p>

        <title>Regulated NAGNAGs Have Conserved Upstream Intronic Sequence</title>
        <p>To better understand how NAGNAG splicing is regulated, and which sequence regions might be involved, we examined sequence conservation of flanking intronic and exonic regions for NAGNAGs grouped by switch score using alignments of the genomes of placental mammals. Tissue-specific NAGNAGs exhibited markedly increased sequence conservation in the upstream intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>), with little or no increase in other analyzed regions.

The consistent location of the sequence conservation signal for regulated NAGNAGs in mammalian and insect genomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g002">Figure 2C–E</xref>) suggested that the region ∼50 bp upstream of the NAGNAG motif, encompassing the competing 3′ splice sites themselves, may contain most of the regulatory information that governs NAGNAG alternative splicing.

            <p>(A) A simple biophysical model of NAGNAG splicing accurately models mean isoform usage across tissues as a function of difference in 3′ splice site score. Each point represents a single human NAGNAG, and the solid and dashed black lines show the mean ψ (across values for individual NAGNAGs with similar splice site score difference, with sliding window of 3.25 bits) and the standard deviation about the mean. The solid red line shows the prediction based on the model for parameters Q = 0.55 and B = 0.58, and the dashed red line indicates the standard deviation about the model mean expected from measurement error. The horizontal and vertical dashed lines indicate the splice site score difference (approximately 1 bit) at ψ = 50%. (B) The −3 bases largely determine whether a NAGNAG is alternatively spliced. We grouped NAGNAGs in the human genome according to their −3 bases and computed the fraction of each group which expressed the proximal (black) or distal (blue) isoform at ≥5% in at least one tissue. (C) Constitutive 3′ splice sites (top, YAG), YAGYAGs which express the proximal isoform at ≥75% in all tissues (middle, YAGYAG proximal major), YAGYAGs which express the distal isoform at ≥75% in all tissues (middle, YAGYAG distal major), and strongly regulated YAGYAGs (bottom, YAGYAG strongly regulated) all exhibit distinct upstream sequence preferences. The <italic>x</italic>-axis shows the position relative to the 3′ splice site (YAG) or proximal 3′ splice site (YAGYAG), and arrows indicate the 3′ splice site that is predominantly used. Figure was created with WebLogo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Crooks1">[53]</xref>. Human and mouse YAGYAGs were grouped together to increase the statistical signal for (C–F). (D) Distal major YAGYAGs have shorter polypyrimidine tracts (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 relative to proximal major class, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Plot shows median length of the polypyrimidine tract, estimated as the first stretch of ≥5 consecutive pyrimidines upstream of the −3 position.

(E) Distal major YAGYAGs have higher CT and TC dinucleotide content (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 relative to proximal major class, Kolmogorov-Smirnov test). Median CT and TC dinucleotide content of the polypyrimidine tract, computed as the fraction of the polypyrimidine tract composed of CT dinucleotides, with an optional T at the beginning or C at the end.

        <title>Specific Sequence Features Associated with Basal and Regulated NAGNAG Splicing</title>
        <p>The variability in NAGNAG splicing observed above implies that features outside of splice site strength and the −3 base must also be involved in determining isoform usage. For example, the NAGNAG in the splicing factor PTBP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) represents an exception to the pattern observed above: the −3 bases (<underline>C</underline>AG<underline>A</underline>AG) predict predominant proximal splice site usage, since C is strongly favored over A and is also proximal, but roughly equal proportions of both isoforms are expressed across all tissues studied (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This observation led us to wonder whether other aspects of this 3′ splice site, e.g., the relatively short and distally located polypyrimidine tract and the relatively distal location of the putative branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figure 1D</xref>) might favor use of the distal NAG in this and other cases.</p>
        <p>While many analyses support the importance of the −3 base combination in NAGNAG alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Daines1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Akerman1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Sinha1">[27]</xref>, there is less consensus in the literature about the relevance of other major elements of the 3′ splice site, including the polypyrimidine tract and branch site. Molecular genetics experiments demonstrated that mutating sequences near the polypyrimidine tract and branch site influenced alternative splicing of specific NAGNAGs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai3">[31]</xref>, but two computational studies that used machine-learning approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Sinha1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Akerman2">[32]</xref> concluded that neither of these elements significantly influenced NAGNAG splicing globally. Notably, the experimental studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai3">[31]</xref> measured quantitative isoform ratios, as we do in this study, while the machine-learning studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Sinha1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Akerman2">[32]</xref> simply classified NAGNAGs as constitutively or alternatively spliced.</p>
        <p>In order to dissect features that impact NAGNAG isoform choice, controlling for the effect of the −3 bases, we considered the large class of NAGNAGs with favored (C or T) nucleotides at both −3 bases (YAGYAGs). We found that exons that predominantly used the proximal splice site (“proximal major” YAGYAGs) had substantially distinct nucleotide preferences from those that predominantly used the distal site (“distal major” YAGYAGs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), consistent with the experimental results of Tsai et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai2">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai3">[31]</xref>, who found that modifying the sequence upstream of the 3′ splice site influenced NAGNAG splicing. For example, distal major YAGYAGs tended to have shorter, more distal, polypyrimidine tracts than proximal major YAGYAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), implicating polypyrimidine tract length and location in control of NAGNAG splicing. The proportion of CT/TC dinucleotides in the polypyrimidine tract was ∼25% higher for distal major YAGYAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), suggesting the possible involvement of CU/UC-binding factors such as those of the PTB family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Oberstrass1">[33]</xref>—some of which are tissue-specifically expressed—in promoting use of distal NAGs. The location of the first upstream AG was also shifted several bases downstream in distal major YAGYAGs compared to other 3′ splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), suggesting that the branch site is located further downstream in this class and that use of a distally located branch site favors use of the distal YAG, perhaps because the distance to the 3′ splice site is more optimal.</p>
        <p>Strongly regulated YAGYAGs had features that were intermediate between the extremes found for proximal major and distal major YAGYAGs, such as polypyrimidine tracts of intermediate length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), suggesting that the presence of intermediate features facilitates regulation. Increased regulation was also associated with reduced 3′ splice site strength and greater similarity in strength between the competing sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s007">Figure S7</xref>), consistent with previous studies of other types of alternative splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Baek1">[34]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The −4 base, four nucleotides upstream of the 3′ splice site, is not generally considered to be important in splicing (with rare exceptions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Corrionero1">[35]</xref>). This position contains little or no information in alignments of constitutive 3′ splice sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Yeo1">[36]</xref>, although a previous machine-learning analysis of features distinguishing between constitutively and alternatively spliced NAGNAGs included the −4 base in their classifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Sinha1">[27]</xref>. Our quantitative analysis strongly supported a special role in NAGNAG regulation for this canonically unimportant position. For distal major YAGYAGs, the −4 position (here referring to the position four nucleotides upstream of the intron-proximal splice site) had the highest information content of any position upstream of the YAGYAG (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>); furthermore, the −4 base was more conserved in distal major and strongly regulated YAGYAGs than for other classes of 3′ splice sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>Of the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3</xref>, the two that seemed most compelling were the preference for pyrimidines at the −4 position and the more distal positioning of branch points in YAGYAGs that favored the distal splice site. To test the predicted role of the −4 base in regulation of NAGNAG splicing, we used a minigene reporter based on the NAGNAG in PTBP2, whose splicing alters an exon coding for the RRM4 RNA binding domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g001">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g004">4A</xref>). As predicted based on the data in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, mutation of the −4 base (T in the wildtype) to A or G resulted in a substantial shift in splicing toward use of the proximal NAG, while mutation to C had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). These observations confirm that presence of a pyrimidine at the −4 position favors use of the distal NAG, even though no sequence preference was observed at this position in constitutive splice sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Presence of a pyrimidine at the −4 position of a NAGNAG might function to shift the location of binding of U2AF65 downstream by a base or more from its normal position, which might then result in preferential binding of U2AF35 to the downstream NAG, though this will require further study.</p>

            <p>(A) Illustration of NAGNAG minigene constructs, designed to test the roles of the branch point to 3′ splice site distance and of the −4 base in NAGNAG splicing. A short segment of intronic sequence spanning the branch point to the 3′ splice site of the PTBP2 NAGNAG was cloned upstream of the IGF2BP1 exon. To confirm the importance of a pyrimidine at the −4 position for distal NAG use, the effects of all four nucleotides at the −4 position were tested. The branch point to 3′ splice site distance was varied by introducing nucleotides (underlined in orange) in constructs containing the PTBP2 branch point sequence, or by removing nucleotides (indicated by green dots) in constructs containing the IGF2BP1 branch point sequence. Locations of RT-PCR primers are indicated by arrows. (B) Proximal isoform expression increased dramatically after the introduction of a purine at the −4 position. Splicing was monitored after minigene transfection into HEK293T cells by RT-PCR. Mean and standard deviation of at least three independent transfections are shown. A representative gel is shown below (top and bottom bands represent proximal and distal isoforms, respectively). (C) As in (B), but varying the branch point to 3′ splice site distance in the context of the native nPTB branch point sequence.

        <p>We also tested the role of the branch point in NAGNAG splicing by manipulating the branch site to 3′ splice site distance in this reporter, either in a context in which the inferred native branch point sequence (BPS) was intact or in a context in which the native BPS had been replaced by the previously mapped BPS of IGF2BP1 intron 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). With the native BPS present, an increase of just four bases in the BPS-3′ splice site distance was sufficient to cause a substantial shift in splicing towards the proximal NAG, with little or no additional shift resulting from addition of three more bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In the context of the exogenous IGF2BP1 BPS, a somewhat higher basal level of proximal splice site usage was reduced by deletion of six bases, with deletion of three bases producing a modest change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). These data indicate that the BPS plays a significant role in NAGNAG splicing and confirm that shorter BPS-3′ splice site distances can shift splicing toward the distal NAG.</p>

        <title>NAGNAGs Accelerate Protein Evolution at Exon-Exon Boundaries</title>
        <p>Together, our analyses of proximal/distal major splicing suggested that NAGNAG 3′ splice sites afford broad scope for evolutionary tuning of isoform ratios, even in cases where the sequence of the second NAG is constrained by selection on the encoded amino acid. For example, mutations affecting the upstream −3 and −4 bases, the polypyrimidine tract, or the location of the branch site could all potentially modulate the ratio of the two isoforms across a range from predominantly proximal to predominantly distal isoform usage, which might facilitate evolutionary addition and deletion of single codons at 3′ splice junctions. A previous study observed reduced frequencies of amino acid substitutions near exon-exon junctions relative to the centers of exons, presumably resulting from purifying selection acting on exonic splicing enhancer motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Fairbrother2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Parmley1">[11]</xref>. By contrast, when we examined exon length changes in alignments of orthologous human and mouse coding exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), we observed a striking 18.5-fold enrichment for gain/loss of exonic sequence at 3′ splice sites relative to flanking positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5B</xref>; assignment of gaps is illustrated in example alignments in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s009">Figure S9</xref>). No particular enrichment for gain/loss of exonic sequence was observed at the 5′ splice site, suggesting that increased addition/deletion of exonic sequence is associated with properties of the 3′ splice site itself, rather than being a generic feature of exon boundaries. This pattern was not changed when restricting to constitutive splice junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s010">Figure S10</xref>). A majority of the changes plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5B</xref> involved gain/loss of precisely three bases, and restricting to changes of exactly this size yielded a similar degree of enrichment at the 3′ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A) Alignment of portions of exons 10 and 11 of TRIM28 gene from three mammals, illustrating a shift in the upstream boundary of exon 11 between human and rodents. Exonic sequence shown in capitals; intronic sequence in lower case. (B) Gain/loss of exonic sequence between human and mouse occurs preferentially at 3′ splice sites (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, permutation test). The fraction of aligned orthologous human and mouse exons with gaps at each position is shown; the background level (mean fraction across the indicated region excluding the 3′ splice site) is shown by the dotted yellow line; the right-hand axis shows enrichment relative to this background. (C) As in (B), but restricted to gaps of length three bases. Preferential occurrence at 3′ splice sites was highly significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, permutation test). (D) Similar to (C), but based on alignments of orthologous <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> exons. Preferential occurrence at 3′ splice sites was highly significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, permutation test).

Preferential occurrence at 3′ splice sites was highly significant (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−6</sup>, permutation test). (F) Residual NAG motif at exons whose boundaries changed in the rodent lineage. Orthologous mouse and rat exons were classified as unchanged (top), expanded by three bases (middle), or contracted by three bases(bottom) based on comparison to an outgroup (human, cow, chicken, or <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>), aligned to the inferred location of the ancestral 3′ splice site (dotted line). Information content of each position is shown relative to a uniform background composition. (G) Exons whose 3′ splice site boundaries differ by three bases between rat and mouse are 7.5 times as likely to have a NAGNAG in the human ortholog as exons whose boundaries did not change (<italic>p</italic>-value for difference&lt;10<sup>−24</sup> by Fisher's exact test). Error bars indicate the 95% binomial confidence interval. (H) Rodent exons orthologous to alternatively spliced human NAGNAG exons (left) are much more likely to exhibit exon boundary changes of three base pairs than those orthologous to constitutively spliced human NAGNAGs (right) (<italic>p</italic>-value for difference&lt;10<sup>−10</sup> by Fisher's exact test). Blue and gray bars in (H) represent subsets of blue and gray bars in (G), respectively. Error bars indicate the 95% binomial confidence interval. (I) Frequency of encoded amino acids that occur opposite gaps at the 3′ splice site in alignments of human and mouse exons is plotted above, overall (pink) and separately by the phase of the upstream intron (i.e., the number of bases, if any, in the last incomplete codon of the upstream exon); amino acid frequency at background positions (4 codons downstream of the 3′ splice site) is shown below.

        </fig>
        <p>While gain/loss of exonic sequence is normally attributed to insertions or deletions (“indels”) in the genome, the increased frequency of changes at the 3′ splice site suggested a prominent role for an alternative mechanism involving genomic substitutions that give rise to three base shifts in exon boundaries without insertion or deletion of genomic DNA. For example, creation of a NAG motif immediately upstream of a 3′ splice site NAG by mutation would be expected to commonly shift splicing upstream by three bases (resulting in exonization of three bases of intron) or generate an alternatively spliced NAGNAG that could subsequently lose splicing at the downstream NAG through mutation. Alternatively, a mutation creating an immediately downstream NAG—or a mutation that weakened the upstream NAG relative to a pre-existing downstream NAG—could result in either alternative splicing or loss of three bases of exonic sequence. As outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s017">Table S6</xref>, both of these scenarios could arise frequently by single base substitutions, which occur at a rate that is an order of magnitude higher than the rate of genomic indels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Silva1">[37]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Consistent with this substitution/exaptation model and the finding that many NAGNAGs are alternatively spliced in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> lineage, we observed similar enrichment for gain/loss of three bases of exonic sequence at the 3′ splice site when comparing orthologous <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>D. yakuba</italic> coding exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Notably, the enrichment of three base gaps at the 3′ splice site was 3-fold weaker in comparisons of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> and <italic>C. briggsae</italic> exons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). NAGNAG alternative splicing is reported to occur rarely in nematodes due to a highly constrained 3′ splice site motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Hiller1">[15]</xref>. We confirmed the rarity of NAGNAG alternative splicing in <italic>C. elegans</italic> using RNA-Seq data from 14 developmental time points and conditions generated by the modENCODE consortium. Enumerating NAGNAGs in introns of <italic>C. elegans</italic> coding genes, we detected alternative splicing (both isoforms expressed at ≥5% in at least one developmental time point) for only 18% of NAGNAGs with favorable pyrimidine bases at both −3 positions based on RNA-Seq read depths slightly below those used in human. By contrast, 50%–85% of human, mouse, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> YAGYAGs were detected as alternatively spliced, suggesting that NAGNAG alternative splicing is substantially rarer in worms than in other metazoans. This decrease in abundance mirrors the 3-fold weaker enrichment of three base gaps at 3′ splice sites observed in worms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Sequence motif analyses further implicated NAGNAG splicing in the exon length changes observed at exon boundaries. Classifying the borders of orthologous mouse and rat exons as unchanged, expanded, or contracted (comparing to human, cow, chicken, and/or <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic> as outgroups), we observed evidence of residual NAGNAG motifs in exons with altered boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Specifically, exons expanded in mouse or rat exhibited a consensus NAG at exonic positions +1 to +3, and contracted exons exhibited a consensus NAG at intronic positions −6 to −4. The presence of this residual sequence motif provides further evidence that a substantial portion of exon length changes observed between orthologous mammalian exons derive from splicing-mediated shifts in exon boundaries rather than genomic indels. Likely because of subsequent selection to optimize the polypyrimidine tract, the residual NAG signal was weaker for contracted than for expanded exons.</p>
        <p>Consistent with these findings, we observed a strong association between gain/loss of three bases in the rodent lineage and presence of a NAGNAG in orthologous human exons. Exons that expanded or contracted in rodents were 7.5-fold more likely to have a NAGNAG in the orthologous human exon than were exons with unchanged boundaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Further subdividing these exons according to the splicing pattern of the NAGNAG in human, we observed that rodent exons orthologous to alternatively spliced human NAGNAGs were ∼9 times more likely to have gained/lost exonic sequence than those orthologous to constitutively spliced human NAGNAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5H</xref>). These analyses implicate NAGNAG alternative splicing as a very common evolutionary intermediate in the gain and loss of single codons from exons.</p>
        <p>This model, where frequent alternative splicing at the 3′ splice site leads to gain/loss of exonic sequence, is expected to play out very differently at 5′ splice sites. Competing 5′ splice sites are most frequently four bases apart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Dou1">[22]</xref>, resulting in a frame-shift which is likely to render one of the protein products non-functional and potentially target the mRNA for nonsense-mediated decay. Although common, competing 5′ splice sites separated by four bases are therefore unlikely to lead to accelerated exon length changes and we observed no significant increase in exon length changes at the 5′ splice site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>

        <title>NAGNAG-Accelerated Protein Evolution Is Highly Biased</title>
        <p>Most three base changes to mRNAs probably minimally affect RNA-level properties such as message stability. However, insertion/deletion of a single amino acid residue can have a profound impact on protein function. For example, deletion of a single codon can alter protein degradation, subcellular localization, DNA binding affinity, or other protein properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Vogan1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Tsai4">[39]</xref>; can cause diseases including cystic fibrosis and Tay-Sachs disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Consortium1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Navon1">[41]</xref>; and can even rescue a disease-related phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Hinzpeter1">[42]</xref>. Insertion or deletion of a codon in a protein structural motif with a periodic hydrogen bonded structure such as a beta sheet or coiled coil domain might have a disproportionate effect on protein structure by altering the hydrogen bonding of a large number of downstream residues. The codon-level effects of NAGNAG splicing are largely determined by intron “phase” (position relative to the reading frame) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Hiller1">[15]</xref>. Considering the spectrum of codons that occurred opposite three base gaps at the beginnings of exons (corresponding to the peak in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), we observed a highly non-random distribution that strongly favored glutamine, alanine, glutamate, and serine and disfavored most other residues including cysteine, phenylalanine, and histidine relative to the background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s018">Table S7</xref>). Distinct and far stronger biases were observed when grouping introns by phase. These biases occurred in a pattern consistent with frequent origin via exaptation of NAGNAGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). For example, glutamine (mostly coded by CAG) was the most commonly added residue at the end of “phase 0” introns, for which the first three bases of the downstream exon form a codon. Serine (mostly AGY) and arginine (mostly AGR) were the most commonly added residues at the boundaries of phase 2 introns, for which the AG of an added NAG would form the first two bases of a codon. These biases contributed to a strong enrichment observed for gain/loss of predicted phosphorylation sites at 3′ splice sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Together, the analyses in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5</xref> demonstrate that gain and loss of residues along proteins occurs in a strongly biased manner, with a highly accelerated rate and biased codon spectrum at the beginnings of exons that is likely driven by genomic substitutions that alter NAGNAG motifs or their splicing patterns. These observations suggest that the evolutionary trajectories of proteins in metazoans are shaped to a surprising extent by the specific locations and phases of introns that interrupt their coding sequences.</p>

        <title>RNA-Seq Read Analysis</title>
        <p>For each NAGNAG, we extracted the sequence flanking the proximal and distal 3′ splice sites and used Bowtie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Langmead1">[46]</xref> version 0.12.7 to map reads to these two sequences. We required that short reads have at least 6 nt on either side of the splice junction (an “overhang” of 6 nt), and furthermore that there be no mismatches within the overhang region. In order to eliminate errors in read mapping due to non-unique splice junctions, we restricted the set of NAGNAGs enumerated across the genome to the subset of NAGNAGs for which all 36-mers mapping to either splice site did not map to the genome or any other splice junction (we used 36-mers because they were the shortest reads analyzed in our experiments). We then computed ψ values as (number of reads mapping to the proximal splice junction)/(number of reads mapping to either the proximal or distal splice junction). For all bioinformatics analyses, we only analyzed the subset of tissues for which a particular NAGNAG had a total of at least 10 reads in order to control for variation in junction coverage due to gene expression differences. We experimented with requiring different levels of junction coverage (10–100 reads per NAGNAG) and confirmed that our conclusions were insensitive to the chosen cutoff. We identified alternatively spliced events as those for which both isoforms were expressed at ≥5% in at least one sample (restricting to tissues for which a particular NAGNAG had ≥10 reads), and identified regulated events as those with <italic>p</italic>≤0.01 by the proportion or <italic>z</italic>-test (prop.test in R [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.R-project.org/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.R-project.org/</ext-link>]).

Using only reads mapping to the two 3′ (skipped exons, NAGNAGs, alternative 3′ splice sites, and mutually exclusive exons) or 5′ (alternative 5′ splice sites) splice sites of each event, we computed ψ values and identified alternative spliced and regulated events as described above.</p>

We expect this trend to continue as the number of mouse tissues increases, as it does for the human data. Accordingly extrapolating the mouse data to 16 tissues with a linear fit and subtracting the mean FDR of 1.1%, we estimated that at least 12% of alternatively spliced mouse NAGNAGs are strongly regulated, providing a lower bound on the fraction of strongly regulated NAGNAGs in mammals. We used the human data to compute a corresponding upper bound of 37% by subtracting the mean FDR of 4.4% from the observed fraction of strongly regulated NAGNAGs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

        <title>Evolutionary Analysis</title>
        <p>We restricted all analyses to “singleton orthologs,” genes without paralogs and with unambiguous orthology assignments in all species considered for each analysis, annotated in Ensembl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Flicek1">[43]</xref> and queried with PyCogent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Knight1">[52]</xref>. For each gene, we required that the longest annotated coding sequence have the same number of exons in all species, and performed all subsequent analyses using this longest coding sequence. For each longest coding sequence, we extracted pairs of consecutive exons, concatenated them, and then aligned them to their corresponding orthologous sequences using FSA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Bradley1">[48]</xref>. In order to control for alignment error, we required that alignment sequence identity be greater than 70% and that the total inserted sequence be no longer than 20% of the length of the shortest exon. Furthermore, if gaps in an alignment could be moved to lie at exon-exon boundaries rather than within exonic sequence while preserving the alignment quality (number of exact matches), then we modified the alignment accordingly, as FSA is unaware of exon structures. This modification affected only a small fraction of alignments, and our results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5</xref> are unchanged without this modification.</p>
        <p>We classified orthologous mouse and rat exons as unchanged, expanded, or contracted based on comparison with an outgroup (human, cow, chicken, <italic>Xenopus laevis</italic>, or <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, in that order, until an informative comparison was found). For each exon in each class, we extracted the corresponding intronic sequence and created a sequence logo using WebLogo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5F–H</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Crooks1">[53]</xref>.</p>
        <p>For analyses of amino acid sequences in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5I</xref>, we compared the amino acids gained or lost in alignments with gaps of three bases at the 3′ splice site. If the next gain/loss was a single amino acid (for example, if the human peptide was SR and the mouse peptide was R), then we counted only the single amino acid which was inserted (S); if the gain/loss was two amino acids (for example, if the human peptide was SR and the mouse peptide was K), then we counted both amino acids which were inserted (SR).</p>
        <p>For <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001229.s011">Figure S11</xref>, we used a BioPerl module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Stajich1">[54]</xref> to query Scansite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001229-Obenauer1">[55]</xref> to predict phosphorylation sites (medium stringency) in the translated longest annotated coding sequence, and plotted the location of predicted phosphorylation sites which were gained/lost in human and mouse.</p>
        <p>Unless otherwise described, all plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001229-g005">Figure 5</xref> were created with matplotlib (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/" xlink:type="simple">http://matplotlib.sourceforge.net/</ext-link>).</p>

          <p>Splice site score difference and maximum splice site score as a function of switch score for different classes of alternative 3′ splice sites. (A) The splice site scores of regulated NAGNAG 3′ splice sites tended to be far more similar to one another than those of unregulated events, suggesting that regulation is easier to achieve when the intrinsic strengths of the sites are evenly matched. (B–C) This trend was much weaker for more distant alternative 3′ splice site events. (D) The 3′ splice site scores of tissue-regulated NAGNAGs also tended to be somewhat weaker than for unregulated NAGNAGs or constitutive 3′ splice sites. This observation suggested that weaker splice sites are more easily regulated, consistent with previous studies of other types of alternative splicing. (E–F) This trend for regulated events to be associated with weaker splice site scores was observed to a much lesser extent for alternative 3′ splice sites separated by longer distances, suggesting that splicing regulatory elements may more readily exert differential effects on more widely spaced 3′ splice sites, making matching of splice site scores less critical for achieving regulation for this class than it is for NAGNAGs. For example, we have previously shown that most exonic splicing silencer (ESS) elements inhibit the intron-proximal site when situated between competing 3′ splice sites, an arrangement that requires separation of the competing sites by sufficient space to accommodate the ESS, and so does not apply to NAGNAGs. “v. low” indicates “very low,” and “CJ” indicates the 3′ splice sites of constitutive junctions.</p>

Isoform ratios are based on the numbers of reads aligning to the 3′ splice sites of each isoform, thereby treating each event as a choice between competing 3′ splice sites (with the exception of alternative 5′ splice site events, where the reads aligning to 5′ splice sites were used). This method ensures that the different classes of splicing events are analyzed “fairly,” irrespective of the length of the alternatively spliced sequence. “Fraction strongly regulated” gives raw estimates (not corrected for using FDRs based on technical replicates).</p>
