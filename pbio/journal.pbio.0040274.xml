      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Sensory systems are shaped by evolution to detect the salient features of an animal's natural environment. At the simplest level, a sensory system is tuned to the most informative cues: specific ultrasonic wavelengths in the bat's echolocation system, or statistically likely features of natural scenes in the vertebrate visual system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b002">2</xref>]. At more complex levels of processing, the nervous system sets behavioral priorities based on context. Even simple animals generate distinct behaviors to the same sensory cue depending on the other cues that are present at the same time. Food, hunger, danger, and sleep elicit modulatory contexts that change the behavioral output to the same sensory input [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b003">3</xref>]. Understanding behavior requires an understanding of the strategies that integrate context into sensory responses during ecologically relevant behaviors.</p>
      <p>Oxygen is unevenly distributed in soil and water environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b006">6</xref>], and is an important sensory cue for many organisms. Animals monitor both internal and environmental oxygen levels to maintain oxygen homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b007">7</xref>]. Either hypoxia or hyperoxia is disruptive: molecular oxygen is essential for many biological processes, but excess oxygen promotes the production of toxic reactive oxygen species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b008">8</xref>]. The best-understood mechanism of oxygen homeostasis is the HIF-1 (hypoxia-inducible transcription factor) system, which is conserved in all metazoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b009">9</xref>]. This relatively slow transcriptional pathway for oxygen homeostasis is supplemented by rapid neuronal mechanisms for oxygen sensation. In mammals, the carotid body senses reduced blood oxygenation to mediate a hyperventilatory response and strong arousal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b010">10</xref>]. In the nematode <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans,</italic> certain chemosensory neurons detect environmental oxygen to generate aerotaxis behaviors in oxygen gradients [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. These neurons, called URX, AQR, and PQR, express five genes that encode soluble guanylate cyclase homologs (sGCs) with similarity to the NO-regulated sGCs from other animals. The sGC homolog GCY-35 is required for normal aerotaxis and contains a heme domain that binds molecular oxygen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>], suggesting that oxygen regulates GCY-35 and cyclic guanosine monophosphate (cGMP) production during aerotaxis. A second sGC homolog encoded by the <italic>gcy-36</italic> gene is also needed for aerotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b012">12</xref>]. cGMP is thought to open a cGMP-gated sensory transduction channel encoded by the <italic>tax-4</italic> and <italic>tax-2</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. Through the activity of the sGC homologs and the cGMP-gated channel, animals accumulate at a preferred oxygen concentration of about 10% oxygen.</p>
      <p>The behavioral response of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> to oxygen is regulated by natural polymorphisms in a neuropeptide receptor gene, <italic>npr-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b012">12</xref>]. <italic>npr-1</italic> encodes a G protein–coupled receptor related to mammalian neuropeptide Y receptors, and exists in two allelic forms that differ at a single animal acid, NPR-1(215V) and NPR-1(215F) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b013">13</xref>]. Both alleles are widely distributed in wild-caught <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> populations. Genetic analysis and biochemical characterization of ligand responses indicate that the 215V allele has high activity and the 215F allele has low activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b015">15</xref>]. <italic>npr-1(215F)</italic> and <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> animals have strong aerotaxis responses in oxygen gradients both in the presence of food and in its absence. <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> animals, including the standard lab strain N2, have strong aerotaxis responses in the absence of food, but fail to avoid high oxygen when food is present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> and <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> also differ in their locomotory responses to oxygen; reducing oxygen results in slowing of <italic>npr-1(lf),</italic> but not <italic>npr-1(215V),</italic> animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b012">12</xref>]. Slowing requires <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>gcy-36,</italic> and is suppressed by expression of <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> in URX, AQR, and PQR [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b012">12</xref>]. These results suggest that <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> activity suppresses sGC-dependent oxygen responses in the presence of food.</p>
      <p>The URX, AQR, and PQR oxygen-sensing neurons have an important role in a second behavior, the naturally polymorphic social feeding behavior of <italic>C. elegans.</italic> Animals with <italic>npr-1(215F)</italic> or <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> alleles aggregate into feeding groups on bacterial lawns, a behavior that requires <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>gcy-36</italic> in URX, AQR, and PQR neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b016">16</xref>]. Because aggregation is stimulated at high oxygen levels and accumulation into aggregates decreases local oxygen levels, it is likely that hyperoxia avoidance by URX, AQR, and PQR is a key component of aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b017">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>An unanswered question is the mechanism by which <italic>npr-1</italic> activity is integrated into the circuit that responds to food and oxygen. <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> action in URX, AQR, and PQR neurons suppresses aggregation on food [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b014">14</xref>]. The simplest interpretation of this result would be that <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> is an internal “food sensor”—a molecule that inhibits URX, AQR, and PQR activity when food is present. However, many other genes and cells can affect aggregation behavior. For example, aggregation in <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> animals requires the function of transient receptor potential channel, vanilloid (TRPV) genes <italic>osm-9</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic> and the receptor chaperone gene <italic>odr-4</italic> in ASH and ADL nociceptive neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b018">18</xref>]. Aggregation is also inhibited by the TGF-β gene <italic>daf-7,</italic> which is expressed mainly in a different class of sensory neurons called ASI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b018">18</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b021">21</xref>]. Given the close relationship between genes and neurons involved in aggregation and hyperoxia avoidance, these other pathways are also candidate regulators of oxygen responses. Indeed, a recent study of oxygen responses in the <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> background showed that <italic>ocr-2</italic> and the ASH nociceptive neurons regulate aerotaxis and oxygen-dependent locomotory responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b017">17</xref>].</p>
      <p>Other than <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>tax-4,</italic> the genes and neurons required for aerotaxis in the food-regulated <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> background are unknown. Here we undertake a systematic comparison of the cells and genes that mediate hyperoxia avoidance in <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> and <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> animals. Our results reveal a distributed network of aerotaxis-promoting neurons and antagonistic neurons that suppress aerotaxis on food. Neuromodulation by food is accomplished by the NPR-1 neuropeptide pathway, noncanonical peptide regulation by the TGF-β–related protein DAF-7, and the neurotransmitter serotonin. Different coalitions of neurons dominate aerotaxis behavior in different conditions. Thus, complex natural behaviors in <italic>C. elegans,</italic> like behaviors in other animals, are assembled by flexible, distributed neuronal networks.</p>

        <title>Two Distinct Groups of sGC-Expressing Neurons Promote Hyperoxia Avoidance</title>
        <p>When N2 <italic>npr-1(215V) C. elegans</italic> is placed into a small chamber with a linear gradient from anoxia to atmospheric oxygen in the gas phase, animals rapidly move to an intermediate preferred oxygen concentration between 7%–14% O<sub>2</sub>, avoiding both high and low oxygen levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">1</xref>B). We found that different genetic and sensory inputs affected the animals' distribution in complex ways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figures 1</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">6</xref>). Some manipulations caused animals to shift toward higher or lower oxygen but preserved avoidance of oxygen extremes (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>F); other manipulations resulted in flattened distributions of animals between 7%–21% oxygen but did not affect avoidance of low oxygen (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>G). Accumulation of animals at one oxygen concentration necessarily affected accumulation at all other concentrations—in other words, individual datapoints within an aerotaxis assay are not independent. Statistical approaches for analyzing aerotaxis data were developed to take the entire distribution into account in representing the mutant responses. Briefly, for each mutant and condition we first compared the complete distribution of animals in the gradient to appropriate control strains using a stringent nonparametric test, chi-square analysis. Distributions that were significantly different at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 were subjected to further analysis with additional tests, using appropriate corrections for multiple comparisons. The Materials and Methods section includes a full discussion of statistical considerations; primary aerotaxis data are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040274-st001">Table S1</xref>.</p>

        <p>In this study, we focused on genes and neurons that contribute to hyperoxia avoidance, the avoidance of oxygen levels above 14% O<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">1</xref>C). Many of the interesting differences between mutants were evident using a simple index for hyperoxia avoidance that compares the fraction of animals in the hyperoxia area (bins 1–3, &gt;14% O<sub>2</sub>) to the fraction in the preferred area (bins 4–6, 7%–14% O<sub>2</sub>). A hyperoxia avoidance index of 1.0 represents complete avoidance of hyperoxia, 0.0 represents no preference, and −1.0 represents a complete preference for hyperoxia. Because each mutant was assayed at least three times, the hyperoxia avoidance index could be used for standard statistical methods such as analysis of variance (ANOVA). In a few cases, the behavior of animals in the gradients showed a significant shift in the preferred oxygen concentration that was not well described by the hyperoxia avoidance index, but could be described using the median preferred oxygen concentration. These cases are discussed individually as they arise. The analysis used here may underreport real differences, but should exclude false-positive results. Throughout this paper, the term “aerotaxis” refers to the complete distribution of animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), and the phrase “hyperoxia avoidance” refers specifically to the hyperoxia avoidance index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>I).</p>
        <p>Hyperoxia avoidance in N2 <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> depends on the cGMP-gated channel <italic>tax-4</italic> and the sGC homolog <italic>gcy-35</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. Four additional sGC homologs, <italic>gcy-32, gcy-34, gcy-36,</italic> and <italic>gcy-37,</italic> are coexpressed with <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>tax-4</italic> in the URX, AQR, and PQR sensory neurons. Existing loss-of-function mutations in all of these sGCs except <italic>gcy-37</italic> were tested to ask whether other sGCs are involved in oxygen sensing in N2 <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> animals. <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>gcy-36</italic> mutants were significantly different from wild-type N2 animals based on the hyperoxia avoidance index, whereas <italic>gcy-32</italic> and <italic>gcy-34</italic> mutants were not affected by this measure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">1</xref>E, and 1I). Analysis of the entire aerotaxis distribution showed a significant shift toward higher median preferred oxygen concentrations in <italic>gcy-34</italic> mutants (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05), and a shift in <italic>gcy-32</italic> animals that is unlikely to be significant. In an independent study, <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>gcy-36</italic> were found to affect aerotaxis in the <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> background, but <italic>gcy-32</italic> and <italic>gcy-34</italic> had no effect under standard assay conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b012">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>The hyperoxia avoidance defects of <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants can be rescued by transgenes expressed in the URX, AQR, and PQR neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. To ask whether these neurons are also necessary for aerotaxis, we expressed the cell-death activator gene <italic>egl-1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b022">22</xref>] under the control of the <italic>gcy-36</italic> promoter to generate a strain in which the URX, AQR, and PQR neurons were absent <italic>(qaIs2241).</italic> No URX, AQR, and PQR neurons could be detected in animals bearing the integrated <italic>qaIs2241</italic> transgene, as assessed either by expression of <italic>gcy-35::GFP</italic> or by Nomarski microscopy (<italic>n</italic> &gt; 100 and <italic>n</italic> = 10, respectively). Surprisingly, the <italic>qaIs2241</italic> strain exhibited robust hyperoxia avoidance that was unlike the sGC mutants <italic>gcy-34, gcy-35,</italic> and <italic>gcy-36</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">1</xref>I). Their hyperoxia avoidance index was normal, but <italic>qaIs2241</italic> animals were shifted to significantly lower oxygen concentrations in a 0%–21% gradient than wild-type animals (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). These results imply the existence of oxygen-sensing neurons other than URX, AQR, and PQR. They also show that altering sGC gene function leads to qualitatively different results from killing URX, AQR, and PQR neurons (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>
        <p><italic>gcy-35::GFP</italic> reporter genes are expressed reliably in URX, AQR, PQR, SDQ, ALN, and BDU neurons, and variably in AVM, PLM, and PLN neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b016">16</xref>]. AVM and PLM are mechanosensory neurons; little is known about the functional properties of SDQ, ALN, BDU, and PLN. <italic>gcy-35; qaIs2241</italic> animals were defective in hyperoxia avoidance, unlike <italic>qaIs2241</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">1</xref>I). This result indicates that <italic>gcy-35</italic> has an additional site of action outside the URX, AQR, and PQR neurons. Expressing <italic>gcy-35</italic> in SDQ, ALN, and PLN was sufficient to restore hyperoxia avoidance to <italic>gcy-35</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">1</xref>I), suggesting that SDQ, ALN, and PLN might also serve as oxygen-sensing neurons. Thus, at least two sets of sGC-expressing neurons promote hyperoxia avoidance: (1) some or all of URX, AQR, and PQR; and (2) some or all of SDQ, ALN, and PLN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>J). The two SDQ neurons are similar in lineage, morphology, and neural connectivity to the AQR and PQR neurons, so they are attractive candidate oxygen sensors.</p>

        <p><italic>osm-9</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic> function in chemotaxis toward some odors and in avoidance of high osmolarity, nose touch, and chemical repellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b024">24</xref>]. The expression of <italic>osm-9</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic> overlaps in the chemosensory neurons AWA, ADF, ADL, ASH, PHA, and PHB; <italic>osm-9</italic> is expressed in numerous additional neurons. Several cell-specific transgenes were tested for the ability to rescue <italic>osm-9</italic> hyperoxia avoidance in the N2 <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> strain. The ASH nociceptive neurons are required for avoidance of chemical, mechanical, and osmotic repellents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b025">25</xref>]. Expressing <italic>osm-9</italic> in the ASH nociceptive neurons, together with the posterior PHA and PHB neurons, restored hyperoxia avoidance to <italic>osm-9</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">Figure 2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">2</xref>I) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b026">26</xref>]. A close correlation was observed between rescue of osmotic avoidance, an ASH-mediated behavior, and rescue of hyperoxia avoidance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). These results match with those previously observed in the <italic>npr-1(lf)</italic> background, where expression of OCR-2 in ASH rescued both aggregation and aerotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b018">18</xref>].</p>
        <p>Unexpectedly, a second transgene that rescued an <italic>osm-9</italic> mutant only in ADF neurons also rescued <italic>osm-9</italic> hyperoxia avoidance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">2</xref>I). ADF is a chemosensory neuron that affects formation of the alternative dauer larva stage, chemotaxis towards water-soluble attractants, and olfactory learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b028">28</xref>]; it has not previously been implicated in oxygen-related behaviors. Unlike the rescuing ASH transgene, the ADF transgene did not rescue osmotic avoidance (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), and the ASH transgene did not rescue other roles of <italic>osm-9</italic> in ADF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b026">26</xref>]. These results suggest that <italic>osm-9</italic> acts in both ASH and ADF neurons to promote hyperoxia avoidance.</p>
        <p>The ADF neurons produce serotonin, a neurotransmitter that modulates egg-laying, feeding, locomotion, learning, and other food- and stress-related responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b031">31</xref>]. The rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin biosynthesis is tryptophan hydroxylase, which is encoded by the <italic>tph-1</italic> gene in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b030">30</xref>]<italic>. osm-9</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic> mutants have reduced levels of <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in ADF [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b026">26</xref>]. To ask whether serotonin might contribute to the activity of ADF neurons, we examined <italic>tph-1</italic> null mutants. These animals avoided hyperoxia about half as well as wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">Figure 2</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">2</xref>I). Their intermediate defect is consistent with the idea that ADF functions as one of several neurons that promote hyperoxia avoidance. A transgene that expressed <italic>tph-1</italic> only in the ADF sensory neurons rescued the hyperoxia avoidance defect of <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">Figure 2</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">2</xref>I). A different transgene that expressed <italic>tph-1</italic> in the NSM neurons in the pharynx did not rescue hyperoxia avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">Figure 2</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">2</xref>I), although it does rescue some effects of <italic>tph-1</italic> on locomotion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b028">28</xref>]. This result suggests that serotonin produced by ADF promotes hyperoxia avoidance.</p>
        <p><italic>tph-1</italic> was also required for hyperoxia avoidance in the <italic>qaIs2241</italic> strain that lacked URX, AQR, and PQR neurons, as were <italic>ocr-2</italic> and <italic>osm-9</italic> TRPV genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">Figure 2</xref>G–I). These results provide further evidence that TRPV channel–expressing neurons cooperate with sGC-expressing neurons in the oxygen response. The analysis of the sGC and TRPV mutants suggests that no single class of neuron is required for hyperoxia avoidance in N2 <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> animals. Either of two sets of sGC-expressing neurons can cooperate with either of two sets of TRPV-expressing neurons to generate hyperoxia avoidance in oxygen gradients (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g001">Figure 1</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">2</xref>J).</p>

        <p>The hyperoxia avoidance defect of <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants off food was rescued in <italic>tph-1; ADF::tph-1</italic> transgenic animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g002">Figure 2</xref>), but these rescued animals were not regulated by food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g005">Figure 5</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g005">5</xref>F).

        <p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> TGF-β homolog DAF-7 responds to food and crowding to regulate formation of the alternative dauer larva stage; low levels of <italic>daf-7</italic> activity are associated with stressful conditions that favor dauer formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b021">21</xref>]. <italic>daf-7</italic> mutants aggregate on food, suggesting a possible interaction with oxygen-regulated behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b019">19</xref>], but this process is genetically different from <italic>npr-1</italic> aggregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b018">18</xref>].

        <p>During reproductive growth, secreted DAF-7 antagonizes the activity of the SMAD transcription factor DAF-3 in target cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b032">32</xref>]. <italic>daf-3</italic> mutants are dauer defective, <italic>daf-7</italic> mutants are dauer constitutive, and <italic>daf-7; daf-3</italic> mutants resemble <italic>daf-3</italic> mutants. Similar epistasis relationships were observed in hyperoxia avoidance. <italic>daf-3</italic> hyperoxia avoidance was regulated by food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">Figure 6</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">6</xref>J), and hyperoxia avoidance of <italic>daf-7; daf-3</italic> animals was also regulated by food, resembling <italic>daf-3</italic> mutants rather than <italic>daf-7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">Figure 6</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">6</xref>J). These results suggest that <italic>daf-7</italic> regulates hyperoxia avoidance through the transcriptional <italic>daf-3/SMAD</italic> pathway. Hyperoxia avoidance in <italic>daf-3 npr-1</italic> mutants resembled that of <italic>npr-1</italic> single mutants and was not regulated by food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">6</xref>J). These results indicate that <italic>npr-1</italic> does not act through the <italic>daf-3</italic> transcriptional pathway.</p>
        <p><italic>daf-7</italic> is expressed most strongly in the ASI sensory neurons, where its transcription is induced by food and suppressed by crowding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b021">21</xref>]. This activity-dependent pathway for <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI requires the cGMP-gated sensory channel <italic>tax-4</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b033">33</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">Figure 6</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">6</xref>G). To ask whether <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI might affect aerotaxis, we examined a strain in which <italic>tax-4</italic> was mutant in ASI and other sensory neurons, but rescued in URX, AQR, and PQR neurons. Hyperoxia avoidance in these strains was not regulated by food (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">Figure 6</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">6</xref>J), suggesting that food could act in part by regulating <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI.</p>
        <p>Both <italic>daf-7</italic> and the serotonin biosynthetic enzyme <italic>tph-1</italic> function in food and stress responses, and <italic>tph-1</italic> has complex positive and negative interactions with genes in the dauer formation pathway, including <italic>daf-7</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b031">31</xref>]<italic>.</italic> We found that <italic>daf-7</italic> mutants had significantly increased <italic>tph-1::GFP</italic> expression in ADF neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g007">Figure 7</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g007">7</xref>C). <italic>tph-1</italic> is the rate-limiting enzyme for serotonin synthesis, so this induction should increase total ADF serotonin levels and therefore promote aerotaxis. <italic>tph-1::GFP</italic> expression in ADF was also increased in <italic>tax-4</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), which have a low level of <italic>daf-7</italic> expression in ASI.

These results are consistent with the model that <italic>daf-3</italic> functions by regulating <italic>tph-1</italic> expression. <italic>daf-3</italic> is not required for basal <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in ADF, only for its regulation by <italic>daf-7</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g007">Figure 7</xref>C); since <italic>tph-1</italic> is also regulated by TRPV and calcium signaling pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b026">26</xref>], <italic>daf-3</italic> may not be the only link between food and <italic>tph-1</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g007">Figure 7</xref>D).</p>
        <p>By both molecular and genetic criteria, <italic>daf-7</italic> and <italic>npr-1</italic> appeared to act in separate pathways to regulate hyperoxia avoidance on food. The expression of <italic>tph-1::GFP</italic> in ADF was not increased in <italic>npr-1</italic> animals compared to wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), and <italic>daf-3 npr-1</italic> mutants resembled <italic>npr-1</italic> single mutants in hyperoxia avoidance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">Figure 6</xref>E and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g006">6</xref>J), indicating that <italic>daf-3</italic> is not the target for <italic>npr-1.</italic></p>
        <p>These results implicate two different pathways in food regulation of aerotaxis: one mediated by neuropeptide <italic>npr-1</italic> suppression of sGC neurons, and one mediated by <italic>daf-7</italic> suppression of <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in ADF.

            <p>(B) Aerotaxis-suppressing pathways. In the presence of food, the aerotaxis neurons are inhibited by the TGF-β homolog DAF-7 and the neuropeptide receptor NPR-1. Food and <italic>tax-4</italic> activity in ASI neurons stimulate the synthesis of DAF-7, which acts through DAF-3 to inhibit serotonin production in ADF and suppress aerotaxis. Increased or unregulated serotonin expression in ADF allows aerotaxis in the presence of food. Food inhibition may involve additional food-sensing pathways in ADF (perhaps via <italic>osm-9</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic>) or serotonin signaling from other food-sensing neurons (such as NSM). NPR-1 is expressed in URX, AQR, PQR, ASH, SDQ, and AUA neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b014">14</xref>] and could inhibit their function in a food-dependent or food-independent fashion. Many of the signaling pathways and neurons described here have the potential to regulate each other's activity. <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants have decreased <italic>daf-7</italic> expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b030">30</xref>], and <italic>daf-7</italic> affects gene expression in the ASH neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b047">47</xref>]. A food-related change in serotonin levels affects nociceptive signaling in ASH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b038">38</xref>]. The NPR-1 ligand FLP-21 is expressed by ASH and ADL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b015">15</xref>]. The regulatory relationships in (B) are supported by the genetics, molecular biology, and behavioral assays in this paper, but these relationships could be reconfigured under different conditions.</p>

        <title>Oxygen-Sensing Neurons Interact in a Distributed Aerotaxis Circuit</title>
        <p>The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> nervous system consists of 302 neurons with reproducible morphologies and synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b034">34</xref>]. Many of these neurons have characteristic sensory or motor functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b036">36</xref>]. However, food is able to alter the neurons required for several <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> behaviors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b038">38</xref>], often through serotonin-dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b031">31</xref>]. Our results suggest that the network for oxygen-regulated behavior is flexible and distributed. Like the crustacean feeding circuit, the leech escape circuit, and the mammalian hippocampus, oxygen responses are encoded in the behavior of neuronal populations, not just individual neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b041">41</xref>].</p>
        <p>At least four sets of sensory neurons promote avoidance of high oxygen: (1) some or all of URX, AQR, and PQR, which express multiple sGCs; (2) some or all of SDQ, ALN, and PLN, which express the sGC homolog <italic>gcy-35</italic>; and (3–4) the <italic>osm-9</italic> (TRPV)–expressing neurons ADF and ASH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). In the absence of food, either URX, AQR, and PQR neurons or the other sGC neurons can be sufficient for hyperoxia avoidance, although they result in different peak oxygen preferences: about 10% O<sub>2</sub> for URX, AQR, and PQR, and about 8% O<sub>2</sub> for the alternative neurons. Avoidance of hypoxia (below 7% O<sub>2</sub>) appears to represent a separate system that is largely independent of these pathways.</p>
        <p>At least three predicted soluble guanylate cyclases, <italic>gcy-34, gcy-35,</italic> and <italic>gcy-36,</italic> contribute to hyperoxia avoidance in an N2 background. Mammalian sGCs function as obligate dimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b042">42</xref>], so the possible complement of different cyclases in URX, AQR, and PQR is substantial, perhaps explaining why sGC mutations are different from killing URX, AQR, and PQR. In an independent study, <italic>gcy-35</italic> and <italic>gcy-36,</italic> but not <italic>gcy-32</italic> or <italic>gcy-34,</italic> were found to be required for hyperoxia avoidance in <italic>npr-1</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b012">12</xref>]. Enhanced aerotaxis activity of URX, AQR, and PQR in <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants may relieve the requirement for <italic>gcy-34</italic> activity. However, even in <italic>npr-1</italic> mutants, either <italic>gcy-32</italic> or <italic>gcy-34</italic> contributes to avoidance of high oxygen levels under sensitized conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b012">12</xref>].</p>
        <p>URX, AQR, PQR, SDQ, ALN, and PLN express sGCs that bind to molecular oxygen, consistent with a primary oxygen-sensing function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. We suggest that these neurons are activated by high oxygen to trigger avoidance behavior. An avoidance function is consistent with the neuronal connectivity of URX, AQR, PQR, and SDQ neurons; like ASH and other sensory neurons that mediate avoidance, these neurons synapse onto the command interneurons that regulate the choice between forward and backward movement [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g008">Figure 8</xref>A).</p>
        <p>The TRPV-expressing neurons ADF and ASH also promote hyperoxia avoidance, and an <italic>osm-9</italic> mutant can be rescued by expression in either of those cells. In addition, ASH neurons contribute to aggregation in <italic>npr-1</italic> strains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b018">18</xref>]. No direct molecular mediators of oxygen sensation have been defined in ADF and ASH. These neurons might sense oxygen directly through an unknown mechanism, or they might act indirectly to stimulate the activity of the sGC-expressing neurons. ASH neurons are polymodal nociceptors that generate robust calcium transients to noxious stimuli such as high osmotic strength, quinine, and touch [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b043">43</xref>], but ASH does not respond with strong calcium transients when exposed to decreases or increases in oxygen in the range where hyperoxia avoidance is observed (unpublished data). It is possible that a subtle modulation of ASH activity by oxygen contributes to a distributed oxygen response, or that other noxious signals sensed by ASH converge with oxygen at downstream neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b018">18</xref>].</p>
        <p>The ADF neurons have not been implicated in aggregation, but our results indicate that ADF has a significant role in aerotaxis of <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> animals. ADF stimulates aerotaxis in the absence of food by producing serotonin. A variety of results suggest that ADF serotonin may be a stress signal in <italic>C. elegans;</italic> this possibility is considered below.</p>
        <p>The wiring diagram of synaptic connections in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> suggests that the network of aerotaxis neurons converges on AVA, the command interneuron responsible for generating backward motion; ASH, AQR, PQR, and SDQ all make connections to AVA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g008">Figure 8</xref>A). Another likely site of signal integration is the interneuron AUA, which receives most of its synaptic inputs from ADF and URX and synapses onto AVA and other neurons.</p>

        <title>TGF-β Signaling, Serotonin, and Aerotaxis on Food</title>
        <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> egg-laying, feeding, locomotion, and olfactory behavior are all regulated by food, in part through serotonin-dependent pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b031">31</xref>]. Our results identify serotonin and the TGF-β homolog DAF-7 as interacting modulators of hyperoxia avoidance in <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> strains. Either decreased or increased serotonin disrupts food regulation: <italic>tph-1</italic> mutants have poor hyperoxia avoidance that is not regulated by food, whereas <italic>daf-7</italic> strains that overexpress <italic>tph-1</italic> have robust aerotaxis that is not regulated by food. Unregulated expression of <italic>tph-1</italic> from the <italic>srh-142</italic> promoter results in food-resistant aerotaxis. These results suggest that <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in ADF functions as a dose-dependent stimulator of hyperoxia avoidance.</p>
        <p>Genetic and molecular results indicate that <italic>daf-7</italic> suppresses hyperoxia avoidance on food by repressing <italic>tph-1</italic> expression in ADF neurons. The expression of <italic>daf-7</italic> in ASI is stimulated by food and <italic>tax-4,</italic> providing a link between food availability and <italic>daf-7</italic> activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b033">33</xref>]. Thus, the <italic>daf-7/tph-1</italic> regulatory loop may be a component of normal food regulation of hyperoxia avoidance. It is possible that other serotonergic neurons affect food regulation as well.</p>
        <p><italic>tph-1</italic> expression in ADF can be induced by infection with bacterial pathogens, high temperature, calcium signaling, and genes in the dauer formation pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b031">31</xref>]. High temperature and pathogenic infection are natural stressors for <italic>C. elegans,</italic> and the dauer pathway is a general physiological response to stress states, suggesting that induction of serotonin in ADF is a common stress-related response. Hyperoxia is a metabolic stressor and a mutagen; the nociceptive ASH neurons and the ADF serotonergic neurons may function to stimulate hyperoxia avoidance (and thus decrease oxidative stress) in the presence of other environmental or metabolic stressors.</p>
        <p>Paradoxically, serotonin can substitute for the effects of food in many behavioral assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b029">29</xref>], and therefore may communicate either food or stress signals depending on the amount of serotonin or the neuronal source of serotonin<italic>.</italic> An interesting contrast to hyperoxia avoidance is provided by ASH nociception, which is stimulated by serotonin and heightened in the presence of food, the condition in which hyperoxia avoidance is suppressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b038">38</xref>]. The behaviors associated with serotonin signaling—enhancement of feeding or egg-laying, enhanced slowing on food, alteration of nociceptive pathways, and olfactory learning—are all highly sensitive to the transition between well-fed and starved states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b044">44</xref>]. ADF serotonin release might be used to signal and enhance the transition between these states, rather than representing either the positive or the negative sensory context.</p>

Peliti, personal communication). Aggregation only occurs in strains that maintain strong hyperoxia avoidance in the presence of food (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040274-st003">Table S3</xref>). These results suggest that aggregation behavior is partly driven by hyperoxia avoidance, and that animals within an aggregate cooperate to lower ambient oxygen to a preferred level. Aggregation in microaerophilic flagellates has been shown to have a similar oxygen-lowering effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b045">45</xref>].</p>
        <p>More generally, hyperoxia avoidance may represent a foraging behavior in which <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> searches for the lower oxygen concentrations that correspond to food. In the soil, pockets of bacteria growing on decaying organic matter create local sinks of oxygen; even <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> colonies on an agar surface consume oxygen faster than it can diffuse through the lawn [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. N2 <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> animals suppress the drive to find low oxygen in the presence of adequate <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> food, a strategy that may allow them to exploit a greater range of environments. Thus the recent evolutionary appearance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> strains with <italic>npr-1(215V)</italic> activity may have added flexibility to <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> feeding behavior [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b015">15</xref>].</p>
        <p>The analysis of wild-type and <italic>npr-1</italic> animals on and off food shows that despite its stereotyped neuroanatomy, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> can generate hyperoxia avoidance using flexible configurations of neurons. The preferred oxygen concentration can be altered by changing the class of sensory neurons that dominate the response, or by changing the properties of the sensory neurons. The strength of the avoidance response can be regulated by different food signals that modulate oxygen-sensing circuits. Our results suggest that the simple nervous system of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">C. elegans</named-content> has the potential to assemble alternative functional circuits analogous to the dynamic modulated networks in crustacean feeding circuits, leech escape response circuit, or hippocampal place cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b041">41</xref>].

        <p>Aerotaxis assays were performed by placing animals on nematode growth medium (NGM) agar in custom-made microfluidic devices fabricated from polydimethylsiloxane (PDMS) with a gas-phase linear gradient from 0%–21% oxygen, and monitoring animals' accumulation in nine bins across the gradient [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>]. Gradients were generated by delivering gases under laminar flow to source and drain chambers immediately outside the behavioral arena, using a syringe pump; diffusion of the gases established the gradient in the small assay chamber. Gases were obtained from Airgas (Radnor, Pennsylvania, United States), Matheson (Montgomeryville, Pennsylvania, United States), and TW Smith (Brooklyn, New York, United States). Animals were prepared for assays as described except that animals were picked instead of washed from their culture plate onto NGM assay plates before the devices were placed onto the assay plate. For assays on food, thin bacterial lawns of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> HB101 were made by seeding NGM plates for overnight growth at 37 °C and returning plates to room temperature for at least 1 h before assay.</p>

        <title>Statistical analysis.</title>
        <p>Statistical analysis of aerotaxis was conducted in multiple steps. The nine individual points in the aerotaxis assay are not independent—accumulation of animals in one bin necessarily affects all other bins—so they cannot be analyzed individually. A first test to assess the overall distribution of animals in the aerotaxis assay was a comparison of experimental strains or conditions to controls by chi-square analysis (nine bins per aerotaxis assay × two strains = eight degrees of freedom). Chi-square analysis takes into account the non-Gaussian nature of the aerotaxis distributions as well as the total number of animals tested. It is overly conservative because it combines all animals tested into a single contingency table, and does not take into account the fact that each assay was repeated multiple times. Therefore, assays that are not statistically different by this criterion may actually be different. With this issue in mind, we have emphasized positive findings in this study. For controls such as N2 that were compared to multiple mutants, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 was used as the level of significance for the chi-square test. Most results described in the paper were significant at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0040274-st002">Table S2</xref>).

        <p>The hyperoxia avoidance index has been previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0040274-b011">11</xref>] and is defined as [(fraction of animals in 7%–14% O<sub>2</sub>) − (fraction of animals in 14%–21% O<sub>2</sub>)] / (fraction of animals in 7%–21% O<sub>2</sub>).</p>
        <p>This standard performance index varies from −1.0 (all animals in hyperoxic regions) to +1.0 (all animals in normoxic regions), with 0 representing no preference between normoxia and hyperoxia. The response to hypoxia, the region between 0%–7% oxygen, was not reliably affected in any of the assays described here; hypoxia avoidance appears to be a distinct behavior with a distinct genetic basis, and this part of the curve was not informative for any analysis. Each strain or condition was tested in at least three assays with ~80–100 animals each, and the mean hyperoxia avoidance index across all assays was used to test significance. <italic>t</italic> tests were used to compare the hyperoxia avoidance indices between two distributions (Statview, Cary, North Carolina, United States). ANOVA plus Bonferroni <italic>t</italic> tests or Dunnett tests were used for multiple comparisons of hyperoxia avoidance indices between strains (Statview). For controls such as N2 that were compared to multiple mutants, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01 was used as the level of significance.</p>
        <p>The median oxygen preference was calculated for each assay as the position of the 50th percentile of animals. Results from multiple assays were combined for each strain or condition using at least three assays with ~80–100 animals per assay, generating a mean median oxygen preference. For ANOVA, all strains were compared to one control (N2 in the absence of food), and Dunnett tests for multiple comparisons were used. Significant differences were observed with <italic>gcy-34, gcy-36,</italic> and <italic>ocr-2</italic> (all off food, higher oxygen preference than N2)<italic>,</italic> and <italic>qaIs2241</italic> off food, <italic>npr-1</italic> on food, and <italic>daf-7</italic> on food (lower oxygen preference than N2).</p>
        <p>In almost every case, the hyperoxia avoidance index or the median oxygen preference uncovered and simplified the differences between strains and conditions that were apparent in the overall assays.</p>
        <p>Two concerns remained after this analysis: (1) is it valid to consider the hyperoxia avoidance index and the median preferred oxygen concentration as independent values? and (2) are there important features of the behavior that were overlooked using these parameters? As an independent, unbiased way to identify important sources of variance in the data, we analyzed the distribution of animals in 279 aerotaxis assays by principal component analysis (PCA), an unsupervised data reduction method.</p>
        <p>PCA was conducted on 48 datapoints that described each aerotaxis curve: the fraction of animals in each of the nine bins, the sums of fractions in adjacent bins or adjacent groups of three or four bins, and the differences between adjacent bins or adjacent groups of two or three bins. These 48 datapoints reflected features of the aerotaxis assay that were not necessarily represented in the standard parameters, such as the steepness of the curve at each point in the assay. Aerotaxis assays representing 36 genotypes with or without food were analyzed for PCA using Cluster 3.0 for Mac OSX (Michiel de Hoon, Seiya Imoto, and Satoru Miyano, University of Tokyo). The first principal component (PC1) described the basic bell shape of the aerotaxis assay, the second component (PC2) resembled the peak preferred oxygen concentration, and the third component (PC3) resembled the hyperoxia avoidance index. Each principal component represents a complex vector that is most easily understood by showing the assays with the highest and lowest value of that vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g009">Figure 9</xref>). For PC2, the highest values were the assays where the peak response was at high oxygen concentrations (e.g., <italic>gcy-34, gcy-36, ocr-2</italic>), and the lowest values were the assays in which the peak response was at low oxygen concentrations (e.g., <italic>qaIs2241</italic>); wild-type N2 animals had an intermediate value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g009">Figure 9</xref>A). For PC3, the highest values were the assays with a strong aerotaxis peak (e.g., <italic>npr-1, daf-7, ADF::tph-1</italic>), and the lowest values were the assays that were nearly flat (e.g., N2-like genotypes on food); wild-type N2 animals off food had a high value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0040274-g009">Figure 9</xref>B).</p>

        <p>The conclusion of this analysis is that an unbiased assessment of the variance in the aerotaxis assays yields features that are substantially related to the parameters identified by direct inspection of the aerotaxis data: the hyperoxia avoidance index and the median preferred oxygen concentration. Since PC2 and PC3 are by definition independent of each other, it is valid to consider these two components of the aerotaxis assay (its peak and its strength) separately.</p>
        <p>We reasoned that if the principal components defined in this manner were biologically significant, they would correlate with the genotype and condition of the assay. Therefore, after PCA of individual assays, assays were grouped by genotype and condition, and the mean and standard error for each principal component were defined for each strain and condition and subjected to ANOVA. This analysis demonstrated significant effects of genotype and condition on PC2 and PC3. Detailed statistical analysis of PC2 and PC3 by genotype and condition led to conclusions similar to those reported in the results (unpublished data).</p>
