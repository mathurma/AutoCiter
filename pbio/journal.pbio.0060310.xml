				<article-title>Lessons on Life from SENP2</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>SUMO-specific protease 2 (SENP2) modifies proteins by removing SUMO from its substrates. Although SUMO-specific proteases are known to reverse sumoylation in many defined systems, their importance in mammalian development and pathogenesis remains largely elusive. Here we report that SENP2 is highly expressed in trophoblast cells that are required for placentation. Targeted disruption of SENP2 in mice reveals its essential role in development of all three trophoblast layers. The mutation causes a deficiency in cell cycle progression. SENP2 has a specific role in the G–S transition, which is required for mitotic and endoreduplication cell cycles in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, respectively. SENP2 ablation disturbs the p53–Mdm2 pathway, affecting the expansion of trophoblast progenitors and their maturation. Reintroducing SENP2 into the mutants can reduce the sumoylation of Mdm2, diminish the p53 level and promote trophoblast development. Furthermore, downregulation of p53 alleviates the SENP2-null phenotypes and stimulation of p53 causes abnormalities in trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, resembling those of the <italic>SENP2</italic> mutants. Our data reveal a key genetic pathway, SENP2–Mdm2–p53, underlying trophoblast lineage development, suggesting its pivotal role in cell cycle progression of mitosis and endoreduplication.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>Genome replication is essential for both expansion of stem cell numbers through mitosis and their maturation into certain specialized cell types through endoreduplication, a unique mechanism for multiplying chromosomes without dividing the cell. An important function of p53 as a guardian of the genome ensures that the genetic information is properly propagated during these processes. In this study, we discovered that mice with disruption of SENP2, an enzyme that removes small molecular signals (called SUMO) that modify a protein's behavior and stability, are unable to form a healthy placenta as a result of deficiencies in the formation of various trophoblast cell types that give rise to the placenta. In the mutants, SUMO modification of Mdm2, a protein that monitors the cellular levels of p53, is deregulated. The loss of SENP2 causes dislocation of Mdm2, leading to aberrant stimulation of p53. The precursor cells known as trophoblast stem cells rely on p53 to proliferate and differentiate into specialized polyploid cells, which contain multiple copies of chromosomes. In <italic>SENP2</italic> mutants, all three trophoblast layers were substantially defective, with the layer containing mainly the polyploid cells most severely affected and diminished. This study reveals a key genetic pathway, SENP2–Mdm2–p53, which is pivotal for the genome replication underlying trophoblast cell proliferation and differentiation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The first two distinct lineages to form in the mammalian embryos are the outer trophectoderm and the inner cell mass (ICM) of the blastocyst [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b001">1</xref>]. The trophectoderm initiates implantation and invasion of the uterus, processes that are essential for placental development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b002">2</xref>]. This process depends on the differentiation of trophoblasts, the main and most important cell types in the placenta [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b004">4</xref>]. The trophoblast stem (TS) cells in the mural trophectoderm, distal to the ICM, stop dividing but continue to duplicate their genomes, a mechanism known as endoreduplication. The polyploid trophoblast giant cells (TGCs) then develop and eventually surround the entire fetus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b005">5</xref>]. As development proceeds, the trophoblast progenitors give rise to three distinct layers in rodents—labyrinth, spongiotrophoblast and TGCs—to form a functional placenta acting as the maternal–fetal interface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b006">6</xref>]. The fetal–placental blood vessels grow in from the allantois to generate the fetal parts of the placental vasculature where the chorioallantoic fusion has occurred [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b007">7</xref>]. The labyrinth is formed by extensive branching morphogenesis of the labyrinth trophoblast and endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b008">8</xref>]. The maternal blood passes through the small spaces of the labyrinth, directly contacting the fetal trophoblast cells to ensure exchange between the two blood systems. The labyrinth layer is supported structurally by the spongiotrophoblast cells, which are mainly derived from the ectoplacental cone and which form a layer separating the labyrinth from the TGC. The simplicity of placental cell lineages makes the placenta a valuable model system for understanding general aspects of development, including branching morphogenesis, lineage-specific determination, cell invasion, and polyploidy, crucial for cancer development and metastasis.</p>
      <p>SENP2 belongs to a family of proteases that remove a small ubiquitin-related modifier (SUMO) from protein substrates. SUMO (also known as sentrin), which regulates posttranslational modification of proteins, is a member of the ubiquitin-like modifier family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b009">9</xref>]. This covalent conjugation process is reversible and highly evolutionary conserved from yeasts to humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b010">10</xref>]. Unlike ubiquitination, which has a well-established role in targeting protein degradation, SUMO modification is involved in protein trafficking, cell cycle, cell survival, and cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b011">11</xref>]. SUMO conjugation of proteins can alter their function, activity, or subcellular localization. Many sumoylated proteins have been shown to accumulate preferentially in specific complexes such as the nuclear pore and PML (promyelocytic leukemia) bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b012">12</xref>]. Similar to ubiquitination, sumoylation requires processing, conjugation, and transfer. The transfer process, which covalently conjugates SUMO polypeptides to their targets, is catalyzed by E3 ligases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b013">13</xref>]. The reverse desumoylation process is mediated by SUMO proteases. The hallmark of these proteases is the highly conserved carboxyl-terminal SENP domain of ∼200 amino acids. SENP2, which is found in three different alternatively spliced forms, has been localized to the nucleus, cytoplasmic vesicles and PML nuclear bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b016">16</xref>]. Although SENPs have been shown to catalyze SUMO modification in various physiological systems, their roles in mammalian development and pathogenesis are mostly unknown.</p>
      <p>We previously discovered an interaction of SENP2 with Axin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b018">18</xref>], a key signaling regulator for the canonical Wnt pathway. To determine the role of SENP2 in cellular signaling and the importance of SUMO modification in trophoblast development, we initiated a genetic analysis in mice. A SENP2-null mouse strain was created by gene targeting in embryonic stem (ES) cells. We found that the disruption of SENP2 leads to developmental defects in all three trophoblast layers. SENP2 is essential for the G–S transition of both the mitotic and the endoreduplication cell cycles, which control the expansion of trophoblast precursors and the maturation of TGCs, respectively. In the mutants, the loss of SENP2 caused a deregulation of Mdm2, resulting in p53 stimulation. We also present evidence to support an essential role of SENP2 in modulating the p53–Mdm2 circuit that underlies genome replication in mitosis and polyploidy during trophoblast development.</p>

        <title>Expression of SENP2 in Trophoblast Development</title>
        <p>To determine the role of SENP2 and the importance of SUMO modification in trophoblast development, we first examined its expression pattern. Strong expression of <italic>SENP2</italic> was observed in extraembryonic tissues, including extraembryonic ectoderm, chorion and ectoplacental cone, at embryonic day (E)7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). In extraembryonic ectoderm, its expression started diminishing by E7.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). In addition to these stem cell niche sites, we also detected its transcript in TS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>C). At E8.5, <italic>SENP2</italic> maintained its ubiquitous expression in trophoblast cells located in the chorion and ectoplacental cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">1</xref>F). By E9.5 and E10.5, the <italic>SENP2</italic> transcript was detected in all three trophoblast layers: labyrinth, spongiotrophoblast and TGC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">1</xref>L). <italic>SENP2</italic> was expressed in the labyrinth trophoblast cells, which derive from the extraembryonic ectoderm and chorion, upon chorioallantoic fusion at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>I). In the E10.5 labyrinth layer, its expression was specifically localized to cytotrophoblasts (mononuclear trophoblasts), adjacent to the maternal blood cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>M). Syncytiotrophoblasts, as well as endothelial and blood cells, appeared to be negative for the staining. In contrast, we found a uniform expression of <italic>SENP2</italic> in spongiotrophoblasts and TGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>J, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">1</xref>K, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">1</xref>N, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">1</xref>O), which are derivatives of the ectoplacental cone. TGCs include primary and secondary cells, derived from mural trophectoderm and ectoplacental cone (derivatives of polar trophectoderm), respectively. The <italic>SENP2</italic> transcript was detected in both the primary and secondary TGCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>G, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">1</xref>K, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">1</xref>O). These results imply an important function of SENP2 in trophoblast progenitors and their development into all three major layers.</p>

        <title>SENP2 Is Required for Extraembryonic Development</title>
        <p>A <italic>SENP2</italic>-null allele was created by the targeted insertion of a lacZ reporter with pgk-neo cassette into exon 2 and the deletion of exons 3 to 5 to inactivate all different forms of the <italic>SENP2</italic> gene product (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details). The targeted mouse ES cell clones heterozygous for <italic>SENP2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060310-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A), obtained by homologous recombination, were then used to obtain the <italic>SENP2<sup>lacZ</sup></italic> mouse strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060310-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). Mice carrying the targeted allele were subsequently bred with a Zp3-Cre transgenic strain to remove the pgk-neo cassette (<italic>SENP2</italic>-null allele), as confirmed by PCR genotyping analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060310-sg001">Figure S1</xref>C). RT-PCR analyses further showed that the <italic>SENP2</italic>-null allele does not express the <italic>SENP2</italic> transcript, but instead expresses the inserted <italic>lacZ</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060310-sg001">Figure S1</xref>D).</p>
        <p>The <italic>SENP2</italic>-null heterozygous (hereafter referred to as <italic>SENP2<sup>+/–</sup></italic>) mice were viable and fertile without any noticeable abnormalities. However, we were unable to find <italic>SENP2</italic>-null homozygous (hereafter referred to as <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>) newborns, implying that they died prematurely. These results prompted us to investigate whether the loss of SENP2 causes embryonic lethality. The <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos appeared to be morphologically indistinguishable from their <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>SENP2<sup>+/–</sup></italic> littermates at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g002">2</xref>B). However, the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos were significantly smaller or underdeveloped compared with the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>SENP2<sup>+/–</sup></italic> littermates at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g002">Figure 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g002">2</xref>D). We could not recover the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos after E11.5. This phenotype is often associated with placental deficiencies, as the embryos begin to rely on maternal supplies upon allantoic fusion at mid gestation.

        <title>Trophoblast Niche Sites Are Defective in SENP2 Nulls</title>
        <p>The placental defects caused by SENP2 deficiency suggested that it is critical for trophoblast development. The stem cells derived from the trophectoderm develop into progenitors, which reside in the ectoplacental cone, the extraembryonic ectoderm, and the chorion. We therefore examined whether the <italic>SENP2</italic> deletion interferes with formation of these niche sites. In situ hybridization of Tpbpa, a marker for the ectoplacental cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b019">19</xref>], revealed a drastic reduction of trophoblast progenitors in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g002">Figure 2</xref>M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g002">2</xref>P).

        <title>Effects of SENP2 Deficiency on Labyrinth Layer</title>
        <p>A closer examination of the labyrinth layer was performed by analyzing the expression of Gcm1, a labyrinth trophoblast marker that is specifically detected in the chorioallantoic invasion sites and later in the differentiated syncytiotrophoblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b021">21</xref>]. No obvious difference between <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> was observed at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">3</xref>D). Gcm-1-positive trophoblast progenitors were clearly identified at the invasion sites. Therefore, fetal vascular invasion was not affected by the deletion. However, deficiencies in labyrinth development of <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> embryos were evident at E10. The syncytiotrophoblasts positive for Gcm-1 exhibited punctated staining in the mutant instead of the continuous thin layers seen in the wild type, suggesting that their differentiation is defective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">Figure 3</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">3</xref>E). By E10.5, the number of the Gcm1-expressing cells was dramatically reduced in the mutants (data not shown). At this stage, <italic>SENP2</italic> expression is restricted to the cytotrophoblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g001">Figure 1</xref>M), a subtype of TGCs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b022">22</xref>]. Therefore, we examined whether cytotrophoblast development was affected by analyzing a cytotrophoblast marker, Ctsq [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b023">23</xref>]. Indeed, the Ctsq-positive cytotrophoblasts identified in the wild-type labyrinth were completely missing in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">Figure 3</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">3</xref>F). Histological analysis further showed that both maternal and fetal blood spaces were enlarged without formation of capillary structures in the SENP2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">Figure 3</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">3</xref>J). Immunostaining of laminin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b024">24</xref>], a basement membrane protein expressed by endothelial cells that highlight fetal blood spaces, further revealed a failure of branching morphogenesis in the SENP2-null fetal vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">Figure 3</xref>H and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">3</xref>K). This might be attributed to a deficiency in endothelial proliferation as the number of cyclin D1-positive cells (proliferation marker only detected in endothelial cells) was decreased in the mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">Figure 3</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g003">3</xref>L). These data demonstrated that SENP2 is essential for labyrinth trophoblast development in establishment of the maternal and fetal blood spaces. The presence of SENP2 in early trophoblast precursors might regulate the differentiation of specialized cell types at later stages. Alternatively, its function in the cytotrophoblasts could be crucial for proper development of syncytiotrophoblasts and endothelial cells. SENP2 is necessary for development of the labyrinth layer during placentation.</p>

        <title>Cell Cycle Defects Caused By SENP2 Deficiency</title>
        <p>The SENP2 mutation led to abnormalities in trophoblast progenitors at niche sites and their development into all three major trophoblast lineages. These findings imply that SENP2 might have a general role in cellular regulations important for expansion of precursors and their differentiation. We speculated that decreases in the numbers of trophoblast progenitors and specialized cell types might be due to alterations in cell survival. However, we failed to detect differences in apoptosis caused by the mutation in trophoblast stem cell niches and all three major trophoblast layers in vivo, or in TS cell culture in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060310-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). We then examined whether SENP2 has an important function in the cell cycle. Investigating the expansion of trophoblast progenitors at the niches revealed a deficiency in their cell cycle progression. The expression of Ki67, a marker detected in all phases of mitotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b018">18</xref>], was detected in virtually all trophoblast progenitors in stem cell niches, including extraembryonic ectoderm, chorion, and ectoplacental cone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">6</xref>C, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">6</xref>E, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">6</xref>G), suggesting that they are actively cycling cells. We next examined the cell cycle progression rate among actively cycling cells by measuring the DNA synthesis rate at S phase using BrdU labeling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b018">18</xref>] for 1 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">6</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">6</xref>F, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">6</xref>H). BrdU incorporation specifically measures the rate of cell cycle progression at S phase, whereas Ki67 identifies all phases of mitotic cells.

            <p>(I–L) <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> (I,J) and <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> (K,L) spongiotrophoblasts were analyzed by immunostaining of Ki67 at E10.5 (I,K) and E10 (J,L). Asterisks indicated the Ki67-negative cells in the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> spongiotrophoblast layer (I). The adjacent section of E10 placentas were stained with anti-BrdU to obtain the progression rate.</p>

        <p>Next, we determined whether similar deficiencies also affect development of the spongiotrophoblast layer. We found that this layer expanded rapidly in the wild-type placenta, but not in the mutants, between E9.5 and E10.5 (data not shown). A portion of the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> spongiotrophoblasts exited the cell cycle at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">Figure 6</xref>I), whereas almost all of the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> spongiotrophoblasts remained Ki67-positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">Figure 6</xref>K). In E10 <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> placentas, spongiotrophoblasts were all positive for Ki67, indicating that they are actively cycling cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">Figure 6</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">6</xref>L). However, the cell cycle progression index, which mainly reflects the BrdU incorporation rate, was reduced from 72 in the controls to 53 in the SENP2 mutants (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0005, <italic>n</italic> = 3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">Figure 6</xref>N). To examine whether cycling of TGC was also affected by SENP2 deficiency, we determined its cell cycle progression index (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g006">Figure 6</xref>O). The cell cycle progression index of TGC decreased from 60 in <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> to 41 in <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0034, <italic>n</italic> = 4). Taken together, these results suggest that cell cycle progression was defective in all stem cell niches, and the spongiotrophoblast and TGC layers, of <italic>SENP2</italic> mutants. The SENP2 mutant cells were trapped or arrested in the cell cycle.</p>

        <p>To further examine stem cell expansion and development, we derived a number of <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TS cell lines from blastocysts. Immunostaining analyses of Oct4 (an ES cell marker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b027">27</xref>] and Cdx2 (a TS cell marker) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b020">20</xref>] confirmed that we were able to successfully establish the SENP2-null TS cell lines (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060310-sg003">Figure S3</xref>).

Although the deficiency in cell cycle progression was also demonstrated using the TS cells in vitro, the degree of severity was reduced compared with that seen in the in vivo studies. As we were aware, the in vitro system does not always recapitulate the dynamic developmental processes that occur in vivo. Nevertheless, because of the limited materials available from the early stages of placenta, the TS cell culture does provide a valuable system to further those of our investigations that are otherwise impossible to perform in vivo.</p>

        <p>To investigate whether a specific phase of the cell cycle was defective, we then determined the cell cycle profiles of the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TS cells by flow cytometry analysis of PI (propidium iodide) stained cells. There was no significant difference in the cell population of G2–M between <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> and <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g007">Figure 7</xref>B). However, in the SENP2 nulls, the percentage of cells in G0–G1 was increased (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 4) but the percentage in S was decreased (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0024, <italic>n</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g007">Figure 7</xref>B and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g007">7</xref>C). This implied that the mutant cells were affected at the G1–S transition. To test this hypothesis, we used nocodazole, a microtubule depolymerizing agent, to block cell division at M phase. Nocodazole was effective in synchronizing the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> TS cells at G2–M after 6 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). However, if cells were arrested or trapped in the G1–S phase and unable to pass through the cell cycle, there would be a delay in synchronizing cells by the nocodazole treatment. Indeed, there were still ∼7% of the G0–G1 cells in <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>, but none in <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, 3 h after the treatment. After the 6 h treatment, a significant number (6.16%) of the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TS cells remained in G0–G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g007">Figure 7</xref>D). Even after 24 h, this population arrested in G0–G1 was still present (data not shown). The results suggest that SENP2 has a pivotal role in TS cell cycle progression and the G1–S checkpoint might be affected by the SENP2 ablation.</p>
        <p>Immunostaining of nuclear envelopes with lamin B [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b028">28</xref>] revealed that nuclei of the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TGCs were significantly smaller (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g008">Figure 8</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g008">8</xref>F). In addition, the mutant TGC nuclei contained smaller and fewer blue dots upon hematoxylin staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g008">Figure 8</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g008">8</xref>F), suggesting that the DNA content might be reduced. These abnormalities are likely caused by a deficiency in endopolyploidy. An important specialized process for TGC maturation is endoreduplication, whereby the genome is amplified without a complete mitosis. The endoreduplication cycle requires only the G and S phases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b029">29</xref>]. To examine the possibility of a defect in endoreduplication, we induced the TS cells to undergo TGC differentiation in vitro by removal of FGF4, heparin, and mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF)-conditioned medium (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> and [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b030">30</xref>]). Flow cytometric analysis of the differentiated cells stained with PI showed that the percentage of cells with higher DNA contents (&gt;4N) was drastically reduced in the SENP2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g008">Figure 8</xref>G). The average percentage of polyploid cells reduced from 25% (<italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) to 7% (<italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic>) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001, <italic>n</italic> = 5) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g008">Figure 8</xref>H). Therefore, the loss of SENP2 induced a severe deficiency in endopolyploidy. SENP2 apparently has a dual role in regulating the G–S transition of mitotic division and endoreduplication during TS cell proliferation and differentiation, respectively.</p>

        <title>Disruption of SENP2 Alters the p53–Mdm2 Circuit in Trophoblast Development</title>
        <p>The cell cycle defects led us to investigate potential downstream targets involved in trophoblast development. We specifically focused on those regulators shown to be conjugated by SUMO. Previous reports showed that SENP2 (also known as Axam) modulates the canonical Wnt pathway by interacting with its signaling molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b031">31</xref>]. Even though this led us to identify SENP2 through its binding to Axin initially, we failed to detect any alteration of Wnt signaling in the SENP2 mutants. Nor were we able to show other alternative pathways critical for placentation, e.g., MAPK and SAPK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b036">36</xref>], to be involved in the SENP2-dependent developmental processes. However, when p53 was examined by immunostaining, we detected an aberrant accumulation in the nuclei of the developing <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TGCs at E8.5–E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>D–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>F). In contrast, the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> TGCs showed no detectable, or very low if any, p53 at these stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>C). The results implied that there is a deficiency in p53 regulation caused by the SENP2 deletion. Degradation of p53 is mediated by ubiquitination-dependent proteolysis. Mdm2, a RING finger E3 ubiquitin ligase that binds to p53, has an essential role in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b040">40</xref>]. We therefore tested whether the loss of SENP2 had an effect on Mdm2. Immunostaining of Mdm2 revealed its localization in both the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cytoplasm and the nucleus during early stages (E8.5–E9.5) of TGC development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>G and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>H). However, Mdm2 was mainly located to the nuclei of the terminally differentiated TGCs at E10.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>I). The differential subcellular distribution of Mdm2 implies that it might be critical for development of TGCs. In contrast, Mdm2 accumulated in nuclei throughout TGC development in the absence of SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>J–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>L). The prominent cytoplasmic staining was lost in the mutants at E8.5–E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>J and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>K). Furthermore, the loss of SENP2 also affected Mdm2 localization in the stem cell niche sites, such as extraembryonic ectoderm and chorion. Mdm2 clearly accumulated in the nuclei of the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> trophoblast progenitors, but was evenly distributed in the whole cells of the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>M and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>N). Similar nuclear accumulations of Mdm2, affecting the p53 level, were also detected in the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> labyrinth and spongiotrophoblast layers (data not shown). Therefore, Mdm2 appeared to be aberrantly localized in the stem cell niches and all three major layers of trophoblast during early embryogenesis. The data suggest that SENP2 is required for proper localization of Mdm2 and degradation of p53. Disturbance of SUMO modification by the SENP2 deletion thus causes deregulation of the p53–Mdm2 pathway, leading to deficiencies in mitotic and endoreduplication cell cycle progression and abnormal trophoblast development.</p>

        <p>The accumulation of p53 in the nuclei of SENP2-null placentas implied that SENP2 negatively modulates the p53–Mdm2 circuit. To determine the role of p53–Mdm2 in trophoblast development, we investigated whether SENP2 modulates Mdm2 and p53 at the posttranscriptional level. In addition to altering the subcellular distribution of Mdm2, the loss of SENP2 had an effect on posttranslational modification of Mdm2. The loss of SENP2 disturbed desumoylation of Mdm2. In the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TS cells, Mdm2 accumulated in the SUMO conjugated state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>O). The loss of SENP2 disturbed the ratio of Mdm2 and Mdm2–SUMO. The sumoylated Mdm2 could also be detected by an anti-SUMO-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>O) as well as immunoprecipitation–immunoblot analysis using anti-Mdm2 and anti-SUMO-1 antibodies (data not shown). We encountered a technical problem in determining the actual amount of the sumoylated Mdm2 by immunoprecipitation–immunoblot analysis. This is likely because desumoylation occurs rapidly in isolated cell extracts whereas immunoprecipitation requires proteins in a native conformation. Therefore, a straight immunoblot assay appears to be better suited for quantitative measurements. To determine whether SUMO modification of Mdm2 is regulated by SENP2, a plasmid expressing a Myc-tagged SENP2 (MT–SENP2) under the control of a CMV promoter was transiently transfected into the mutants. The reintroduction of SENP2 altered the ratio of Mdm2 and Mdm2–SUMO and diminished the level of Mdm2–SUMO, suggesting that its desumoylation is modulated by SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>O). Immunoblot analysis also revealed an elevation of p53 caused by the SENP2 deletion in TS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>P). Although p53 is known to be sumoylated, we did not detect obvious accumulations of the SUMO-conjugated form caused by the SENP2 ablation. We then tested whether SENP2 is required to mediate the downregulation of p53 by overexpression of MT–SENP2. Consistent with our hypothesis, p53 levels were significantly reduced in the SENP2-null cells transiently transfected by MT–SENP2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>P).</p>
        <p>To further confirm that the loss of SENP2 was the primary cause of the trophoblast defects, we reintroduced MT–SENP2 into <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cells. To determine the differentiation process affected by SENP2 at a more quantitative level, we examined the expression of a TGC marker, p450scc, by immunoblot analysis. The expression of p450scc was drastically reduced in <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> placentas, confirming the TGC developmental defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>Q). The expression of p450scc was not detectable in <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> TS cells but was highly increased in the differentiated TGCs, suggesting the success of the in vitro culture system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>Q). We did not detect a great induction of p450scc in the differentiated <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cells, consistent with our in vivo findings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>Q). The reintroduction of MT–SENP2 in the SENP2 mutants led to an induction of p450scc upon TGC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>Q). The p450scc induction level did not reach that of the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> TGCs, most likely due to the transfection efficacy, in that not all of the mutants were transfected. Nevertheless, these data demonstrate that reintroducing SENP2 into the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TS cells can promote their differentiation into TGCs. This suggests that SENP2 inactivation is the cause of the trophoblast developmental defects observed in the mutants. An aberrant stimulation of p53 might be responsible for the SENP2-null defects in mitotic division and polyploidy.</p>
        <p>In the SENP2 mutants, the dislocation of Mdm2 implied that its distribution is regulated by the SUMO pathway. We therefore investigated whether Mdm2 localization is affected by SUMO. First, immunoblot analysis after cell fractionation showed that sumoylated Mdm2 is found preferentially in the nuclear fraction of <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>R). Next, we examined whether SUMO conjugation alters the subcellular distribution of Mdm2 in live cells. GFP analysis of TS cells transiently expressing GFP-tagged Mdm2 or Mdm2–SUMO-1, revealed their preferential localization. We found that Mdm2 mainly accumulated in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>S and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">9</xref>V), with occasional distribution to the whole cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>T). However, Mdm2–SUMO-1 displayed a clear nuclear accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>U), with either a punctated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>W) or a nucleolar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g009">Figure 9</xref>X) staining pattern. Similar results were also obtained by the use of Mdm2–SUMO-1<sup>GG96–97Δ</sup>, a mutant lacking the last two glycine residues of SUMO-1, which prevent further conjugation that might affect subcellular distribution (data not shown). Therefore, the SENP2 mediated SUMO modification of Mdm2 appears to be crucial for its subcellular trafficking.</p>

        <title>The Requirement for p53 in Mediating the Deficiencies of SENP2-Null Mutants</title>
        <p>To address the importance of p53 in mediating the SENP2-null phenotype, we tested whether p53 activation is necessary and sufficient to affect trophoblast proliferation and differentiation. We used both gain-of-function and loss-of-function analyses. Nutlin-3 is a potent small-molecule antagonist of Mdm2, which binds to the p53-binding pocket of Mdm2 and prevents its interaction, thereby stabilizing p53. We first determined that the Nutlin-3 treatment of the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> cells could elevate p53 in a dosage-dependent manner, but, most importantly, to reach the level detected in the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g010">Figure 10</xref>A). To examine whether the p53 elevation induced G1–S arrest, TS cells were treated with Nutlin-3. A cell cycle profiling assay showed that the Nutlin-3 treatment caused the wild-type TS cells to accumulate in G0–G1 phase, similar to the <italic>SENP2<sup>–/–</sup></italic> TS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g010">Figure 10</xref>C). Next, we examined whether the elevated level of p53 interfered with the differentiation process. In the <italic>SENP2<sup>+/+</sup></italic> TS cells induced for TGC differentiation, Nutlin-3 significantly reduced the expression of the TGC marker p450scc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g010">Figure 10</xref>E), and prevented TGC differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g010">Figure 10</xref>F–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g010">10</xref>K). The average number of TGC decreased significantly in the presence of Nutlin-3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g010">Figure 10</xref>L, <italic>p</italic> = 0.006, <italic>n</italic> = 4).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>This study demonstrates an essential role of SENP2 in trophoblast lineage development during placentation. All three major trophoblast layers were affected by SENP2 deficiency. Our data provide an important connection between SENP2 and the p53–Mdm2 pathway in trophoblast development. The loss of SENP2 caused a deficiency in the G–S transition, which is required for both the mitotic cell cycle (containing G1, S, G2, and M phases) and the endocycle (containing only the G and S phases) during trophoblast proliferation and differentiation, respectively. The cell cycle regulators p53 and Mdm2 appear to be critical for SENP2-dependent trophoblast mitosis and polyploidy. We propose that the SENP2–Mdm2–p53 pathway has a dual role in the G–S checkpoint of mitotic division and endoreduplication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g011">Figure 11</xref>A). Although high levels of p53 induce a G1 arrest, a low level may be necessary to go through the rest of mitosis, such as through the tetraploid checkpoint. Because of the omission of M phase in endoreduplication, repression of p53 is essential to produce polyploid cells. Our findings further suggest that SENP2-dependent SUMO modification controls the subcellular localization of Mdm2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060310-g011">Figure 11</xref>B). Sumoylated Mdm2, which preferentially accumulates in the nucleus, likely cannot modulate p53, whereas desumoylated Mdm2, which can move freely to the cytoplasm, is capable of p53 degradation.</p>

          <p>(A) Diagram illustrating the p53–Mdm2 circuit regulated by SENP2 in the trophoblast cell cycle. Stimulation of Mdm2 by SENP2 leads to degradation of p53. Cellular levels of p53 control the G–S transition that has a dual role in TGC development. The G–S phase is required for both mitotic division (cell cycle: G1, S, G2, and M) and endoreduplication (endocycle: G and S only) during expansion of trophoblast stem cells and maturation of trophoblasts, respectively. Although a low p53 level is essential for stem cell proliferation, inhibition of p53 is required upon differentiation.</p>

      <p>This study provides evidence to support an important function of p53, as a guardian of the genome to control polyploidy. An endoreduplication deficiency was previously observed in embryos lacking cyclin E proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b041">41</xref>]. In contrast to the SENP2-null deficiencies, the loss of cyclin E proteins did not affect TGC differentiation. It is conceivable that cyclin E, which functions in late G1 phase to promote S-phase entry, acts further downstream of the SENP2–Mdm2–p53 pathway. In the SENP2 mutants, we detected alterations of this regulatory pathway not only in the stem cell niche site, but also in the differentiated trophoblast layer. A recent report found that an increased number of TGCs were detected in the p53-null placentas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b042">42</xref>], further supporting our hypothesis. SENP2 might also be involved in a crucial step of p53-dependent aneuploidy, genome instability and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b043">43</xref>]. Polyploid cells have several different fates. They can arrest in the cell cycle mediated by the tetraploidy checkpoint, which then triggers apoptosis. However, the lack of p53 allows these cells, as they escape from the arrest to undergo multipolar mitosis, to become aneuploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b044">44</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b046">46</xref>]. The nature of trophoblast development provides a system to elucidate the regulatory mechanism underlying polyploidy. Because of the biochemical activity of SENP2, the SENP2-null model offers a unique opportunity to further investigate the modulation of the p53–Mdm2 circuit by SUMO in normal developmental programming of polyploidy. The knowledge obtained here might be applicable to malignant transformation processes associated with polyploidy.</p>
      <p>SENP2 is also known as Axam, which has been shown to modulate Wnt signaling by interacting with Axin, a scaffold protein involved in targeting β-catenin for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b017">17</xref>]. Although biochemical studies suggested that SENP2 could regulate the canonical Wnt pathway by SUMO modulation of a LEF/TCF transcription factor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b031">31</xref>], there was no in vivo evidence to support this idea. We failed to detect alterations in Wnt–β-catenin signaling in the SENP2 mutant placentas (SC and WH, unpublished data) although this might occur in other tissues. SUMO modification of Axin has been shown to modulate its effects on JNK signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b036">36</xref>]. Neither JNK, nor the related p38 and Erk1/2 factors that are important for placental function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b035">35</xref>], seem to be involved in the SENP2-mediated trophoblast development (SC and WH, unpublished data). However, we identified the p53–Mdm2 pathway as a downstream target of SENP2. Our data imply that SUMO modification mediated by SENP2 is required for proper localization and function of Mdm2, which in turn controls p53 stability during trophoblast development. Not only does stimulation of p53 induce phenotypic defects resembling those of the SENP2 inactivation, but downregulation of p53 alleviates the trophoblast deficiencies caused by SENP2 deficiency. It is conceivable that Wnt or JNK/SAPK signaling regulated by SENP2 is critical for another cell type and lineage development. The generation of mouse models permitting conditional inactivation of SENP2 will aid these studies and determine its essential role in other developmental processes.</p>
      <p>The loss of SENP2 disturbs the balance of SUMO modification. Although sumoylation of Mdm2 has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b047">47</xref>], it was not clear whether this modification dictates subcellular distribution. Our data provide evidence that cellular distribution of Mdm2 is regulated by the SUMO pathway. Disruption of SENP2, leading to an accumulation of Mdm2 in a hyper-sumoylated state, induces its mislocalization. Many sumoylated proteins, including PML, preferentially accumulate in specific complexes called PML nuclear bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b012">12</xref>]. Sumoylation of PML is essential not only for these nuclear bodies to form but also for other sumoylated proteins to concentrate there. Although the biological function of PML nuclear bodies remains largely elusive, subsequent recruitment of proteins can modulate transcription activity. It has been shown that sumoylation of PML directs p53 to nuclear bodies, leading to a stimulation of its transcriptional and pro-apoptotic activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b049">49</xref>]. These effects can be regulated by sumoylation of p53 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b051">51</xref>]. Because of technical limitations and, more importantly, SUMO regulation of a number of p53 regulators (Mdm2, MdmX, and PML), the functional consequences of sumoylation have been difficult to elucidate. As SUMO modification of PML and p53 is a key determinant for maintaining genome integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b012">12</xref>], our data imply that SENP2 might mediate this maintenance.</p>
      <p>Using a mouse model with disruption of SENP2, this study suggests a novel role of SUMO modification in cell cycle progression and induction of polyploidy. Sumoylation, which dictates Mdm2 trafficking, is crucial for modulation of the p53–Mdm2 circuit. Further studies focusing on the detailed mechanistic switch of the SENP2–Mdm2–p53 pathway and its implications in other developmental and pathogenic processes promise important insights into the role of SUMO modification in mammalian development and disease.</p>

Lysates were subject to PCR analysis. The <italic>SENP2</italic> wild-type allele was detected by a nested PCR assay. Primers 5′- ctgttttctactgcagtggacac-3′ and 5′-gctgcctggagtttatctactgtag-3′ were used for the first PCR reaction, performed with 35 cycles of amplification (94 °C for 30 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 2 min 30 s), followed by a 7-min extension at 72 °C. Subsequently, the first PCR products were subject to a second PCR reaction using the method described for genotyping the <italic>SENP2</italic> wild-type mouse strain. For genotyping the SENP2 mutant culture, the same method for the <italic>SENP2</italic> mutant mouse strain was used.</p>
        <p>To establish the TS cell lines [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b030">30</xref>], blastocysts were recovered in TS medium (RPMI-1640 medium containing 20% fetal bovine serum, 1 mM sodium pyruvate, 100 μM β-mercaptoethanol, 100 μg/ml penicillin–streptomycin), plus 25 ng/ml FGF4 and 1 ng/ml heparin. Briefly, each blastocyst was placed in a culture dish with mitomycin C-treated MEF feeders and cultured in a humidified 5% CO<sub>2</sub> incubator at 37 °C. The blastocysts were hatched and attached to the dishes in 24–36 h. After 48 h, a small outgrowth from a blastocyst was formed and cultured in TS medium containing 25 ng/ml FGF4 and 1 ng/ml heparin. After 72–96 h, the outgrowths were ready to be disaggregated by the addition of 0.25% trypsin/EDTA and incubation for 3 min at 37 °C. The disaggregated cells were continuously cultured in TS medium with the presence of FGF4 and heparin. The TS cell colonies began to appear after days 6 to 10, and continued to be cultured until they were about 50% confluent. After expanding the cultures on the feeders for one or two passages, MEF-free TS cells were obtained and maintained in media containing 70% MEF-conditioned medium, 30% TS medium, 37.5 ng/ml FGF4, and 1.5 ng/ml heparin. To differentiate TS cells into TGC, cells were cultured in TS medium with no additions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060310-b030">30</xref>]. For BrdU labeling of the cultured cells, 30 μg/ml BrdU (Sigma) was added in the media for 1 h. The labeled cells were then fixed with methanol/acetone (1:1), followed by immunostaining analysis. For cell cycle analysis by flow cytometry, 8 × 10<sup>5</sup> (for mitotic cell cycle) or 10<sup>5</sup> (for endoreduplication cycle) TS cells were cultured in 6 cm dishes in TS media plus FGF4, heparin, and MEF-conditioned medium (undifferentiated medium) for 2 d, and TS media only (differentiated medium) for 6 d, respectively. Cells were then harvested by trypsinization and fixed in 70% ethanol at 4 °C for at least 24 h. Cells were then treated with RNase (1 mg/ml) for 30 min, followed by PI staining (20 μg/ml) for 10 min at room temperature. Samples were analyzed by an Epics Elite ESP (Coulter Electronics) set to collect 10,000 events. The percentage of cells in G0–G1, S, G2–M or with polyploidy were determined using ModFit LT software. For synchronizing cells in M phase, 3 μM nocodazole was added to the media. Nuclear and cytoplasmic fractionations of TS cells were extracted using an NE-PER extraction kit according to the manufacturer's protocol (PIERCE).</p>

Samples were then incubated with buffer containing 0.2 M Tris-HCl (pH 8.0) and 0.1 M glycine for 10 min at room temp, followed by post-fixing with 4% paraformaldehyde in PBS buffer for 20 min and a 20-min wash in PBS buffer at room temperature. The sections were incubated in buffer containing 0.1 M triethanolamine (pH 8.0) for 10 min, followed by 0.25% (v/v) acetic anhydride in 0.1 M triethanolamine (pH 8.0) buffer for 10 min and by 2× SSC (1× SSC: 0.15 M sodium chloride and 15 mM sodium citrate, pH 5.5) buffer for 10 min. After dehydration through ethanol gradients and air drying for 2 h, sections were incubated with digoxygenin-labeled probes (1 μg/ml) in 5× SSC buffer containing 50% formamide, 50 μg/ml yeast tRNA and 1% SDS overnight at 70 °C. Samples were then washed three times with 5× SSC buffer for 15 min at 70 °C and 2× SSC buffer containing 50% formamide for 10 min at 45 °C before incubating with buffer containing 20 μg/ml RNase A, 5 U/ml RNase T1, 0.5 M sodium chloride, 10 mM Tris (pH 8.0) and 1 mM EDTA (pH 8.0) for 30 min at 37 °C. After washing with 2× SSC for 10 min at 37 °C and 0.1× SSC for 10 min at 45 °C, samples were incubated in MBST buffer containing 60 mM maleic acid, 0.15 M sodium chloride, and 0.1% Tween-20, pH 7.5 for 10 min and blocked with 10% goat serum in MBST for 2 h at room temperature. After incubating with anti-digoxygenin antibody (Roche) in the blocking buffer for overnight at 4 °C, sections were washed with NTMT buffer (100 mM sodium chloride, 100 mM Tris, pH 9.5, 50 mM magnesium chloride and 0.1 % Tween 20) and incubated in NTMT plus 2 mM levamisole overnight at 4 °C. To visualize the bound signals, samples were incubated with BM-purple (Roche) for 2 h to several days. The reaction was stopped by incubating in PBS buffer, followed by counterstaining with nuclear fast red.</p>

          <p>(A–C) The targeted locus contains an in-frame insertion of lacZ into the second exon of <italic>SENP2</italic> and a pgk-neo gene, flanked by loxP sites, for positive selection. Diphtheria toxin (DTA) was used for negative selection. The pgk-neo was removed by Cre-mediated recombination to generate the null allele as described in Materials and Methods. Southern (A) and PCR analyses (B,C) examined the targeted and null alleles. (A) Using a 5′ external probe, the EcoRV-digested wild-type (WT, 10.3 kb) and knock-in (KI, 7.9 kb) bands were detected in the targeted ES cells by Southern blotting. Mice carrying either the targeted (B) or the null (C) allele were analyzed by PCR for the WT and KI alleles and the neo and lacZ genes as indicated.</p>
          <p>(D) RT-PCR analyses detected the transcripts of <italic>SENP2</italic> and lacZ in the control (+/+) and homozygous (–/–) E10.5 embryos, respectively.</p>
