<article-title>Insulator Protein Helps Organize the Gaps in the Axon's Insulation</article-title>
</related-article>
<abstract>
<p>The pathogenesis of peripheral neuropathies in adults is linked to maintenance mechanisms that are not well understood. Here, we elucidate a novel critical maintenance mechanism for Schwann cell (SC)–axon interaction. Using mouse genetics, ablation of the transcriptional regulators histone deacetylases 1 and 2 (HDAC1/2) in adult SCs severely affected paranodal and nodal integrity and led to demyelination/remyelination. Expression levels of the HDAC1/2 target gene myelin protein zero (P0) were reduced by half, accompanied by altered localization and stability of neurofascin (NFasc)155, NFasc186, and loss of Caspr and septate-like junctions. We identify P0 as a novel binding partner of NFasc155 and NFasc186, both in vivo and by in vitro adhesion assay. Furthermore, we demonstrate that HDAC1/2-dependent P0 expression is crucial for the maintenance of paranodal/nodal integrity and axonal function through interaction of P0 with neurofascins. In addition, we show that the latter mechanism is impaired by some P0 mutations that lead to late onset Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Peripheral nerves consist mainly of axons and Schwann cells, which form myelin sheaths around axons. Peripheral neuropathies primarily affect axons, their myelin, or both. Etiologies are multiple: they can be inherited, autoimmune, infectious, metabolic (e.g., diabetes), or be due to tumors or toxic agents. However, the pathogenesis mechanisms of these disorders are not well understood. Here, we elucidate a novel critical mechanism in peripheral nerves for the stability of two adjacent structures of major importance for axonal function, the paranodes and nodes of Ranvier. We find that disruption of these structures causes a form of peripheral neuropathy. Ablation of the transcriptional regulators histone deacetylases (HDAC)1 and 2 in adult Schwann cells results in motor and sensory dysfunction, disruption of paranodal/nodal integrity, and loss of myelin. Expression of the HDAC1/2 target gene myelin protein zero (P0) was reduced by half, leading to altered localization of paranodal and nodal neurofascins, loss of paranodal Caspr, and impairment of axon–Schwann cell interaction in paranodal/nodal regions. We demonstrate that P0, the most abundant protein of peripheral compact myelin, extends to paranodes/nodes to maintain their stability by binding neurofascins. P0–neurofascins binding is affected by P0 mutations responsible for late onset forms of the inherited peripheral neuropathy Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease, identifying a pathogenesis mechanism of these disorders.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Myelinated axons are organized in distinct molecular domains, the axon initial segment, the internodes, juxtaparanodes, paranodes, and the node of Ranvier. This organization ensures proper clustering of ion channels, which is critical for the induction and fast propagation of electric signals along axons. In the peripheral nervous system (PNS), formation of these specialized domains requires the tight association of axons with Schwann cells (SCs), the myelinating glia of the PNS, except for the axon initial segment that forms independently of glial cells.</p>
<p>Disruption of these domains causes or aggravates many human disorders of the nervous system, including multiple sclerosis, motor and sensory neuropathies, Guillain-Barré syndrome, and most likely cognitive disorders [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>]. Thus, extensive research has been carried out to determine the identity and functions of the molecular components of these domains [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>]. However, our knowledge is incomplete and more work is required to fully understand the mechanisms that control their formation and preservation.</p>
<p>In this study, we elucidate the functions of histone deacetylases (HDACs) 1 and 2 and their target gene <italic>myelin protein zero</italic> (<italic>P0</italic>) in the maintenance of PNS integrity. By deacetylating histones at specific loci, HDACs locally modify the architecture of chromatin to control the transcription of their target genes [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. HDACs can also deacetylate transcription factors and thereby modulate their activity [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]. These enzymes are thus very powerful transcriptional regulators. We have previously shown that the two class I enzymes HDAC1 and HDAC2 are critical for the specification of peripheral glia [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and for postnatal development of SCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. HDAC1 and HDAC2 are highly homologous nuclear enzymes that have important functions in myelination and survival [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. Although they can have primary functions, they usually efficiently compensate for the loss of each other [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. We showed in previous studies that HDAC2 and, to a lesser extent, HDAC1, interact with the major transcription factor of SC differentiation Sox10 to activate Sox10 target genes, including Sox10 itself and the other major transcription factor regulating myelination Krox20, as well as P0 [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In addition, we found that HDAC1 maintains survival of early postnatal SCs by preventing precocious activation of beta-catenin [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>We show here that HDAC1/2 are not necessary to maintain Sox10 and Krox20 expression, nor SC survival in the adult PNS. Instead, HDAC1/2 are critical for the maintenance of paranodes and nodes of Ranvier integrity through their target gene <italic>P0</italic>. P0, the most abundant protein of PNS compact myelin, maintains the cohesion between two adjacent myelin wraps by homophilic adhesion properties [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. Unexpectedly, we identify a novel function of P0 that is not linked to myelin compaction. Indeed, we demonstrate that P0 belongs to both paranodal and nodal adhesion complexes, where it is essential for the maintenance of these domains in the adult PNS.</p>
<p>Many mutations in the <italic>P0</italic> gene lead to peripheral neuropathies classified as Charcot-Marie-Tooth disease (CMT), with either early onset during childhood or late onset in adults [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. In early-onset CMTs, demyelination and/or dysmyelination are prominent, whereas late-onset CMTs are usually characterized by altered axon–SC interaction and mild demyelination [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. We show here that at least three P0 mutants that lead to late-onset CMT display homophilic adhesion properties comparable to wild type P0, but are unable to interact with components of the paranodal and nodal complexes, resulting in disruption of these structures, while myelin stability is maintained.</p>

<title>HDAC1/2 Are Required in SCs for the Maintenance of Motor and Sensory Functions in Adult Mice</title>
<p>To determine whether HDAC1 and/or HDAC2 are required for the maintenance of peripheral nerves, we ablated HDAC1 and/or HDAC2 specifically in adult SCs. Mice expressing a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under the control of the <italic>P0</italic> promoter (P0CreERT2) [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>] were crossed with animals carrying floxed <italic>Hdac1</italic> and/or floxed <italic>Hdac2</italic> alleles (H1fl/fl and/or H2fl/fl) [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. Single heterozygous (P0CreERT2-H1fl/wt or-H2fl/wt, called thereafter H1HTZ and H2HTZ), single homozygous (P0CreERT2-H1fl/fl or-H2fl/fl, called thereafter H1KO and H2KO), and double homozygous (P0CreERT2-H1fl/fl-H2fl/fl, called thereafter dKO) mutants were generated. At three months of age, HDAC1 and/or HDAC2 were ablated in SCs by tamoxifen injections. At 8 wk post-tamoxifen, elongated nuclei (presumably SC nuclei) had lost HDAC1 (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1A</xref>) and/or HDAC2 (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1B</xref>) in dKO nerves. Consistent with previous studies using the same P0CreERT2 mouse line [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>], recombination efficiency was variable between animals: HDAC1/2 were ablated in 45% to 85% of SCs. To determine the onset of protein loss, we carried out western blot analyses on sciatic nerve lysates of control and dKO mice. HDAC1/2 protein levels were reduced already 7 d post-tamoxifen injection (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1C</xref>). While single HDAC mutants did not display obvious defects, dKO mice developed a strong maintenance phenotype of hindlimb weakness (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1D</xref>), which started at 6 wk post-tamoxifen and remained stable until at least 12 months. We carried out functional analyses at 8 wk post-tamoxifen and found that both motor and sensory functions were affected in dKO mice, as evidenced by reduced performance on the rotarod (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1E</xref>) and decreased sensitivity to heat in the hot plate test (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1F</xref>). In addition, gait analysis tests identified significantly reduced stride length (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1G</xref>) and base (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1H</xref>) in dKO mice compared to controls. These data demonstrate that HDAC1/2 are essential in SCs to maintain adult PNS function.</p>

<title>Loss of HDAC1/2 in Adult SCs Leads to Demyelination/Remyelination and Decreased P0 Expression</title>
<p>To identify the defects responsible for the loss of function due to ablation of HDAC1/2 in adult SCs, we carried out morphological analyses. We found that 7% of axons were either demyelinated or remyelinated (thin myelin) in dKO sciatic nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>), while axon diameters were unaffected (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1A Fig</xref>). Indeed, we measured a slight increase in the percentage of axons of middle range caliber, but no significant difference in axon diameter average (controls: 4.81 ± 0.54 μm and dKO: 4.23 ± 0.37 μm, <italic>p</italic>-value = 0.21). We also examined potential defects in single heterozygous and homozygous mutants, but found no defect in H1HTZ, H2HTZ or H1KO, and only 0.5% of demyelinated or remyelinated axons in H2KO (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>). This indicates that in adult SCs, such as in other systems [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>], HDAC1 and HDAC2 can efficiently compensate for the loss of each other. Indeed, HDAC2 levels were up-regulated in H1KO nerves compared to controls (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1B Fig</xref>), but HDAC1 levels were not up-regulated in H2KO nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1C Fig</xref>). This suggests that efficient compensation of HDAC1 function may require the up-regulation of HDAC2, while HDAC1 compensates HDAC2 function without up-regulation. However, the small but significant percentage of demyelinated/remyelinated axons in H2KO nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>) shows that compensation by HDAC1 is incomplete. Consistent with myelin breakdown, we detected increased presence of macrophages in dKO nerves by morphological analyses (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref>, labeled M) and immunofluorescence using the macrophage marker CD68 (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2B</xref>, arrows). We previously found that HDAC1/2 interact with the transcription factor Sox10 to induce the expression of P0 in SC precursors and postnatal SCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In postnatal SCs, we also showed that the Sox10/HDAC complex controls the expression of Sox10 itself and Krox20 [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Consistently, P0 expression was reduced at the transcript levels at 5 wk post-tamoxifen (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2C</xref>) before the influx of macrophages in the nerves and when no demyelinated/remyelinated axon was found (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). P0 was also reduced at the protein level at 5 wk (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>) and 8 wk post-tamoxifen (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2D</xref>) in dKO nerves, but remained unaffected in H1HTZ, H2HTZ, H1KO, and was slightly decreased in H2KO nerves at 8 wk post-tamoxifen (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2C Fig</xref>). However, myelin basic protein (MBP) levels were not significantly affected at 5 wk (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2D Fig</xref>) or 8 wk post-tamoxifen (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3A Fig</xref>). The transcription factors Sox10 and Krox20 were not affected either (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3B and S3C Fig</xref>), and myelin-associated glycoprotein (MAG) was slightly increased (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3D Fig</xref>). By immunofluorescence, we detected many cells that had lost P0 but expressed high levels of myelin basic protein (MBP) (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, white arrows) in dKO nerves at 8 wk post-tamoxifen, indicating that loss of P0 precedes the loss of MBP in demyelinated cells. A few SCs had only residual levels of both P0 and MBP (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, yellow arrowhead), and a few others expressed high levels of both P0 and MBP (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>, blue arrowheads). In early postnatal SCs, we previously showed that HDAC1/2 limit the levels of active beta-catenin (ABC) to prevent apoptosis. However, we did not find differences in ABC levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3E Fig</xref>) or apoptosis (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4A Fig</xref>) between dKO and control nerves. Proliferation of SCs, analyzed by BrdU incorporation at 5 wk post-tamoxifen, before the influx of macrophages, was also not affected (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4B Fig</xref>). Taken together, these data show that HDAC1/2 are necessary in adult SCs for the maintenance of high P0 expression and for optimal myelination but not for SC survival.</p>

<title>Loss of HDAC1/2 in Adult SCs Results in Disruption of Paranodal and Nodal Structures</title>
<p>To detect potential additional defects in HDAC1/2 mutants, we analyzed the molecular composition and the morphology of nodes of Ranvier and paranodes on cryosections of mutant sciatic nerves at 8 wk post-tamoxifen. Strikingly, the paranodal axonal protein Caspr was nearly lost in dKO sciatic nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>), while Caspr was unaffected in H1HTZ, H2HTZ, H1KO, and slightly affected in H2KO paranodes (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5A and S5C Fig</xref>). To detect the paranodal SC-localized neurofascin (NFasc)155 and the nodal axonal NFasc186, we used a pan-neurofascin antibody. In dKO nerves, NFasc155 protein levels were decreased (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), and in the majority of paranodes, NFasc155 localization appeared widened and its distribution diffused (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C–3E</xref>). Protein levels of Contactin, a third known component of the paranodal complex, localized on the axonal side, were not significantly affected compared to control nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), and Contactin was present in dKO paranodes (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B and 3E</xref>). Consistent with the loss of Caspr [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>], K<sub>v</sub>1.2 voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels were no longer restricted to juxtaparanodes, but had moved to paranodes in dKO nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C and 3E</xref>) and protein levels were significantly reduced (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S6A Fig</xref>). In addition, NFasc186 protein levels were also decreased (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>), and immunoreactivity was not detectable or weak in the node of Ranvier of dKO nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C–3E</xref>), while NFasc186 was unaffected in H1HTZ, H2HTZ, H1KO, and slightly affected in H2KO paranodes (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5B and S5C Fig</xref>).

We used NFasc staining in paranodes to quantify the frequency of normal, elongated, and abnormal (low intensity, asymmetric, irregular shape) structures.

<p>Septate-like junctions in paranodes are formed by the paranodal complex NFasc155/Caspr/Contactin. Each of these three proteins is necessary for the formation of septate-like junctions [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>] and thus for the fence function of paranodes to prevent voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels to invade paranodes. To analyze the morphology of paranodes in dKO nerves, we carried out electron microscopy on longitudinal ultrathin sections of control and dKO sciatic nerves at 8 wk post-tamoxifen. While we could detect septate-like junctions in the paranodes of control nerves, we could rarely detect them in dKO nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>), and in some cases microvilli were invading the space between paranodal loops and the axolemma (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>, region highlighted in blue). We quantified the percentage of paranodes with detached loops, which is a direct consequence of loss of septate-like junctions. We found 46 ± 3% of paranodes with detached loops in dKO nerves, whereas we did not detect paranodes with detached loops in control nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4A</xref>). In addition, nodes of Ranvier were significantly wider in dKO (1.35 ± 0.03 μm) compared to control (0.95 ± 0.01 μm) nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title>Exogenous P0 Maintains Myelination, Caspr, and Neurofascins in dKO DRG Cultures</title>
<p>To identify the molecular mechanisms by which HDAC1/2 control the maintenance of paranodal and nodal integrity, and optimal myelination, we carried out in vitro myelination assays using dorsal root ganglion (DRG) explants of dKO embryos and control littermates. We cultured DRG explants until they reached a myelination plateau, and then added tamoxifen to induce ablation of HDAC1/2. For these experiments, we generated HDAC1/2 dKO using a tamoxifen-inducible Cre recombinase under control of the <italic>PLP</italic> promoter (PLPCreERT2) [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], because efficiency of in vitro recombination was high with PLPCreERT2 (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8A Fig</xref>). These mutants are called <italic>plp</italic><bold>-</bold>dKO thereafter.</p>
<p>Ten days after tamoxifen addition, <italic>plp</italic><bold>-</bold>dKO DRG cultures had severely demyelinated, as shown by reduction of MBP fluorescence intensity (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>) and the presence of myelin debris (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8B Fig</xref>). Consistent with our in vivo data (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2E</xref>), most of the remaining MBP-expressing fibers in <italic>plp</italic><bold>-</bold>dKO DRG had lost P0 expression (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5C</xref>). In addition, while Caspr and neurofascins were robustly present in myelinated fibers of control DRG cultures, Caspr was either not or rarely detected in the remaining MBP-expressing fibers of <italic>plp</italic><bold>-</bold>dKO DRG cultures, and neurofascins were either not detectable or reduced compared to control cultures (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5D and 5E</xref>). P0 transcription is directly activated by the complex Sox10/HDAC1/2 [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>], and ablation of HDAC1/2 in adult SCs in vivo leads to a similar phenotype as for P0-null mice, i.e., motor and sensory loss of function, demyelination/remyelination, presence of macrophages, and loss of Caspr in sciatic nerves [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>]. In addition, we found that all paranodes/nodes in adult P0 homozygous knockout (P0 KO) and 77 ± 6% of paranodes/nodes in adult P0 heterozygous mutant (P0 HTZ) sciatic nerves exhibited diffused and widened NFasc155 in paranodes and loss of NFasc186 in nodes of Ranvier (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9A–S9C Fig</xref>). Thus, we hypothesized that P0 is the main HDAC1/2-dependent gene that is essential for maintenance of paranodes/nodes integrity and of optimal myelination in adult SCs. To test this hypothesis, we generated doxycycline-inducible lentiviruses expressing either untagged P0, P0 myc-tagged at the intracellular C-terminus (P0-myc), or green fluorescent protein (GFP) as a control. We transduced SCs with these lentiviruses at the start of DRG cultures and induced P0 expression only at the myelinated stage, just before ablating HDAC1/2 in SCs. P0 myc-tagged at the intracellular C-terminus is inserted into the membrane and functions comparable to wild type P0 [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. Indeed, both untagged P0 and P0-myc were able to prevent demyelination in <italic>plp</italic><bold>-</bold>dKO DRG cultures (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F and 5G</xref>). Both P0 and P0-myc also rescued Caspr and increased neurofascins in paranodes/nodes of <italic>plp</italic><bold>-</bold>dKO DRG cultures (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>, and <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). In summary, myelinating cultures using DRG explants of <italic>plp</italic><bold>-</bold>dKO embryos allowed us to mimic the in vivo phenotype resulting from loss of HDAC1/2 in adult SCs. We therefore used this system for rescue experiments and demonstrated that P0 is responsible for HDAC1/2-dependent maintenance of paranodes and nodes of Ranvier integrity, and for optimal myelination in adult SCs.</p>

<title>P0 Is a Component of Paranodal and Nodal Complexes in the Adult PNS</title>
<p>The rescue of Caspr and neurofascins by P0 in MBP-expressing fibers was intriguing and prompted us to seek the molecular mechanism of P0 function in the maintenance of paranodal and nodal structures.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we found that P0 localization was not restricted to internodes such as MBP, but extended further to the region between two internodes in DRG myelinating cultures (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11A Fig</xref>), suggesting the presence of P0 in paranodes and nodes of Ranvier. We confirmed the presence of P0 in paranodes and nodes of Ranvier in vivo by coimmunofluorescence of P0 with total NFasc, NFasc186, and Contactin on cryosections of adult mouse sciatic nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6A–6C</xref>) and adult human peripheral nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11B and S11C Fig</xref>) and 3-D reconstruction of immunofluorescence signals in mouse sciatic nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). In addition, by immunoelectron microscopy on adult mouse sciatic nerves, we detected P0 specifically localized in compact myelin as expected, and also in paranodal loops and microvilli (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6F</xref>).</p>

<p>NFasc155 is necessary for the maintenance of paranodes and is the only known transmembrane component of the paranodal complex that is expressed on the SC side [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. Because P0 was necessary for the maintenance of Caspr and neurofascins, and was localized in paranodes and microvilli, we hypothesized that P0 is another binding partner within the paranodal complex and of the nodal complex. To test this hypothesis, we generated Fc particles fused to the extracellular domain of P0 (P0-Fc, <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A and S12B Fig</xref>) and control Fc particles (neg-Fc, <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s012" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12A Fig</xref>) and carried out adhesion assays. The extracellular domain of P0 forms homotetramers connecting two myelin wraps [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], and as expected, P0-Fc bound to HEK293T cells expressing P0-myc at their cell surface, whereas neg-Fc particles did not (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7A</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s013" ref-type="supplementary-material">S13A Fig</xref>).

These data indicate that the extracellular domain of P0 is capable of interacting with the extracellular domain of NFasc155 and of NFasc186. We then tested by coimmunoprecipitation whether these interactions also occur in vivo. Indeed, NFasc155 and NFasc186 coimmunoprecipitated with P0 (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>) in adult control sciatic nerves, showing that P0 interacts with these two neurofascins in vivo, whereas coimmunoprecipitated NFasc levels were strongly reduced in dKO sciatic nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g007" ref-type="fig">Fig 7F</xref>). These data demonstrate that P0 belongs to the paranodal and nodal complexes in the adult PNS.</p>

<title>Three P0 Mutants Causing Late Onset CMT Maintain Homophilic Adhesion Properties, but Their Binding to Neurofascins Is Impaired</title>
<p>To investigate the functional relevance of P0 interaction with neurofascins further, we aimed at disrupting the P0/NFasc interaction without altering the homophilic adhesion properties of P0. If functionally relevant, P0/NFasc interaction is likely to be affected by some of the P0 mutations that are responsible for subtypes of the human disease, CMT.

<title>P0/NFasc Interaction Is Critical for the Integrity of Paranodal/Nodal Structures, but Not for the Stability of Myelin</title>
<p>We showed that exogenous P0 and P0-myc were able to prevent demyelination and disruption of nodes and paranodes due to HDAC1/2 ablation in SCs of myelinated DRG cultures (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g005" ref-type="fig">Fig 5F–5I</xref> and <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s010" ref-type="supplementary-material">S10 Fig</xref>). We then asked whether the loss of P0/NFasc interaction alters the ability of P0 to maintain the integrity of paranodal/nodal structures and the stability of myelin. To answer this question, we generated lentiviruses carrying myc-tagged H52Y, D32G, or S49L P0 mutants that exhibited three different NFasc binding profiles by adhesion assay (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8</xref>): impaired binding to both NFasc for H52Y, impaired binding to NFasc155 for D32G, preserved binding to both NFasc for S49L. All generated mutants reached the plasma membrane of differentiated primary rat SCs (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S15 Fig</xref>).

<p>These data are consistent with the binding profiles of P0 mutants to neurofascins: preserved for S49L, impaired for H52Y and partially impaired for D32G. They are also consistent with the absence of demyelination (or mild demyelination) phenotype in late onset CMT caused by D32G and H52Y mutations, and with the strong demyelination phenotype caused by S49L P0 mutation in early or late onset CMT.</p>
<p>In addition to demonstrating the necessity of P0/NFasc interaction for the maintenance of paranodal/nodal integrity independent of myelin stability, these data identify the impairment of P0 binding to one or both neurofascins as a likely contributing pathogenesis mechanism of late onset CMT, caused by at least the three P0 mutants D6Y, D32G, and H52Y tested in this study. We thus demonstrate the functional relevance of P0 interaction with neurofascins and the critical dependence of the adult PNS upon this mechanism for maintenance of integrity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We previously showed that HDAC1/2 direct neural crest cells into the glial lineage [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] and are necessary for SC survival and to induce the transcriptional program of myelination during development [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. In contrast, we show here that HDAC1/2 are not required in adult SCs for expression of inducers of myelination or survival. However, we found that HDAC1/2 are essential in adult SCs to maintain the integrity of the PNS through their target gene <italic>P0</italic>. We demonstrate that P0 is a novel component of paranodal and nodal adhesion complexes and is critical to preserve the structure of these domains in adult peripheral nerves.</p>
<p>Ablation of HDAC1/2 in adult SCs resulted in partial motor and sensory loss of function with moderate demyelination/remyelination. Consistently, MBP was lost in only a few fibers. However, P0 was reduced in most fibers, suggesting that loss of P0 precedes the loss of MBP in these mutants. In addition, these data indicate that low levels of P0 are sufficient to maintain at least temporary stability of the myelin sheath in adult SCs. This is consistent with the phenotype observed in heterozygous P0 deficient mice and in a subset of patients suffering from late onset CMT due to P0 mutations [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In addition, we found widened and diffused localization and decreased levels of NFasc155 and severe loss of Caspr in paranodes of HDAC1/2 dKO nerves, while the presence of NFasc186 in nodes of Ranvier was strongly reduced. Consistent with the loss of Caspr [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], paranodal loops were detached from the axolemma, as a consequence of disrupted septate-like junctions. Kv1.2 K<sup>+</sup> channels were mislocalized to paranodes, and nodes of Ranvier were wider in these mutants. Interestingly, Contactin levels were not significantly affected in dKO nerves. This contrasts with the reported developmental functions of Caspr [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and NFasc155 [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>], where deletion of Caspr or NFasc155 leads to loss of Contactin in paranodes. It thus appears that Caspr and NFasc155 are essential for initial clustering but not for maintenance of Contactin in paranodes of adult nerves.</p>
<p>Unexpectedly, we found a strong decrease of NFasc186 in nodes of HDAC1/2 dKO nerves, while Nav1.6 Na<sup>+</sup> channels, Gliomedin, and Ankyrin G were maintained. During development, loss of NFasc186 leads to failure of Nav channels clustering at the node [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. However, Amor and colleagues [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>] show that absence of Gliomedin and NrCAM leads to loss of NFasc186, while Nav channels are maintained, as long as Ankyrin G is still present at the node. This is consistent with our present findings. In addition, the maintenance of Gliomedin in dKO nodes indicates that in the absence of NFasc186, other components of the node that interact with Gliomedin, such as NrCam [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>] and/or ECM proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>], are able to stabilize Gliomedin localization.</p>
<p>We previously found in the SC lineage that HDAC1/2 have the peculiar ability to activate transcription of specific target genes when bound to the transcription factor Sox10 [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Indeed, Sox10 requires HDAC1/2 as cofactors to activate the <italic>P0</italic> promoter in SCs and P0 expression is barely detectable in developing HDAC1/2-null SCs [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. P0-deficient mice show demyelination/remyelination [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], decreased Caspr in paranodes, mislocalization of voltage-gated K<sup>+</sup> channels [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>], and alteration of neurofascins localization (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s009" ref-type="supplementary-material">S9 Fig</xref>), similar to the ablation of HDAC1/2 in adult SCs. Thus, we hypothesized that demyelination and disruption of paranodes and nodes of Ranvier in adult HDAC1/2 dKO mice are due to the loss of P0. Myelinated DRG cultures from HDAC1/2 <italic>plp</italic>-dKO embryos, treated with tamoxifen to induce the ablation of HDAC1/2, mimicked the loss of P0, Caspr, and neurofascins in MBP-expressing fibers and the demyelination phenotype of adult HDAC1/2 dKO mice. P0 exogenously delivered by inducible lentiviruses just prior to HDAC1/2 ablation maintained paranodal/nodal localization of Caspr and neurofascins, and prevented demyelination in these cultures. This demonstrates that HDAC1/2-dependent P0 expression in SCs is essential to maintain the integrity of paranodes and nodes of Ranvier, and optimal myelination in the adult PNS.</p>
<p>Caspr and Contactin expressed at the axolemma and NFasc155 expressed at the paranodal glial loops form the paranodal complex and are essential for the formation of septate-like junctions [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. It was thought that MBP and P0 are exclusively localized to compact myelin in internodes; however, our analyses revealed that while MBP localization is indeed restricted to internodes, P0 is also localized in paranodes and nodes of Ranvier. We show here that the maintenance of paranodes and nodes of Ranvier structure requires the interaction of P0 with NFasc155 and NFasc186. The decrease of NFasc155 and NFasc186 total protein levels (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>) is significant in dKO compared to control nerves, but moderate, and the levels of NFasc155 transcripts are unchanged in dKO compared to control sciatic nerves (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.s018" ref-type="supplementary-material">S18 Fig</xref>). Thus, by interacting with NFasc, P0 may stabilize the localization of NFasc in paranodes and nodes of Ranvier. Although different pools of P0 may interact with either NFasc155 or NFasc186, our findings open the possibility of interaction between paranodal and nodal complexes through P0 as a physical linker at the interface of these complexes. This hypothesis is supported by our 3-D reconstructions in which no gap was detected between axonal and glial neurofascins (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g006" ref-type="fig">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>).</p>
<p>Further strengthening the functional relevance of P0 interaction with neurofascins, we demonstrate that this interaction is impaired by the three P0 mutations D6Y, D32G, and H52Y [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>,<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>–<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>], which are responsible for late onset forms of the human disease, CMT. Interestingly, homophilic adhesion among P0 proteins is not affected by these three mutations. Consistently, these P0 mutants prevent demyelination but are unable to maintain neurofascins and Caspr in paranodes and nodes of HDAC1/2 <italic>plp</italic>-dKO DRG myelinated cultures. In contrast, S49L P0 mutation that leads to either early or late onset CMT with strong demyelination, is able to bind both NFasc and to maintain high levels of NFasc and Caspr in HDAC1/2 <italic>plp</italic>-dKO DRG cultures, but it is unable to prevent demyelination. In addition to unraveling a new function of P0 in maintaining the integrity of paranodes/nodes of Ranvier independently of its function in maintaining myelin stability, these data identify a previously undescribed molecular mechanism that leads to pathological consequences in some disease-causing P0 mutants and suggest that other P0 mutants leading to late onset CMT may also act through the same or related pathogenesis mechanism. Consistent with our findings, detailed morphological analysis of a sural nerve biopsy from a patient harboring a D32G P0 mutation shows frequent abnormal structure in the paranodal region [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>].</p>
<p>NFasc155 and NFasc186 are generated by alternative splicing of the same gene and differ by only a few amino acids: their extracellular part consists of six immunoglobulin (Ig)-like domains, four fibronectin type 3 (FNIII)-like domains (1st, 2nd, and 4th are common to both NFasc, while NFasc155 has the 3rd and NFasc186 the 5th FNIII-like domain), and in addition, NFasc186 possesses a mucin-like domain [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. It is therefore not surprising that P0 binds both NFasc by adhesion assay. We have identified two amino acids (D6 and H52) in the Ig-like domain of P0 that are required for interaction of P0 with both NFasc and one amino acid (D32) required for binding of P0 to NFasc155, but not to NFasc186 (<xref rid="pbio.1002258.g008" ref-type="fig">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). This suggests that P0 can bind to NFasc155 and NFasc186 through common, but also distinct, domains. However, whether P0 binds to both axonal and glial NFasc in vivo through the same domains remains to be determined. It is conceivable that the folding and/or flexibility of NFasc186 or NFasc155 extracellular domain in vivo allows binding to P0 through the same domains. However, our coimmunoprecipitation data of NFasc with P0 in adult mouse sciatic nerves hint towards that binding of P0 to NFasc186 is stronger than to NFasc155, indicating that P0 may interact with both NFasc through at least partially distinct domains in vivo. In addition, such as P0, NFasc are subject to post-translational modifications including glycosylation of their extracellular domain, which can potentially modify their interaction with extracellular binding partners.</p>
<p>Among the three amino acids D6, D32, and H52 we found required for the binding of P0 to one or both NFasc, D6 is not predicted by the crystal structure of P0 extracellular domain [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>] to be directly involved in P0 homophilic adhesion, but H52 is predicted to belong to the putative adhesion interface, and D32 to the head-to-head interface of P0 proteins [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>]. However, according to our data obtained by in vitro myelination and/or adhesion assay, the three amino acids D6, D32, and H52 do not appear essential for the maintenance of P0 homophilic adhesion properties. This is consistent with the late onset phenotype and mild demyelination resulting from the mutation of these residues in humans [<xref rid="pbio.1002258.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Thus, despite the putative involvement of H52 and D32 in P0 homophilic adhesion, the mutation of D32 in G (Asp32 in Gly) or H52 in Y (His52 in Tyr) may not be sufficient to dramatically alter P0–P0 interaction.</p>
<p>In summary, our study shows essential functions of HDAC1/2-dependent P0 expression in the maintenance of paranodal and nodal structures and of optimal myelination in the adult PNS. We demonstrate that P0 is a critical component of the paranodal and nodal adhesion complexes (our findings are summarized in <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s019" ref-type="supplementary-material">S19 Fig</xref>), and we identify a novel function of P0 that is independent of the maintenance of myelin stability. This critical function of P0 in the adult PNS is impaired by at least three P0 mutations that lead to late onset CMT, while myelination is mostly preserved, thus uncovering a novel pathogenesis mechanism of these P0 mutations.</p>

<p>Eight weeks post-tamoxifen injections, mice were placed five times on the rotarod apparatus to test balance and motor coordination (day 1). The duration of each trial was limited to 300 s, and trials were separated by a 30 min recovery period. Latency to fall from the rotating beam was recorded. On day 2, mice were individually placed on a hot plate (52°C), and the latency for the appearance of paw licking as a sign of unpleasant heat was recorded. On day 3, footprints were recorded to analyze gait abnormalities. Mice were first trained to swiftly walk through a narrow runway (1 m in length) to a goal box. After inking their hind paws with nontoxic paint, paw prints left on the white paper lining the floor were analyzed (three runs). Parameters were stride length (distance between consecutive prints of the same paw) and base (distance between hind paw prints). All behavioral tests were carried out with the same experimental animals (six dKO and six control littermate mice, three females and three males per group). Animals of control and dKO groups had similar body length and weight.</p>

Forty-eight hours after transfection, cells were incubated with P0-Fc, P0-D6Y-Fc, P0-D32G-Fc, P0-H52Y-Fc, P0-S49L-Fc, or neg-Fc in 1% Ultra-low IgG FBS/DMEM for 1 h at 37°C, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>/95% air. Cells were then washed three times with PBS and incubated for 1 h at RT with Alexa Fluor 488-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Human IgG (1:500 in PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch), or Cy3-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Human IgG (1:500 in PBS, Jackson ImmunoResearch) for HEK293T cells expressing Contactin-GFP. Cells were washed again three times with PBS and fixed with 4% PFA for 15 min at RT. After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated overnight at 4°C in PBS containing primary antibodies against either total Neurofascins (Rabbit, 1:200), Caspr (Mouse, 1:100), Contactin (Goat, 1:40) or P0 (Chicken, 1:200), or in PBS/0.3% Triton X-100 containing primary antibody against Myc (Mouse, 1:200). After three washes with PBS, cells were incubated for 1 h at RT with Cy5-Affinipure Goat Anti-Rabbit IgG or Alexa Fluor® 647-AffiniPure Goat Anti-Mouse IgG (1:500, Jackson ImmunoResearch) diluted in PBS or PBS/0.3% Triton X-100 for Myc staining.

<p>Graph showing mRNA levels of NFasc155 (primer pair 1) and NFasc (presumably also NFasc155, primer pair 2) normalized to GAPDH and measured by real-time qPCR with two different primer pairs in dKO compared to control (= 100%) sciatic nerves at 5 wk post-tamoxifen, before the influx of macrophages, but when P0 protein levels were already reduced (see <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>) and the localization of NFasc at the nodes/paranodes was already significantly affected (see <xref rid="pbio.1002258.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S7 Fig</xref>) in dKO sciatic nerves. Sciatic nerves of three dKO and three control littermate animals were used, and no significant difference was detected.</p>

<title>Summary of HDAC1/2-dependent P0 functions in adult PNS paranodes/nodes.</title>
<p>P0 interacts with NFasc155 in paranodes and with NFasc186 in nodes of Ranvier. The dashed circle around NFasc155, P0, and NFasc186 indicates the hypothetical simultaneous interaction of P0 with both NFasc155 and NFasc186. Ablation of HDAC1/2 in adult SCs leads to loss of P0, which results in 1) mislocalization and decrease of NFasc155 levels, loss of Caspr and septate-like junctions, and mislocalization of Kv1.2 in paranodes, and 2) loss of NFasc186 in nodes of Ranvier. Dystroglycan, NrCam, pERM (not represented in the drawing), and Contactin remain in paranodes of dKO nerves.</p>
