      <abstract>
        <p>Bacteria sense and respond to their environment through signaling cascades generally referred to as two-component signaling networks. These networks comprise histidine kinases and their cognate response regulators. Histidine kinases have a number of biochemical activities: ATP binding, autophosphorylation, the ability to act as a phosphodonor for their response regulators, and in many cases the ability to catalyze the hydrolytic dephosphorylation of their response regulator. Here, we explore the functional role of “split kinases” where the ATP binding and phosphotransfer activities of a conventional histidine kinase are split onto two distinct proteins that form a complex. We find that this unusual configuration can enable ultrasensitivity and bistability in the signal-response relationship of the resulting system. These dynamics are displayed under a wide parameter range but only when specific biochemical requirements are met. We experimentally show that one of these requirements, namely segregation of the phosphatase activity predominantly onto the free form of one of the proteins making up the split kinase, is met in Rhodobacter sphaeroides. These findings indicate split kinases as a bacterial alternative for enabling ultrasensitivity and bistability in signaling networks. Genomic analyses reveal that up 1.7% of all identified histidine kinases have the potential to be split and bifunctional.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Two-component signaling systems mediate many of the physiological responses of bacteria. In their core, these systems consist of a histidine kinase (HK) and a response regulator (RR) that it can phosphotransfer to. Around this core interaction, evolution has led to several conserved biochemical and structural features. In order to achieve a broad and predictive understanding of bacterial signaling, it is important to assess whether these features enable specific signaling dynamics and properties. Our study provides a potential functional role for one such feature, the split histidine kinases, where autophosphorylation and phosphotransfer activities of a conventional HK are segregated onto distinct proteins capable of complex formation. We show that that this unusual configuration can enable ultrasensitivity and bistability in signal transduction under specific biochemical conditions. We experimentally show that one of these requirements, namely segregation of the phosphatase activity predominantly onto the free form of one of the proteins making up the split kinase, is met in proteins isolated from <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic>. Genomic studies suggest 1.7% of all histidine kinases could function as bifunctional split kinases. This study provides a linkage between these proteins and response dynamics, thereby enabling experimentally testable hypotheses in these systems.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Bacterial responses to many external stimuli are underpinned by two-component signaling networks (TCSNs). These are found in most bacterial species and are also present in Archaea, eukaryotic microbes, and plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Wuichet1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Hamer1">[2]</xref>. TCSNs are built upon the core reactions involving a histidine kinase (HK) that autophosphorylates on a conserved histidine residue in response to a signal, and a cognate response regulator (RR) that is activated when the HK phosphorylates one of its conserved aspartate residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Stock1">[3]</xref>. Evolutionary processes seem to have exploited the modular structure of these proteins to produce a distinct set of biochemical features and network structures that reoccur in diverse TCSNs; bifunctional HKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Batchelor1">[4]</xref>, sink RRs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Sourjik1">[5]</xref>, phosphorelays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Hoch1">[6]</xref> and split HKs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter1">[7]</xref>. In order to achieve a broad and predictive understanding of bacterial signaling, it is important to assess whether these features enable specific signaling dynamics and properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Soyer1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>There has already been progress towards this goal. Firstly, bifunctional HKs, which display both phosphatase and kinase activity towards their cognate RR, enable robustness in system output with respect to fluctuations in the amount of these signaling proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Batchelor1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Shinar1">[9]</xref> and reduce cross-talk among different TCSNs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Alves1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Groban1">[11]</xref>. Further, theoretical work indicates that bi-functional HKs can generate flexible signal-response relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Igoshin1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Tiwari1">[13]</xref> and allow higher signal amplification compared to monofunctional HKs that lack phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Alves1">[10]</xref>. Secondly, sink RRs, which compete with another RR for phosphoryl groups from a single cognate HK, are suggested to allow faster response termination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Sourjik1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-JimnezPearson1">[14]</xref>. Finally, phosphorelays, which contain several proteins (or domains) acting as a relay between the HK and RR, are suggested to integrate several signals received on their different layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Bischofs1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Appleby1">[17]</xref> and implement both ultrasensitive and linear responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Kim1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-CsikszNagy1">[19]</xref>. Taken together, these studies suggest that specific biochemical and structural features in TCSNs could enable specific functional roles.</p>
      <p>Of the different features of TCSNs, split kinases are predicted in several bacterial genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Wuichet1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Hamer1">[2]</xref> and are biochemically characterized in <italic>Rhodobacter sphaeroides</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter2">[20]</xref>. In this organism, the split kinase system is composed of CheA3 and CheA4, which form a bipartite histidine kinase that phosphorylates the response regulator CheY6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g001">Figure 1</xref>). CheA4 lacks the phosphorylatable P1 domain, whereas CheA3 lacks the dimerization (P3) and catalytic kinase (P4) domains. Neither CheA3 nor CheA4 can autophosphorylate when incubated separately with ATP; however, when a mixture of CheA3 and CheA4 is incubated with ATP, then CheA3 becomes phosphorylated, indicating that these proteins can act as a histidine kinase only by forming a complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref>. Activated by incoming signals, the P4 domain of CheA4 binds ATP and phosphorylates the P1 domain of CheA3. Subsequently, CheA3-P acts as a phosphodonor for its cognate response regulator, CheY6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref>, which controls flagellar rotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter4">[22]</xref>. In vivo, CheA3 and CheA4 co-localize to the cytoplasmic chemotaxis cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Wadhams1">[23]</xref> and are both essential for chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter5">[24]</xref>. CheA3 and CheA4 bind to the cytoplasmic cluster via their P5 domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Scott1">[25]</xref>. Whilst part of this cluster, CheA3 and CheA4 dynamically interact with one another. To allow phosphorylation of CheA3, the P4 domain of CheA4 must transiently bind to the P1 domain of CheA3 (in the subsequent analysis we refer to this complex as CheA3:CheA4). Once phosphorylated, the P1 domain of CheA3 is released by CheA4, and CheA3-P can then donate its phosphoryl group to the corresponding response regulator CheY6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Bell1">[26]</xref>. In addition to its phosphotransfer function, CheA3 is also a phosphatase towards CheY6-P <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter1">[7]</xref>. <italic>cheA3</italic> mutants retaining phosphotransfer functions but lacking phosphatase activity do not support chemotaxis, similarly, <italic>cheA3</italic> mutants retaining phosphatase activity but lacking phosphotransfer activity also fail to support chemotaxis, indicating that chemotaxis requires both activities of CheA3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref>. In addition, to being phosphorylated and dephosphorylated by the split kinase comprising CheA3 and CheA4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref>, CheY6 is also phosphorylated by CheA2 at the polar chemotaxis cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter6">[27]</xref>.</p>

      <p>Despite this wealth of information, the general role of split kinases in bacterial signaling is not clear. In essence split kinases are unusual bifunctional HKs, where the autophosphorylation and subsequent phosphotransfer and phosphatase activities are encoded on two separate proteins. Since the complex formed by these proteins is functionally equivalent to a bifunctional HK, it is not clear what the role of splitting biochemical activities in this way might be. Using the biochemical reactions of CheA3, CheA4, and CheY6 as a model system, we developed a mathematical model and analyzed the response dynamics mediated by this split kinase. Repeating this analysis with a bifunctional HK and a conventional HK-RR pair featuring a separate phosphatase, we found that in contrast to these configurations, split kinases enable ultrasensitivity and bistability in the signal-response relationship. We show that these dynamical features are maintained under a wide parameter range, provided certain biochemical assumptions are met. These requirements indicate that the source of ultrasensitivity and bistability in split kinases is the inverse coupling between their kinase and phosphatase activities; i.e. the kinase activity cannot be increased without reducing the phosphatase activity and vice versa. Through measurements of phosphatase activity, we show that this condition is met in the <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> system <italic>in vitro</italic>. These findings suggest that bacteria might be utilizing split kinases as a means of implementing ultrasensitivity and bistability in cellular decision making.</p>

        <title>Construction of a mathematical model of a split kinase</title>
        <p>Since our aim is to study the general response dynamics that split kinases can mediate, we use the CheA3, CheA4, and CheY6 triplet as a model system and study its dynamics in isolation through <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments, numerical simulation and analytical approaches.

We then analyzed the response dynamics of the resulting model and its variants both through numerical simulations and deriving analytical solutions of steady state behavior using approximations and the chemical network theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Craciun1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Shinar2">[29]</xref> (see<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"> <italic>Methods</italic></xref> and <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s013">Text S1</xref></italic>).

        <title>The input-output relationship for the split kinase shows ultrasensitivity and bistability</title>
        <p>A primary property of interest for any signal transduction system is the signal-response relationship it implements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Tyson1">[30]</xref>. To analyze the signal-response relationship in systems featuring a split kinase, we defined the system response as the steady state level of phosphorylated CheY6 (CheY6-P) at a given signal level, and derived this relationship for different parameters and biochemical assumptions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). This analysis revealed that when assuming free CheA3 as the sole phosphatase for CheY6-P, the system has a high potential for displaying ultrasensitivity and bistability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2</xref> and Figures S1, S2, S3). Both of these dynamics result in a switch-like behavior; the response of the system is low until signal levels increase above a certain threshold, after which the response increases disproportionately to reach a high level (e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In the case of bistability, the low and high response levels correspond to stable states of the system, separated by an unstable region, resulting in abrupt switching dynamics and hysteresis (i.e. the switching threshold is different depending on the past state of the system).</p>

        <p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> measured kinetic rates and protein concentrations from <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> constitute “biologically meaningful” values that could be representative for two-component systems in general. To analyze the potential effects of these rates on the observed nonlinearity of the signal-response relationship, we have performed a sensitivity analysis by varying the base parameter values over a large range and quantifying the shape of the resulting signal-response curve (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). This analysis shows that the level of ultrasensitivity in the signal-response relationship is most sensitive to the parameters controlling the complex formation between CheA3:CheA4 (<italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>) and the dephosphorylation of phosphorylated CheY6 (<italic>k<sub>9</sub></italic> and <italic>k<sub>11</sub></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2</xref> and Figures S1, S2, S3). The association rate constant (<italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>/<italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic>) we used in the basic model is approximately 500-fold higher than that measured <italic>in vitro</italic>, using purified <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref>. We still consider this high value “biologically relevant” as <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions can result in confining of split kinase components to small regions of the cell, resulting in much higher effective concentrations than are attainable under the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions as used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter3">[21]</xref>. For example, in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, CheA3 and CheA4 localize to the cytoplasmic chemoreceptor cluster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Wadhams1">[23]</xref>, which - using immunogold electron microscopy - is estimated to occupy less than 5% of the cross-sectional area of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Harrison1">[31]</xref>. Assuming a spherical shape for both the cell and this cluster, the volume of the latter could be estimated to be approximately 1% of the total cell volume. Thus, the effective concentrations of CheA3 and CheA4 in this cluster could be increased by as much as 100-fold, resulting in a significantly higher effective association rate constant than measured <italic>in vitro</italic> (up to 10,000 fold).</p>
        <p>Besides parameter values, several modeling choices could also alter the finding of bistability and ultrasensitivity arising in a split kinase system. In particular, the basic model presented above assumes that free CheA3 is the sole phosphatase in the system (besides the intrinsic autodephosphorylation activity of CheY6-P). Relaxing this assumption and considering increasing phosphatase activity by the CheA3:CheA4 and CheA3:CheA4:ATP complexes (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s013">Text S1</xref>, section 1</italic>), significantly reduced ultrasensitivity in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s004">S4</xref>). In contrast, the presence of ultrasensitivity was much more robust to increasing phosphatase activity by CheA3p (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s005">S5</xref>). Another mechanistic choice in the modeling of the split kinase system is the fate of the CheA3:CheA4 complex after phosphorylation of CheA3. In the basic model analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2</xref>, this is modeled as phosphorylation resulting in the dissociation of the complex and release of CheA4 and CheA3-P. An alternative would be that the CheA3:CheA4 complex remains intact post phosphorylation, resulting in a CheA3-P:CheA4 complex (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s013">Text S1</xref>, section 2</italic>). When we assume the presence of CheA3-P:CheA4 complex that can phosphotransfer to CheY6, bistability was lost, but not ultrasensitivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Finally, we found that including an additional (monofunctional, non-split) kinase in the model, as seen for example in <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic> CheA2 (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s013">Text S1</xref>, section 3</italic>), does not affect the ultrasensitivity but can result in the loss of bistability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the basic model and all of these variants arising from specific modeling choices are “nested” in the sense that the basic model can be recovered through appropriate choice of parameters (e.g. setting dephosphorylation activity of CheA3p very low). In line with this observation, we find that the basic model and all of the alternative structures discussed so far can be analytically shown to possess the “ability” to attain bistability (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4"><italic>Methods</italic></xref>). More particularly, each of the chemical reaction systems arising from these models have the capacity for multiple steady states according to the higher deficiency theorem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Feinberg1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Shinar2">[29]</xref>; i.e. these chemical systems permit bistability for some set of non-zero parameter values and under the assumption of mass action kinetics (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s014">Text S2</xref></italic>).</p>

        <title>Segregation of kinase and phosphatase activities allows ultrasensitivity and bistability</title>
        <p>Taken together, these analyses suggest that the ability of a split kinase to mediate ultrasensitivity and bistability relates to the segregation of kinase and phosphatase activities. To better understand how this relates to ultrasensitivity and bistability, we simulated the time evolution of the system in the presence of step signals. As expected from the ultrasensitive signal-response relationship, system response (i.e. increase in free CheY6-P) was low for step-signals below the threshold and displayed a sudden large jump for step-signals crossing the threshold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Before the threshold, increasing signal levels resulted in an increase in the CheA3:CheY6-P complex, while the crossing of the threshold and subsequent increases in signal caused it to decrease. The reason for this behavior is that before the threshold there is enough free CheA3 in the system to bind and dephosphorylate the CheY6-P that is formed, while after crossing of the threshold there is no free CheA3 left in the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g003">Figure 3</xref>). These observations can be understood if we consider the cyclic nature of the reactions in this system as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g001">Figure 1</xref>. The free CheA3 can be seen as a branching point in the system, with one branch leading to binding to CheA4 and ultimately to more CheY6 phosphorylation (phosphorylation branch), while the other leading to binding to CheY6-P and subsequent dephosphorylation (dephosphorylation branch). While the phosphorylation branch is regulated externally of the system by signals sensed by the cytoplasmic cluster (i.e. through altering <italic>k3</italic> and/or <italic>k5</italic>), the dephosphorylation branch is controlled internally by the covalent modification of CheY6. This results in a dynamical motif that is similar to that seen in metabolic branching points and that can embed ultrasensitivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-LaPorte1">[33]</xref>. The split kinase system can embed a high level of nonlinearity as it contains both an inverse coupling of the two branches themselves (via CheY6) and their regulation (via CheA3). At low signals, these two branches allow enough free CheA3 in the system so to result in equally fast phosphorylation and dephosphorylation of CheY6. As the signal increases, however, the rate of the phosphorylation branch increases, while at the same time shutting down the dephosphorylation branch. In other words, the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation branches are coupled inversely, such that the kinase activity cannot be increased without reducing the phosphatase activity and vice versa. These dynamics can be observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g003">Figure 3</xref>; the loss of free CheA3 in the system coincides with an abrupt increase in CheA3-P and CheY6-P, while the CheA3:CheA4 complex maintains a fast turnover. This dynamical picture also explains the parameter effects observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2</xref> (and Figures S1, S2, S3, S4). For example, the decrease in ultrasensitivity from the reduction of CheA3-CheA4 association rate constant (<italic>k1</italic>) can be explained by a slowing down of the phosphorylation branch. Similarly, the decrease in ultrasensitivity from the inclusion of additional phosphatase activity via species other than free CheA3 can be explained by its perturbing effects on the inverse coupling between the phosphorylation and dephosphorylation branches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s005">S5</xref>). It must also be noted that the total level of CheA4 in the cell allows additional (internal) control on the dynamics of the system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s003">Figure S3</xref>), through its effects on the phosphorylation branch.</p>

        <p>To further test whether the inverse coupling of kinase and phosphatase activities through free CheA3 is the underpinning mechanism of ultrasensitivity, we considered dynamics in two alternative models where such coupling is missing; (i) a bifunctional HK that is not split, and (ii) a traditional HK that is neither bifunctional nor split, with a dedicated auxiliary phosphatase for the phosphorylated RR. An analytical treatment of the dynamics arising in the former scenario suggests that non-split bifunctional HKs (where the phosphorylated/non-phosphorylated HK acts as kinase/phosphatase on its cognate response regulator) gives rise to hyperbolic signal-response relationships and provides the system with robustness towards variations in component concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Shinar1">[9]</xref>. For the latter scenario (e.g. CheA-CheY-CheZ system found in the <italic>E. coli</italic> chemotaxis system) we developed a simplified model and solved it for the steady state levels of phosphorylated response regulator. We compared this analytical solution to that derived from a simplified model of a split kinase system (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s013">Text S1</xref>, section 4</italic>). This analytical treatment shows that the latter displays a higher level of nonlinearity for the steady state expression of phosphorylated RR. More importantly, we find that of the three possible alternative structures - bifunctional and split, monofunctional and split, bifunctional and non-split - only the chemical reaction system arising from the bifunctional and split kinase have the capacity for multiple steady states according to the higher deficiency theorem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Feinberg1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Shinar2">[29]</xref> (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s015">Text S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s018">6</xref></italic> for detailed results). Taken together, these analytical findings show that for bistable and ultrasensitive dynamics to be realized in a split kinase system, <italic>both</italic> bifunctionality of the HK and the splitting of these two functionalities (i.e. kinase and phosphatase activity) are needed.</p>

        <title>Experimental verification that free CheA3 is a better phosphatase than CheA3:CheA4</title>
        <p>As shown above, the ability of the split kinase to achieve both segregation and inverse coupling of kinase and phosphatase activities requires that free CheA3 is the predominant phosphatase with other CheA3 containing species (in particular CheA3:CheA4 and CheA3:CheA4:ATP) showing much lower phosphatase activity. Testing this requirement, or directly the level of ultrasensitivity <italic>in vivo</italic>, is complicated both by the presence of additional components in the system and our lack of knowledge of the signal identity in split kinase systems studied to date. As an alternative, and to achieve an approximate test of our theoretical understanding of split kinase response dynamics, we performed <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of CheY6-P dephosphorylation in the presence of CheA3 and CheA4. In these experiments we used a purified phosphorylated P1 domain of CheA3 (CheA3P1-P) as the sole phosphodonor in the environment. As CheA3P1-P is known to lack phosphatase activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter1">[7]</xref>, this setup allows us to test directly the phosphatase activity of free CheA3 and the CheA3:CheA4 complex. If kinase and phosphatase activities are segregated into the complexed and free CheA3 respectively, these measurements should reveal a decrease of phosphatase activity with increasing CheA4 concentration, as this would sequester free CheA3 into the CheA3:CheA4 complex. In contrast, such an effect would be absent if the CheA3:CheA4 complex possessed the same level of phosphatase activity as free CheA3. We found evidence for such a decrease, with increasing CheA4 concentrations reducing the rate of CheA3 mediated dephosphorylation of CheY6-P (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g004">Figure 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s008">Figure S8</xref>). To rule out the possibility of any interference from free CheA4, we have also confirmed the lack of dephosphorylation activity by CheA4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). This observation qualitatively matches predictions from a specific model of this <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental setup where we assumed phosphatase activity to be restricted to only free CheA3 (see <italic><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002949.s013">Text S1</xref></italic> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g004">Figure 4</xref>). These experimental findings strongly suggest that the CheA3:CheA4 complex has much lower phosphatase activity than free CheA3.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Two component signaling systems mediate many of the physiological responses of bacteria and display several conserved biochemical and structural features. Here, we analyzed how one such feature, the split kinase, affects response dynamics. Our theoretical treatment proved that the chemical reaction system arising from a bifunctional split kinase gives rise to the possibility of bistability, whereas systems arising from bifunctional, non-split and monofunctional, split kinases lack such capability (unless featuring dead-end complex formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Igoshin1">[12]</xref>). Sampling the parameter space around kinetic rates and protein concentrations measured in (or estimated from) <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, we found that a split kinase system set in a “biologically relevant” parameter regime has potential for an ultrasensitive and bistable signal-response relationship. These nonlinear dynamics arise from the bifunctional and split nature of the kinase, which introduce a branching point into the system between phosphorylation and dephosphorylation reactions. Thus, the level of ultrasensitivity (and emergence of bistability) in the system is determined by the parameters and the biochemical mechanisms found in the reaction cycles linked to this branching point.</p>
      <p>We found that the one crucial biochemical aspect enabling ultrasensitivity and bistability in the split kinase system is the predominant allocation of phosphatase activity to the free protein (rather than any of the complexes in the system). Using <italic>in vitro</italic> phosphotransfer assays in the CheA3-CheA4-CheY6 split kinase system isolated from <italic>R. sphaeroides</italic>, we found support for free CheA3 being the principal phosphatase in that system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g004">Figure 4</xref>). It remains to be shown whether this system enables ultrasensitivity or bistability <italic>in vivo</italic>. The theoretical findings of this study suggest that the switch-like dynamics resulting from ultrasensitivity and bistability could be relevant in the physiological context of the CheA3-CheA4-CheY6 system, which is involved in the integration of cytoplasmic and extracellular signals for proper chemotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Tindall1">[34]</xref>. It would be plausible for example, if the switching dynamics described here allowed cells to override external chemotaxis signals in favor of internal signals such as those related to metabolism, which could contribute to motility decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Goldstein1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Soyer2">[37]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002949-g002">Figure 2</xref>, several internal parameters of the system, including the total expression level of CheA4, allow control of the dynamics mediated through CheA3:CheA4 and might enable further tuning of such decision making mechanisms.</p>
      <p>While our results highlight split kinases as a potential strategy for implementing ultrasensitivity in bacterial two-component systems, it is not the only one. Previous theoretical studies have found that ultrasensitivity can be achieved in phosphorelays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Kim1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-CsikszNagy1">[19]</xref>, in classical HK-RR systems embedding specific spatial dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-vanAlbada1">[38]</xref> and in systems with bifunctional HKs, where unphosphorylated HKs and RR form a dead-end complex that is incapable of HK autophosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Igoshin1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Salvado1">[39]</xref>. These findings suggest that there are several diverse structural, spatial and dynamics that are possible in bacterial two-component systems and that have the potential to enable nonlinear response dynamics. Our theoretical findings extend this list with split kinase systems. Further, we provide experimental support for a condition that increases their potential for generating ultrasensitivity and bistability. Such responses are known to be common in eukaryotes and can enable decision making at the cellular level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Goldbeter1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Kholodenko1">[42]</xref>. Thus, it is perhaps not surprising that bacterial signaling systems harbor mechanisms to enable similar levels of ultrasensitivity.</p>
      <p>Although rare, split kinases are found in several other bacteria. A recent study looking at CheAs identified 11 split CheAs (2.3%) versus 470 complete CheAs (97.7%) in fully sequenced non-redundant genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Wuichet1">[1]</xref>. In addition to these split CheAs, there is the potential for other HKs to be split where the HisKA (dimerization and histidine phosphotransfer) and the catalytic HATPase (histidine kinase ATPase) domains are found on separate proteins. <italic>In vitro</italic> studies of the osmosensing histidine kinase, EnvZ, have shown that it possible to split the HATPase and HisKA domains onto separate polypeptides whilst retaining their activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Park1">[43]</xref>. Interrogation of the SMART database reveals that out of the 42417 proteins containing HisKA domains (dimerization and histidine phosphotransferase), 1556 (3.66%) lack a HATPase (histidine kinase ATPase) domain (expect value&lt;0.01), and of these, 711 (1.7%) have the phosphatase sequence motif (HE/DxxN/T) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Huynh1">[44]</xref> and could therefore be split bi-functional kinases. The results presented here suggest that cells may use such split kinases to allow high sensitivity and bistability enabling switch-like physiological responses to environmental stimuli.</p>
      <p>As the highly modular TCSNs are used by bacteria to control many of their physiological responses, it will be valuable to explore other mechanisms which can enable specific response dynamics in these systems and to determine the evolutionary drivers that were responsible for their emergence. This would increase our ability to better understand microbial signaling and exploit it in synthetic biology applications.</p>

The final reaction volumes were 2 ml. For production of CheA3P1-<sup>32</sup>P, reaction mixtures contained 300 µM CheA3P1 and 20 µM CheA4. Reactions were initiated by addition of 2 mM [γ-<sup>32</sup>P] ATP (specific activity 14.8 GBq mmol<sup>−1</sup>; PerkinElmer). After 1 hour incubation, samples were purified by using Ni-NTA columns (Qiagen) as described previously for unphosphorylated His-tagged CheA3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002949-Porter7">[47]</xref>.
