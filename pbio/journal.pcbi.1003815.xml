<abstract>
<p>Groupwise functional analysis of gene variants is becoming standard in next-generation sequencing studies. As the function of many genes is unknown and their classification to pathways is scant, functional associations between genes are often inferred from large-scale omics data. Such data types—including protein–protein interactions and gene co-expression networks—are used to examine the interrelations of the implicated genes. Statistical significance is assessed by comparing the interconnectedness of the mutated genes with that of random gene sets. However, interconnectedness can be affected by confounding bias, potentially resulting in false positive findings. We show that genes implicated through <italic>de novo</italic> sequence variants are biased in their coding-sequence length and longer genes tend to cluster together, which leads to exaggerated p-values in functional studies; we present here an integrative method that addresses these bias. To discern molecular pathways relevant to complex disease, we have inferred functional associations between human genes from diverse data types and assessed them with a novel phenotype-based method. Examining the functional association between <italic>de novo</italic> gene variants, we control for the heretofore unexplored confounding bias in coding-sequence length. We test different data types and networks and find that the disease-associated genes cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. We present a tool of superior power to identify functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias and demonstrate the suitability of this method to functionally cluster variant genes underlying polygenic disorders.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Plenty of gene variants have been associated with a disease, yet most of the heritability, along with the molecular basis, of common diseases remains unexplained. However, it is widely thought that the products of genes whose mutations are implicated in the same disease function together in the same biological pathways and it is the disruption of these pathways that underlies the disease. Such pathways are not well defined and their identification could help elucidate disease mechanisms. Consequently, groupwise functional analyses of gene variants to identify common disease-relevant pathways are becoming standard in next-generation sequencing studies, but we find that these analyses are confounded by coding-sequence length bias. We control for these bias and describe a phenotype-based approach which outperforms other methods in discerning functional associations among the disease-associated genes. We also demonstrate the suitability of this method to functionally dissect the gene variants underlying a complex disorder, the identified functional clusters offering insight into disease mechanisms.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is widely postulated that the products of genes whose variants are implicated in the same disease participate in the same biological function or process whose disruption leads to the disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Brunner1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Vockley1">[2]</xref>. This concept is supported by examples of complex disease in which the proteins encoded by the implicated genes interact, form a molecular complex or function at different steps of the same biochemical pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Oti1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Rossin1">[4]</xref>. As there is limited power to associate rare variants with disease by case–control studies, the use of functional-enrichment approaches that identify a shared function in a set of mutated genes is becoming standard in the interpretation of variants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Webber1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Sanders1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Since the function of many genes is not known and their classification to pathways is scant, functional associations between genes are often inferred from large-scale omics data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Rossin1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-ORoak1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Gulsuner1">[9]</xref>. However, the suitability of such data types, including protein–protein interactions and gene co-expression networks, for functional-enrichment analysis remains unclear. Moreover, the inferred functional associations can be affected by confounding factors, potentially resulting in false positive findings. Thus, it is important to identify any bias affecting the implicated genes and control for them. Multiple exome-sequencing studies currently test variants for functional enrichment and yet there is no consensus concerning what to control for <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-ORoak1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Gulsuner1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we have inferred functional associations between human genes from diverse data types and assessed the phenotypic agreement of the inferred gene–gene associations. We have examined different data types and networks and found that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks. Examining the functional association between <italic>de novo</italic> gene variants, we have identified a confounding bias in coding-sequence length that we control for. We present a tool that identifies functional associations among genes mutated in the same disease even after accounting for significant sequencing study bias and demonstrate the power of this tool to functionally subcluster the gene variants underlying a polygenic disorder.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To test for functional associations among gene variants, we derived functional links between genes from diverse data types. For example, we calculated correlation coefficients from expression profiles, whereas gene annotation data were processed in the form of semantic similarity, which is a measure of relatedness between two genes assessed by the similarity of their annotations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Pesquita1">[10]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The data were likely to include noise leading to false links and their reliability was unknown. To estimate and take into account the accuracy of the links, we evaluated the individual data types with a novel, phenotype-based method, by examining the semantic similarity between the mouse phenotypes of the genes they related to each other (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). That is, each data type in turn indicated gene–gene linkages (gene pairs) and the accuracy of these links was assessed by considering the similarity of the phenotypes arising from the disruption of the unique mouse orthologs of these genes. We expected the data types to link together genes whose knockouts give rise to the same phenotypes, even if these mouse phenotypes were not necessarily expected to resemble human symptoms. The similarity of mouse phenotype annotations correlated with the similarity of human disease phenotypes (ρ = 0.223, P&lt;2×10<sup>−16</sup>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s001">Figure S1</xref>) and mouse phenotypes have been assigned to 6169 unique orthologs of human genes, 3.4-fold more than the 1801 genes annotated by the Human Phenotype Ontology (HPO; downloaded in 2012) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Robinson1">[11]</xref>. Consequently, we used the phenotype annotations from the Mouse Genome Database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Eppig1">[12]</xref> as the benchmark against which to evaluate other data types and set aside the HPO annotations for use as a test set for validation.</p>

<p>Integration of different data types into a combined network is expected to improve the accuracy of links and thus, in addition to considering individual data types, we also built an integrated gene network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Lee1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Franke1">[14]</xref>. For this, we selected data types that consistently linked together genes associated with similar mouse knockout phenotypes and that produced a positive correlation with the semantic similarity of mouse phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s012">Table S1</xref>). For each data source suggesting functional links, we fitted regression curves in order to re-score the links so that any data-specific scores characterising the gene pairs were replaced with the semantic similarity that they corresponded to according to a regression function (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). When multiple data sources suggested functional linkage between the same two genes, we summed their link weights according to the approach of Marcotte and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Lee2">[15]</xref>, thereby down-weighting less reliable data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref>). The resulting integrated gene network outperforms networks derived from the individual data types both in terms of coverage and accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>We corroborated the integrated phenotypic-linkage network by showing that genes whose perturbations are implicated in the same disease tend to be closely interlinked (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s002">Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s006">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s007">S7</xref>). It is possible that their tendency to be closely interconnected is due to shared functional annotations assigned to them because they were implicated in the same disease in the literature. Also, we cannot assume that the associations of genes to phenotypes – forming the test sets – were made independently of any data type. Consequently, we turned to recently reported <italic>de novo</italic> mutations associated with developmental disorders that were identified independently of the data types included in the network.</p>
<p>Genes with <italic>de novo</italic> substitutions in patients with the same disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-ORoak1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Gulsuner1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-deLigt1">[16]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Allen1">[18]</xref> showed a tendency to be more interconnected in the gene networks than random gene sets of the same size. However, as the interconnectedness of genes can be affected by confounding factors, it is important to identify any bias affecting the studied genes and control for them during the randomizations. We have found that the genes implicated through <italic>de novo</italic> sequence variants are biased in their coding-sequence (CDS) length, as longer genes are more likely to be mutated by chance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We also observe that genes with longer CDS tend to be interconnected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) and thus controlling for CDS length during the randomizations can significantly affect their relative degree of clustering (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To control for coding-sequence (CDS) length during the randomizations, we have selected random genes the CDS length of which matched the CDS length of the studied candidate genes. Node degree has been previously identified as a confounding factor in functional analyses, particularly where an increase in degree results from study bias <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Gillis1">[19]</xref>. However, controlling for node degrees in a gene network does not correct the CDS length bias (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). CDS length correlates very weakly with node degree (Spearman's ρ = 0.050). The length bias are highly significant in all the studied gene sets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g002">Figure 2</xref>), while the node degrees are significantly different only in some of the candidate gene sets and there is no correlation between the node degree and mutational burden of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Having examined different data types and networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Lee2">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-WardeFarley1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Szklarczyk1">[21]</xref>, we find that the disease-associated genes cluster more significantly in the integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have inferred functional-association networks of human genes from diverse data types and assessed the phenotypic agreement of the inferred links. Having examined different data types and networks, we have found that genes mutated in the same disease cluster more significantly in an integrated phenotypic-linkage network than in other gene networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We note that another gene network, called NETBAG, has been developed by Gilman and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Gilman1">[22]</xref>. We could not access NETBAG for the performance comparison. Nevertheless, Gilman and colleagues state the use of shared disease associations among 478 human genes as the gold standard in their network construction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Gilman1">[22]</xref> and the used disease associations originate from a study published in 2001 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-JimenezSanchez1">[23]</xref>. By comparison, our method takes advantage of over 100,000 mammalian genotype–phenotype relations and fully exploits bio-ontologies by means of semantic similarity, with both advances expected to enhance greatly the phenotypic-linkage network that we explicitly present here.</p>
<p>Examining the functional association between <italic>de novo</italic> gene variants, we have identified a confounding bias in coding-sequence length that we control for to avoid false positive findings. Numerous implicated variants are in fact expected to be neutral mutations but they are more likely to appear in genes with longer CDS, leading to a tendency of the implicated genes to be interconnected in gene networks (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g002">Figure 2</xref>). These bias have confounded functional analyses and likely led to an overestimation of functional clustering in former studies. We have found that the CDS-length bias were highly significant in all the studied gene sets, including the unaffected siblings, while the node degrees were not. The higher node degrees in some of the candidate gene sets may indicate a functional signal, as the same genes are significantly more conserved (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s008">Figure S8</xref>). We conclude that controlling for CDS length in functional analyses of gene variants is appropriate.</p>
<p>One way of controlling for CDS length is to compare the interconnectedness of the implicated genes with that of genes mutated in unaffected controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Gulsuner1">[9]</xref>. However, we observe that the control genes tend to be less interconnected than random genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s009">Figure S9</xref>), which suggests that our way of controlling for CDS length (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s5">Methods</xref>) is more conservative.</p>
<p>The nature of the phenotypic-linkage network suggests that the clustered genes function together in the same disease-relevant cellular pathways (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s010">Figure S10</xref>). The functional convergence that we identify among the three sets of genes from independent exome studies of autism spectrum disorder demonstrates that the method is able to detect biological coherence among variant genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s010">S10</xref>). Throughout, we have considered the larger class of non-synonymous variants which is likely to possess a more diluted signal than nonsense variants. As with all clustering methods, our method is sensitive to the number of variants identified and the likelihood of their causal relation. Half of our study sets included only 5–10 genes with nonsense variants, between which we either did not find any functional links or the sum of link weights was not significantly higher than expected after controlling for CDS length. For studies of rare or <italic>de novo</italic> variants derived from a single or small number of genomes, gene prioritizing methods based upon phenotypic similarity may be more appropriate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Robinson2">[24]</xref>. Continuing efforts to systematically phenotype model organisms and to enrich the phenotype ontologies could further improve the resulting phenotypic-linkage networks that are constructed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Brown1">[25]</xref>.

<title>Inference of functional associations between genes from diverse data types</title>
<p>To gain the most information about genes whose variants may be relevant to disease and to explore the functional relations between them, we collected large amounts of functional genomics data on human genes and their mouse orthologs. We wanted the data sets to inform us about the functional similarity of genes, therefore we processed them such that they indicated gene–gene links. For every data type except physical interactions, we derived a score characterising gene pairs, such as the correlation coefficient from expression profiles or semantic similarity from gene annotations.</p>

<title>Evaluation of data sets</title>
<p>To estimate the reliability of the individual data sets, we evaluated them by examining the semantic similarity between the phenotypes associated with the unique mouse orthologs of the genes they linked to each other. For each data set, we derived gene–gene linkages (gene pairs) with data-specific scores characterizing the strength of a linkage and ordered the gene pairs by their score from largest to smallest. Next, we calculated and plotted the median semantic similarity of mouse phenotype annotations for bins of 1,000 gene pairs (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>We tested if the data types linked together genes whose knockouts influence the same phenotypes. When the strongest linkages derived from a data set did not correspond to higher semantic similarities of phenotypes than expected by chance, we did not include the links from the given set in the integrated gene network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s013">Table S2</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s5e">
<title>Re-scoring and integration of data</title>
<p>We selected data sets that produced a positive correlation with the semantic similarity of mouse phenotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s012">Table S1</xref>) and fitted regression curves in order to re-score the links so that any data-specific scores characterising the gene pairs were replaced with the semantic similarity of phenotypes that they corresponded to according to a linear regression function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003815-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Thus all gene pairs that had an original data-specific score were re-scored, including those that did not have phenotypic annotations.</p>
<p>By re-scoring the data types with a universal benchmark we weighted them in proportion of their relative accuracy. When multiple data sources suggested functional linkage between the same two genes, we summed their link weights (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003815.s011">Figure S11</xref>) increasingly down-weighting less reliable data according to a formula used by Marcotte and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003815-Lee2">[15]</xref>:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003815.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003815.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>L</italic> represents a re-scored link weight from a single data set, <italic>L</italic><sub>0</sub> being the largest link weight among all the links between the given two genes, <italic>i</italic> is the index of the remaining links ordered by their weights for the gene pair and <italic>D</italic> is a free parameter. We optimized the value of this parameter and used <italic>D</italic> = 5 in integrating data types to create the final phenotypic-linkage network.</p>

<title>Controlling for coding-sequence length</title>
<p>In testing for functional enrichment in a set of genes, the degree of functional association between the genes can be compared to that calculated for randomized gene sets. As the degree of functional association can be affected by confounding bias, it is important to identify such bias affecting the studied gene set and control for them. To control for coding-sequence (CDS) length during the randomizations, we selected random genes the CDS length of which matched the CDS length of the studied (mutated) genes. For each of the studied genes in turn we assigned a list of 100 genes with the same or most similar CDS length, using the longest CDS of each gene. Random gene sets were then assembled by selecting one random gene from each of these lists.</p>
