        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs) remain dormant in the bone marrow until needed to replenish the hematopoietic system, at which point they are stimulated to proliferate extensively, undergoing both regeneration (self-renewal) and differentiation. Self-renewal is key to maintaining an adequate HSC reserve, and return to dormancy after such stimulation is critical, yet still poorly understood. In this study, we report that CD81, a transmembrane organizing protein, is a novel regulator involved in HSC self-renewal. Transplanting HSCs into mice that are lethally irradiated to remove their native HSCs stimulates the transplanted HSCs to proliferate to replenish the hematopoietic system, allowing us to examine whether and how HSCs return to quiescence. HSCs lacking CD81 take longer to return to quiescence after such stimulation, resulting in reduced stem cell function. Conversely, forced CD81 membrane clustering, using an antibody, promotes early return of proliferating stem cells to quiescence and nuclear localization of FoxO1a, a key protein that mediates the cell cycle arrest. CD81 clustering also constrains Akt activity, which orchestrates multiple pathways such as cell proliferation and responses to reactive oxygen species. Treatment of <italic>Cd81</italic>-deficient HSCs with an Akt inhibitor, perifosine, which bypasses the requirement for CD81 in this process, rescues the delay defect of <italic>Cd81</italic>-deficient HSCs. Together, our data demonstrate that CD81 is critical to maintaining the functional integrity of HSCs during regeneration, and it is acting through Akt to influence its downstream pathways that govern cell cycle progression.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Hematopoietic stem cells (HSCs), which represent around 1/10<sup>4</sup> to 1/10<sup>5</sup> bone marrow cells, can proliferate to replenish the hematopoietic system after its exposure to environmental stresses such as infection, ablative chemotherapy, or irradiation. The stem cell compartment is maintained by self-renewal, in which HSCs generate daughter cells that retain stem cell function after cell divisions. The delicate balance maintained between differentiation and self-renewal necessitates a constellation of intrinsic and extrinsic regulatory mechanisms that are still not well understood. The vast majority of HSCs possess a dormant phenotype (G0 phase of the cell cycle) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Wilson1">[1]</xref> and slow cycling kinetics (prolonged G1 phase) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Nygren1">[2]</xref>, enforced by regulatory mechanisms that inhibit cell cycle progression from a quiescent stage to active proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Orford1">[3]</xref>. In the face of proliferative stimuli, however, these controls are overridden to allow the stem cells to perform their regenerative functions, posing an intriguing question: how do the self-renewing HSCs re-enter a quiescent state? Although extrinsic signaling from cytokines has been proposed to facilitate HSC quiescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Cheng1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Nie1">[6]</xref>, the mechanisms that intrinsically dictate cell cycle exit in HSCs remain largely undefined.</p>
      <p>We previously identified several cohorts of genes that are preferentially expressed in HSCs during proliferative and quiescent states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Venezia1">[7]</xref>, and are thus candidates for playing a role in regulation of self-renewal. The gene encoding CD81 (also called Tapa-1), a cell surface transmembrane protein that belongs to the tetraspanin family, emerged from that study as one of the most consistently upregulated molecules in HSCs exposed to proliferative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Venezia1">[7]</xref>. This protein is found in a variety of tissues and has been shown to regulate cell migration, adhesion, and fusion, as well as proliferation and pathogen entry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Yunta1">[8]</xref>. It is widely expressed in the murine hematopoietic system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Chambers1">[9]</xref>, where its roles include cell-cell interaction, lymphocyte activation, and leukocyte adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Levy1">[10]</xref>. This functional versatility and the upregulated expression pattern of <italic>Cd81</italic> in proliferating HSCs led us to hypothesize that this tetraspanin molecule has a specific function in HSC fate determination, particularly during active stem cell regeneration and proliferation.</p>
      <p>Serial competitive transplantations provide extreme proliferative stress for HSCs, in which the functional integrity of HSCs has to be delicately maintained and tightly controlled such that an imbalance of cell cycle progression (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Orford1">[3]</xref>) or uncontrollable level of reactive oxygen species (ROS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Ito1">[11]</xref> compromise the ability of HSCs to regenerate. Akt/Pkb, a serine/threonine kinase, is found to be a key regulator in maintaining HSC integrity. Constitutive activation of Akt in HSCs leads to HSC hyperproliferation and loss of HSC engraftment in primary competitive transplantation (the first round of transplantation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Kharas1">[12]</xref>, a similar phenotype to that of HSCs lacking Pten, a negative regulator in the Akt pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Zhang1">[13]</xref>. HSCs lacking both <italic>Akt1</italic> and <italic>Akt2</italic> show an engraftment defect in the third competitive transplantation (a third round of transplantation using donor-derived HSCs or bone marrow) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Juntilla1">[14]</xref>. Interestingly, loss of molecules downstream of Akt, such as Atm, FoxOs, and p21, results in similar phenotypes. <italic>Atm</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs failed to engraft long-term in competitive transplantation assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Ito2">[15]</xref>. HSCs lacking FoxO3a show a significantly decreased engraftment in the secondary competitive transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Miyamoto1">[16]</xref>, while <italic>Foxo1/3/4</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs present a much more severe engraftment defect such that they fail to engraft in the primary transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Tothova1">[17]</xref>. In addition, HSCs lacking <italic>p21<sup>Cip1/Waf1</sup></italic>, a cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor downstream of Akt, exhaust at the 4<sup>th</sup> transplantation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Cheng2">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Here we show, by using <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs in competitive transplantation assays and monoclonal antibody treatment to induce CD81 clustering on the HSC membrane, that CD81 paces the return of proliferating HSC to a quiescent state. We also demonstrate that CD81 mediates this effect by downregulating the activation state of Akt and subsequently promoting FoxO1a translocation into the nucleus, where it induces cell cycle suppression. Moreover, with the treatment of perifosine, an Akt inhibitor, the engraftment defect of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs is corrected, indicating that CD81 is involved in maintaining HSC function integrity through Akt pathways. In addition, we show here the expression of p19, a downstream CDK inhibitor of FoxO proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Katayama1">[19]</xref>, is significantly lower during the regeneration of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs. In addition, the expression of oxidative responsive genes is significantly decreased in quiescent <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSC post-regeneration, suggesting <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs are more susceptible to reactive oxygen species (ROS), which may contribute to their compromised function.</p>

        <title>Self-Renewing HSCs Express CD81 during Stress-Induced Proliferation</title>
        <p>In our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Venezia1">[7]</xref>, <italic>Cd81</italic> mRNA was sharply upregulated in HSCs (SP<sup>KLS</sup>, c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Lin<sup>−</sup> Sca-1<sup>+</sup> purified from the Side Population of mouse bone marrow cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Goodell1">[20]</xref>) after treatment with 5-flurouracil (5FU), a cytotoxic drug that induces HSCs to proliferate. The entire side population (SP) compartment expanded markedly after 5FU induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001148.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), exhibiting a heterogeneous surface expression of CD48, a known marker of HSC differentiation that is absent in unperturbed HSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Challen1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Kiel1">[22]</xref>, and CD81. The presence or absence of CD81 and CD48 defined three subpopulations of the 5FU-stimulated, heterogeneous SP cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001148.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), and the pattern of expression provided an opportunity to further assess the apparent association between CD81 and proliferating HSCs. Interestingly, the CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup> subpopulation was preferentially distributed toward the lower SP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001148.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), associated with the most primitive long-term HSC activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Goodell1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Challen1">[21]</xref>, consistent with the hypothesis that CD81 plays a functional role in HSC self-renewal. To further test whether CD81 expression was associated with HSC activity after 5FU treatment, we compared the ability of the CD81<sup>+</sup> or CD81<sup>−</sup> fractions of SP cells to reconstitute hematopoiesis, using competitive transplantation assays. At 5, 13, and 20 weeks post-transplantation into lethally irradiated mice, the CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup> donor cells showed significantly greater repopulating activity than the CD81<sup>−</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup> or the CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup> fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; the number of CD81<sup>−</sup>CD48<sup>–</sup> cells is insignificant). Because CD48 expression is associated with differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Kiel1">[22]</xref>, this suggests that these markers delineate a transition between self-renewal and differentiation, with CD81 expression associated with sustained HSC activity. More interestingly, among the three subpopulations, CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup> are the only cells presenting a rapid return to quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), suggesting that HSCs tend to return to quiescence once sufficient progeny are generated.</p>

            <p>(A) Competitive transplantation assay shows that among the SP cells from the 5FU-treated mice, the CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup> fraction contains most of the stem cell activity, compared with that of the CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup> and CD81<sup>−</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup> fractions. In this assay, 300Lin<sup>−</sup>SP (Side Population) cells expressing the indicated markers were transplanted with 2.5 × 10<sup>5</sup> whole bone marrow competitors. The test donor population was derived from CD57Bl/6-CD45.2 mice, while the competitors and recipients were C57BL/6-CD45.1 mice, enabling us to determine the contribution of HSCs to peripheral blood production, using flow cytometry to detect the CD45.2 marker. The values are means ± SD (<italic>n</italic> = 5 per group per time point), **<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05. (B) CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup>SP cells show the least expression of Ki-67, a proliferation antigen, at each 5FU time point tested, indicating that CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup> cells are the cells returning to quiescence most rapidly among the Lin<sup>−</sup>SP cells. For each time point, femurs and tibias from 3 to 4 mice were collected in each experiment, and at least two independent experiments were performed for each time point. (C) Expression of CD81 by HSCs (SP cKit<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup>Sca1<sup>+</sup>, SP<sup>KLS</sup>) is upregulated when the stem cells are proliferating in response to 5FU stimulation (shown here are 5FU-Day2 and 5FU-Day5). CD81 is expressed at background levels in quiescent HSCs (5FU-Day0 and 5FUDay11), but is upregulated during proliferation (starting at 5FU-Day2).</p>

        <p>Further evidence for a role of CD81 in HSC self-renewal came from studies that monitored the expression of CD81 protein by HSCs (SP<sup>KLS</sup>) over the course of 5FU treatment, using an anti-CD81 monoclonal antibody, EAT2. The proliferative response of HSCs to a single dose of 5FU (150 mg/kg) has been established: HSCs begin to proliferate late on day 1 post-treatment and reach maximal proliferation on day 6, returning to quiescence after day 7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Venezia1">[7]</xref>. The expression of CD81 correlated closely with the proliferation kinetics of the HSCs (as defined both SP<sup>KLS</sup> and CD150<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup>c-Kit<sup>+</sup>Sca-1<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup>). In contrast to its low expression by unstimulated HSCs (5FU-Day 0), the CD81 protein was detected in abundance on days 2, 5, and 8 post-treatment, with a return to background levels by day 11 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>

        <p>The timing of CD81 expression on proliferating HSCs suggested a role for this molecule in HSC self-renewal, a prediction we sought to test using HSCs purified from CD81 deficient mice (<italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Tsitsikov1">[23]</xref> and wild-type HSCs transplanted into lethally irradiated mice. In the primary competitive transplantation assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), the engraftment capacity of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs did not differ appreciably from that of the wild-type cells and presented a comparable ability to give rise to blood lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001148.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). To test whether <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs were able to generate HSCs in the transplant recipients (self-renewal) we purified HSCs from the primary recipients and examined their function. Despite their ability to differentiate in vitro, as determined by methycellulose assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001148.s002">Figure S2B</xref>), they engrafted secondary transplant recipients only marginally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), indicating a defect in their ability to self-renew. In addition, <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type HSCs showed nearly identical properties in homing assays performed over the first 24 hours of secondary transplantation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001148.s002">Figure S2C</xref>), indicating that the hematopoietic repopulation defect shown by the <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs is independent of their response to chemokine-guided homing to stem cell niches. It is worth noting that the un-challenged <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> bone marrow not only presents with comparable stem cell composition and cellularity (unpublished data), but the primary transplantation with whole bone marrow cells also exhibited no defect in engraftment (unpublished data), indicating that the defect found in <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSC is specific to the HSC progeny that have gone through self-renewal.</p>

        <title><italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs Show Normal Proliferation During Homeostasis But Are Delayed in Returning to Quiescence after Proliferative Stress</title>
        <p>To elucidate the mechanism underlying defective engraftment by <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs, we considered that a hyperproliferation phenotype leading to depletion of the stem cell pool is often linked to ineffective secondary or serial transplantations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Cheng2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Arai1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Hock1">[25]</xref>. As a molecule highly expressed primarily during the short window of HSC proliferation, we reasoned that CD81 may specifically exert its function only when cells encounter proliferative stress. We therefore challenged primary recipients of transplantation with wild-type or <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSC transplants with one dose of 5FU (150 mg/kg), and evaluated the proliferative status of the donor-derived HSCs. Under steady-state conditions in the absence of proliferative stress, similar fractions of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type HSCs were proliferating, determined by bromodeoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling assays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Comparable proportions of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type HSCs were also proliferating on day 4 after 5FU treatment, suggesting that CD81 does not participate in the early phase of HSC proliferation stimulated by the drug (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Thereafter, the <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells showed only a modest decline in proliferative activation on day 8 after 5FU treatment, while their wild-type equivalents began a relatively rapid return to quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs were able to return to a comparable level of quiescence in the later stage of recovery (5FU-Day12), indicating that CD81 functions to facilitate the recovery of HSCs in the face of 5FU stimulation or other types of proliferation stress. Therefore, it is evident that the defective engraftment in the secondary transplantation is not an exhaustion of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs through over-proliferation. Rather, it is a loss of functional integrity with signs of uncoordinated cell cycle progression.</p>

        <title>A Distinct Clustering Pattern of CD81 Is Associated with HSCs Returning to the Quiescent State</title>
        <p>CD81 is a tetraspanin molecule that is believed to organize membrane domains for signaling molecules and therefore is involved in a variety of signaling pathways downstream of these molecules. We therefore sought to determine if CD81 forms discrete domains in proliferating HSCs. We identified a distinct clustering pattern of the molecule on day 8 after 5FU treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>), which was not observed for other membrane proteins, such as CD29 (unpublished data). CD81 was identified as an anti-proliferation target from monoclonal antibody screenings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Oren1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Takahashi1">[27]</xref>. It has been reported that engagement of CD81 by a high concentration of monoclonal antibody interferes with cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Kelic1">[28]</xref>. To test whether clustering of CD81 on the cell membranes facilitates quiescence in HSCs, we used an anti-CD81 monoclonal antibody, EAT2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Maecker1">[29]</xref>, to engage signaling downstream of this tetraspanin molecule. Notably, the antibody-treated proliferating HSCs (5FU-Day7) harbored CD81 protein clustered in patches on the cell membrane, while in the isotype control-treated HSCs, the CD81 proteins were scattered throughout the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). By measuring the area of clustering, we found that the EAT2 treatment promotes tighter clustering of CD81 protein on proliferating (5FU-Day7) HSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), a day earlier than CD81 naturally coalesces (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>). Finally, binding of the anti-CD81 antibody triggers an early exit of HSCs from the cell cycle, as a significant fraction of HSCs treated with the EAT2 antibody return to quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g004">Figure 4C,D</xref>). Thus, cross-linking CD81 molecules with monoclonal antibodies on proliferating HSCs (5FU-Day7) recapitulated what we observed on HSCs in later proliferating stages when returning to quiescence (5FU-Day8), and the clustering pattern of CD81 on HSCs correlated with a quiescence phenotype.</p>

        <title>Manipulating the Distribution of Membrane CD81 Leads to Changes in Akt-FoxO Activity</title>
        <p>When brought into close proximity, tetraspanin molecules are thought to form microdomains that constrain other resident membrane proteins, ultimately affecting downstream signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Levy1">[10]</xref>. We therefore investigated the downstream signaling cascade initiated by CD81 clustering in proliferating HSCs, first testing the activation state of ERK (MapK1), p38 (MapK14), JNK (MapK8), and Akt, which were reported to participate in signaling pathways downstream of CD81 after its stimulation by various means <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Brazzoli1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Lishner1">[31]</xref>. At 1 h after stimulation with EAT2 antibody, only Akt showed a significant reduction (20%) in its phosphorylation state in response to antibody-induced CD81 clustering (judged by the ratio of median fluorescence intensity of phospho-Akt in EAT2-treated HSC to that in isotype-control antibody-treated HSCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). More importantly, the expression of CyclinD1, a cell cycle regulator downstream of Akt, was found to decrease by 30% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). This suggests that EAT2-induced CD81 clustering on HSCs leads to a downregulation of Akt activity, which subsequently represses HSC proliferation via CyclinD1 reduction.</p>

            <p>(A) The phosphorylation of Akt, an indicator of Akt activation, decreases upon CD81 clustering on proliferating HSCs. EAT2 antibody-treatment of HSCs induces a 20% reduction of phosphorylated-Akt (pAkt), a 30% decrease of CyclinD1 expression, and no decrease of phosphorylated-ERK (p-ERK) or phosphorylated-p38 (p-p38) median fluorescence intensity, compared with results from isotype control-treated HSCs. (B) FoxO1a but not FoxO3a is activated in HSCs in response to EAT2 antibody-mediated CD81 clustering. In EAT2-treated HSCs, FoxO1a shows a nuclear localization phenotype on EAT2-treated cells, whereas in isotype control-treated HSCs the majority of FoxO1a is excluded from nucleus. The localization of FoxO3a, on the other hand, shows no difference in EAT2-treated HSC, compared to the isotype control group. The FoxO translocation was measured by Imagestream. Six representative single cells are shown. (C) Nuclear translocation of FoxO1a in EAT2-treated HSCs is significantly higher in comparison with that in the isotype control group. An established statistic model was employed to calculate degrees of protein nuclear localization with Pearson’s correlation coefficient and generate similarity scores that evaluate the co-localization of FoxO signals with nucleus. Positive nuclear correlation in the single cell images was assigned when the similarity score was more than 1 (more than 100 cells were acquired for each analysis, <italic>n</italic> = 2 per group of treatment; mean values ± SD are shown, *<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). (D) On 5FU-Day8, the level of phospho-Akt in CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>−</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup>SP cells that are returning to quiescence on 5FU-Day8 is lower than that in the CD81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup>Lin<sup>−</sup>SP cells, a population that is proliferative.

        <p>The FoxO transcription factors, which are suppressed by Akt during cell proliferation, are essential for HSC self-renewal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Tothova2">[32]</xref>. Activated Akt phosphorylates FoxO proteins, which are then restricted from entering the nucleus. A return of HSCs to quiescence should thus involve deactivation of Akt and nuclear entrance by FoxOs. To examine whether the Akt deactivation we observed resulted in nuclear localization of any FoxO proteins and suppression of HSC proliferation, we utilized Imagestream flow cytometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-George1">[33]</xref> to visualize the localization of FoxO1a and FoxO3a and to quantify the number of HSCs with FoxO nuclear localization during FACS analysis. We discovered that FoxO3a was localized in the nucleus regardless of antibody treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), while FoxO1a translocated from the cytoplasm to the nucleus after anti-CD81 antibody stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The nuclear localization of FoxO1a in EAT2-treated HSCs was significantly higher than that in the isotype control-treated HSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Perifosine, an Alkylphospholipid, Rescues the Engraftment Defect of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs</title>
        <p>We next investigated the activation level of Akt in the <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs by measuring the phospho-Akt level and found that the <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs possess a higher phospho-Akt on 5FU-Day8 when they present a hyper-proliferating phenotype (5FU-Day8). The activity of Akt has been shown to be tightly associated with the proliferation state of HSCs such that constitutive activation of Akt leads to their hyper-proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Kharas1">[12]</xref> while HSCs lacking both Akt1 and Akt2 were more quiescent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Juntilla1">[14]</xref>. However, the consequences of both the gain and loss of Akt function was to perturb the regeneration power of HSCs such that constitutive activation of Akt resulted in HSC exhaustion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Kharas1">[12]</xref> and Akt1/Akt2 loss resulted in defective hematopoiesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Juntilla1">[14]</xref>. We therefore reasoned that Akt activity is tightly controlled during HSC self-renewal, and perturbing Akt activity during the recovery phase of HSC after stress may lead to altered HSC activity. Thus, we incubated recovering HSCs with perifosine, an Akt inhibitor, at the stage when <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs show higher proliferation and higher expression of CyclinD1. At 30 min after the perifosine treatment (2 µg/ml), we found it returns the phospho-Akt to a comparable level with WT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). We administered perifosine to recipients during their recovery phase of transplantation (50 mg/kg, 7 d post-transplantation) when HSCs are presumably recovering and returning to homeostasis. Perifosine is an alkylphospholipid that is thought to incorporate into cell membranes, limit the accessibility of membrane signaling domains for Akt, and subsequently block Akt activation via phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Kondapaka1">[34]</xref>. Ten weeks later, when the transplant recipients were stably engrafted, the regenerated marrow was extracted and transplanted into secondary recipients.

This indicates that although perifosine may have been limiting Akt activity through blocking Akt from the signaling domains on membrane as we propose CD81 may be acting, the inhibitory kinetics are distinct from each other. Nevertheless, the dramatic rescue of the <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> phenotype in the secondary recipients suggests that CD81 functions at least in part via limiting Akt activity during HSC self-renewal.</p>

        <title>The Expression of CDK Inhibitors and Oxidative Stress Genes Are Altered in <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs</title>

        <p>To further investigate whether oxidative stress may contribute to the defective regeneration phenotypes of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs, we purified donor-derived hematopoietic progenitor cells from the regenerating bone marrow (5FU-Day8) and analyzed the expression level of both <italic>Atm</italic> and <italic>p130/Rbl2</italic>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>It is well accepted that regulation of cell cycle progression in HSCs is critical to maintain stem cell activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Orford1">[3]</xref>; however, there is only scant understanding of the mechanisms by which proliferating HSCs return to quiescence. The results of our study delineate a novel mechanism in which CD81, a stress-responsive membrane protein, is upregulated in HSCs exposed to proliferative stimuli and then acts to inhibit their otherwise unrestrained division. The severe self-renewal defect of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs after robust proliferative stress such as transplantation suggests that the role of CD81 in HSC self-renewal is transient and constrained in time.</p>
      <p>The key feature of this mechanism seems to be the ability of CD81 molecules to form specialized microdomains on the HSC surface. These domains have been identified on other cell types, such as lymphocytes and astrocytes, where they provide scaffolds for signaling molecules and orchestrate the interactions of membrane-associated proteins with effector molecules to initiate signaling cascade that can either induce or inhibit cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Shoham1">[37]</xref>. Interestingly, we found that CD81 forms a distinct patch-like, polarized pattern when HSCs are returning to quiescence. The membrane distribution of CD81 protein can be manipulated to form clusters with high concentrations of monoclonal antibodies that accelerate the return to quiescence of proliferating HSCs. With this manipulation, only Akt, among several kinases tested including JNK, p38, and ERK, showed a reduction in activation in response to CD81 clustering, suggesting Akt may be closely associated with the CD81 microdomains. Subsequently, we found translocation of FoxO proteins are affected in response to the clustering of CD81. However, with no known ligands for CD81, it is unclear how CD81 is brought together to form patches. As CD81 is thought to be able to interact with itself through its extracellular domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Stipp1">[38]</xref>, we thus speculate the clustering may be spontaneous when there is an upregulated expression level of CD81 on the cell membrane, such as we observe during HSC regeneration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001148-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), which increases the local CD81 density.</p>
      <p>Additionally the study with <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs in 5FU-stimulated regeneration highlights a time point when HSCs start to return to quiescence after the 5FU proliferative stimuli (5FU-Day8). At this time, <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs showed a hyper-proliferation phenotype with increased Akt activity, elevated expression of CyclinD1, and decreased RNA expression of <italic>p19<sup>Arf</sup></italic>, indicating that CD81 acts through Akt pathways during the proliferation phase of HSC regeneration. Moreover, at the stage when HSCs return to quiescence (5FU-Day12), <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−/−</sup> HSCs show significantly decreased expression of oxidative response genes, <italic>Atm</italic> and <italic>p130/Rbl2</italic>, suggesting that CD81 preserves the functional integrity of regenerating HSCs partly through impacting the oxidative stress response and possibly the intracellular level of ROS (reactive oxygen species). Taken together, these data indicate that CD81 acts through Akt pathways to pace the cell cycle progression, the oxidative stress response, and therefore to preserve the functional integrity of HSCs.</p>
      <p>Furthermore, a single in vivo treatment of an alkylphospholipid, perifosine, to the recovering mice (during the primary transplantation) rescues the defective engraftment of <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs as tested in secondary transplantation. In addition to being an Akt inhibitor, perifosine is found to act through JNK-dependent mechanism and induce caspase-dependent apoptosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Chiarini1">[39]</xref>. It has been proposed to condition the regiment to treat acute myelogenous leukemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Tazzari1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Papa1">[41]</xref>. However, in our study, we have not found an altered activity of JNK in <italic>Cd81</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> HSCs (unpublished data). We thus suspect that the treatment of perifosine replaces the role of CD81 in the recovering HSCs as microdomains that block signal transduction, and effectively modulates Akt activity. Ultimately, to fully understand how CD81 microdomains communicate with the Akt pathway, it will be necessary to identify their interacting proteins in HSCs in different stages of proliferation. More importantly, our finding that perifosine increases HSCs engraftment may aid to improve the human bone marrow transplantation in treating leukemic patients.</p>
      <p>A variety of extrinsic signals provided by the HSC niche have been reported to critically affect the ability of HSCs to maintain stem cell integrity as well as their proliferation status <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Yin1">[42]</xref>. However, it is unclear how any of these pathways dominantly govern the response of the HSCs to environmental cues. Our study suggests that when HSCs are under proliferative stress, the CD81 microdomains orchestrate the spatial distribution of signaling receptors on membrane as well as membrane-affiliated intracellular molecules on HSCs, and selectively transduce the extrinsic cues from the bone marrow niches. Future studies of the divergent roles of the CD81 microdomains on long-term repopulating HSCs may afford productive targets for the regulation of stem cell growth.</p>

CD48<sup>+</sup>CD81<sup>−</sup> marks the lower to tip SP fraction (55% of tip-SP cells), while CD81<sup>−</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup> marks the upper-to-shoulder fraction (19% of tip-SP cells). Cd81<sup>+</sup>CD48<sup>+</sup> marks the intermediate SP population (23% of tip-SP cells).</p>

(B) Post the primary transplantation, <italic>Cd81<sup>−/−</sup></italic> HSCs showed comparably ability to generate colonies albeit presenting a defective phenotype in the recipients of the secondary transplantation. After the primary transplantation, single HSCs were purified and placed in M3434 metholcult media for assaying colony-forming ability. 48-96 single cells were scored for colony forming in each set of single M3434 culture. Mean value ± SD findings are shown (n = 3 for both WT and <italic>Cd81<sup>−/−</sup></italic>).

The CFSE based homing assay was modified from a previous protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001148-Wilson1">[1]</xref>. Briefly, the CD45.2 nucleated bone marrow cells from the original transplant recipients were magnetically purified and labeled with a fluorescent lipid dye, PKH2 Green Fluorescent Cell Linker (Sigma). 2×10<sup>7</sup> cells were then transplanted lethally irradiated mice. After 12 h, the recipient mice were sacrificed and one leg (a tibia and a femur) was collected for analysis. The homed donor progenitor cells were measured as the percentage of fluorescence-labeled KLS (c-Kit<sup>+</sup> Lineage- and Sca-1<sup>+</sup>) cells in recipient bone marrow. Mean ± SD findings are shown (n = 4 for wild-type and 3 for <italic>Cd81<sup>−/−</sup></italic> transplantation). CFSE is the abbreviation of carboxyfluorescein succinimidyl ester, a fluorescence dye labeling cell membrane).</p>

          <p>Gating schemes of the Ki-67 detection and of the expression level of p-Akt. (A) In the 5FU time course study, proliferating cells of HSCs were measured by the expression of Ki-67. HSCs were purified based on the properties of Hoechst33342 efflux (SP) and marker expression including c-Kit<sup>+</sup>, Sca-1<sup>+</sup>, and Lin- (SPKLS), as well as the expression of CD45 marker that distinguish donor-derived HSCs (CD45.2<sup>+</sup>) from the competitors (CD45.1<sup>+</sup>).
