        <p>A systematic analysis reveals a regulatory network controlling selective odorant receptor expression and neuronal diversity in <italic>Drosophila</italic>.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The mechanism that specifies olfactory sensory neurons to express only one odorant receptor (OR) from a large repertoire is critical for odor discrimination but poorly understood. Here, we describe the first comprehensive analysis of OR expression regulation in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. A systematic, RNAi-mediated knock down of most of the predicted transcription factors identified an essential function of acj6, E93, Fer1, onecut, sim, xbp1, and zf30c in the regulation of more than 30 ORs. These regulatory factors are differentially expressed in antennal sensory neuron classes and specifically required for the adult expression of ORs. A systematic analysis reveals not only that combinations of these seven factors are necessary for receptor gene expression but also a prominent role for transcriptional repression in preventing ectopic receptor expression. Such regulation is supported by bioinformatics and OR promoter analyses, which uncovered a common promoter structure with distal repressive and proximal activating regions. Thus, our data provide insight into how combinatorial activation and repression can allow a small number of transcription factors to specify a large repertoire of neuron classes in the olfactory system.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Our nervous system has a daunting diversity; it contains 100 billion neurons that all have defined functions and connections. To address how neuronal diversity is produced, we have turned to a complex but defined set of neurons, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system located in the antenna. This system contains 34 neuron classes with different functions and connections, each defined by the unique odorant receptor they express. We set out to identify the transcription factors (regulatory genes) that are required for each class to express the correct odorant receptor. We find that seven transcription factors are continuously required in different combinations for the expression of all tested 32 odorant receptors. We also show that these transcription factors can both turn on and turn off odorant receptor genes, making the expression regulation more economical. We conclude that dual use of a small set of factors, which are always on in the neuron, can define its functional class and thereby produce diversity in the nervous system.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The external world is perceived by peripheral neurons that each expresses only one or a stereotyped set of receptors from a large genomic repertoire <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Zylka1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Yau1">[4]</xref>. The selective receptor expression ensures the specific function of each sensory neuron and produces a daunting diversity of sensory neuron classes. However, little is known about how the neuron class-specific receptor expression is controlled.</p>
      <p>In the mouse olfactory system, each olfactory sensory neuron (OSN) chooses to express one odorant receptor (OR) out of approximately 1,200 OR genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Johnston1">[5]</xref>. OR choice in mammalians is in part a stochastic process restricted by the developmental context, which is manifested as restricted zonal expression patterns of each OR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Serizawa1">[6]</xref>. The zonal patterns can be resembled by the expression of transgenic OR promoters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Serizawa1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Lewcock1">[7]</xref> and raises the possibility that there are transcription factors (TFs) that in combinations or in gradients specify mouse OR expression. Two TFs, Lhx2 and Emx2, have been identified as general regulators of OR expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Kolterud1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-McIntyre1">[10]</xref>, but the identities of the TFs that regulate specific mouse ORs are unknown, because the large size of the OR repertoire makes systematic analysis of TF phenotypes cumbersome and specific defects difficult to detect.</p>
      <p>In similarity to mammals the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORs are expressed in a salt and pepper pattern within domains of the antenna OSNs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Vosshall1">[11]</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> OR expression create 34 OSN classes with a stereotype neuronal number and location <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Hallem1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Endo1">[14]</xref>, suggesting a strictly predetermined process. The large number of OSN classes and precise OR regulation makes the <italic>Drosophila</italic> antenna an extraordinary system to study how ORs are regulated and how a large number of neuron classes are specified. To date, only two TFs, Acj6 and Pdm3, has been shown to specify a subset of <italic>Drosophila</italic> ORs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Komiyama1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Bai1">[16]</xref>. However, no systematic approach has yet been undertaken to address the regulatory mechanism of OR expression.</p>
      <p>To address how the olfactory system specifies the unique OR identity of a large number of sensory neurons we have performed the first systematic genetic (directed RNAi) screen for direct regulators of <italic>Drosophila</italic> OR expression. Hereby, we have identified a set of only seven TFs that regulate the complete OR collection of the adult <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system. We provide a systematic analysis to demonstrate how these TFs employ multiple strategies to specify OR class identity.</p>

        <title>A Systematic RNAi Screen Identifies Seven TFs That Regulate OR Expression</title>
        <p>In mammals and insects, the majority of OSNs each express a single OR gene out of a large genomic repertoire. To identify the TFs that are necessary for proper OR expression in <italic>Drosophila</italic> we used the transgenic UAS-driven inverted repeats (IRs) from the Vienna <italic>Drosophila</italic> RNAi Center (VDRC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Dietzl1">[17]</xref> to interfere with the 753 annotated putative TFs in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.flytf.org/" xlink:type="simple">www.flytf.org</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Adryan1">[18]</xref>. The TF-IRs were expressed in postmitotic OSNs by <italic>pebbled</italic>-Gal4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Sweeney1">[19]</xref>, and OR expression was visualized by direct OR promoter fusions with <italic>CD8::GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). In two separate rounds we analyzed the RNAi effect on the expression of four representative OR classes: <italic>Or92a</italic> and <italic>Or98a</italic> for basiconic OSNs in the distal and central antennal region, Or23a and <italic>Or47b</italic> for trichoid OSNs in overlapping proximal antennal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We found 611, 81.1% of the TFs, to be available as RNAi lines in the VDRC library and expression of which lead to lethality of another 14.2% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Of the remaining 504 gene knock downs (TF-IRs), we identified seven that resulted in a strong and highly penetrant loss of OR expression: <italic>acj6-</italic>, <italic>E93 (Eip93f)-</italic>, <italic>Fer1-</italic>, <italic>onecut-</italic>, <italic>sim-</italic>, <italic>xbp1-</italic>, and <italic>zf30-IRs</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>

        <title>Overlapping Expression of the Seven TFs</title>
        <p>All identified TFs belonged to different protein families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2A</xref>): Acj6 (POU-Homeobox; Hox), E93 (Psq like helix-turn-helix; HTH), Fer1 (basic helix loop helix; bHLH), Onecut (cut-Hox), Sim (PAS-bHLH), Xbp1 (bZIP), and Zf30c (C2H2; zinc finger). Two of the genes, <italic>zf30c</italic> (<italic>zinc finger at 30c</italic>), which encodes a protein with ten C2H2 zinc finger domains and <italic>Fer1</italic> (<italic>Forty eight related 1</italic>), encoding a bHLH factor, had not previously been characterized.</p>
        <p>We next asked whether expression of the seven TFs correlated to the OR expression domains or sensilla groups. There are three main groups of sensilla, basiconic, coeloconic and trichoid, differently distributed across the antenna <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Shanbhag1">[20]</xref>. In situ hybridization and immunohistochemistry demonstrated that all seven TFs were expressed in the adult antenna in various patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Each pattern showed little restriction to domains or sensilla groups and none of the TFs were expressed in only one or only a few OSN classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Two of the TFs, <italic>acj6</italic> and <italic>xbp1</italic>, were ubiquitously expressed and might regulate OR expression more indirectly via any of the other five TFs. When analyzed, no obvious differences in strength or distribution of <italic>E93</italic>, <italic>Fer1</italic>, <italic>onecut</italic>, <italic>sim</italic>, and <italic>zf30c</italic> expression were found in the <italic>acj6</italic>- and <italic>xbp1</italic>-IRs, indicating that the seven TFs might be directly required for OR expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2C and 2D</xref>).</p>
        <p>To address the extent of coexpression between the seven TFs, we analyzed each TFs expression in two OSN classes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In <italic>Or92a</italic> OSNs, all seven TFs were expressed including <italic>E93</italic>, the TF that was not required for <italic>Or92a</italic> expression. Similarly, Or47b neurons expressed <italic>E93</italic>, the only TF required for expression, and <italic>acj6</italic>, <italic>Fer1</italic>, <italic>sim</italic>, and <italic>xbp1</italic>. These data show that the seven TFs are expressed in broad and overlapping populations of mature sensory neurons, which do not correlate with sensilla groups or OSN classes. The lack of anatomic correlation of the expression patterns suggests that these TFs are part of a distinct regulatory network separate from the general process of antenna and neuron specification.</p>

        <title>The Identified OR Regulators Are Required in Adult Flies</title>
        <p>The onset of OR expression takes place during the second half of pupal development, after OSN axon guidance, and is one of the final steps of sensory neuron differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). To rule out a role of the seven TFs in early OSN specification and differentiation, which could affect OR gene expression more indirectly, the pan neuronal markers, Elav and Neuroglian, were analyzed. The overall number of OSNs and axonal projections from the antenna to the brain was not affected in any of the RNAi knock downs, indicating no gross changes in sensory neuron development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

        <p>Next, to determine the temporal window of TF function in OR expression we used the TARGET system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-McGuire1">[21]</xref>. Here, the IR-mediated gene knock-down can be regulated via a temperature-sensitive Gal4 repressor (GAL80<sup>ts</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

        <p>In a reverse approach, knock down of the TFs during pupal development and a reversal of the wild-type TF expression in early adult stages allowed us to distinguish between earlier developmental roles and a later function in OR gene regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

        <p>To determine whether this small set of TFs can regulate the full collection of OR genes, we extended our RNAi analysis to the majority of the sensory neurons classes in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> olfactory system. The resulting OR expression phenotypes were assembled into a regulatory matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; for statistics see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s006">Table S2</xref>).

First, all 32 ORs required at least one of the seven TFs for correct expression, demonstrating a prominent role in OR gene regulation for the TFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g004">Figure 4A and 4C</xref>). Second, in line with the wide TF expression patterns across the antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), the TFs were required for OR expression in OSN classes indiscriminate of sensilla group or antenna location (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g004">Figures 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s003">S3</xref>), supporting that the TFs disconnect the OR expression from the early antenna patterning and development. Third, the identified seven TFs were required for expression of partly overlapping sets of OR genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), suggesting a combinatorial mode of OR gene regulation. Last, unique TF combinations were associated with 17 of the 32 ORs expression and each combination ranged from one to six TFs and only two additional TFs would be sufficient to resolve the remaining redundancies.

        <title>The Seven TFs Bind to Different Combinations of Motifs Upstream OR Genes</title>
        <p>To address, whether any of the identified TFs bind directly to the regions upstream of each OR, we exploited the well-established vertebrate DNA binding motifs of Acj6, Onecut, and Xbp1. It has been shown that <italic>Drosophila</italic> Acj6 and Onecut share binding properties with their vertebrate orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s004">Figure S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Bai1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Turner1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Nguyen1">[23]</xref>.

In mobility shift assays, recombinant <italic>Drosophila</italic> Xbp1 bound this core sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s004">Figure S4A</xref>), demonstrating shared binding properties between the Xbp1 orthologs.</p>
        <p>The Acj6-, Onecut-, and Xbp1-DNA binding motifs were used to search 1 kb upstream of 32 OR genes and identified various combinations of the TF binding motifs upstream of each OR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; for location of each motif see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s007">Table S3</xref>). Most OR promoter regions contained at least one binding site for the TFs required for expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). The fact that some OR promoter regions lacked predicted binding sites for the required TF suggest either that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> TF and the vertebrate ortholog have slightly different DNA binding requirements or that the TF in these cases indirectly regulate the OR gene. In vitro binding assays for four of the OR genes showed that all motifs were recognized by the matching TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). These data together with the strong correlation between motif and OR gene activation suggest that each OR promoter is bound and regulated by different combinations of these TFs.</p>

Transgenic constructs containing these conserved regions produced antenna OSN expression for ten tested OR promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), suggesting that a short region directly upstream of each OR gene was sufficient for expression. However, half of the short promoter constructs produced misexpression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5D and 5E</xref>); the lack of OSN class specificity implies that distal regulatory regions are required to repress OR expression in some OSN classes.

        <title>The Location of the DNA Binding Motif Determines TF Function</title>
        <p>The bioinformatic analysis uncovered DNA motifs in OR promoters that did not require the matching TF for expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). When the upstream locations of these “nonessential motifs” were plotted, a peak was found downstream of the TATA boxes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s007">Table S3</xref> for location of each motif). Conversely, all motifs upstream of ORs that required the matching TF were located upstream of each TATA box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), suggesting that motif location might reflect different TF functions. For example, <italic>Or98a</italic>, which did not require <italic>xbp1</italic> for expression, had an Xbp1 motif downstream of the TATA box (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).

The repression of Or98a and the activation of Or7a expression in the same OSN class show that Xbp1 has a dual function in the specification of OR gene expression. One simple explanation might be that Xbp1, when bound far upstream, activates expression of Or7a and, when bound next to the TATA box, hinders transcriptional initiation of <italic>Or98a</italic>. To address this possibility, the Or98a Xbp1 motif was mutated, which produced misexpression across the central antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). These data suggest that the differential activity of Xbp1 can be defined by the location of the binding motif in the regulatory regions of the two OR genes.</p>

        <title>The Seven Identified TFs Are OR Selector Genes</title>
        <p>In 1975, Antonio Garcia-Bellido presented the concept of selector genes, TFs that can determine a particular cell fate. Several levels of selector genes has been found, which control gene programs that individually specify organ, tissue, and cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Mann1">[27]</xref>. Recently, studies in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> have revealed that one factor and its motif can be enough to assign expression to one neuronal class <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Etchberger1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Way1">[30]</xref>. These observations have led to the formulation of the terminal selector gene hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Hobert1">[31]</xref>, which put forward that only a small set of TFs are continuously required to express the genes that signify each neuron class, like ORs. However to date few such cases have been identified.</p>
        <p>Our systematic analysis presents several observations that suggest the identified TFs to be terminal selector genes for OR expression. First, continuous expression of all seven TFs are required for OR expression in the mature OSNs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Second, the seven TFs are expressed in the mature OSNs, in various patterns across the antenna (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Third, all 32 tested ORs require different combinations of the TFs for expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Last, motifs for the TFs are found upstream of the ORs genes they regulate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and the motifs are necessary for OR promoter function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Consequently, it appears that the large number of OR expression patterns are achieved by combinatorial use of a few TFs that function as OR selector genes.</p>
        <p>The OR selector genes belong to different protein families (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), which indicate that evolution has favored recruitment of TFs with very different DNA binding properties, rather than expansion of one family that shares the basic DNA binding motif, which could secure the fidelity of the combinatorial pattern. On the other hand, the high motif specificity for each factor suggests that loss or gain of motifs for one OR selector might generate a new OR expression pattern and a totally new OSN class. Thus, single OSN class expression and high evolvability, two hallmarks of olfactory system evolution, might in part be due to the combinatorial function of the OR selector genes.</p>

        <title>Single OR Expression, a Large Regulatory Cost</title>
        <p>How many OR selector genes are required to uniquely express one OR in each OSN class? We identified seven OR selector genes, but given the limitations of RNAi, it is likely that there are a total of at least ten critical TFs to specify all OSN classes. Even this probably low estimate generates a rather high number of TFs considering that <italic>Drosophila</italic> antennae have 34 OSN classes that express ORs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Couto1">[13]</xref>. Theoretically the number of TFs needed for a binary combinatorial code to generate 34 unique outcomes is six (2<sup>6</sup> = 64). Seven TFs can in theory separate 2<sup>7</sup> = 128 combinations, and ten TFs designate more than 1,000 combinations, suggesting a large number of unused combinations. This surplus of combinations may be due to the inherent randomness of evolution and the impossibility of creating a streamlined code by chance. Another possibility for this large number is the need for a high degree of fidelity, with little or no ectopic OR expression tolerable for proper functioning of the olfactory system. Extrapolation of our observations to the regulatory requirements of the mammalian olfactory system indicates that at least 200–300 TFs would be required to provide a regulatory system that controls &gt;1,000 mammalian ORs, a daunting number. Therefore, it is reasonable to suspect that the stochastic OR selection mechanism found in vertebrates was added during evolution to accommodate the heavy increase in regulatory costs resulting from an expanded number of OR genes.</p>

        <title>Combinatorial Activation and Repression Control OR Expression</title>
        <p>To date very few TFs have been found to be restricted to small neuronal populations in neuroepithelia or in the developing brain in general <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Gray1">[32]</xref>. This situation has motivated the suggestion that combinatorial TF regulation defines broad expression patterns of molecules such as neurotransmitters, but is insufficient to generate the large number of neuron classes in, for example, the olfactory system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001280-Ma1">[33]</xref>. Similarly, all seven selector genes in this study are expressed across the antenna but still are required for the expression of some few ORs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g002">Figures 2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g004">4A</xref>). How can widely expressed TFs then produce restricted expression patterns? We have formulated two explanations. First, our promoter analysis suggests that the OSN class specificity is in part due to repression. Most ORs have a proximal regulatory region next to the gene that is sufficient for expression in OSNs but requires repression from more distal regions for the spatial restriction to each OSN class (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In this model, the expression of the TFs that produce OR expression does not need to be particularly specific as long as they are counteracted by repressive factors. Second, the identified TFs can both activate and repress OR expression dependent on the location of the binding site or by the available cofactors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g006">Figures 6C, 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001280-g007">7A, and 7B</xref>). Dual use of the TFs might increase their regulatory power and as a likely consequence the number of TFs required for OR expression to be reduced. We therefore suggest that specification of large numbers of neuron classes in the olfactory system and likely in the nervous system, require two layers of combinatorial coding, one layer of terminal selector genes that produce expression and a layer of repressors that restrict the expression to each class.</p>

        <p>Virgin flies containing <italic>Pebbled-GAL4</italic>, <italic>UAS-Dicer2</italic>, and the OR promoter fusions were mated with males obtained from the VDRC library. The crosses were set up at 25°C, and after 3 d the parental flies were removed and the vials shifted to 27°C. 2–3 d after eclosure, the GFP levels corresponding to OR expression were ranked 0–5, where 5 corresponded to the wild-type level. For all assays, for five females per line crosses were scored blind to the genotype and all lines with phenotypes scored below 2 were retested. A line was considered to have established phenotype if three consecutive crosses included flies that scored below 2. To further validate the established phenotypes, RNAi lines from the VDRC, NIG, and the Transgenic RNAi Project (TRiP) were used, all the different lines gave the same phenotype as in the screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001280.s005">Table S1</xref>).
