<abstract>
<p>Crosstalk between neurons and glia may constitute a significant part of information processing in the brain. We present a novel method of statistically identifying interactions in a neuron–glia network. We attempted to identify neuron–glia interactions from neuronal and glial activities via maximum-a-posteriori (MAP)-based parameter estimation by developing a generalized linear model (GLM) of a neuron–glia network. The interactions in our interest included functional connectivity and response functions. We evaluated the cross-validated likelihood of GLMs that resulted from the addition or removal of connections to confirm the existence of specific neuron-to-glia or glia-to-neuron connections. We only accepted addition or removal when the modification improved the cross-validated likelihood. We applied the method to a high-throughput, multicellular <italic>in vitro</italic> Ca2+ imaging dataset obtained from the CA3 region of a rat hippocampus, and then evaluated the reliability of connectivity estimates using a statistical test based on a surrogate method. Our findings based on the estimated connectivity were in good agreement with currently available physiological knowledge, suggesting our method can elucidate undiscovered functions of neuron–glia systems.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many neuroscientists believe that neurons mainly perform information processing in the brain. Glial cells have traditionally been regarded as passive cells, whose roles have been limited to mechanical support and energy transfer to neurons. However, some studies have recently demonstrated the existence of interactions between neurons and glial cells and implied the involvement of crosstalk between neuronal and glial systems in information processing. Nevertheless, the details on neuron–glia communication largely remain unknown. One way of addressing this issue is to use a powerful statistical methodology to identify the network structure based on high-throughput time-lapse imaging from neuron–glia networks. We developed a new statistical method for functional connectivity analysis that was suitable for examining neuron–glia interactions. We applied the method to multicellular Ca2+ imaging data, where neurons and glial cells carried out spontaneous activities in a rat hippocampal CA3 culture. We found in a data-driven manner that each glial cell facilitated the activities of neighboring neurons with a peak latency of 500 ms. Our study is the first of its kind to present a statistical framework to investigate the functional connectivity between neurons and glial cells. Our statistical method is thus capable of identifying neuron–glia interactions by utilizing the high-throughput imaging technique.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Information processing in the brain is primarily performed by neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Buzsaki1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Shepherd1">[2]</xref>. Some studies, however, have revealed the existence of crosstalk between neurons and astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Hamilton1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fellin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Tian1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Perea1">[14]</xref> that neighbor the neurons and envelop the neuronal synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Sofroniew1">[15]</xref>. The observations in these studies suggest the involvement of glia in the brain's information processing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Araque1">[16]</xref>. Stimulation applied to the main type of glial cells (i.e., astrocytes) may induce the exocytosis of gliotransmitters, which in turn modulates post-synaptic currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Araque2">[17]</xref> and increases post-synaptic excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Volterra1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-DePitt1">[19]</xref>. Stimulation applied to neurons, on the other hand, elevates the Ca2+ activity of astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schipke1">[8]</xref>. This effect occurs both in culture and in acute brain slices, and is most likely mediated by astrocyte receptors for neuro-active molecules, neurotransmitters and neuromodulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schipke1">[8]</xref>. <italic>In vitro</italic> astrocytes are known to exhibit relatively slow non-electrical activities (100 ms<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1 min) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Sofroniew1">[15]</xref>. In contrast, neurons exhibit rapid depolarization, or ‘spikes’ (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>1 ms). Furthermore, <italic>in vivo</italic> animal experiments have suggested that glia affect neural networks in the sensory cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schummers1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Takata1">[21]</xref> and in the motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Nimmerjahn1">[22]</xref>. These <italic>in vivo</italic> results imply that glia may play an important role in the information processing associated with sensory and motor functions. These findings clarify the necessity to shift our focus from pure neuronal networks to neuron–glia networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Haydon1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fields2">[26]</xref>. Unless otherwise noted, we will denote astrocytes as glia after this.</p>
<p>To clarify the roles of neuron–glia interactions in brain information processing, we need to examine neuronal and glial activities in a network in an unmanipulated state. For example, some experiments have artificially generated epileptiform bursting activities of neurons and glial cells, and then examined the contributions of glial activity via further pharmacological manipulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fellin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Tian1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-GmezGonzalo1">[27]</xref>. Such approaches are very appropriate for clinical applications. However, one needs to assess the concise contribution of glial activities in networks in a resting state to elucidate their functions in information processing. In this case, the sheer complexity of the networks makes it extremely difficult to estimate neuron–glia interactions. The dissociation of glial effects from other neuronal effects is a challenging problem, especially when indirect interactions via other neurons in the network are taken into consideration. Also, such indirect interactions may themselves be important for identifying neuron–glia interactions.</p>
<p>Generalized linear models (GLMs) have been developed for pure neuronal networks (without glia) to analyze their interactions in terms of both response functions and functional connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Okatan1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Kobayashi1">[33]</xref>. One can identify the characteristics of multivariate time series by estimating the model parameters in the GLM-based approaches. In the framework of the GLMs, the probability of spike events in a network at any given time depends on the history of the activity time series. The response functions and functional connectivity are estimated from the observed time-series of multi-neuronal spiking activities. The estimated response functions measure the extent to which the other neuronal spikes causally affect the spiking activities of target neurons. The estimated functional connectivity, on the other hand, represents the pathways over which the neuronal activities propagate. Although the functional connectivity does not necessarily correspond to a specific synaptic or non-synaptic connection (e.g., gap-junction) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Friston1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-ValdesSosa1">[35]</xref>, existing studies have shown that synaptic connections are closely linked to the connections that can be functionally estimated based on Ca2+ imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Stetter1">[36]</xref> and multi-electrode physiological measurements <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Constantinidis1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fujisawa1">[38]</xref>. Friston et al. argued that functional connectivities, particularly the ones that depend on the context of environments and behaviors, represent information flow propagating through anatomical connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Friston2">[39]</xref> in their research on fMRI datasets. One may then use the response functions and functional connectivity to address how each component contributes to information processing in the brain, either in a controlled environment or in the resting state. This type of data-driven approach is important in analyzing experimental data with high throughput, and in our particular case of identifying unknown neuron–glia interactions, even with a lack of a priori biological knowledge.</p>
<p>Neuronal spiking activity is binary, while glial activity may be regarded as being graded time series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Volterra1">[18]</xref>. Since we cannot directly apply the existing GLM-based techniques to such heterogeneous neuron-glia networks, we propose a new GLM-based statistical method in this paper to identify the interactions between neurons and glial cells. We applied this statistical method to the time-lapse imaging data of the rat hippocampal CA3 region based on high-resolution (184<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>94 pixels) and high-speed (100 Hz) Ca2+ imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Takahashi1">[40]</xref>. We determined the response functions and functional connectivity of the neuron–glia network from spontaneous activities of neurons and glial cells, which were then quantified by measuring the Ca2+ signal averaged over each cell. The reliability of the determined connectivity was evaluated with a statistical test based on a surrogate method. Our analysis revealed several characteristics of interactions between neurons and glia, including the positive effect of glial activities on the activities of neighboring neurons. These results obtained solely by using the proposed method were compatible with existing knowledge on neuron–glia interactions, reinforcing the previous neurobiological observations and providing new insights into the functions of neuro–glia systems.</p>

<p>We developed a statistical method to identify the functional connectivity and response functions of neuron–glia networks <italic>in situ</italic>, which may reflect the dynamics of ionic receptors on neurons and glial cells. We applied it to a Ca2+ imaging dataset of an <italic>in vitro</italic> brain slice (see ‘ <italic>In vitro</italic> Ca2+ imaging’ section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>), by using the Ca2+ signal (concentration) as an indicator of neuronal as well as glial activities. We conducted high-resolution (184<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>94 pixels) and high-speed Ca2+ imaging (100 Hz) from a CA3 region (184 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>94<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of a rat's hippocampal slice to prepare the dataset by using Nipkow-type spinning-disk microscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Takahashi1">[40]</xref>. We observed spontaneous Ca2+ activities of neurons and glial cells within the 10 min of a fluorescence image series. An image preprocess applied to the image series extracted binary activities of 48 neurons and graded activities of six glial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Figs. 1E and 1H</xref>). The spike frequency of the 48 neurons was 0.03–1 Hz. The activity dataset thus consisted of the observation time series of 48 neurons and six glial cells.</p>

<p>We tried to identify the neuron–glia system based on this observation time series by estimating the parameters of our neuron–glia network model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>. See ‘Generative model and MAP estimation’ section of Methods). We developed a generalized linear model (GLM) of a neuron–glia network as a variation of previous GLMs used for neuronal networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Kim1">[41]</xref>. We could efficiently and uniquely obtain maximum a posteriori (MAP) estimates of the parameters by assuming that the present activities of neurons and glial cells were independent conditional on their past. Using the MAP estimates, we could avoid ‘overfitting’, where the model estimates were disturbed by noise involved in the relatively short observation time series.</p>

<title>Outline of functional connectivity analysis.</title>
<p>(A) We statistically estimated the whole network of neurons and glial cells based on the neuronal and glial activities obtained from time-lapse Ca2+ imaging. A neuron–glia system consists of four types of possible connections (depicted by arrows): between neurons (blue), from glial cells to neurons (orange), from neurons to glial cells (green), and between glial cells (red). (B) Each specific connection in the neuron-glia network was identified by basically comparing the cross-validated likelihood between two network structures: (1) one with the connection and (2) the other without the connection.</p>

<p>We evaluated the quality-of-fit of the estimated model to the observation time series by using <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-fold cross-validation (see ‘Functional connectivity analysis’ section of Methods). The observation time-series dataset in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-fold cross-validation was partitioned into <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> subseries. A single subseries was used as the dataset to evaluate the estimated model, while the remaining <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> subseries were used as the training dataset to estimate the model parameters. Our measure of the quality-of-fit was the cross-validated likelihood, i.e., the model's predictability of the activities of neurons and glial cells in the test dataset averaged over <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> folds (for more details, see ‘Functional connectivity analysis’ in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section).</p>
<p>Since the cross-validated likelihood depended on the network structure of the model, i.e., the connectivity pattern within the neuron–glia system, it could be used to identify the connectivity between neurons and glial cells. For a specific connection from a glial cell to a neuron (a glia-to-neuron connection), we accepted the connection if a network structure with the new connection indicated a better cross-validated likelihood than the network structure that did not include the connection. In contrast, for a specific connection from a neuron to a glial cell (a neuron-to-glia connection), we preferred a network structure without the connection if the reduced network structure indicated a better cross-validated likelihood than the one with the connection (see ‘Functional connectivity analysis’ section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We identified the best network structure, i.e., the connectivity and response functions of the neuron–glia system, by repeating this set of procedures (the addition/removal of connections including MAP-based parameter estimation inside). The reason for our different treatment of glia-to-neuron and neuron-to-glia connections will be discussed later.</p>
<p>We conducted surrogate analysis to verify the reliability of the extracted functional connections as follows. First, we created a set of artificial time series for neurons and glial cells by applying “cyclic” rotations in which the cross correlations were destroyed but the autocorrelations were preserved. We then applied our algorithm to this artificial data set, and compared the number of identified connections against the number of connections we had identified from the original data. This obtained a statistical evaluation of the bulk number of connections that could be identified with our method.</p>
<p>Recent studies have shown that glial activities affect neuronal activities on various time scales, ranging from several tens of milliseconds to several hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fellin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Min1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Perea1">[14]</xref>. We focused on interactions that lasted for a relatively short duration with a delay ranging between 100 and 500 ms in this study. This is because our method could not deal with interactions with longer delays in our time-lapse image dataset of 10 min (see ‘Limitations of proposed method’ in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> section). A detailed description of the overall method is found in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s014">Text S1</xref>.

Here, we assumed that the functional connections between neurons and glia were directional because the neuron-to-glia and the glia-to-neuron connections are believed to depend on different biophysical processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Haydon1">[23]</xref>. There are small numbers of connections with substantially larger values than the other connections at the top left of the matrix, i.e., inter-neuronal connections. This observation is consistent with existing physiological studies, which report that the strength of inter-neuronal connections in the hippocampus obeys a log-normal distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Ikegaya1">[42]</xref> We can also see some strong glia-to-neuron connections at the top right.</p>

<title>Neuron–glia network estimated from Ca2+ imaging data.</title>
<p>(A) Connectivity matrix of the neuron–glia network estimated with our method. Each column and each row of the matrix correspond to “sender” (i.e., from) neuron/glia and “receiver” (i.e., to) neuron/glia. Indices of 48 neurons and indices of six glial cells are segmented by white lines on the matrix. Each matrix entry denotes the root mean square of the corresponding response function; the root mean square is normalized within the entry values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> individually. This is because the magnitude of the response functions was considerably different across <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For example, the element (1, 49) indicates the magnitude of the response function from neuron 1 to glial cell 1 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

<p>We took temporal averages of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and determined connections corresponding to positive values as excitatory. We similarly determined connections corresponding to negative values as inhibitory. Approximately half of the inter-neuronal connections were found to be excitatory (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). This may suggest some sort of a balance in inter-neuronal and inter-glial connections. Positive values for the temporal averages of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> were found for 63% of the former and for 11% of the latter, suggesting that there were major excitatory effects from glial cells to neurons but minor inhibitory effects from neurons to glial cells.</p>

<title>Functional connectivity analysis between neurons and glia</title>
<p>We determined the existence of a connection (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) from the <italic>j</italic>-th glial cell to the <italic>i</italic>-th neuron using a newly designed <italic>t</italic>-statistic, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which determined whether the increase in the cross-validated likelihood resulting from the addition of the new connection was significant or not (see ‘Functional connectivity analysis’ section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We found that 24% of the glia-to-neuron pairs increased the cross-validated likelihood, and the remaining 76% decreased the cross-validated likelihood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s003">Fig. S3</xref>).

<title>Identified connectivity and response functions</title>
<p>Our results suggested the existence of functional connectivity from glial cells to neighboring neurons within a 20 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>50 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> perimeter. The identified functional connectivity also exhibited a distinctive local tiling pattern with few overlaps (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g004">Fig. 4</xref>). Further, these connections had positive response functions on the time scale of 500 ms. These results are in good agreement with experimental findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fellin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Bushong1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Wilhelmsson1">[46]</xref>. For example, the activation of hippocampal CA1 astrocytes has induced an inward current to neurons for a duration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>500 ms (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fellin1">[6]</xref>), which is mediated by glutamate released from astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-DePitt1">[19]</xref>; this phenomenon synchronizes the activities of CA1 neurons in the same range of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>100 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Angulo1">[47]</xref>. Anatomical studies have also found that astrocytes in the hippocampus occupy non-overlapping domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Bushong1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Wilhelmsson1">[46]</xref>. The identified response functions correspond to the inward current to neurons, and the identified local connectivity corresponds to the mostly non-overlapping domain of astrocytes. This would also suggest that glial activities could affect neuronal information processing in spontaneously active situations, in concert with inter-neuronal and inter-glial interactions, like those in our <italic>in vitro</italic> experiment.</p>
<p>The estimated glia-to-neuron response functions had a time scale of several hundred milliseconds with a peak latency of 500 ms. This relatively long duration might include the time for the activations of neuronal AMPAR and NMDAR in response to gliotransmitter release. Because the deactivation kinetics of AMAPR is known to be very rapid (∼5 ms), one may think that AMPAR activation should not appear in the response functions derived from the sampling interval of 10 ms. However, response functions not only depend on receptor kinetics, but also on the entire processes of AMPAR-mediated transmission (i.e., from glial vesicle release to neuronal Ca2+ signals). These entire processes are known to require at least several hundred milliseconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Sasaki1">[48]</xref>. Thus, the effects of AMPA- and NMDAR-mediated transmission were most likely reflected in our response functions.</p>
<p>Our analysis indicated the possible presence of many neuron-to-glia connections. We also found that, even if these connections really existed, the intensities of these connections were weak and they were spatially unlocalized. Indeed, neuron-to-glia interactions has been discovered in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schipke1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Bernardinelli1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Newman2">[49]</xref>. Although this has been observed in the bursting state of neuronal activities, such neuron-to-glia interactions may have been too small to observe in our spontaneously active situation. Thus, the identified weak neuron-to-glia connections were insignificant with a short observation time of 10 min. In contrast, if there were in fact no neuron-to-glia connections, those misidentified neuron-to-glia connections may have been due to spurious correlations between neuronal and glial activities. Such correlated activities may have been mediated by dentate gyrus (DG) neurons. DG neurons are known to relay signals to both CA3 astrocytes and CA3 neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Dani1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Haustein1">[51]</xref>. Thus, CA3 astrocytes and CA3 neurons could have simultaneously responded to DG neurons, which might have resulted in correlated activities for the misidentified functional connections. In either case, the significantly longer and simultaneous observation of both CA3 and DG regions is necessary to address the origin of the identified weak and spatially unlocalized neuron-to-glia connections.</p>
<p>Ca2+ signal has been recognized to be one of the most powerful indicators of glial activities. For example, the transmission of gliotransmitter, glutamate, is known to depend on the glial Ca2+ concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Zhang1">[52]</xref>. When a glial cell uptakes glutamate spilled out from synaptic clefts, the intracellular Ca2+ concentration of the glial cell is known to increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schipke1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Newman2">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Wang1">[53]</xref>. Although Ca2+ imaging is no doubt a powerful experimental methodology, our statistical method has potential applications to other types of imaging experiments. For example, we may apply our statistical technique to the dataset from intracellular pH imaging. Intracellular pH is known to reflect gliotransmitter release, which is a type of glial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Chesler1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Cengiz1">[55]</xref>.</p>
<p>When our method is applied to electrophysiological or imaging experiments from different hippocampal areas such as CA1, CA3, and the entorhinal cortex, it should be modified by, for example, changing the tuning parameters in the estimation (see ‘Tuning parameters’ section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Indeed, we should consider the possibility that the neuron–glia interactions are characterized by different biophysics in different brain regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-DePitt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Matyash1">[56]</xref> and hence are represented by different tuning parameter values in our method.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g003">Fig. 3B</xref> shows that about half the inter-neuronal and inter-glial interactions were positive and half were negative (i.e., the excitatory and inhibitory effects were balanced). The balanced excitatory and inhibitory effects in inter-neuronal interactions are known to lead to high levels of variability in neuronal spiking and this high variability can enable neuronal networks to embed rich information into their activity patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Shadlen1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Shadlen2">[58]</xref>. Our results suggest that this balance was not only achieved in inter-neuronal interactions but also in inter-glial interactions. Balanced inputs from the glial cells might similarly provide high levels of variability to glial activities and promote efficient information processing.</p>

<title>Comparison with other approaches</title>
<p>Our method of identifying the functional connectivity between neurons and glial cells is an extension of existing methods based on Granger causality. Granger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Granger1">[59]</xref> presented a model-based statistical approach to explore the causality between two variables by examining whether the prediction of a time series of one variable could be improved by incorporating information on the past values of the other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Lungarella1">[60]</xref>. Kim et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Kim1">[41]</xref> applied Granger causality to functional connectivity analysis of spike sequences; they performed a statistical test based on the log-likelihood of the autoregressive model of spike sequences. Our method presented in the current study can be seen as an extension of Kim et al.'s method that utilized the cross-validated likelihood for model selection. By use of the cross-validated likelihood, we could allow the actual underlying process to be different from the process hypothesized by GLM, while the original Granger causality-based method assumed that they were exactly the same.</p>
<p>Schleiber et al. presented another kind of model-free approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Stetter1">[36]</xref> to identify the causality between multiple variables. They utilized transfer entropy, which was used to measure improvements in the prediction of one time series by knowing the past values of another. No distribution of variables needs to be assumed because of the model-free computation of entropy in this approach. One possible drawback in the method of transfer entropy is that it can be difficult to incorporate effects in multiple variables and non-stationarity in the underlying stochastic process due to the lack of direct modeling. In contrast, we can apply our method to non-stationary activities of neurons and glial cells by introducing a time-varying spontaneous firing rate to the likelihood model (Eqs. (1) and (2)).</p>
<p>Our GLM is novel particularly in that it combines a Bernoulli point process model to represent binary neuronal spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Okatan1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Mishchenko1">[61]</xref> and a vector autoregressive model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Geweke1">[62]</xref> to represent graded glial activities. The vector autoregressive model has been widely accepted in the field of statistical time-series analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Hamilton2">[63]</xref>. Although both these models are known, there have never been any studies in neuroscience that have employed a hybrid stochastic model that could simultaneously deal with both discrete and continuous time-series like those in neuron-glia systems.</p>

<title>High-throughput of proposed method</title>
<p>The most important advantage of functional connectivity-based approaches is their high throughput. The functional connectivity-based approach enabled us to extract essential structures of the neuron–glia system even from a relatively small amount of data that consisted of 10-min time series of Ca2+ imaging in comparison with their pure anatomical connectivity-based counterparts, like those by electron microscopes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Chklovskii1">[64]</xref>. The reasonable performance of our method in artificial networks (85% accuracy from activity time series of 1280 s; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s008">Fig. S8</xref>; see ‘Validation using artificial data’ section of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s014">Text S1</xref>) suggests that our identified functional connectivities are biologically and statistically plausible. The functional connections estimated with our method are expected to approach true ones in the network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s008">Fig. S8</xref>) as the amount of data increases. If there are many unobservable neurons or glial cells, on the other hand, the meaning of functional connectivity may become ambiguous. However, the advantages of functional connectivity-based approaches will increasingly grow in various neuroscientific scenarios with rapid advances in <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> imaging techniques and increased access to more widespread and longer measurements. A possible future direction is to explore the fusion of functional connectivity-based methods and anatomical methods. Moreover, the response functions estimated with our method have a meaning on their own; they represent the entirety of synaptic connections that not only include ionic factors but also metabotropic factors.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>Limitations of proposed method</title>
<p>Our functional connectivity analysis was based on an assumption that the Ca2+ activities of cells were independent conditional on their history (see ‘Generative model and MAP estimation’ in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). This assumption was equivalent to ignoring neuron–glia interactions whose durations were shorter than the sampling interval (10 ms) in this study. Nevertheless, interactions with such a short time scale can play important roles in neuron–glia networks. An existing study that has proposed the max entropy model, for example, has discussed this possibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Tang1">[65]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Shimazaki1">[66]</xref>. For the following two reasons, however, we believe that our assumption will not negatively affect the reliability of our identification of the interactions with relatively long time scales (between 100 and 500 ms), which is the main target of our functional connectivity analysis.</p>
<p>First, we found that the intensity of our response functions were likely to shrink to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the delay time approached <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g006">Fig. 6</xref> (left)). This, in particular, means that high frequency responses did not take place around <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> ms. This ruled out the possibility for major interactions on shorter time scales because such interactions most likely triggered high frequency fluctuations in the response functions.</p>
<p>Second, our functional connectivity analysis was based on the difference in cross-validated likelihoods. It would have been unlikely that our abandonment of short term interactions would have severely deformed our computation of cross-validated likelihoods. Even if it had introduced some bias into their evaluations, the bias could be “cancelled out” as we took their differences into account. As such, our method was quite robust against bias that might have resulted from ignoring interactions on smaller time scales. It should be noted that the probability of multiple spikes in 10-ms bins was quite small because the spike frequency (below 1 Hz) in our observation time series was low.</p>
<p>We conducted 10-fold cross-validation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in the time-series analysis. Since we uniformly segmented the whole time series to subseries with a length of 60 s in the cross-validation procedure, interactions with time scales longer than 60 s were simply ignored.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3e">
<title>Bulk numbers of connections in surrogate method</title>
<p>Since the optimal network structure was searched by iterative applications of local searches and hence did not necessarily assess the whole set of identified connections, the bulk number of identified connections was statistically evaluated by means of the surrogate method in which null hypothesis assumed there were in fact no connections in the network (see ‘Surrogate method’section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Grn1">[67]</xref>. According to the surrogate method, we artificially created time series for neurons and glial cells separately by applying cyclical rotation to the original neuronal time series and phase randomization in the frequency domain to the original glial time series found in the observation dataset. The temporal relationships with other elements in the network were destroyed in the surrogate time series, while preserving important statistical features of its own like those in the distribution and autocorrelation. We then compared the number of connections identified by our method from the actual data against that with the surrogate time series, which led to a statistical evaluation of the bulk number of identified connections.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3f">
<title>Insignificant neuron-to-glia connections</title>
<p>Our functional connectivity analysis was based on iterative applications of local searches for the network structure with the largest cross-validated likelihood. Since multiple hypothesis testing underlies this algorithm, some connections might have been detected by chance even if there had in fact been no connections between neurons and glia. To examine the false positive detection, we used the surrogate method to determine whether the number of identified connections was larger than that found by chance (see ‘Surrogate method’ section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Grn1">[67]</xref>.</p>
<p>We found that the number of identified glia-to-neuron connections was significantly large through surrogate analysis, while that of the neuron-to-glia connections was not. Further, the small and inhibitory neuron-to-glia interactions were inconsistent with the excitatory interactions reported by preceding experimental studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schipke1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Newman2">[49]</xref>. This inconsistency may be reconciled if we consider the dependence of neuron-glia interactions on the frequency of neuronal firing. Such a frequency-dependent regulation has been discussed within the context of glia-to-neuron connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-DePitt1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Zorec1">[43]</xref>, and a similar regulation might also be realized in neuron-to-glia connections. Note that clear excitatory neuron-to-glia interactions were found through experiments that induced high frequency bursting activities in neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schipke1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Newman2">[49]</xref>. On the other hand, the frequency of neuronal activities in our imaging experiment was low (0.03 Hz–1 Hz). Thus, the excitatory neuron-to-glia interactions might have been too weak to have been detected in this low-frequency situation. It is also possible that the Ca2+ active region within the astrocyte's cell body and the sites of neuron-to-glia interactions were so far apart in our imaging experiment, which mostly measured the cell body, that it could not provide us with sufficient information to identify the actual neuron-to-glia connections.</p>

<title>Neuron-to-glia connections with positivity constraints</title>
<p>Although existing studies have shown that neural spikes cause an increase in glial Ca2+ activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Hamilton1">[3]</xref>, our functional connectivity analysis did not take this known fact into account. The results may change when we assume that all the neuron-to-glia interactions are excitatory. This assumption is equivalent to forcing the response functions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, from neurons to glial cells to be positive (see ‘Positivity constraints to response functions from neuron to glia’ section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We identified nine neuron-to-glia connections out of 288 pairs with the positivity constraints; we found functional connections from neurons to glial cells 2, 4, and 5, but no connections to other glial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s009">Fig. S9</xref>). When we validated the set of identified connections with the surrogate method, the <italic>p</italic>-value of the number of connections was too large to accept any neuron-to-glia connections. This suggests that, even under the new constraint, neurons do not directly affect glial cells when neurons and glial cells are spontaneously behaving. We compared the cross-validated likelihood between our original model (without the positivity constraints) and the modified model with the positivity constraints on the basis of the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We only considered the set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s corresponding to the pair of cells for which our method detected a functional connection. The standard error of the mean (SEM) of these <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the original model, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the modified model. These results indicate that the original model was better than the modified model support our speculation that the model with the positivity constraints did not necessarily capture the nature of the spontaneous <italic>in vitro</italic> activities of neurons and glial cells in the hippocampal CA3 circuit.</p>

<title>Pre-processing</title>
<p>We performed the Ca2+ imaging (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Fig. 1B</xref>) for 10 min (600 s) according to the experimental procedure above. Our imaging yielded a time-lapse image dataset that consisted of 60,000 image frames. The visual field of single image frames was 184 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>94 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (184<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>94 pixels). We extracted regions of interest (ROIs) in the first step of image preprocessing, as follows. We applied a spatial smoothing filter (2D Gaussian filter with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> = 1 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to each image in the time lapse. We calculated the average and standard deviation (SD) of fluorescence signals over the observation period for each pixel along this filtered image series. We then specified the neighborhood (a ball with a radius of 3 <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of each local maximum of the average fluorescence intensity as an ROI. We identified a total of 170 ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Fig. 1C</xref>). We computed the average signal intensity over the pixels in each of the 170 ROIs, and arranged the average signal intensity along the 60,000 frames that constituted the signal time series of the ROIs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). We then decomposed the signal time series into a baseline series and activity series on all the ROIs by iteratively applying the following procedure until the baseline series converged. Beginning with the initial baseline series set as flat at the average, we detected all the timepoints inside one SD of the baseline series as inliners, and replaced the baseline series with the new one connecting the inliners. We re-calculated the SD based on the new baseline series in the next application of this procedure. We then dissociated another baseline series. This baseline detection was in essence a detrending procedure; it removed the trends due to possible photo-bleaching. We defined spiking events as peaks of time series with substantially larger intensities than the baseline (with a fixed difference) for each ROI. We detected 48 ROIs out of the 170 ROIs, which indicated sufficient numbers of spiking events (0.03–1 Hz, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>). We confirmed these 48 ROIs corresponded to neuronal soma by visually inspecting them. The peaks of the neuronal Ca2+ spikes were found to have similar intensities, and we observed no buildup activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>). We therefore deemed it safe to interpret each Ca2+ spike with a width of 10 ms to be a single spike. As such, the activity over each of the 48 ROIs was recorded as a binary time series.</p>
<p>We selected six ROIs, other than the 48 neuronal ROIs, as regions representing glial cells, based on their morphologies (by visual inspection) and fluorescence levels. We particularly selected small cells with high fluorescence levels because such cells were likely to be astrocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Friston1">[34]</xref>. The radius of each ROI was re-set individually to a smaller value than that of the neurons because we only found six glial ROIs. We used the signal average over each glial ROI as the measure of glial activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>) and arranging it over 60,000 frames constituted the activity time series. We applied individual linear detrending to each glial time series to remove slow trends possibly induced by photo-bleaching. We then applied a temporal Gaussian filter (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to remove high frequency noise and shot noise. The glial time series thus obtained is depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003949-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>.

When we use the term Markov, our models of interest may include those in which the dependence of the current state on past states is non-linear.</p>
<p>Below, we provide the likelihood of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based on our generative model, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the parameter vector. Let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be its prior distribution. Bayes' theorem tells us that the posterior distribution of the parameter vector is given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Given an observation time series, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the parameter-vector estimate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that maximizes the posterior distribution (i.e., the MAP estimation). Our generative model is based on a Markov chain model where the neuronal and glial activities at present are assumed to be mutually independent but dependent on their past activities. More precisely, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the history of activities of all the components with a maximum time lag, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We allowed all neurons to have their own parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and all glial cells to have their own parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. That is, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Moreover, the maximum time lag, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, could be differently set for individual types of interactions (see below).</p>

<title>Prior distribution</title>
<p>Here, we explain our prior setting of the model parameters in our GLM. We introduced a prior distribution to the parameters representing the response functions, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to make the response functions sparse, which is preferred in avoiding overfitting to relatively small datasets, in addition to smoothing with respect to the lag time. Such a prior distribution is given by <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003949.e168"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e168" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where tuning constant <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> controls the L2-sparseness of the response functions and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> controls their smoothness. We granted independent, noninformative priors <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (Eqs. (1) and (2)). In summary, we put <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e175" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e176" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These parameters and their prior distribution are summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s012">Table S3</xref>.</p>
<p>The prior based on L2-sparseness would be preferable for increasing the cross-validated likelihood of the model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Wahba1">[71]</xref> by effectively reducing the sensitivity of the model to noise inevitably involved in a relatively small dataset. The smoothness prior would reduce the effective space in which the response functions exist and hence would be beneficial to improve the cross-validated likelihood. Although the time scales of neuron-glia interactions may span a wide range, fluctuating from several tens of milliseconds to several hours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Fellin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Min1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Perea1">[14]</xref>, our current study focused on specific types of interactions that lasted for several hundreds of milliseconds. Our prior setting that preferred smooth response functions was also considered to work in removing neuron-glia interactions with shorter time scales.</p>

<title>Efficient estimation of parameters</title>
<p>By applying Bayes' theorem to the likelihood and the prior distribution above, we have the following log posterior <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003949.e178"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e178" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>We obtained the parameter vector, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e179" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that maximized the log posterior above; the expression above suggests that this MAP estimation can be individually performed for each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e180" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and for each <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e181" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This individuality also suggests the ability to apply parallel computation to the estimation of parameters.</p>
<p>Fortunately, our set of MAP estimates is unique because our generative model is an instance of GLM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Bishop1">[72]</xref> and a strictly convex prior distribution also makes the posterior distribution convex. This allows us to use efficient optimization algorithms. When maximizing the first term in Eq. (4) with respect to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we used a limited-memory Broyden-Fletcher-Goldfarb-Shanno (BFGS) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Byrd1">[73]</xref>, which is a variation of a quasi-Newton method, to conserve the memory necessary for optimization. The second term in Eq. (4) is a convex quadratic function. We can therefore use a simple linear algebra to estimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Functional connectivity analysis</title>
<p>Our functional connectivity analysis between neurons and glial cells was based on a comparison of the cross-validated likelihood, i.e., the model's reproducibility for the activities in a validation dataset, between two different network structures. If there were two different network structures, one with a certain neuron-glia connection and another without the connection, and the latter demonstrated a larger cross-validated likelihood than the former, then, the connection was not considered to be included in our neuron-glia system. According to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-fold cross-validation with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> being 10, we partitioned the time series <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> into 10 subseries; we used nine of these subseries to train the model (“training dataset”), and calculated the model-likelihood of the one remaining subseries (“test dataset”) as the cross-validated likelihood of the model.

<p>When evaluating the connections from the <italic>j</italic>-th glial cell to neurons, we compared the cross-validated likelihood between two different network structures, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to which different constraints were introduced.

To construct a statistical test in a practical manner, therefore, we assumed that the difference in the neuron-wise, test-dataset-wise cross-validated likelihood, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, would obey a normal distribution with a zero mean and variance <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and designed a <italic>t</italic>-statistic: <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003949.e218"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e218" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the unbiased variance of the difference in the cross-validated likelihood, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, calculated in the cross-validation process. By simply assuming the normality of the stochastic variable, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we can make <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to follow a <italic>t</italic>-distribution. We can then rely on the standard <italic>t</italic>-test, when evaluating each connection from glial cell <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to neuron <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Indeed, this <italic>t</italic>-statistic assumption is not very accurate because the cross-validation samples are not independent of one another and the stochastic variable does not obey a normal distribution. However, the advantages of the <italic>t</italic>-statistic assumption on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> outweigh the disadvantages; we can evaluate the stochastic uncertainty of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> up to the second order moment by using this token.</p>
<p>We took the opposite approach when evaluating connections from neurons to a particular single glial cell, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We compared two different network structures in a similar way to that above with a fixed glial cell of interest, i.e., the <italic>i</italic>-th glial cell: the network with no neuronal connections to the glial cell (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and the network consisting of all possible connections. We defined the mean of differences in the glia-wise, test-dataset-wise cross-validated likelihood of the <italic>i</italic>-th glial cell by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e229" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>A <italic>t</italic>-statistic of the difference in the glia-wise cross-validated likelihood was similarly defined as <disp-formula id="pcbi.1003949.e230"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e230" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula></p>
<p>We treated the connections from glia to neurons differently from those from neurons to glia in this study. The main principle of our search for the optimal network structure was to begin the search from a network structure with the highest cross-validated likelihood possible (see ‘Methods Overview’ section in Results. Some details are also given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s014">Text S1</xref>). While the network structure with no neuron-to-glia connections exhibited a higher glia-wise cross-validated likelihood than the network structure with full neuron-to-glia connections (full network), the neuron-wise cross-validated likelihood of the full network was lower than that of the structure with no glia-to-neuron connections (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s001">Fig. S1</xref>). Also, we resorted to an incremental search algorithm by considering the intractability of a full search over the whole space of all possible network structures. The search algorithm we adopted converges to an optimal network structure if we begin the search from a heuristically chosen structure with a high cross-validated likelihood. The cross-validated likelihood of the network structure monotonically increases and necessarily converges in this search algorithm because we only adopt a new structure when the cross-validated likelihood increases whereas the number of possible network structures is huge but still finite.</p>

<title>Surrogate method</title>
<p>We explored a statistical test based on the surrogate method to statistically examine the number of detected connections under the null hypothesis of no causal connectivity. We need to construct surrogate neuronal or glial activities that might have been observed under the null hypothesis, only from the observation time series.</p>
<p>In order to evaluate the number of detected connections from the <italic>i</italic>-th glial cell to neurons, we generated the surrogate glial activity (Ca2+ signals) of the <italic>i</italic>-th glial cell (called the original glial cell below) 1000 times based on the Iterated Amplitude Adjusted Fourier Transform (IAAFT) method (for details, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s014">Text S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Schreiber1">[74]</xref>. This surrogate glial cell was assumed to have no connections to any neurons in the neuron-glia system, but all other parts of the system remained untouched. Surrogate glial activity in the IAAFT method was generated based on the randomization of phases in the activity time series of the original glial cell. Application of IAAFT to glial activity destroyed the mutual correlation between the original glial cell and all the other network components while preserving the amplitude distribution and the autocorrelation of the activity of the original glial cell (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). We obtained 1000 surrogate datasets by replacing the activity time series of the original glial cell with each of the 1000 surrogate glial activities. We then applied functional connectivity analysis to each of the 1000 surrogate datasets and computed the number of detected connections from the surrogate glial cell to neurons. The empirical distribution constructed from the 1000 surrogate datasets could serve as a null distribution built on the hypothesis that there were no functional connectivities from the original glial cell to neurons. We compared the number of actually detected connections based on the original glial cell's activity against the empirical distribution to compute the <italic>p</italic>-value of the original glial cell's activity.</p>
<p>In the construction of each surrogate neuronal activity, on the other hand, we applied a circular shift to the original neuronal spike time series. This type of implementation is preferable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Louis1">[75]</xref> because it can perturb the temporal relationship between neurons, whose activities are surrogated, and other components of the network while preserving its own statistics, such as the distribution of inter-spike intervals, autocorrelation, and self-dependence of the original neuronal activity.</p>

<title>Tuning parameters</title>

More concretely, we searched discretized candidates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the best values for both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e245" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e246" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e247" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e248" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e249" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e250" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for both <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e251" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e252" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to maximize the cross-validated likelihoods, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e253" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e254" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>Here, we applied the heuristic constraints to mainly reduce the search space of the tuning parameters. Such application of constraints is equivalent to having assumed that similar mechanisms govern all receptors on neuronal and glial cells. However, some studies have indicated the possibility that glial receptors might respond differently to neurons and glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003949-Sofroniew1">[15]</xref>. Therefore, we recomputed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e258" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e259" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> independently (with no constraints) to validate our heuristic constraint <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e260" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, while clumping all the other tuning parameters, and we found that the recomputed parameter values were equal to that with the constraint <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e261" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When we carried out the same validation for the constraint, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e262" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the optimal values without the constraint also yielded the same value as that with the constraint. Further, the overall characteristics of the response functions were found to be fairly robust against the large diversion in the smoothing parameter from its optimal value (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003949.s007">Fig. S7</xref>).</p>

<title>Positivity constraints to response functions from neurons to glia</title>

The parameter optimization (the MAP estimation) of the log posterior with our likelihood and prior distribution is equivalent to the minimization of a specific quadratic cost function.

<p><bold>Detection of neuron-to-glia connections by introducing positivity constraints to their response functions.</bold> We implemented a modified version of our method with positivity constraints on the response functions from neurons to glia. Likewise in the original method, we used the <italic>t</italic>-statistic, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003949.e314" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, to identify the connections. The modified method identified connections from some neurons to glia 2, 4, and 5 (marked in red). Under this new constraint, we could not detect any connection from neurons to glia 1, 3, and 6. The neurons indexed in green numerals in each panel indicate those with the identified connections to the glial cells marked red, whose removal degraded the cross-validated likelihood of the activity of the red-marked glial cells. The bottom right panel indicates the average for the estimated response functions of the identified neuron-to-glia connections, along with the 95% confidence interval at each delay time.</p>
