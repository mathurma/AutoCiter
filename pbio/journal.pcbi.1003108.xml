<abstract>
<p>Recent imaging studies of mitochondrial dynamics have implicated a cycle of fusion, fission, and autophagy in the quality control of mitochondrial function by selectively increasing the membrane potential of some mitochondria at the expense of the turnover of others. This complex, dynamical system creates spatially distributed networks that are dependent on active transport along cytoskeletal networks and on protein import leading to biogenesis. To study the relative impacts of local interactions between neighboring mitochondria and their reorganization via transport, we have developed a spatiotemporal mathematical model encompassing all of these processes in which we focus on the dynamics of a health parameter meant to mimic the functional state of mitochondria. In agreement with previous models, we show that both autophagy and the generation of membrane potential asymmetry following a fusion/fission cycle are required for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population. This health maintenance is affected by mitochondrial density and motility primarily through changes in the frequency of fusion events. Health is optimized when the selectivity thresholds for fusion and fission are matched, providing a mechanistic basis for the observed coupling of the two processes through the protein OPA1. We also demonstrate that the discreteness of the components exchanged during fusion is critical for quality control, and that the effects of limiting total amounts of autophagy and biogenesis have distinct consequences on health and population size, respectively. Taken together, our results show that several general principles emerge from the complexity of the quality control cycle that can be used to focus and interpret future experimental studies, and our modeling framework provides a road-map for deconstructing the functional importance of local interactions in communities of cells as well as organelles.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Mitochondria are the powerhouses of eukaryotic cells, oxidizing glucose to produce ATP. Most cells harbor tens to hundreds of mitochondria in a constant state of flux, in which they fuse with one another, undergo fission, import proteins to grow larger, and eventually are recycled by autophagy. These dynamic processes depend on the electrical potential that is maintained across the mitochondrial inner membrane and powers the production of both ATP and detrimental reactive oxygen species. How do mitochondria maintain high membrane potential in the face of damage due to reactive oxygen species? Here, we develop a model to study how the reorganization of mitochondrial networks in space and time due to fusion, fission, and the experimentally observed development of membrane potential asymmetry after fission affect overall mitochondrial health. We show that health, which is a proxy for the mitochondrial membrane potential, is dominated by how density and motility affect the frequency of fusion events, and that several simple rules for the system kinetics lead to optimal quality control. This model predicts general behaviors that can be applied to specific studies of mitochondrial dynamics in a wide variety of cell types, and provides a framework for deconstructing complex organellar organization and their function in human disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>All eukaryotic cells contain mitochondria, whose number and structure can vary substantially during the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mitra1">[1]</xref> and between cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Robin1">[2]</xref>. One of the primary functions of mitochondria is the production of ATP through utilization of the electrochemical potential across the inner membrane (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Rottenberg1">[3]</xref>. However, this process also produces reactive oxygen species (ROS), which can damage DNA and proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Balaban1">[4]</xref>. The input-output relation between membrane potential and ATP production is highly nonlinear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Nicholls1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Nicholls2">[6]</xref>, suggesting the importance of maintaining high membrane potential within an optimal range that results in high levels of ATP production with minimal ROS production. Indeed, mitochondria with low membrane potential are selectively degraded within autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Kim1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mitochondria are dynamic organelles that undergo frequent cycles of fusion and fission, leading to the formation of complex networks distributed heterogeneously across the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Chan1">[8]</xref>. The ultrastructure of the mitochondrial network varies significantly with cell type. Skeletal muscle cells contain long filamentous mitochondrial networks, while immune cells can contain large spherical mitochondrial aggregates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Chan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Detmer1">[9]</xref>. In normal rat kidney cells, mitochondria switch from a fragmented to a hyperfused state during the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mitra1">[1]</xref>. During periods of fusion, mitochondria exchange both soluble and membrane-bound components. The time scale of this exchange can vary significantly depending on the component being exchanged and its location in the mitochondrion; soluble matrix components mix rapidly (within seconds), while inner-membrane proteins mix on a time scale of tens of minutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Malka1">[10]</xref>.</p>
<p>Recent fluorescence microscopy studies have explored the relationship between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and mitochondrial fusion and fission in H9c2 cells, a subclone of a cell line derived from embryonic BD1X rat heart tissue that exhibits many of the properties of skeletal muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Kimes1">[11]</xref>, by simultaneously quantifying the levels of a <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-sensitive dye and of matrix-targeted photo-activateable green fluorescent protein (PA-GFP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig1">[12]</xref>. By photo-activating the PA-GFP in only a small proportion of the mitochondria within a given cell, fusion events can be directly observed via the transfer of activated PA-GFP into a dark matrix compartment and the equilibration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Fusion was observed to selectively involve mitochondria with high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig1">[12]</xref>. In addition, approximately 30% of fusion events were followed by a statistically significant difference in the membrane potentials of the two daughter mitochondria (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>); the mechanism behind the generation of this asymmetry in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is currently unknown. Importantly, this difference has a large impact on the relative capacities for ATP and ROS production of the two daughter mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Nicholls2">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Similar microscopy experiments on H9c2 cells revealed that the probability of fusion of two mitochondria in close contact was strongly dependent on whether one or both of the mitochondria were being actively transported at the time of contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Liu1">[13]</xref>. This study also distinguished two different classes of fusion, one that allows complete mixing of matrix components and another that allows only partial mixing (transient fusion) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Liu1">[13]</xref>. This transient fusion usually occurs when two mitochondria on different microtubules come into contact, while complete fusion occurs when mitochondria are either stationary or if they are on the same microtubule <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Liu1">[13]</xref>. This partial diffusion occurs mainly for membrane proteins, since diffusion of ions and soluble matrix proteins is very fast over the micron length scales of individual mitochondria, and suggests an absence of active mixing during fusion.</p>
<p>In support of the physiological importance of mitochondrial dynamics, the inhibition of fusion or fission leads to a deterioration of overall mitochondrial health in many organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig2">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Chen2">[16]</xref>. Deletion of mitochondrial fusion proteins Mfn1 and Mfn2 in mice is embryonically lethal, and the mitochondria in these mutant cells are fragmented and dysfunctional (depolarized with low ATP production) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Chen2">[16]</xref>. In the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, deletion of the mitochondrial fusion protein FZO1 results in fragmentation of the mitochondrial network and loss of respiratory function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Hermann1">[17]</xref>. A unifying hypothesis is that mitochondrial fusion-fission and autophagy form a quality-control axis that maintains mitochondrial health by segregating dysfunctional mitochondria into a separate pool of mitochondria that are unable to fuse, and undergo autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig2">[14]</xref>. Recent evidence suggests that mitochondrial motility plays a key role in each of the steps associated with mitochondrial quality control, including fusion, fission, biogenesis, and lysosomal function. Motility is affected by both normal changes in the cell's physiological state (e.g., during the cell cycle) and in pathologies such as neurodegeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Wang1">[18]</xref>, mutations in proteins such as the mitofusins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Chen2">[16]</xref> and Parkin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Wang2">[19]</xref>, and calcium homeostasis pathologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Wang1">[18]</xref>. Therefore, consideration of motility and the spatial distribution of the mitochondrial network is critical to address the effects of pathological changes on mitochondrial quality control.</p>
<p>A previous computational study of the effects of fusion, fission, and autophagy on mitochondrial health in the presence of ROS-mediated damage demonstrated that selective fusion and autophagy can result in stable average health of the mitochondrial population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mouli1">[20]</xref>. Moreover, post-fission asymmetry in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> led to a further health enhancement, by using selective autophagy to ratchet against damage. The model was used to demonstrate that selective fusion could be important as an isolation mechanism that allows autophagy to recycle dysfunctional mitochondrial components. A different model of the effects of reducing mitochondrial fusion as the cell ages proposed two separate modes of mitochondrial damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Figge1">[21]</xref>: stochastic damage similar to Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mouli1">[20]</xref> and infectious damage, which was conjectured to be the main cause of the rapid depolarization observed after fission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig1">[12]</xref>. These studies were important first steps in modeling mitochondrial network dynamics. However, they did not consider the spatial distribution of mitochondria, preventing them from addressing whether cytoskeletal motility and mitochondrial density strongly affect quality control. Moreover, their artificial implementations of fusion in which all unfused mitochondria could interact, regardless of position, made it more difficult to connect model kinetics to experimental parameters.</p>
<p>Here, we present a computational model that incorporates the spatial dynamics of mitochondrial networks into the quality control cycle of the mitochondrial population. Similar to Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mouli1">[20]</xref>, we simplify the physiology of mitochondrial function to a health parameter mimicking <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We show that the average health of the network is maximized when the fusion and autophagy processes have a common selective health threshold, suggesting a common mechanism of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-selectivity by the fusion and autophagy machinery. We also demonstrate that as long as the density of mitochondria is high enough to preserve a critical level of fusion, quality control is sufficient to maintain a healthy mitochondrial population. Moreover, the effect of any motion dependence of fusion can be understood simply as a shift in the effective fusion rate. In the absence of an active segregation mechanism, the molecular mechanism underlying the generation of asymmetry in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> must be relatively discrete to benefit health, involving at most only a few tens of units that can be exchanged. Finally, we find that restricting the maximal rate of autophagy primarily affects the health of the network, while restricting mitochondrial replication (biogenesis) primarily affects the population size. Taken together, these results can guide the interpretation of experiments by revealing the processes for which cellular health has the greatest sensitivity.</p>

<title>A model of stochastic, spatially dependent mitochondrial dynamics</title>
<p>We encompass the diverse range of mitochondrial network properties by simulating the dynamics of mitochondria that undergo autophagy, replication, fusion, fission (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), and transport along cytoskeletal filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Each simulation represents a cell initialized with a given number of mitochondria (Methods). Similar to a previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mouli1">[20]</xref>, we define a quantity for each mitochondrion that we will refer to as its “health,” which is a proxy for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The ATP-producing potential of a mitochondrion is correlated with its <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Nicholls1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Nicholls2">[6]</xref>. When <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is below 180 mV; ATP production only becomes nonlinear under stress, when the mitochondrion is hyperpolarized and respiration is slowed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Nicholls1">[5]</xref>. Our simulations thus most closely mimic cells in unstressed conditions, when lower <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is directly correlated with lower ATP production.</p>

<title>A cycle of fusion, fission, and autophagy contribute to quality control of mitochondrial health.</title>
<p>Each mitochondrion is represented as a set of discrete health units that are in either a healthy (green) or damaged (red) state. (1) Fusion joins two (or more) mitochondria into a connected entity, though each mitochondrion is assumed to retain its original identity. Only mitochondria above a particular health threshold are permitted to fuse. (2) Fused mitochondria undergo stochastic exchange of a fixed number of health units. This exchange can lead to an asymmetry in the health of fused mitochondria, which occurs when these mitochondria undergo fission. (3) Fission separates fused mitochondria into isolated mitochondria or mitochondrial subnetworks. (4) Autophagy removes isolated mitochondria when their health is below the autophagy threshold. (5) Damage to mitochondrial health sets a health unit to the damaged state. (6) New mitochondria are produced via the cumulative effects of protein synthesis and import, and this replication event generates a copy of an existing mitochondrion that appears in the same physical neighborhood with the same number of health units as the progenitor mitochondrion. The variables representing the rates of each process (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are shown next to their labels.</p>

<p>(A) We represent each mitochondrion as a circle with radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. (B) Each stationary mitochondrion can bind a cytoskeletal filament pointed in a random direction at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. (C) A mitochondrion attached to a filament moves at constant velocity <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> until it either unbinds at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or encounters another mitochondrion or the edge of the cell. (D) In the presence of fusion and fission, this model produces mitochondrial networks with structures qualitatively similar to those observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Autophagy of unfused mitochondria with poor health (orange) is critical for the establishment of functional mitochondrial networks, by allowing the replacement of dysfunctional mitochondria with healthy mitochondria that can still undergo fusion.</p>

<p>Mitochondria lose their metabolic function over the course of days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Chen3">[22]</xref>, although the specific cause of this loss is unclear. We treat the health of a mitochondrion as being composed of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> binary health units (HUs) that are either undamaged (1) or damaged (0); in each simulation, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is fixed for all mitochondria. We model the effects of this damage on each HU as a Poisson process with constant rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that switches an HU from undamaged to damaged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), mimicking the detrimental effects of ROS production on mitochondrial function. To determine the health of a given mitochondrion, we compute the sum of all the HUs and divide by the maximum number (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The limit of a continuous health quantity that mimics continuous <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can in principle be realized by taking <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be very large.</p>
<p>In our simulations, each mitochondrion behaves as an independent entity unless it is fused to another mitochondrion, in which case the fused mitochondria behave as one entity. Although fragmented mitochondria can have a distribution of sizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Ishihara1">[23]</xref>, we treat all networks as composed of individual mitochondria of a fixed size representing the average of this distribution. For computational simplicity, we represent each mitochondrion as a circle with radius <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Liu1">[13]</xref>. Mitochondria are too large to diffuse in a densely packed cell at any appreciable rate, and consequently rely on active transport by molecular motors along cytoskeletal filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Grafstein1">[24]</xref>. In our model, we treat active transport as persistent diffusion along a dense microtubule network that allows travel in any direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). In our simulations, we restrict motion to only unfused mitochondria. Each unfused mitochondrion is treated as either stationary or attached to a cytoskeletal filament. An unfused mitochondrion can bind to a microtubule at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from anywhere in the cell, and the direction of motion is chosen at random from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>). An attached mitochondrion moves at a constant velocity until it detaches from the filament at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or until it contacts another mitochondrion, at which time fusion can occur (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g002">Fig. 2C</xref>, Methods). Upon fission, the daughter mitochondria again behave as independent entities unbound to a cytoskeletal filament.</p>
<p>We consider the mitochondria to be spatially distributed across a two-dimensional, square-shaped cell, a reasonable approximation of common experimental imaging conditions with cells spread on adhesive surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Cuvelier1">[25]</xref>. We incorporate the necessity for direct contact during fusion by determining a fusion probability for each pair of mitochondria based on whether they are touching (Methods). The explicit incorporation of mitochondrial proximity in fusion dynamics is a key feature of our model that distinguishes it from previous models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mouli1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Figge1">[21]</xref>, and allows us to address experimental observations such as the dependence of fusion on intracellular mitochondrial transport. Selectivity is incorporated by only permitting fusion between mitochondria whose health exceeds a fusion threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Fused mitochondria undergo fission at a fixed rate (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) selected to reproduce the observed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> duration of fusion events in H9c2 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig2">[14]</xref>. In order to simulate the effects of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> asymmetry after fissioning, we exchange a set number of randomly chosen HUs between the two fissioning mitochondria. This strategy simulates partial diffusion of contents between the fused mitochondria that is interrupted by fission. It also helps to partially retain the original mitochondrial identity, as observed in fluorescence microscopy experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Liu1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Arimura1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig3">[27]</xref>. In these “kiss and run” events, fused mitochondria retain their pre-fusion spatial extents post-fission despite large changes in their membrane potentials, suggesting that such partial diffusion along with retention of mitochondrial identity is a critical component of mitochondrial function.</p>
<p>During autophagy, mitochondria are engulfed by autophagosomes and delivered to lysosomes for lysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Kim1">[7]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g002">Fig. 2D</xref>). Autophagy is selective; only dysfunctional mitochondria with lower <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and hence lower ATP production potential are targeted to autophagosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Kim1">[7]</xref>. Therefore, we model autophagy by removing mitochondria whose health is less than a given autophagy threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at a fixed rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where we have assumed that the number of autophagosomes is not limiting for mitochondrial turnover. In accordance with experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig1">[12]</xref>, we do not allow large mitochondria to undergo autophagy, since autophagosomes have a maximum size limit that we take to be a single, unfused mitochondrion.</p>
<p>The removal of mitochondria through autophagy is balanced by biogenesis, or replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Robin1">[2]</xref>. Although increases in mitochondrial mass typically occur through the process of continuous growth followed by fissioning, for simplicity we model replication as discrete events that occur at rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> involving the instantaneous doubling in size and then fissioning of one mitochondrion into two (Methods). Given that the mitochondrial biomass (population size) in many cells is roughly constant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Robin1">[2]</xref>, we assume that there is a metabolic limit to the replication rate in which replication asymptotically approaches zero as the population size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases according to<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003108.e042"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e042" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the typical number of mitochondria and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the variability in mitochondrial number.

<title>Autophagy is required for maintaining a healthy mitochondrial population</title>
<p>In order to study how the mitochondrial population size and average health are affected by changes to the processes captured by our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g001">Fig. 1</xref>), we simulated the network dynamics within cells seeded with an initial population of 150 unfused mitochondria.

However, the average health decreased more slowly than in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>, since autophagy selectively removed the unhealthy mitochondria from the cell. This decline in mitochondrial population size was counterbalanced by sufficiently high rates of biogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g003">Fig. 3C</xref>).

<p>(A) In the presence of damage alone, average mitochondrial health (red) decays exponentially. The dashed lines represent the 25th and 75th percentiles of health averaged over 25 independent simulations, while the shaded region represents one standard deviation above and below the average health across the simulations. The population size (blue) remains constant.

The wide range of healths near this transition point is due to the small numbers of mitochondria per cell.

<p>As reported in Ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mouli1">[20]</xref>, the average health can be substantially improved by selective fusion and asymmetric fission in conjunction with damage, autophagy, and replication (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). The exchange of HUs that occurs during fission stochastically leads to an asymmetry in the healths of the fissioning mitochondria. The probability of asymmetry development is highest when the two fused mitochondria have comparable healths, and when the number of HUs exchanged is half the total number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g004">Fig. 4</xref>).

<title>Limiting the rates of autophagy and replication affects health and mitochondrial population size in distinct manners</title>
<p>Biogenesis and autophagy are limited by protein synthesis, import across the mitochondrial membranes, and the number of autophagosomes. To implement these constraints in our model, we enforced maximal rates of autophagy and replication (Methods). We observed that increasing the maximal autophagy rate from very low values exerted a large impact on average health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>), indicating that maintenance of autophagy above a critical level may be crucial for removing damaged mitochondrial components, thereby allowing biogenesis of less-damaged mitochondria and leading to a healthier mitochondrial population. Over a wide range of the maximal autophagy rate, the cell maintained a constant number of mitochondria, while the steady-state average health saturated at a value determined by the damage rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g008">Fig. 8A</xref>).</p>

<title>Maximal autophagy and replication rates affect health and mitochondrial population size in distinct manners.</title>
<p>(A) Restricting the maximal autophagy rate causes a decrease in steady-state health with relatively little effect on population size, indicating that autophagy is critical to maintaining a healthy population. (B) In contrast, cells maintain high average health when the maximal replication rate is restricted, while the population size decreases. All damage rates are in units of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Discreteness is crucial for the effectiveness of membrane potential asymmetry</title>
<p>For the passive exchange mechanism in our model that generates asymmetry in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the effectiveness of segregation is determined not only by the fraction of HUs that are exchanged, but also by the total number of HUs per mitochondrion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which dictates the discreteness of the health parameter. To keep all other behaviors the same while changing the level of discreteness, we determined the average steady-state health by simultaneously varying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> while scaling the number of HUs exchanged during fission. In the absence of fusion, the proportion of exchanged HUs did not affect health, but average steady-state health decreased as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>). This occurred because the distribution of health narrowed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g009">Fig. 9Bi,iv</xref>) and hence the replacement of a dysfunctional mitochondrion by a healthy mitochondrion with health <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was less effective for health maintenance. Health sharply dropped at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; past this amount, the average health was substantially below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and hence the replication rate was not large enough to compensate for the loss of mitochondria due to autophagy.

<title>Maintenance of mitochondrial health requires a discrete health parameter.</title>
<p>(A) The average steady-state health of the mitochondrial population can be maintained above the autophagy threshold when the number of HUs per mitochondrion is small, but falls off rapidly to zero due to loss of mitochondria via autophagy as the total number of HUs increases toward a continuum health variable. When the rate of fusion is nonzero, cells can tolerate less discreteness in the health parameter (more HUs) due to the additional stochasticity introduced by fission and by sequestering mitochondria from autophagy while fused. (B) Histograms of the healths of mitochondria in simulations conducted with different maximum HU values and fusion rates (points labeled <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in (A)) show that the overall health depends on the distribution of mitochondria and this overall distribution is similar for a given average steady-state health as long as the fusion rate is nonzero.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.g009" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The relationship between the total number of HUs and the average steady-state health was more complex when fusion was allowed. Due to the fact that fused mitochondria are unable to undergo autophagy (Methods), higher fusion rates meant that a greater fraction of the mitochondria were temporarily protected from autophagy and hence cells could maintain an average steady-state health just below the autophagy threshold at higher values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Nevertheless, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increased, the average steady-state health again declined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g009">Fig. 9A</xref>), indicating that the efficacy of HU exchange decreased. Moreover, a sharp drop in health still occurred when the average health dropped below <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> due to the same narrowing of the distribution of health unit values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g009">Fig. 9B</xref>). Thus, our simulations indicate that a greater degree of discreteness of mitochondrial health results in higher health due to selective removal of mitochondria associated with the extremes of the distribution of individual healths.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The physical proximity of the mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA), RNA, and proteins to the ROS produced by mitochondria as a side effect of respiration makes them susceptible to damage via chemical interactions. For example, free radicals, including ROS, can cause deletions and base-pair substitutions in DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Balaban1">[4]</xref>, potentially rendering proteins encoded by the mtDNA ineffective or even detrimental. The formation of aggregates of misfolded proteins may also exert a toxic effect on the organelles, burdening metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Hashimoto1">[28]</xref>. To address cellular capacities for reducing mitochondrial dysfunction, we have developed a model of network dynamics that incorporates mitochondrial motion and spatial heterogeneity in two dimensions. Although this system of interactions between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, autophagy, fusion, fission, and cytoskeletal-mediated transport is complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g001">Fig. 1</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g002">2</xref>), the generality of our model has allowed us to address the relative importance of many potential factors regulating mitochondrial health. In the presence of selective autophagy, the benefits of the generation of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> asymmetry during the fusion/fission cycle substantially boost mitochondrial health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g003">Fig. 3</xref>,<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g004">4</xref>). During each cycle, the potential to create a healthier and a less healthy mitochondrion from a pair of mitochondria with average health leads to a increase in the average health of the population once autophagy removes the mitochondrion of lower health from the population. In addition, we demonstrated that the optimal operating point for maximal health occurs when the thresholds <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), suggesting that the molecular mechanism underlying fusion selectivity may act in opposite manners on the autophagy machinery. Indeed, there is evidence that mitochondrial autophagy and fusion are both linked to the transmembrane protein OPA1, suggesting that its concentration may positively and negatively affect fusion and autophagy, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig3">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Within the extensive parameter space of our model, we have extracted several simple rules that determine the region of optimal mitochondrial health. Average health is only weakly dependent on density as long as a minimal level of fusion is maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Moreover, imposing a motion dependence on the fusion rate mainly rescaled the effective fusion rate and thereby adjusted health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). These results both suggest that the frequency of fusion events is a relevant metric for evaluating the consequences of perturbations to mitochondrial dynamics on health, and motivate its quantification in future experimental studies. Moreover, the cell may have limits on the absolute number of fusion events, due to the costs of expression for fusion and fission proteins. Our simulations demonstrate that the cell can enhance fusion rates by actively regulating mitochondrial density and motility. Illustrating the importance of autophagy and replication to health maintenance, our simulations also showed that limiting the maximal rate of autophagy to below the damage rate resulted in a sharp decrease in health, while limiting the replication rate caused a decline in population numbers without affecting health (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g008">Fig. 8</xref>). Where possible, we have used experimentally relevant parameters in our model, and our results are generally robust to changes of large changes of parameters. Moreover, specific details of a given experimental system such as experimentally measured kinetics can be easily incorporated to investigate differences in behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Karbowski1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Molina1">[30]</xref>. Future experiments in a wide range of cell types will help to elucidate which behaviors are universal, for which our model will provide a framework for revealing the underlying mechanisms.</p>
<p>The membrane potential <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is an experimental readout of the ability of mitochondria to produce ATP. In the interests of simplicity and generality, we have used the health parameter as a proxy for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which itself is a function of many components such as the electron transport chain, the number of ATPases utilizing <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, proton leaks across the inner mitochondrial membrane, and other geometric factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Perry1">[31]</xref>. Although the health of a mitochondrion may be directly correlated with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, it would be better represented as a discrete variable if it is a function of a discrete underlying quantity affecting <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such as the healthy mtDNA copy number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Kukata1">[32]</xref>. In the absence of an active mechanism for the development of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> asymmetry, our simulations indicate that the underlying quantity being exchanged during fission must be a unit that exists in small numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g009">Fig. 9</xref>), such as a mtDNA molecule or a protein aggregate. By condensing “health” into a single parameter, we have systematically analyzed the effects of mitochondrial network dynamics. However, our current model does not address complementarity, the fusion-mediated exchange of different levels of various proteins and solutes between mitochondria, which has also been suggested as another potential benefit of mitochondrial fusion and fission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Detmer1">[9]</xref>. In future work, this aspect could be explored by increasing the number of parameters that define the health of a mitochondrion.</p>
<p>This study lays the framework for future simulations of the role of mitochondrial network dynamics in the quality control of mitochondrial health. In comparison with previous models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Mouli1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Figge1">[21]</xref>, which have proven useful for elucidating the systems-level importance of mitochondrial dynamics, we have specifically incorporated the need for spatial proximity and the role of motility in fusion, and thus have the capacity to study how the spatial extent and motility of the mitochondria affect quality control. Furthermore, we have explicitly modeled biogenesis as a separate metabolic process, allowing us to address how population size is stabilized in the presence of mitochondrial turnover. Although we have made simplifying assumptions such as a two-dimensional framework, a square cell geometry, and the absence of intracellular structures such as organelles, our model is easily extended to address more complex cell morphologies and structures that sterically exclude mitochondria. Future work will focus on specific cellular phenomena, such as the spatial heterogeneity of the cytoskeleton and autophagosomes. In addition, our model was implemented to mimic a relatively static cell that maintains a roughly constant number of mitochondria; future investigations will include the increase in mitochondria required for growing and dividing cells. Finally, mitochondrial turnover provides a model for how interactions among the members of a community can enhance collective fitness at the cost of sacrificing individual members, and a computational framework for studying such systems may similarly illuminate key features of system optimality.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>For each set of parameters (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003108-t001">Table 1</xref>), we carried out 25 independent simulations to approximate the size of a population of cells and the level of stochasticity present in a typical experimental study of mitochondrial network dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Twig3">[27]</xref>. Each simulation represented a cell initialized with 150 mitochondria, an intermediate population size across different mammalian cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003108-Robin2">[33]</xref>. The mitochondria were initially distributed randomly throughout the cell such that they did not overlap. The autophagy process removes a mitochondrion from the simulation; since fused mitochondria are not subject to autophagy in our simulations, our definition of an individual mitochondrion is the largest possible unit for autophagy, and varying that unit size would be similar to varying the mitochondrial population size or density (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003108-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). The replication process selects a mitochondrion at random and generates a new mitochondrion with the same health as its progenitor. For the replication rate in <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1003108.e042">Eq. 1</xref>, we set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; our results were insensitive to changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003108.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Two strategies were tested for the placement of a new mitochondrion: randomly throughout the cell, or nearby the progenitor. In the latter case, a location within a certain radius of the progenitor is selected at random that does not overlap with other mitochondria. Both strategies converged on quantitatively similar results and hence we used the first strategy for simplicity.</p>

This restriction was only lifted when the running event counter fell below the allowed number, thus preserving the stochastic nature of autophagy and replication while limiting the allowed number of events.</p>
<p>Mitochondrial transport was simulated as a persistent diffusion process in which mitochondria bind to cytoskeletal filaments and move at a constant velocity until they either stochastically unbind from the filament or run into another mitochondrion or the edge of the cell. For simplicity, we ignored any organelles or other spatial features inside the cell, such as the nucleus, that might impede mitochondrial transport; such features would be straightforward to introduce in future extensions of the model. During each time step, each pair of touching mitochondria had the potential for fusion.
