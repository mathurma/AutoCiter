<abstract>
<p>There is great interest in increasing proteins’ stability to enhance their utility as biocatalysts, therapeutics, diagnostics and nanomaterials. Directed evolution is a powerful, but experimentally strenuous approach. Computational methods offer attractive alternatives. However, due to the limited reliability of predictions and potentially antagonistic effects of substitutions, only single-point mutations are usually predicted <italic>in silico</italic>, experimentally verified and then recombined in multiple-point mutants. Thus, substantial screening is still required. Here we present FireProt, a robust computational strategy for predicting highly stable multiple-point mutants that combines energy- and evolution-based approaches with smart filtering to identify additive stabilizing mutations. FireProt’s reliability and applicability was demonstrated by validating its predictions against 656 mutations from the ProTherm database. We demonstrate that thermostability of the model enzymes haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase LinA can be substantially increased (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> = 24°C and 21°C) by constructing and characterizing only a handful of multiple-point mutants. FireProt can be applied to any protein for which a tertiary structure and homologous sequences are available, and will facilitate the rapid development of robust proteins for biomedical and biotechnological applications.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Proteins are increasingly used in numerous biotechnological applications. A key property determining proteins’ applicability is their stability under operating conditions. Natural proteins can be stabilized by modification of their structure. Methods of molecular biology allow introduction of modifications–mutations–to the protein structure at will, but it is not straightforward where to mutate and which amino acid to introduce for better stability. Computational methods can be used for prediction of stabilizing mutations using computers. Current computational methods predict libraries of single-point mutations, which need to be constructed individually, tested and recombined, resulting in non-trivial experimental effort. Here we present a robust computational strategy for predicting multiple-point mutants, providing extremely stabilized proteins with a minimal experimental effort.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proteins are increasingly used in biotechnological applications as therapeutics [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], diagnostics [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>], nanomaterials [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>] and biocatalysts [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]. Despite numerous advantages, the utility of proteins is frequently restricted by their limited stability under practical conditions, such as high temperatures, extreme pH, or the presence of organic solvents or proteases. Their thermostability is usually positively correlated with stability and performance in the presence of denaturing agents [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>], expression yield [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref005" ref-type="bibr">5</xref>], serum survival time [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref006" ref-type="bibr">6</xref>] and shelf-life [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>]. Thus, it is a key determinant of proteins’ applicability in biotechnological processes. High temperatures may also be required to prevent bacterial contamination during enzymatic food processing [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. Moreover, thermostable proteins can tolerate much larger numbers of mutations than mesophilic variants and show enhanced evolvability in protein engineering projects [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref009" ref-type="bibr">9</xref>].</p>
<p>Protein engineering is frequently applied to obtain more stable proteins. If successful, such efforts typically enhance the melting temperature (<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) of engineered proteins by 2 to 15°C [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Extremely stabilized proteins with even greater increases in melting temperature (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>) have been engineered by incorporating multiple mutations, and several outstanding increases of up to 35°C have been achieved using directed evolution methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>]. However, these methods generally require extensive experiments, including screening up to 10<sup>8</sup> colonies of organisms expressing mutant variants to identify stable constructs, and appropriate high-throughput screening assays must be available [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. A currently popular strategy is saturated mutagenesis of hotspots identified by (semi-)rational approaches [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], such as the most flexible residues [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]; tunnel-forming residues [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>]; or residues at multimeric interfaces [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>]. The selected hotspots are then subjected to site-saturation mutagenesis (while leaving the rest of the protein unchanged) to create smaller smart libraries, markedly reducing the required screening to thousands of colonies.</p>
<p>A long-sought alternative to screening-based approaches is reliable <italic>in silico</italic> design of stability-enhancing mutations. Numerous stable proteins have been computationally engineered via diverse approaches (singly or in combination), e.g., identification of back-to-consensus or ancestral mutations, calculation of changes in folding free energies upon mutation, introduction of disulfide bridges and elimination of highly flexible regions [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. However, mutants generated using computational methods have rarely surpassed the 15°C Δ<italic>T</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> threshold of outstanding stabilization as a result of neutral, destabilizing or function-corrupting mutations that were predicted as stabilizing due to moderate accuracy of these methods [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>]. To overcome this obstacle and provide substantial stabilization, predicted mutations are usually introduced by site-directed mutagenesis and tested individually. The most viable mutations are then recombined in multiple-point mutants assuming they have additive effects, but this is often invalid due to antagonistic epistatic effects of individual mutations [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref017" ref-type="bibr">17</xref>]. For all those reasons, no computational method capable of directly designing highly stable multiple-point mutants has been previously published.</p>
<p>Here we introduce a strategy, FireProt, for computationally designing multiple-point mutants, enabling significant improvements of protein stability with minimal experimental effort. We demonstrate its power by stabilizing the model proteins haloalkane dehalogenase (HLD) DhaA and γ-hexachlorocyclohexane dehydrochlorinase LinA. The method’s general applicability was further verified by validation against information from the ProTherm database [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref018" ref-type="bibr">18</xref>], demonstrating that it can be used to identify stabilizing mutations in diverse proteins with known tertiary structures and homologous sequences allowing phylogenetic analysis, and thus should have broad utility in protein stabilization projects.</p>

<title>Development of FireProt strategy for design of stabilizing multiple-point mutants</title>
<p>The FireProt strategy for protein stabilization is based on combining the best multiple-point mutants obtained from predictions of ΔΔG following mutation from a set of crystal structures and evolutionary information derived from multiple sequence alignment (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Additional pre- and post-processing filters are applied in both approaches to improve prediction reliability and reduce the required computational effort.</p>

<title>Dataset construction</title>
<p>FireProt’s capacity to identify the most stabilizing single point mutations either by energy- or evolution-based approaches was evaluated using the dataset derived from the ProTherm database employing the records with absolute ΔΔG values ≥ 0.5 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>. This value was selected since the estimated experimental error for measurements of ΔΔG is about 0.48 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When multiple ΔΔG values were available for a single mutation, the value determined closest to the standard experimental conditions was retained. Ten most mutated proteins from the ProTherm database, representing all four protein structural classes (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>), were selected to increase the chance that predicted mutations will be experimentally characterized. The total number of possible mutations in these 10 proteins was 30,058, but good quality experimental data were available for only about 2% of the mutations, yielding the dataset of 656 mutations (119 stabilizing and 537 destabilizing) at 337 different positions (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Optimization of energy-based approach</title>
<p>We evaluated the performance of four prediction tools: FoldX [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>], Rosetta [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>], ERIS [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>] and CUPSAT [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>], using the ProTherm dataset (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The purpose was to select suitable combination of tools and the thresholds of predicted energy change upon mutation that would achieve very high precision (the ratio between the truly stabilizing mutations and mutations predicted as stabilizing) and simultaneously very low false positive rate (the fraction of destabilizing mutations incorrectly predicted as stabilizing from all truly destabilizing mutations). The stability change thresholds were tested in the range between -2.5 and +2.5 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> with the step size 0.5 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>. According to this evaluation, Rosetta and FoldX achieved the highest precision, 76% and 67%, respectively, when using the thresholds of -2 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> and -1 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The false positive rates for these thresholds for Rosetta and FoldX were 1% and 2%, respectively (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec006">
<title>Evaluation of energy-based approach</title>
<p>Combination of the prediction by the two best performing tools using their optimal thresholds with conservation analysis by Rate4Site tool [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>] in the energy-based FireProt approach performed notably better than either Rosetta or FoldX alone: FireProt achieved 100% precision and 0% false positive rate. Such high reliability in prediction was achieved at the expense of the number of recognized stabilizing mutations. Rosetta and FoldX correctly identified 16 and 20 truly stabilizing mutations out of 21 and 30 mutations predicted by these tools as stabilizing (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). However, only 8 mutations were agreed upon as stabilizing by both methods following the FireProt strategy. Conservation analysis discarded 2 false positive mutations since they targeted immutable positions with high CONSURF conservation grade (≥ 8) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>]. The remaining 6 mutations selected by FireProt as stabilizing were all true positives. In addition to 6 mutations included in the evaluation, the FireProt predicted other 101 stabilizing mutations for 10 most mutated proteins for which, however, experimental data were not available (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec007">
<title>Evaluation of evolution-based approach</title>
<p>In addition to the energy-based approach, the evolution-based approach of FireProt strategy was also evaluated using the ProTherm dataset. The back-to-consensus method [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref027" ref-type="bibr">27</xref>] identified six potentially stabilizing mutations in the 10 most mutated proteins for which experimental data were available. Four of these mutations were true positives and two were false positives. The subsequent application of the FoldX filter (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>) correctly discarded one of the false positive mutations, giving a precision of 80%.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Evaluation of prediction for multiple-point mutants</title>
<p>The last step in the development of the FireProt workflow before its application towards a design of thermostable proteins was to evaluate Rosetta’s ability to predict the stability effects for multiple-point mutations. We collected a consistent dataset of previously measured stability changes in 46 mutants of DhaA enzyme for this purpose. Using this dataset a correlation of 0.81 between the predicted ΔΔG and experimentally determined <italic>T</italic><sub><italic>m</italic></sub> values was observed, suggesting that Rosetta could be employed for this purpose (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Design of thermostable haloalkane dehalogenase DhaA</title>
<p>DhaA enzyme was selected as the first model protein due to the wealth of knowledge available on mutants engineered towards higher thermostability, prolonged half-life and stability in organic co-solvents that enables quantitative comparison of their performance with the mutants designed by FireProt [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>].</p>
<sec id="sec010">
<title>Energy-based approach</title>
<p>Out of 5,529 possible single-point mutations, 1,919 were at positions with high evolutionary conservation (CONSURF grade ≥ 8) or exhibiting evolutionary correlation with other residues (Correlated Mutation Analysis score ≥ 0.8 calculated by Comulator tool [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>]), indicating that these positions are functionally important. All these mutations were discarded to avoid major changes in the enzymes’ activity or substrate specificity. FoldX analysis of ΔΔG for the remaining 3,610 mutations identified 151 potentially stabilizing single-point mutations. Rosetta calculation was then applied to further decrease the number of potentially false positives among these mutations, resulting in 22 promising mutations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Table</xref>). A mutation disrupting a salt bridge and five with antagonistic effects (ΔΔG of double-point mutants &gt; -3.0 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>) were also discarded, leaving 16 potentially stabilizing mutations. Only the most favorable mutations at each position were further analyzed for their mutual interactions, leaving a final set of eight potentially non-antagonistic stabilizing mutations: C128F, T148L, A172I, C176F, D198W, V219W, C262L and D266F (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). The Rosetta predicted high stability of the recombined multiple-point mutant DhaA112 carrying all these mutations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>The back-to-consensus approach employing simple consensus and frequency ratio predictions identified 42 potentially stabilizing substitutions (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s008" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s011" ref-type="supplementary-material">S8</xref> Tables). Of these, 22 were excluded by FoldX predictions as potentially destabilizing (ΔΔG &gt; 0.5 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup>), and seven to preserve residues with side-chains involved in important interactions. In total, 13 back-to-consensus mutations passed all of the applied filters and were combined into four multiple-point mutants (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). These mutations were combined according to their different origin from two applied consensus techniques using either representative MSA of the HLD-II subfamily or MSA of whole HLD family (see <xref rid="sec022" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> for more details). DhaA100 featured the I136L, V184E and V197E mutations, which were predicted by both simple consensus and frequency ratio analyses of the representative MSA of the HLD-II subfamily. DhaA101 contained the mutations E20S, F80R and A155P, which were predicted solely by the frequency ratio analysis, while DhaA102 included the mutations L161M, I162V and D198S, which were predicted solely by the simple consensus analysis. Finally, DhaA103 contained the V55L, A127V, H188A and E191A mutations, which were predicted by simple consensus analysis of the representative MSA of the whole HLD family. Interestingly, none of these mutants was predicted to be more stable than the wild-type by Rosetta (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Expression and purification of all constructed mutants resulted in good yields and protein purity. Far-UV CD spectra of wild-type and mutants show that none of the mutations caused significant changes in secondary structure (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>) and all tested variants were active with 1-iodohexane at 37°C (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The constructed variants’ thermostability was determined by thermally-induced denaturation using DSC (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>) and CD spectroscopy (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2A Fig</xref>). A substantial increase in melting temperatures (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> 16.2°C) was observed for variant DhaA112 designed by the energy-based approach, indicating strong stabilization effects of the introduced mutations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). The effect of the consensus substitutions was moderate–only two tested variants, DhaA101 and DhaA103, showed positive thermostabilization effects (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> 9.6 and 2.3°C), while the mutations in DhaA100 and DhaA102 had neutral or destabilizing effects (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>). Combining the best energy-based mutant (DhaA112) with the best mutant identified by the evolution-based approach (DhaA101) produced a final mutant, DhaA115. Effects of the evolution-based substitutions were complementary and additive with those predicted by the energy-based approach, giving an outstanding increase in thermostability: Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> 24.6°C (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t001" ref-type="table">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of the final combined mutant</title>
<p>The combined mutant DhaA115 was characterized in detail, in terms of its thermostability in the presence of organic co-solvents, half-life at elevated temperature and temperature profile. The <italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> determinations show that the mutations had stabilizing effects in the presence of three organic co-solvents comparable to those in the pure buffer (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub>: 20 to 26°C; <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3A</xref>). The enhanced thermostability was also reflected in a strongly improved half-life at 60°C (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). After seven days incubation at 60°C, the mutant DhaA115 still retained about 50% of its initial activity, while the wild-type became inactivated within six hours. Two inactivation phases were observed for all DhaA variants: rapid initial inactivation followed by a slower decay of activity (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3B</xref>). The wild-type lost around 80% of its activity in the first fast phase, while the mutations in DhaA115 reduced the loss during the first inactivation phase to only 30%. The rate of inactivation during the first phase was comparable for both wild-type and DhaA115, while the rate during the second phase was dramatically (100-fold) slower for the mutant. Similar effects were observed with a previously reported stable variant of DhaA63 (denoted Dhla8) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>] constructed using Gene Site-Saturation Mutagenesis (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s003" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Fig</xref>). The apparent optimal temperature shifted from 45°C for the wild-type enzyme to 65°C for the mutant DhaA115, and its specific activity with 1-iodohexane at optimum temperature was 28% higher, but the shape of the temperature profile remained largely unchanged (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3C</xref>). Steady-state kinetic constants of the two enzymes determined at their respective suboptimal temperatures with 1-iodohexane revealed comparable catalytic properties (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t002" ref-type="table">Table 2</xref>).</p>

Comparison of the far-UV CD spectra of LinA wild-type and its mutants show that none of the mutations caused significant changes in secondary structure (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). Both LinA variants retained similar level of specific activity as LinAwt (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) showing that the introduced mutations did not alter activity negatively. The thermostability of the constructed LinA variants was determined by thermally-induced denaturation using both DSC (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>) and CD spectroscopy (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2B Fig</xref>). Similar to the energy-based DhaA variant, the energy-based LinA variant (LinA01) showed a substantial increase in melting temperatures (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> 20.9°C) again showing the strong stabilization effects of the introduced mutations (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). The evolution-based mutant (LinA02) showed small decrease in thermostability (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> -3.7°C) indicating that mutations identified by consensus methods are not conserved to preserve the stability of the enzyme (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.t003" ref-type="table">Table 3</xref>). No combined mutant was constructed due to the absence of stable evolution-based mutations.</p>

<title>Stabilizing mutations in DhaA</title>
<p>Out of 11 mutations, 3 residues are lining a main transport tunnel, 3 mutated residues were buried in the protein core and 5 are exposed to solvent on the protein surface (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>). 8 mutations identified by the energy-based approach introduce bulkier, more hydrophobic residues (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>) that probably enhance stability by improving packing of atoms in the protein interior and/or strengthening hydrophobic interactions. The contributions to stability of the mutations proposed by the evolution-based approach are more difficult to explain. The A155P mutation (at the fourth most flexible position in the protein structure) could increase rigidity by introducing proline to the affected loop and account for most of the observed stability improvement, while effects of the E20S and F80R mutations are probably neutral or restructuring the charged network on the surface of DhaA (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s014" ref-type="supplementary-material">S11 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The last decade has seen significant advances towards more rational approaches to reduce the experimental effort required to engineer highly stable proteins (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Table</xref>). As a contribution to these efforts we have developed a hybrid strategy integrating energy-based and evolution-based approaches, with smart filtering of mutations that are destabilizing or may impair enzymes’ functions, enabling the identification of additively stabilizing substitutions in multiple-point mutants. It is essential to correctly configure all of the tools used in both the energy- and evolution-based approaches of the FireProt workflow in order to achieve robust and reliable predictions. Therefore, individual steps of the workflow were verified using a dataset featuring diverse proteins from the ProTherm database. The predictions carried out for 656 mutations confirmed the FireProt's precision: the energy- and evolution-based approaches identified stabilizing mutations with success rates of 100% and 80%, respectively. Strikingly, only one stabilizing mutation that exceeded our thresholds was identified by both approaches, suggesting that they are highly complementary. The potential downside of the stringent conditions imposed to avoid false positives was that 92% of the available stabilizing mutations were discarded. However, the remaining correctly identified stabilizing mutations should be more than sufficient to construct highly stable catalysts (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S3 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>When the energy-based approach was applied to DhaA and LinA enzymes, the removal of conserved and correlated positions from analysis helped to avoid modification of structurally and functionally important residues, thereby greatly reducing the number of possible mutations requiring evaluation by computationally intensive free energy calculation. Since FoldX computation is about an order of magnitude faster than Rosetta, it was applied as a pre-filter, further reducing numbers of mutations to be analyzed by Rosetta. Regarding the prediction of multiple-point mutants, simple recombination of the most promising mutants could weaken stabilization, since strong antagonistic effects were detected even at the level of double-point mutants. The thermostability enhancement for the eight- and four-point mutants predicted by this approach, DhaA112 (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> 16°C) and LinA01 (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> 21°C), both exceeded the threshold for outstanding stabilization, although none of the introduced mutations optimized either hydrogen bonds or charge-charge interactions. This may be due to sampling limited rotamer libraries during the calculations and the requirement for both FoldX and Rosetta to unambiguously evaluate selected mutations as stabilizing. FoldX and Rosetta employ simplified scoring functions and despite using three protein structures for analysis, only limited protein flexibility is allowed, implying that it should be possible to supplement mutations proposed by free energy calculations with beneficial substitutions identified using different principles.</p>
<p>To this end, additional mutations were selected by the evolution-based approach. The mutations predicted by the back-to-consensus method were filtered by FoldX to discard mutations proposed due to function-related evolutionary constraints rather than structural stabilization. This filtering step proved to be very important as over half of the mutations were discarded as potentially destabilizing. Interestingly, all five multiple-point mutants DhaA100-DhaA103 and LinA02 were predicted as destabilizing by Rosetta and had to be tested experimentally. While this prediction was accurate for three of them (DhaA100, DhaA102 and LinA02), the other two mutants (DhaA101 and DhaA103) were clearly more stable than the wild-type. This result suggests that some underlying principles important for stability detected by the back-to-consensus method are not captured by the applied Rosetta protocol. We speculate that these may include larger backbone rearrangements, interactions with ions present in the solvent, or other entropic contributions that are not well accounted for in the current protocols. Experimental characterization of these mutants by microcalorimetry, temperature-jump stopped-flow and protein crystallography is currently on-going in our laboratory. Despite its lower reliability, the evolution-based approach should still be considered as useful supplement to the energy-based approach, potentially enabling further improvement in the stability of designed proteins. The final 11-point mutant DhaA115 arising from this hybrid prediction strategy is one of the most stable HLD protein known to date (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> &gt; 24°C) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref030" ref-type="bibr">30</xref>].</p>
<p>We have compared our strategy against several methods providing exceptional protein stabilization (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Table</xref>). The experimentally intensive protocols of directed evolution and hot-spot predictions can provide engineered enzymes with comparable enhancement. However, since their success rate is generally below 1%, stable proteins can only be obtained after extensive screening. Notably, two of these studies also focused on improving stability of the enzyme DhaA. In one, an eight-point mutant DhaA was obtained with a Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 18°C after screening all 121,000 possible variants [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref028" ref-type="bibr">28</xref>]. We have obtained a clearly superior enzyme after experimental evaluation of as few as six mutants, highlighting the importance of removing mutations with antagonistic and uncertain stabilizing effects. In the other study performed with DhaA, four hotspots in an access tunnel were experimentally randomized, requiring experimental screening of 5,000 mutations [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and the Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> for the best four-point mutant was 19°C.</p>
<p>Highly stable proteins have been obtained by <italic>in silico</italic> prediction of stabilizing effects of single-point mutations in four recently published studies [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>]. In one, 67 variants of epoxide hydrolase with mutations identified as potentially stabilizing by the FRESCO method were experimentally tested, 24 were reportedly more stable than the parent protein, and the variant with the best permutation of mutations had remarkably enhanced thermostability (Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> 36°C) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. Much of this enhancement arose from disulfide bridges at the dimer interface, making this approach particularly suitable for multimeric proteins. In another of the studies, four out of six engineered methionine aminopeptidases designed by the Rosetta<sub>VIP</sub> method were found to be stabilizing and a combined five-point mutant reportedly had a Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> of 18°C [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>]. The authors noted that their final construct is still less stable than the most thermostable native aminopeptidases and that the method is particularly effective for mutagenesis of buried residues around internal cavities. In the other study, a 12-point mutant of Tobacco 5-epi-aristolochene synthase was generated using the SCADS method with an impressive Δ<italic>T</italic><sub>m</sub> (45°C), but at the expense of 98% of catalytic activity at the optimal temperature [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. In comparison to the methods applied in these and other relevant studies (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.s015" ref-type="supplementary-material">S12 Table</xref>), FireProt affords a reduction of experimental screening effort due to robust identification of stabilizing mutations and ensuring their additivity. In addition, it has promising applicability to diverse proteins, potentially all proteins with known tertiary structure and homologous sequences, due to the diverse locations of introduced mutations and universal applicability of underlying principles.</p>
<p>In summary, the presented hybrid strategy FireProt affords rapid design of stable proteins. Consideration of the additivity of identified potentially beneficial mutations enables prediction of multiple-point mutants with significantly enhanced stability. Despite a dramatic reduction in experimental effort, the workflow provided two proteins with outstanding stability. One of them a HLD with greater thermostability than all known HLD enzymes, either obtained from thermophilic organisms or engineered using extensive combinatorial screening. Furthermore, owing to the smart filtering, this strategy is affordable by users with limited access to powerful computer facilities. In addition, implementation of the FireProt strategy in the web-based protein engineering tool Hotspot Wizard [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>] is currently on-going in our laboratory to ensure user convenience.</p>

<title>Construction of multiple sequence alignments</title>
<p>Sequences of six experimentally characterized HLDs–DhaA, LinB, DrbA, DmbC, DhlA and DmbB–or the sequence of LinA were used as queries for PSI-BLAST [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>] searches against the nr NCBI database (version July-2009 and May-2015, respectively) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>], with threshold <italic>E</italic>-values of 10<sup>−10</sup> and 10<sup>−15</sup> for the initial BLAST search and inclusion of a sequence in the position-specific matrix, respectively. Sequences collected after three PSI-BLAST iterations were clustered by CD-HIT [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref037" ref-type="bibr">37</xref>] at 90% identity threshold. The resulting dataset (including 8,226 sequences for DhaA and 946 for LinA) was clustered with CLANS [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref038" ref-type="bibr">38</xref>] using default parameters and varying threshold <italic>P</italic>-values. Sequences clustering with query at the <italic>P-</italic>value of 10<sup>−29</sup> were extracted and aligned with MUSCLE [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>]. All artificial, incomplete or divergent sequences were removed. Final multiple sequence alignment (MSA) of LinA contained 13 sequences. The prepared MSA of the HLD protein family comprised 168 sequences. All sequences (47) belonging to the HLD-II subfamily were then extracted to create a HLD-II subfamily dataset and aligned with MUSCLE. To reduce possible bias toward highly similar sequences, UniqueProt [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref040" ref-type="bibr">40</xref>] was used (with a HSSP cut-off value of 40) to select representative sequences from both datasets. The created representative HLD family and HLD-II subfamily datasets comprised 87 and 27 sequences, respectively. Each representative dataset was then aligned with MUSCLE [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref039" ref-type="bibr">39</xref>].</p>

<title>Analysis of evolutionary conservation and correlation</title>
<p>The MSA of the whole HLD-II subfamily or the MSA of LinA was used to estimate the level of conservation at individual positions.

Positions with a grade ≥ 8 were considered immutable. The MSA of the whole HLD family or MSA of LinA was used to identify positions with correlated mutations (and a threshold Correlated Mutation Analysis score ≥ 0.8), by applying the 3DM database’s Comulator online tool [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref029" ref-type="bibr">29</xref>].</p>

Residues from poorly aligned regions (DhaA residues 1–18, 131–179 and 279–293 from the HLD family MSA, and residues 1–14 from the HLD-II subfamily MSA) were excluded from the analysis. The simple consensus analysis was performed using the consensus cut-off of 0.5, meaning that a given residue must be present at a given position in at least 50% of all analyzed sequences to be assigned as the consensus residue. Two cut-offs were simultaneously applied in the frequency ratio analyses: a frequency cut-off of 0.2 for the maximum allowed ratio between target and conserved residue frequencies, and a minimal frequency of 0.4 for the most conserved residue.</p>

<title>Compilation of a validation dataset</title>
<p>The validation dataset was compiled from ProTherm records that include experimentally determined differences between the Gibbs free energies of folding for mutant proteins and the corresponding wild type (ΔΔG). To increase the reliability of the analysis, only records with absolute ΔΔG values of ≥ 0.5 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> were included; the experimental error for measurements of ΔΔG is estimated to be about 0.48 kcal.mol<sup>-1</sup> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. When multiple ΔΔG values were available for a single mutation, only the value determined under the experimental conditions closest to the physiological pH of 7 was retained. The dataset was also limited to mutations in the ten most mutated proteins in ProTherm. Multiple sequence alignments for each protein in the dataset were constructed using a protocol similar to that applied in the analysis of the model enzyme DhaA. However, an automatic multi-step procedure was developed to circumvent the need to manually select PSI-BLAST queries. First, the name of the relevant protein family was found in the SCOP database [<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>]. Then, all members of the same protein family were clustered by CD-HIT using an identity threshold of 90%. Finally, up to five representatives of each resulting cluster were selected at random to constitute the set of PSI-BLAST queries.</p>

The consumption of particular substrates was quantified using gas chromatography (Trace 1300, Thermo Scientific, USA) equipped with capillary column TG-SQC (30m x 0.25mm x 0.25μm, Thermo Scientific, USA) and connected with mass spectrometer (ISQ™ LT Single Quadrupole, Thermo Scientific, USA). The 1 μL samples were injected into split-splitless inlet at 250°C, with split ratio 1:50. The temperature program was isothermal at 40°C for 1 min, followed by increase to 250°C at 20°C.min<sup>-1</sup> and hold for 4 min. The flow of carrier gas (He) was 1 mL.min<sup>-1</sup>. The MS was operated at SCAN mode (30 to 320 amu). The temperature of ion source and GC-MS transfer line was 200°C and 250° C, respectively. Dehydrochlorination activities were quantified following the decrease in concentration of γ-HCH over time.</p>

<p>Substrate to product conversion by the action of DhaAwt and DhaA115 was monitored by using the isothermal titration microcalorimeter VP-ITC (MicroCal, Piscataway, USA) at 37°C and 57°C, respectively. The substrate 1-iododohexane was dissolved in 100 mM glycine buffer (pH 8.6) and the solution was allowed to reach thermal equilibrium in the reaction cell (1.4 mL). The reaction was initiated by injecting 10 μL of enzyme solution containing either 22 μM DhaAwt or 24 μM DhaA115 into the reaction cell. Enzymes were dialyzed overnight against the same glycine buffer. The measured rate of heat change was assumed to be directly proportional to the velocity of the enzymatic reaction according to the Eq (<xref rid="pcbi.1004556.e001" ref-type="disp-formula">1</xref>)
