				<article-title>An Insecure Role for Securin in Chromosome Segregation</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Abnormalities of chromosome number are frequently observed in cancers. The mechanisms regulating chromosome segregation in human cells are therefore of great interest. Recently it has been reported that human cells without an <italic>hSecurin</italic> gene lose chromosomes at a high frequency. Here we show that, after <italic>hSecurin</italic> knockout through homologous recombination, chromosome losses are only a short, transient effect. After a few passages <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells became chromosomally stable and executed mitoses normally. This was unexpected, as the securin loss resulted in a persisting reduction of the sister-separating protease separase and inefficient cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1. Our data demonstrate that securin is dispensable for chromosomal stability in human cells. We propose that human cells possess efficient mechanisms to compensate for the loss of genes involved in chromosome segregation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A number of factors are involved in ensuring that in dividing cells chromosomes are copied exactly once and then distributed correctly to daughter cells. Chromosome cohesion is established during chromosome replication in S-phase and is mediated by the multisubunit cohesin complex, which forms a giant ring structure possibly encircling sister chromatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b001">1</xref>]. Sister chromatid separation in anaphase depends on the removal of cohesin complexes from chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b002">2</xref>]. In vertebrates removal of cohesin from chromosomes occurs in at least two steps. The “prophase pathway” removes the bulk of cohesin from chromosome arms during prophase and prometaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b004">4</xref>]. By metaphase only minor amounts of cohesin remain on chromosomes, preferentially at centromeres [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b004">4</xref>]. Centromere-specific factors, such as shugoshin, protect the cohesion between sister centromeres from the prophase pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b006">6</xref>]. At the metaphase-to-anaphase transition, residual cohesion is dissolved by the large cysteine endopeptidase separase, which cleaves the so-called kleisin subunit of cohesin (Scc1/Rad21 in mitosis; Rec8 in meiosis). This cleavage allows sister chromatids to move apart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b008">8</xref>] and is, in fact, essential for anaphase to occur [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b009">9</xref>].</p>
      <p>For most of the cell cycle, separase activity is inhibited by binding of an inhibitory chaperone called securin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b012">12</xref>] or by phosphorylation-dependent complex formation with Cdk1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b014">14</xref>]. Separase is eventually activated by proteolysis of securin or the cyclin B subunit of Cdk1, which in both cases is mediated by a ubiquitin protein ligase named anaphase promoting complex or cyclosome (APC/C) and its cofactor Cdc20 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b016">16</xref>].</p>
      <p>Thus, securin is a key substrate of the APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup> pathway. Though conserved in function, securins from different phyla are highly divergent in sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b017">17</xref>]. Earlier studies had already implicated securin in functional mechanisms related to cell-cycle control and tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b019">19</xref>]. To further address securin's function, both copies of the gene encoding <italic>hSecurin</italic> were inactivated via homologous recombination in the karyotypically stable human colorectal cancer cell line HCT116 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>]. The results indicated that <italic>hSecurin</italic> is indeed needed for chromosomal stability in human cells, as <italic>hSecurin</italic>-deficient cells exhibited high rates of chromosome missegregation, similar to those observed in many cancers. Furthermore, the data suggested that <italic>hSecurin,</italic> through its chaperone activity, plays a crucial role for the proper function of separase, especially for separase-dependent cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>]. (Our group contributed to that paper some of the cytogenetic data using fixed cell suspensions provided by C. Lengauer's laboratory.)</p>
      <p>However, the important role of <italic>hSecurin</italic> elucidated in the Jallepalli et al. study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>] contrasts with the results of another investigation, which found mice lacking securin to be viable and apparently normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b021">21</xref>]. Furthermore, only 20% of mouse cells without securin exhibit gains or losses of chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b022">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>To resolve this discrepancy, we conducted further studies with the <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell line. Here, we show that the initial missegregation phenotype was superseded by a regaining of chromosomal stability in only a few passages. The karyotype of chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells was indistinguishable from that of the parent cell line with intact securin. Surprisingly, the initially described biochemical defects caused by the lack of securin, i.e., significantly reduced levels of separase and inefficient cleavage of the cohesin subunit Scc1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>], were still present.</p>
      <p>This indicates that securin is not required for faithful chromosome segregation and that alternative mechanisms may compensate for the absence of securin and/or reduced separase levels.</p>

        <title>Analysis of Chromosomal Instability in the <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> Cell Line at Different Passages</title>
        <p>In an initial step, metaphase spreads of the <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell line were karyotyped by multiplex fluorescence in situ hybridization (M-FISH) at different passages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">Figure 1</xref>). For passages 2 and 3, we confirmed the loss of numerous chromosomes in the majority of analyzed cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">1</xref>B). About 60% (12/20) of metaphase spreads showed losses of at least one chromosome. Surprisingly however, the high rate of chromosome losses in the <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell line had almost vanished by passage 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), when chromosome losses were noted in only 10% (2/20) of cells. By passage 12, we observed no chromosome losses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). In the latter two analyses, merely one metaphase spread each had a gain of a single chromosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">Figure 1</xref>C and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">1</xref>D).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>The entire experiment was repeated, and it again showed the same phenomenon, i.e., decreasing chromosome losses in the <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cell line with increasing passage numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).</p>
        <p>As expected, the parent cell line HCT116 was chromosomally stable and remained stable throughout all analyses (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>When we karyotyped the <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells at passage 12, we found that the karyotype of the cells was identical to the karyotype of the parent cell line HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g001">Figure 1</xref>F; a detailed karyotype description is given in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Thus, the <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells showed all known structural rearrangements from the parental cell line HCT116, which we had described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b023">23</xref>]. There were no additional, new changes, and none of the known aberrations was lost.</p>
        <p>Interphase FISH confirmed that <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells at passage 12 were indeed chromosomally stable, similarly to the parental cell line HCT116 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Confirmation that Chromosomally Stable Cell Lines Are Indeed <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> Cells</title>
        <p>In the next step we confirmed that chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells were indeed <italic>hSecurin</italic> deficient. We used PCR primer pairs spanning the second and third exons of the securin gene, as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g003">3</xref>B). In addition, we designed a primer set flanking exon 3 to specifically demonstrate that the <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells lack exon 3 of the securin gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g003">3</xref>C). Genomic PCR analyses with these primer sets using DNA extracted from chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells demonstrated that the cells had indeed a homozygous deletion of the exon 3 region of the <italic>hSecurin</italic> gene. Primers for exons 8 and 9 of p53 were used as an additional control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g003">Figure 3</xref>B).</p>

            <p>(B) As a control, PCR analysis was done with primers located in exons 8 and 9 of the p53 gene and resulted in the expected amplification product for both cell lines (lanes 2 and 3).

        <title>Normal Execution of Anaphase in <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> Cells</title>
        <p>Previously, it was reported that cells lacking <italic>hSecurin</italic> grew somewhat more slowly than wild-type cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>]. In contrast, the growth pattern of chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> cells was indistinguishable from that of the HCT116 parent cell line (unpublished data). Therefore, we performed immunofluorescence experiments to examine the distribution of centromeres during mitosis with cells from passages 12 or higher. <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cells and chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells in various stages of mitosis were stained with the CREST (calcinosis-Raynaud's phenomenon-esophageal dismobility-sclerodactyly-telangiectasia syndrome of scleroderma) antibody, which recognizes kinetochore proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In addition, we used cyclin B1 as a marker for mitotic stage. Anaphase cells were first identified by virtue of chromosome condensation and lack of cyclin B staining and then scored for unsegregated chromatids remaining at the metaphase plate. In previous experiments, about 30% of <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells in anaphase still had paired sister chromatids left behind at the metaphase plate, when most of the other chromosomes had segregated to the poles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>]. When we analyzed a total of 75 cells in three separate experiments in each <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>+/+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g004">Figure 4</xref>A–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g004">4</xref>G) and <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g004">Figure 4</xref>H–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g004">4</xref>N) cell line, we found no differences.

        <title>Cleavage of Separase and Scc1 in <italic>hSecurin<sup>−/−</sup></italic> Cells</title>
        <p>During mitosis, separase undergoes proteolytic auto-cleavage resulting in carboxy (C)- and amino (N)-terminal fragments. Previously, it was reported that in <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells separase levels and activity were both reduced [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b020">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>We analyzed separase levels in chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells synchronized by nocodazole. Lysates from <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells were probed with antibodies to separase. For each cell line we detected both the full-length and the cleaved forms of separase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). However, both the full-length and the cleaved forms of separase were consistently 3- to 4-fold weaker in the chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells.</p>

            <p>(A) Quantitation of full-length separase and the N-terminal cleavage product in both <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells. Lysates from nocodazole-arrested cells were analyzed by immunoblotting with an antibody against the N-terminus of separase. The chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells show reduced levels of both the full-length and the cleaved N-terminal form of separase. β-tubulin was used as a loading control.</p>
            <p>(B) Separase was immunoprecipitated from nocodazole-arrested <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>+/+</sup> and <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells, activated by incubation in <italic>Xenopus</italic> anaphase extracts, and incubated with <sup>35</sup>S-hScc1 for 0, 20, or 90 min before analysis by SDS-PAGE and autoradiography. For these experiments we used four times as many <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells as <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>+/+</sup> cells. Note the absence of detectable Scc1 cleavage fragments in the <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> samples.</p>

        <p>We reconstituted the cleavage reaction, which dissociates Scc1 from the centromeric regions, by using immunoprecipitated separase complexes that were first incubated with <italic>Xenopus</italic> egg extracts as a source of mitotic APC/C<sup>CDC20</sup>. In the case of HCT116 parent cells, incubation of activated separase with in vitro-translated <sup>35</sup>S-hScc1 resulted in typical cleavage fragments that were readily detectable after a 20-min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). Four times as much starting cell material was used to purify separase from <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells as was used to purify the same amount of separase from wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). However, the separase from <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells did not display any cleavage activity towards Scc1, even after a 90-min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).</p>
        <p>Despite the absence of activity in vitro, separase auto-cleavage products (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g005">Figure 5</xref>A) demonstrate the presence of at least some separase activity in <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells, which, apparently, is sufficient to execute anaphase normally (see above).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, immunoprecipitated separase from nocodazole-arrested cells showed a higher degree of self-cleavage in <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells compared to that in wild-type cells. This suggests that separase might be partly deregulated in the <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0030416-g005">Figure 5</xref>C).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We report here that <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells are capable of compensating securin loss and rapidly regain chromosomal stability within a few passages. Our findings were unexpected, as chromosomally stable <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells continue to have the initially described biochemical defect, i.e., reduction of both the amount and the activity of separase [20; this study].</p>
      <p>Our data may explain why mice lacking securin are viable and normal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b021">21</xref>]. However, mouse cells without securin have little change in the level of separase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b022">22</xref>]. This is in contrast to our observations in human cells, where absence of securin resulted in the aforementioned significant reduction of both separase and its cleavage product. Furthermore, about 20% of mouse embryonic stem cells without securin were aneuploid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b022">22</xref>], while the percentage of aneuploid human <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells was reduced to background levels similar to those observed in the chromosomally stable parent cell line HCT116. These data indicate that significant differences in separase regulation between human and mouse cells must exist.</p>
      <p>The reconstitution of chromosomal stability and complete separation of sister chromatids in <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells suggest that significantly lower than normal amounts of separase are sufficient for normal execution of anaphase. This is in agreement with separase at wild-type levels being able to efficiently remove from chromosomes even vastly increased amounts of cohesin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>In contrast to budding yeast, human cells lacking <italic>hSecurin</italic> still manage to arrest sister chromatid separation in the presence of spindle poisons [20; unpublished data]. Therefore, additional mechanisms that regulate the removal of cohesin in human cells must exist. One additional, securin-independent mechanism of separase inhibition involves phosphorylation by Cdk1 and subsequent binding of the kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b022">22</xref>]. As securin and Cdk1 bind separase in a mutually exclusive manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b014">14</xref>], Cdk1 may be capable of compensating for the loss of securin. Indeed, mouse embryonal stem cells lacking both forms of separase regulation suffer from precocious sister chromatid separation under mitotic checkpoint arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b022">22</xref>]. Another level of control is probably exerted by shugoshin, which prevents removal of centromere-specific cohesin before the onset of anaphase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b005">5</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our findings demonstrate that deletion of <italic>hSecurin</italic> has little or no effect on long-term chromosome segregation fidelity in human cells. In fact, our results even raise the possibility that the chromosomal instability (CIN) phenotype observed in early passages of the <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cells might have been caused by insults during the deletion process rather than by loss of securin per se.</p>
      <p>Alternatively, cells might upregulate other control pathways in response to loss of securin, thereby regaining chromosomal stability. Comparative gene expression profiling before and after loss of <italic>hSecurin</italic> might reveal compensatory changes in the expression of genes involved in anaphase regulation. We therefore compared the transcriptomes of the HCT116 parent and the <italic>hSecurin</italic><sup>−/−</sup> cell line using the Affymetrix U133A chip. Indeed, significantly different expression levels were found for <italic>PLK2</italic> (Polo-like kinase 2), <italic>RCC1</italic> (regulator of chromosome condensation 1, also known as chromosome condensation 1 [<italic>CHC1</italic>]), and <italic>SMC6L1</italic> (SMC6 structural maintenance of chromosomes 6-like 1) (unpublished data). However, future experiments will be required to determine the physiological significance of these findings and whether the above proteins might play a currently unknown role in the other two known regulations of sister chromatid separation.</p>
      <p>In summary, we have shown that securin is not required for chromosomal stability in human cells. Our results affect current mathematical models of colorectal cancer investigating the role of genetic instability in tumorigenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b024">24</xref>]. The crucial effect attributed to CIN is acceleration of the mutation rate. However, our data indicated that a CIN-causing mutation may not reach fixation in a given cell compartment, which should therefore change existing assumptions on the evolution of CIN lesions and their growth rates.</p>
      <p>Finally, implications of this study extend beyond mechanisms leading to chromosomal instability and affect possible strategies for cancer therapy. It has been suggested that, as stability pathways of tumor cells are defective, cancer cells may be more sensitive to stress-inducing agents and they should be especially susceptible to attack by instability-inducing drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0030416-b025">25</xref>]. However, our results suggest that targeting a particular pathway may not destroy a cell but rather activate alternative pathways. A search and detailed characterization of these alternative pathways will provide further clues to the nature of CIN in human cancers.</p>
