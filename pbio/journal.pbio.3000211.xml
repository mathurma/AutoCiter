<abstract>
<p>During spermatogenesis, interconnected haploid spermatids segregate undesired cellular contents into residual bodies (RBs) before detaching from RBs. It is unclear how this differentiation process is controlled to produce individual spermatids or motile spermatozoa. Here, we developed a live imaging system to visualize and investigate this process in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>. We found that non-muscle myosin 2 (NMY-2)/myosin II drives incomplete cytokinesis to generate connected haploid spermatids, which are then polarized to segregate undesired cellular contents into RBs under the control of myosin II and myosin VI. NMY-2/myosin II extends from the pseudo-cleavage furrow formed between two haploid spermatids to the spermatid poles, thus promoting RB expansion. In the meantime, defective spermatogenesis 15 (SPE-15)/myosin VI migrates from spermatids towards the expanding RB to promote spermatid budding. Loss of myosin II or myosin VI causes distinct cytoplasm segregation defects, while loss of both myosins completely blocks RB formation. We found that the final separation of spermatids from RBs is achieved through myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis, while myosin II is dispensable at this step. SPE-15/myosin VI and F-actin form a detergent-resistant actomyosin VI ring that undergoes continuous contraction to promote membrane constriction between spermatid and RB. We further identified that RGS-GAIP-interacting protein C terminus (GIPC)-1 and GIPC-2 cooperate with myosin VI to regulate contractile ring formation and spermatid release. Our study reveals distinct roles of myosin II and myosin VI in spermatid differentiation and uncovers a novel myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis process that controls spermatid release.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a conserved multistep process that involves mitotic proliferation of spermatogonia, meiotic division of spermatocytes, and differentiation of haploid spermatids into mature spermatozoa. During spermatid differentiation, spermatids shed unwanted cellular contents in the form of a residual body (RB) and detach from the RB to become mature spermatozoa. A series of cellular events occur in this process, including RB formation, cytoplasm segregation, and spermatid release, but the underlying cellular mechanisms are largely unknown. In this study, by combining live-cell imaging and genetic manipulation in an optimized in vitro culture system, we monitored and investigated <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> spermatid differentiation with high temporal and spatial resolutions. We found that RB formation and cytoplasm segregation are regulated by 2 actin-based molecular motors, which play distinct roles in these processes. Non-muscle Myosin 2 (NMY-2)/myosin II drives incomplete cytokinesis to generate connected haploid spermatids. NMY-2 and F-actin accumulate at the pseudo-cleavage furrow and extend towards the spermatid poles to promote RB expansion. In the meantime, defective spermatogenesis 15 (SPE-15)/myosin VI co-migrates with cortical actin from spermatids towards the expanding RB to promote spermatid budding. Cellular contents are differentially segregated into spermatids and RBs during RB expansion mediated by myosin II and myosin VI, respectively. We discovered that spermatid release is achieved by myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis and that the cargo adaptor RGS-GAIP-interacting protein C terminus (GIPC) is the key regulator of myosin VI in this process. SPE-15/myosin VI and F-actin form a detergent-resistant actomyosin VI ring to promote membrane restriction that separates spermatids from the RB.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Spermatogenesis is a conserved multistep process that involves mitotic proliferation of spermatogonia, meiotic division of spermatocytes, and differentiation of haploid spermatids into mature spermatozoa. In <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, spermatogenesis occurs in both males and hermaphrodites. Upon entering meiosis, primary spermatocytes bud off the syncytial cytoplasmic core known as the rachis and undergo meiosis, resulting in generation of 2N secondary spermatocytes that sometimes undergo incomplete cytokinesis and remain attached [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref002">2</xref>]. Each secondary spermatocyte initiates meiosis II to produce 2 connected haploid spermatids, which differentiate to shed undesired cytoplasm in the form of a residual body (RB). Spermatids inherit mitochondria, Golgi-derived fibrous-body membranous organelles (FB-MOs), and a haploid nucleus, whereas all ribosomes, nearly all the actin, and most of the tubulin are packaged into the RB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref004">4</xref>]. Spermatids subsequently detach from the RB and further mature into motile spermatozoa [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref006">6</xref>]. The RBs are phagocytosed and degraded in gonadal sheath cells by the molecular machinery that removes apoptotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref007">7</xref>]. RB formation and cytoplasm segregation also occur in flies during spermatid individualization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref009">9</xref>]. In vertebrates, incomplete cytokinesis occurs during mitosis of spermatogonia and meiosis of spermatocytes, leading to generation of a bundle of interconnected haploid spermatids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref012">12</xref>]. The spermatids transform into spermatozoa through a process called spermiogenesis, which involves multiple cellular remodeling events including selective placement of unneeded cellular contents into RBs and release of sperm from RBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref015">15</xref>]. Failure of this process affects spermatid generation and activation, causing male infertility in worms, flies, and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref018">18</xref>]. However, little is known about how RBs form and detach from spermatids and how cytoplasm segregation is achieved.</p>
<p>Myosins are actin-based molecular motors that translocate along actin filaments in an ATP-dependent manner. Myosins have been implicated in various aspects of spermatogenesis, including mitosis and meiosis, spermatid differentiation, and cytoplasm segregation, consistent with the extensive actin cytoskeleton remodeling observed in these processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref020">20</xref>]. Non-muscle myosin II is crucial for cytokinesis in both mitotic and meiotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref021">21</xref>]. Myosin VI is the only minus-end–directed motor protein on actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref022">22</xref>]. It participates in a variety of cellular processes by transporting cargos along actin or stabilizing actin cytoskeleton structures and linking them with membranes or protein complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref024">24</xref>]. In either case, myosin VI is assisted by associating with cargo adaptors, which mediate targeting and dimerization of the motor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref025">25</xref>]. Myosin VI is important in <italic>Drosophila</italic> spermatid individualization, probably by stabilizing the actin cone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref028">28</xref>]. Loss of defective spermatogenesis 15 (SPE-15), the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> myosin VI, affects proper partitioning of organelles and cytoskeleton components into spermatids and RBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref016">16</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether and how SPE-15 directly regulates the sorting process.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a live-cell imaging system to visualize spermatid differentiation in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, during which spermatids shed unneeded cellular contents into RBs and detach from RBs. Our study reveals distinct roles of myosin II and myosin VI in residual body formation and cytoplasm segregation and uncovers a novel myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis that separates spermatids from RBs.</p>

<title>Live-cell labeling and imaging visualize spermatid differentiation in vitro</title>
<p>In previously reported in vitro culture conditions, primary spermatocytes develop to form spermatids, but most spermatids remain attached to the residual body (RB), which prevents further characterization of spermatid detachment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref001">1</xref>]. Here, we optimized the culture medium so that it can support development of spermatocytes until spermatid release (Materials and methods: “In vitro culture of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> spermatocytes and live-cell imaging”). The control strain in this study was <italic>him-5</italic>, because <italic>him-5</italic> mutant hermaphrodites produce a much higher percentage of male progeny than the wild-type N2 strain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref029">29</xref>]. We cultured primary or secondary spermatocytes dissected from <italic>him-5</italic> males in the optimized culture medium and followed spermatid differentiation by time-lapse recordings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Consistent with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref001">1</xref>], we observed that 1 primary spermatocyte divided into 2 connected secondary spermatocytes in meiosis I, and each secondary spermatocyte initiated meiosis II to produce 2 connected spermatids that undergo differentiation, leading to generation of 2 individual spermatids and 1 residual body (RB) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, dashed boxes, C, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s001">S1A Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s007">S1 Video</xref>). RBs derived from 2 connected secondary spermatocytes fused spontaneously, forming a large RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). When cultured in the optimized medium at 20°C, all spermatocytes followed by time-lapse recording developed to produce released spermatids, while on average, 3 out of the 4 spermatids derived from each primary spermatocyte separated from the RB in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). When cultured at 25°C, spermatocytes appeared to develop normally, but spermatid release was reduced significantly, which suggests that elevated temperature affects spermatid release in vitro (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s002">S2D</xref>).</p>

<p>By time-lapse recording, we found that a cleavage furrow was formed at the midpoint of the 2 haploid nuclei in meiosis II (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>, white arrows). Instead of further contracting, the furrow extended towards the 2 spermatid poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, double-headed arrow), leading to gradual expansion of the RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s007">S1 Video</xref>). Later on, new cleavage furrows formed between the spermatids and the RB, which contracted continuously to separate the individual spermatids from the RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, yellow arrow, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s007">S1 Video</xref>). Because the first cleavage furrow did not result in membrane fission, it is referred to as the pseudo-cleavage furrow from now on and is thus distinguished from the cleavage furrow formed at the final cytokinesis step.</p>
<p>The differential partitioning of cellular components during spermatid differentiation has been observed previously by electron microscopy and immunohistochemistry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref016">16</xref>]. However, it is unclear whether and how the cytoplasm segregation coordinates with RB formation. By live-cell labeling and time-lapse recording, we observed that chromosomes labeled by green fluorescent protein (GFP)-tagged histone 2B (H2B) divided normally in meiosis and were efficiently segregated into differentiating spermatids in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Mitochondria were first partitioned into 2 domains separated by the pseudo-cleavage furrow and were excluded from RBs during RB expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s008">S2 Video</xref>). Ribosomes labeled by ribosomal protein 5, large subunit (RPL-5)::GFP were observed in the cytoplasm and at the cortex of spermatocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). RPL-5::GFP became enriched at the pseudo-furrow site and was fully segregated into the expanding RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s009">S3 Video</xref>). We followed cytoskeleton dynamics in this process by silicon-rhodamine (SiR)-actin or SiR-tubulin staining, which had no notable effect on the progression of RB formation and spermatid release in vitro (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). F-actin labeled by SiR-actin or Lifeact was observed throughout the entire cortex of the dividing secondary spermatocytes. Actin filaments became enriched at the pseudo-furrow site and the cortex of the RB during furrow ingression and RB expansion, which appeared to involve continuous centripetal movement of F-actin from the spermatid poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, white line and white arrow, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s001">S1C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s010">S4 Video</xref>). Sealing of the cortical actin in the RB occurred when all the actin had moved into the RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, yellow arrow, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s001">S1C Fig</xref>), which explains the extremely low levels of actin in released spermatids. We labeled microtubules by SiR-tubulin or GFP fusion of tubulin beta 2 (GFP::TBB-2) and found that increasing amounts of microtubules emanated from the gamma tubulin (TBG-1)-positive microtubule organizing center (MTOC) while the signal from the spindle gradually diminished (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s001">S1D and S1E Fig</xref>). The microtubule bundles were subsequently released from the MTOC and transported into the RB (S1D and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), consistent with previous observations in fixed and live spermatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref030">30</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref031">31</xref>]. Most TBG-1 was also transported into RBs, leaving only weak TBG-1 spots in spermatids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s001">S1E Fig</xref>, yellow arrow). Altogether, our live-cell imaging of in vitro cultured spermatocytes reveals previously unobserved dynamic processes during spermatid differentiation, including expansion of the pseudo-cleavage furrow, segregation of mitochondria and ribosomes during RB expansion, dynamics of cytoskeleton components, and cytokinesis that separates spermatids from the RB.</p>

<title>Myosin II and myosin VI play distinct roles to regulate RB formation</title>
<p>Our data suggest that the pseudo-cleavage furrow expands to promote RB formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s007">S1 Video</xref>). We examined the dynamics of non-muscle myosin 2 (NMY-2), the heavy chain of non-muscle myosin II, which is required for cleavage furrow formation in cytokinesis. After the onset of meiosis II, NMY-2 puncta were observed throughout the entire cell cortex but were concentrated at the spot where 2 secondary spermatocytes were connected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). NMY-2 was then enriched at the site where the pseudo-cleavage furrow formed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, white arrow). The cortical NMY-2 at the pseudo-cleavage furrow extended towards the 2 spermatid poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, double-headed arrow), concomitant with RB expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s011">S5 Video</xref>). <italic>nmy-2(ne3409)</italic> is a temperature-sensitive mutant allele of <italic>nmy-2</italic>, which results in strong loss-of-function (lf) phenotypes in embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref032">32</xref>].

<p>We next examined the role of actin in this process as both NMY-2 and F-actin accumulated at the pseudo-furrow site and the cortex of the expanding RB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), and cytochalasin B is reported to inhibit cell division during spermatogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref004">4</xref>]. Latrunculin A disrupts actin filaments by inhibiting actin polymerization. We found that Latrunculin A treatment of secondary spermatocytes prior to appearance of the pseudo-cleavage furrow prevented furrow formation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, white arrows), while treatment of secondary spermatocytes that already had a pseudo-cleavage furrow led to suppression of furrow expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2D</xref>, yellow arrows). Thus, actin filaments are required for pseudo-cleavage furrow ingression and subsequent expansion. The actin filaments and myosin II may form actomyosin to power the ingression and expansion processes.</p>
<p>In <italic>him-5</italic> males, RBs were formed through active expansion of the pseudo-cleavage furrow towards the spermatid poles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). In <italic>nmy-2</italic> mutants, however, pseudo-cleavage furrows did not form, but spermatids budded gradually from the cell body, leaving a structure morphologically similar to the RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, lines, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s012">S6 Video</xref>). Thus, myosin II-independent mechanisms may mediate spermatid budding in <italic>nmy-2(ne3409)</italic>. To further test this, we examined whether SPE-15, the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> myosin VI, is involved in this process. SPE-15 is highly expressed during spermatogenesis and has been implicated in cytoplasm segregation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref016">16</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref033">33</xref>]. We constructed double mutants that lack functions of both NMY-2 and SPE-15 and found that spermatid budding was completely suppressed (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s002">S2B</xref>). This suggests that SPE-15 function is important for spermatid budding in <italic>nmy-2</italic> mutants. In <italic>spe-15(hc75) nmy-2(ne3409)</italic> double mutants, meiosis II was initiated, and chromosomes were segregated, but formation of spermatids and the RB was completely blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s013">S7 Video</xref>). We next generated endogenously expressed GFP::SPE-15 by clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease (CRISPR/Cas9). GFP::SPE-15 accumulated mainly in the nucleus of primary spermatocytes, and was released later into the cytosol, probably due to nuclear envelope breakdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). After the onset of meiosis II, GFP::SPE-15 was recruited to the cell cortex and moved from the spermatid pole to the spermatid–RB boundary during RB expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s014">S8 Video</xref>). In <italic>nmy-2(ne3409)</italic>, SPE-15 movement to the spermatid–RB boundary was unaffected, and it occurred concomitantly with spermatid budding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s015">S9 video</xref>). These data suggest that directional movement of myosin VI may promote spermatid budding in <italic>nmy-2</italic> mutants. Similarly, loss of SPE-15 did not affect enrichment of NMY-2 at the pseudo-furrow site, its expansion towards the spermatid poles, or the accompanying RB expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s016">S10 Video</xref>). We found that NMY-2 was completely restricted to the RB in <italic>him-5</italic> worms but diffused into spermatids in <italic>spe-15</italic> mutants, which indicates that SPE-15 is required to restrict NMY-2 within RBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that myosin II and myosin VI regulate spermatid and residual body formation by mediating RB expansion and spermatid budding, respectively.</p>

<title>Myosin II and myosin VI regulate partitioning of cellular components in different manners</title>
<p>We found that differential partitioning of cellular components occurs during residual body formation, leading to segregation of mitochondria into spermatids and ribosomes into RBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">Fig 1D and 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s008">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s009">S3 Videos</xref>). In <italic>him-5</italic> worms, mitochondria were excluded from RBs during NMY-2/RB expansion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). In <italic>nmy-2(ne3409)</italic>, RB expansion was disrupted, and significantly more mitochondria were retained in RB-like structures than in <italic>him-5</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s017">S11 Video</xref>). Mitochondria in <italic>spe-15(hc75)</italic> were segregated normally into spermatids during RB expansion but returned to RBs at a later stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Thus, myosin II but not myosin VI is required for the initial segregation of mitochondria into spermatids. RPL-5::GFP was quickly sorted into RBs in <italic>him-5</italic>, and the sorting was not impaired during spermatid budding in <italic>nmy-2(ne3409)</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). In <italic>spe-15</italic> mutants, however, a significant proportion of RPL-5::GFP was retained in the cortex and cytosol of spermatids during residual body formation, indicating that ribosome segregation into RBs is impaired (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g003">3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s003">S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s018">S12 Video</xref>). The cytoskeleton components actin and tubulin were moved to and enriched in RBs in <italic>him-5</italic> worms. However, actin and tubulin were present in spermatids in <italic>spe-15</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s003">S3C Fig</xref>). This is consistent with the previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref016">16</xref>] and suggests that segregation of actin and tubulin into RBs is affected in <italic>spe-15(lf)</italic>. In line with this, transport of microtubules to RBs was impaired in <italic>spe-15</italic>, but it was not obviously affected in <italic>nmy-2(ne3409)</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s003">S3D and S3E Fig</xref>). Collectively, these data indicate that myosin II and myosin VI have distinct effects on cytoplasm segregation, which is in good agreement with the directional movement of the 2 myosins during spermatid budding and RB expansion. Myosin II extends towards the 2 spermatid poles and is required for segregation of mitochondria into spermatids, while myosin VI moves from the spermatid poles to the RB and is involved in transporting ribosomes and cytoskeleton components into the RB.</p>

<p>By monitoring the dynamics of GFP::SPE-15, we found that SPE-15 migrated from the spermatid poles to the RB during spermatid budding and was enriched at the site where membrane constriction occurred (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, yellow arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s014">S8 Video</xref>). This temporal localization pattern is consistent with the role of SPE-15 in regulating membrane constriction and spermatid release. We next compared the dynamics of myosin II and myosin VI in worms that carry endogenously expressed NMY-2::mCherry and GFP::SPE-15. NMY-2, but not SPE-15, was enriched at the pseudo-cleavage furrow between 2 haploid spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, white arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s020">S14 Video</xref>). When the RB was formed, NMY-2 appeared as punctate structures distributed throughout the entire cortex of the RB, whereas SPE-15 was specifically enriched at the constriction and cleavage site at which spermatids and the RB are separated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g004">Fig 4E</xref>, yellow arrows, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s020">S14 Video</xref>). Altogether, these data indicate that myosin VI, but not myosin II, is required for the final cytokinesis.</p>
<p>Defective cytokinesis may lead to retraction of polarized spermatids and generation of nucleus-containing residual bodies. Nucleus-containing RBs may be recognized and removed by the phagocytic pathway, similar to nucleus-free RBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s005">S5A Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref007">7</xref>].

Then, SPE-15 and F-actin comigrated from the spermatid pole to the RB and accumulated at the site where membrane constriction occurred (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g005">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s006">S6B and S6C</xref>). Thus, SPE-15 and F-actin may act together to regulate cytokinesis between spermatids and the RB. By visualizing SPE-15 and F-actin in 3 dimensions, we observed that SPE-15 formed ring-like structures, and contraction of the ring was concomitant with sealing of the cortical actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). We treated spermatocytes that contain enriched SPE-15 at the spermatid–RB boundary with 5% NP40.

<title>GIPC cooperates with myosin VI to regulate actomyosin VI ring formation and spermatid release</title>
<p>Myosin VI regulates various membrane trafficking processes through interactions with different partners. We performed yeast two-hybrid screening to search for SPE-15–interacting proteins and identified GIPC-1 and GIPC-2. They are members of the RGS-GAIP-interacting protein C terminus (GIPC) family, which act as cargo adaptors to load a variety of cargos for myosin VI–dependent endosomal trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref034">34</xref>]. GIPC-1 and GIPC-2 are almost identical in amino acid sequence and are highly expressed during spermatogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s006">S6D Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref033">33</xref>]. We found that both GIPC-1 and GIPC-2 interacted with SPE-15 through its RRL motif, which is located in the cargo-binding domain (CBD) and is known to mediate the interaction of myosin VI with adaptor proteins (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g006">6A and 6B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s006">S6E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref036">36</xref>].

<p>We generated an antibody that recognizes both GIPC-1 and GIPC-2 and stained GIPC and SPE-15 simultaneously. GIPC and SPE-15 both accumulated at the constriction region between spermatids and the RB, while only faint signals were detected at the spermatid poles (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g006">6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s006">S6F</xref>). Loss of GIPCs disrupted accumulation of SPE-15 between spermatids and the RB, indicating that GIPC is required for formation of the actomyosin VI contractile ring (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g006">Fig 6F and 6G</xref>). Enrichment of GIPC at the cleavage region was completely abolished in <italic>spe-15(hc75)</italic> mutants, indicating that GIPC localization requires SPE-15/myosin VI (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g006">Fig 6F</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using an approach combining live-cell imaging and genetic manipulation in an optimized in vitro culture system, we monitored and investigated spermatid differentiation with high temporal and spatial resolution, which reveals previously unseen cell biological processes that drive RB expansion, spermatid budding, cytoplasm segregation, and cytokinesis (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g001">1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">7A</xref>). Our data demonstrate that myosin II and myosin VI regulate residual body formation by mediating RB expansion and spermatid budding, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). In the meantime, cellular contents are differentially segregated into spermatids and RBs, which requires functions of myosin II and myosin VI, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Finally, spermatids are separated from RBs by myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>).</p>

<title>Proposed models showing the role of myosin II and myosin VI in spermatid differentiation.</title>
<p>(A) Proposed model of the role of myosin II and myosin VI in spermatid differentiation. Myosin II and myosin VI play distinct roles to regulate RB formation and cytoplasm segregation. Dashed boxes show the differentiation process of a single haploid spermatid in <italic>him-5</italic> animals. Residual body formation is achieved by myosin II–mediated RB expansion and myosin VI–mediated spermatid budding. Spermatids are separated from RBs by myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis. Cellular contents are differentially segregated into spermatids and RBs during RB expansion, regulated by myosin II and myosin VI, respectively. Green arrows point to the pseudo-cleavage furrow that is enriched in actomyosin II. Blue arrows indicate accumulation of actomyosin VI at the cleavage furrow between the spermatid and the RB. Green dashed arrows and blue dashed arrows indicate the movements of NMY-2 and SPE-15, which are in opposite directions. In <italic>spe-15 nmy-2</italic> double mutants, spermatid differentiation is completely blocked. (B) Proposed model of actomyosin VI ring formation and contraction in separating spermatids from the RB. GIPC may promote myosin VI dimerization or oligomerization, which is required for actomyosin VI ring formation. Head domains in SPE-15 dimers or oligomers may localize to anti-parallel actin bundles. Their movement towards the minus end of actin bundles may generate a pulling force and induce actin sliding, which drive contraction of the actomyosin VI ring. Other actin regulators, including formins, Arp2/3, and capping proteins, may regulate the architecture and dynamics of the actin network that are required for actomyosin VI ring formation and contraction.

<p>Our data suggest that movement of the 2 myosins in opposite directions may drive RB expansion and spermatid budding and, at the same time, promote partitioning of cellular components into RBs and spermatids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). It is possible that pseudo-cleavage furrow extension towards the spermatid poles, powered by NMY-2/myosin II and F-actin, excludes organelles like mitochondria from the central region during RB formation and thus promotes mitochondrial segregation into spermatids (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s003">S3A Fig</xref>). We suspect that mitochondria may connect with astral microtubules that associate with the cell cortex. The astral microtubules and the associated mitochondria may be excluded from the central region during RB/NMY-2 expansion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s003">S3A and S3D Fig</xref>, 6 min), which ensures that mitochondria are not partitioned into RBs. In <italic>spe-15(lf)</italic>, the initial segregation of mitochondria into spermatids is not obviously affected, indicating that SPE-15 is not required for active positioning of mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). At the late stage, however, spermatids in <italic>spe-15(lf)</italic> are not separated from the RB, and mitochondria-containing spermatids retract, causing appearance of mitochondria in the RB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This suggests that timely myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis is essential for maintaining chromosomes and mitochondria in spermatids. On the other hand, movement of SPE-15/myosin VI with the cortical actin from spermatids to RBs may promote spermatid budding and transport of cytoskeleton components and ribosomes into RBs (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g005">5C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">7A</xref>). Moreover, enrichment of SPE-15 and F-actin at the RB–spermatid boundary may serve as a barrier to prevent entry of cortical actin and NMY-2 into spermatids. Future studies should address whether and how mitochondria may connect with astral microtubules and whether SPE-15 achieves its segregation function by mediating cross-linking of ribosomes and microtubules with actin filaments.</p>
<p>Our data show that spermatid differentiation shares common properties with normal cytokinesis but has unique features. As in cytokinesis, myosin II and F-actin form an actomyosin II ring to drive cleavage furrow ingression at the equatorial region of the dividing secondary spermatocyte. However, instead of further constricting membranes at the furrow site as in cytokinesis, the actomyosin II ring expands towards the 2 spermatid poles, which may provide the force for RB expansion (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g002">2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">7A</xref>). The positioning of the actomyosin II contractile ring and its subsequent extension may be directed by the anaphase spindle, but how this process is regulated remains unclear.</p>
<p>We found that the final release of spermatids is independent of myosin II but is carried out by myosin VI–mediated cytokinesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7</xref>). In this process, SPE-15/myosin VI and F-actin form detergent-resistant actomyosin VI rings, and contraction of the actomyosin VI ring may drive membrane constriction for spermatid release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g005">Fig 5C–5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">7B</xref>). The upstream signal(s) that trigger(s) SPE-15 movement towards RBs and contraction of the actomyosin VI ring is unclear and requires further investigations.</p>
<p>Myosin VI is capable of inducing actin network deformation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref037">37</xref>]. Here, we found that actomyosin VI contractile rings can be formed in vivo and are responsible for cytokinesis and spermatid release. It is reported that antiparallel actin bundles and branched meshwork, but not parallel bundles, are selectively contracted by myosin VI in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref038">38</xref>]. In this process, reconstituted double-headed myosin VI is used, which triggers continuous contraction by tethering and sliding neighboring antiparallel filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref038">38</xref>]. Here, we found that SPE-15/myosin VI associates with the cargo adaptor GIPC, and the interaction is required for actomyosin VI ring formation and spermatid release. Myosin VI is known to undergo GIPC-dependent dimerization or oligomerization in endocytosis and endocytic transport [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref039">39</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref042">42</xref>]. Therefore, GIPC may promote SPE-15/myosin VI dimerization to facilitate actomyosin VI ring formation and contraction like reconstituted double-headed myosin VI in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref038">38</xref>]. In addition, SPE-15 oligomers may act as myosin II minifilaments to tether and slide antiparallel actin bundles, thus generating the force for contraction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). We found that both Latrunculin A and Jasplakinolide treatment suppressed membrane constriction between spermatids and RBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g005">Fig 5A and 5B</xref>). This suggests that actin polymerization and depolymerization are both important for actomyosin VI ring contraction, similar to actomyosin II rings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref043">43</xref>]. Formin, actin-related proteins 2 and 3 (Arp2/3), profilin, and capping proteins may collaborate to control actin network architecture and dynamics in this process (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000211.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). In-depth analyses are needed to determine which factors are involved and how they act. Future studies should also address whether myosin VI–mediated membrane transport processes may participate in spermatid release as in cytokinesis of mitotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000211.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

The 19 bp gene-specific guide sequence was constructed in pDD162 (Addgene #770047)—which has a gRNA backbone and a Cas9 gene—by site-directed mutagenesis using the following primers: PSL129/130 for <italic>gipc-1(qx478)</italic>, PSL139/140 for <italic>gipc-2(qx479)</italic>, PSYC843/844 for <italic>spe-15(qx529)</italic>, PJYH59/60 for <italic>qx506</italic>, PJYH319/320 for <italic>qx654</italic>, and PYBL135/136 for <italic>qx548</italic>. The following repair templates, which are less than 120 nt, were synthesized directly and used as single-stranded templates: PSL131 for <italic>gipc-1(qx478)</italic>, PSL141 for <italic>gipc-2(qx479)</italic>, and PSYC845 for <italic>spe-15(qx529)</italic>. For easier selection of desired mutations, restriction enzyme recognition sites were included in (<italic>Xba</italic> I in <italic>gipc-1</italic>, <italic>Nco</italic> I in <italic>gipc-2</italic>) or excluded from (<italic>EcoR</italic> I in <italic>spe-15</italic>) the repair DNA sequences. Longer double-stranded templates were generated by PCR using primers containing homology arms: PJYH61/62 for <italic>qx506</italic>, PJYH428/429 for <italic>qx654</italic>, and PYBL147/PYBL148 for <italic>qx548</italic>. To prepare the injection mixture, pDD162 containing a gRNA sequence and the Cas9 gene was diluted to a final concentration of 20 ng/μl, short linear DNA templates were diluted to 1 μM, and longer templates were diluted to 50 ng/μl. An oligonucleotide template for <italic>dpy-10</italic> repair and a pDD162 construct containing a <italic>dpy-10</italic> gRNA were included in the injection mixture for F1 screening. F1 worms showing roller or dumpy phonotypes were singled. Worm lysates were used for PCR or PCR followed by restriction enzyme digestion to identify worms containing the desired DNA changes. All strains generated by genome editing were outcrossed 4 times before use. Primers and oligonucleotide templates used for CRIPSPR/Cas9 are included in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000211.s023">S1 Table</xref>.</p>

<title>In vitro culture of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> spermatocytes and live-cell imaging</title>
<p>L4-stage males with rounded tails were picked and placed on fresh OP50-seeded plates and grown for 1 to 2 d. The celibate males were then transferred to a new plate without bacteria and allowed to crawl for a few minutes. Three to 5 μl of Leibovitz's L-15 medium (Gibco 21083–027) containing 15% FBS (Pan p11606) was added onto a clean slide. Three to 5 males were quickly dissected in the medium using 2 needles to release the spermatocytes. A clean coverslip was carefully placed over the sample and then sealed with a mixture of beeswax and Vaseline (1:1) for imaging.</p>
<p>Spermatocytes at different developmental stages were distinguished by differential interference contrast (DIC) morphology observed using a 10× objective. Fluorescence images were captured using a 100× objective (CFI Plan Apochromat Lambda; NA 1.45; Nikon) with immersion oil (type NF) on an inverted fluorescence microscope (Eclipse Ti-E; Nikon) equipped with a spinning-disk confocal scanner unit (UltraView; PerkinElmer) with 488 (emission filter 525 [W50]), 561 (dual-band emission filter 445 [W60] and 615 [W70]), and 635 (dual-band emission filter 485 [W60] and 705 [W90]) lasers. For time-lapse recording, images were captured at intervals ranging from 10 s to 1 min (10 s, 15 s, 20 s, 30 s, or 1 min) at 20°C or 25°C. The room temperature was adjusted to 20°C or 25°C before images were taken. The Z stage was adjusted as required to focus on the middle section of spermatocytes. Images were viewed and analyzed using Volocity software (PerkinElmer). For 3D reconstruction, images in 13 z series (0.5 μm/section) were captured every 1 min at 20°C and were viewed and reconstituted using Volocity software (PerkinElmer).</p>
<p>Time-lapse recording with DIC alone was performed using a 100× objective (Plan-Neofluar; NA 1.40; Carl Zeiss) with Immersol 518F oil (Carl Zeiss) on an Axioimager M2 microscope (Carl Zeiss) equipped with an AxioCam monochrome digital camera (Carl Zeiss). Images were captured every 10 s at 20°C or 25°C. The Z stage was adjusted as required to focus on the middle section of spermatocytes. Images were processed and viewed using ZEN 2 software (Carl Zeiss).</p>
<p><italic>nmy-2(ne3490)</italic> spermatocytes in the sealed slides were kept at 25°C for at least 2 min before imaging to ensure the protein became nonfunctional. The temperature was maintained at 25°C during time-lapse recording.</p>

<title>Vital stain labeling and drug treatment</title>
<p>SiR-actin (Spirochrome SC001) and SiR-tubulin (Spirochrome SC002) were used for live-cell imaging with a final concentration of 1 μM. Worms were dissected in culture medium containing 1 μM SiR-actin or SiR-tubulin and incubated for 5 min at 20°C in the dark before imaging in the same medium. Mitochondria in the released spermatocytes were labeled and imaged in culture medium containing 50 nM Mitotracker Red CMXRos (ThermoFisher M7512). Nuclei were labeled with 1 μg/ml Hoechst 33342 (ThermoFisher 62249) or 50 nM DRAQ5 (ThermoFisher 62254) in culture medium.</p>
<p>For drug treatment, a final concentration of 0.3 μg/ml Latrunculin A (Sigma L5163) or 5 μM Jasplakinolide (Abcam ab141409) was utilized.

<title>Yeast two-hybrid screen</title>
<p>The ProQuest (ThermoFisher) yeast two-hybrid system was used to search for SPE-15 partners using the CBD (Q1031-P1219) of SPE-15 as a bait. SPE-15(CBD)::FLAG was constructed in pDBLeu, and protein expression was determined by western blot. The optimal concentration of 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole was determined by self-activation testing of SPE-15 (CBD). A library of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> cDNA in pPC86 was then screened using pDBleu-SPE-15(CBD)::FLAG. Transformants were selected on synthetic complete (SC) medium lacking leucine, tryptophan, and histidine (SC-Leu-Trp-His) with optimal 3-amino-1,2,4-triazole for the activation of the reporter gene HIS3.

<title>Immunostaining</title>
<p>Slides were coated with poly-lysine (5%) and marked with a small circle using a PAP pen after drying. Twenty males were dissected in 20 μl SM buffer (50 mM HEPES, 25 mM KCl, 45 mM NaCl, 1 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, 5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>, 10 mM dextrose [pH 7.8]) to release spermatocytes and sperm. 20 μl 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) was added after removal of extra SM buffer, and the slides were kept at room temperature for 15 min. After removal of PFA, 20 μl 4% PFA containing 5% Triton X-100 was added, and the slides were kept for a further 10 min at room temperature. A coverslip was placed on top of the sample, and the slide was frozen on a block that had been cooled in liquid nitrogen while applying gentle pressure to remove the coverslip. The amount of 40 μl PBS (137 mM NaCl, 2.7 mM KCl, 10 mM Na<sub>2</sub>HPO<sub>4</sub>, 1.8 mM KH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub> [pH 7.4]) containing 1% BSA and 10% serum was added to each sample and kept for 1 h to block nonspecific antigens. After removing the blocking buffer, 50 μl fresh primary antibodies (1:200) diluted in blocking buffer was added to each sample and kept overnight at 4°C or 2 h at room temperature. The samples were rinsed 3 times for 10 min each in PBST (PBS containing 0.2% Tween 20), and then were incubated with fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies (1:500) and/or rhodamine-conjugated phalloidin (ThermoFisher R415) (1:10,000) for 45 min in the dark.

<p>(A) Time-lapse analysis of meiosis in two connected secondary spermatocytes dissected from <italic>him-5</italic> males expressing GFP::SPE-15 and stained by SiR-actin. The relative intensity of GFP::SPE-15 and SiR-actin along the white line is shown in the graphs. (B) Fluorescence images of spermatids undergoing differentiation dissected from <italic>him-5</italic> animals expressing GFP::SPE-15 and stained by SiR-actin. Yellow arrows indicate colocalized SPE-15 and actin in sperm. White arrows point to colocalized SPE-15 and actin at the sperm–RB boundary. (C) Fluorescence images showing accumulation of GFP::SPE-15 and SiR-actin at the spermatid–RB boundary. (D) Amino acid sequence alignment of GIPC-1 and GIPC-2. Arrows indicate the locations where premature stop codons were introduced into <italic>gipc-1</italic> and <italic>gipc-2</italic> through CRISPR/Cas9. (E) Amino acid sequence alignment of the CBDs of <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> SPE-15 and human myosin VI. The conserved RRL motif is mutated to AAA in the <italic>spe-15(qx529)</italic> mutant by CRISPR/Cas9. (F) Light and fluorescence images of differentiating spermatids dissected from <italic>him-5</italic> males then stained by anti-GIPC and anti-SPE-15 antibodies. White arrows indicate enrichment of GIPC and SPE-15 at the spermatid–RB boundary. Yellow arrows point to faint GIPC and SPE-15 signals at the spermatid poles. The cytosolic staining of SPE-15 is probably caused by recognition of SPE-15 isoforms without the motor domain by the anti-SPE-15 antibody. Scale bars: 5 μm. CBD, cargo-binding domain; CRISPR/Cas9, clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 nuclease; GFP, green fluorescent protein; GIPC, RGS-GAIP-interacting protein C terminus; RB, residual body; SiR, silicon-rhodamine; SPE-15, defective spermatogenesis 15.</p>
