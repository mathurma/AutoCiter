<abstract>
<p>The source of symmetry breaking in vertebrate oocytes is unknown. Animal—vegetal oocyte polarity is established by the Balbiani body (Bb), a conserved structure found in all animals examined that contains an aggregate of specific mRNAs, proteins, and organelles. The Bb specifies the oocyte vegetal pole, which is key to forming the embryonic body axes as well as the germline in most vertebrates. How Bb formation is regulated and how its asymmetric position is established are unknown. Using quantitative image analysis, we trace oocyte symmetry breaking in zebrafish to a nuclear asymmetry at the onset of meiosis called the chromosomal bouquet. The bouquet is a universal feature of meiosis where all telomeres cluster to one pole on the nuclear envelope, facilitating chromosomal pairing and meiotic recombination. We show that Bb precursor components first localize with the centrosome to the cytoplasm adjacent to the telomere cluster of the bouquet. They then aggregate around the centrosome in a specialized nuclear cleft that we identified, assembling the early Bb. We show that the bouquet nuclear events and the cytoplasmic Bb precursor localization are mechanistically coordinated by microtubules. Thus the animal—vegetal axis of the oocyte is aligned to the nuclear axis of the bouquet. We further show that the symmetry breaking events lay upstream to the only known regulator of Bb formation, the Bucky ball protein. Our findings link two universal features of oogenesis, the Bb and the chromosomal bouquet, to oocyte polarization. We propose that a meiotic—vegetal center couples meiosis and oocyte patterning. Our findings reveal a novel mode of cellular polarization in meiotic cells whereby cellular and nuclear polarity are aligned. We further reveal that in zygotene nests, intercellular cytoplasmic bridges remain between oocytes and that the position of the cytoplasmic bridge coincides with the location of the centrosome meiotic—vegetal organizing center. These results suggest that centrosome positioning is set by the last mitotic oogonial division plane. Thus, oocytes are polarized in two steps: first, mitotic divisions preset the centrosome with no obvious polarization yet, then the meiotic—vegetal center forms at zygotene bouquet stages, when symmetry is, in effect, broken.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In most vertebrates, an early event in egg development involves the establishment of the so-called animal—vegetal axis; this sets up the embryonic body axes and contributes to germ-line specification, and therefore, is key to embryonic development. The animal—vegetal axis is established during oogenesis by the Balbiani body (Bb), an aggregate of specific mRNAs, proteins, and mitochondria, which forms adjacent to the nucleus and ultimately defines one pole of the oocyte, the vegetal pole. Despite its universal conservation, how the Bb forms and how its position is determined is unknown. Here, we show that Bb formation is initiated at the onset of meiosis, and its position coincides with a previously known meiotic polarized nuclear configuration, the chromosomal bouquet, which gathers the chromosome ends, the telomeres, asymmetrically on the nuclear membrane to assist in homologous chromosome pairing. We reveal that a global cellular organizer functioning via microtubules generates the bouquet and aggregates the Bb precursors asymmetrically towards the centrosome. We determined that these events lie functionally upstream to the Bb regulator Bucky ball. Further upstream, we found that the centrosome appears prepositioned by an intercellular cytoplasmic bridge derived from the last presumptive cell division plane of the premeiotic oogonial cell. Thus, oocyte polarity and the chromosomal bouquet are linked through a common cellular polarization mechanism.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Cell polarity is essential to epithelial tissue formation and function in both development and homeostasis. Correct cellular polarization is required for proper asymmetric cell division of stem cells, as well as the appropriate segregation of cell fate determinants to daughter cells in the generation and maintenance of functioning tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref003">3</xref>]. Aberrant polarization in stem cells, their daughter cells, and differentiated cells causes tissue defects and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref004">4</xref>]. Tracing the origins of cell polarity in many systems has, therefore, been of great biological and clinical interest.</p>
<p>In most vertebrates, oocyte polarization along the animal—vegetal (AV) axis is key to establishing the embryonic body axes, as well as specifying the germline. First, the embryonic dorsoventral axis is established by dorsal determinants localized to the egg vegetal pole during oogenesis. Following fertilization, these vegetally-localized dorsal determinants then translocate via the Syntabulin linker, Kinesin motor, and cortical microtubules to the future dorsal side of the embryo, where they activate a Wnt signaling pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref011">11</xref>]. Nuclear localization of β-catenin then establishes the dorsal organizer, generating the embryonic dorsoventral axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref012">12</xref>]. Importantly, the mRNAs of <italic>syntabulin</italic>, as well as of dorsal determinants like <italic>wnt11</italic> and <italic>wnt8</italic> in Xenopus and zebrafish, localize to the oocyte vegetal pole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref011">11</xref>]. Disrupting their localization and/or function results in ventralized embryos that lack dorsal structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Secondly, germ cells form by inheriting vegetally-localized germ cell determinants, termed germ plasm, during cleavage stages. The germ plasm initially adheres to the cleavage furrows and then segregates to daughter cells during asymmetric cell divisions, inducing germline fate in specific blastomeres. Importantly, prior to localization to furrows, the germ plasm components are aggregated at the egg and oocyte vegetal pole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref019">19</xref>]. Finally, the AV axis of the oocyte aligns with and determines the embryonic anterior—posterior axis. Vegetal pole formation in the oocyte thus provides crucial positional information to the future developing embryo.</p>
<p>The oocyte vegetal pole is specified by the Balbiani body (Bb, also called the “mitochondrial cloud” in Xenopus). The Bb is an aggregate of mRNA protein granules (mRNP) that include embryonic patterning factors and germ plasm, as well as organelles such as mitochondria [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref020">20</xref>]. Following Bb formation adjacent to the nucleus, it associates with the oocyte cortex, where it unloads its mRNPs to specify the vegetal pole of the oocyte [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref022">22</xref>]. Demonstrating the developmental importance of the Bb, most of the dorsal determinants and germ plasm components discussed above localize to the Bb and then the vegetal pole. Moreover, the initial Bb pathway is likely further required for a second wave of vegetal mRNA localization in oogenesis, termed the “late pathway”, which utilizes a specific microtubule population and Kinesin motors to localize additional factors to the vegetal pole [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref024">24</xref>]. Loss of the Bb impedes mRNA localization by this pathway as well [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>]. Despite the importance and universal conservation of the Bb from insects to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref026">26</xref>], its formation is poorly understood. In particular, it is unknown whether its cellular position is determined stochastically or by a prepattern. The source of oocyte AV polarization is, therefore, unknown.</p>
<p>Since the Bb forms intimately associated with the nucleus, we postulated that the nucleus may determine the position of the Bb. Such a mechanism would require polarized cues from the nucleus. Intriguingly, a polarized nuclear configuration, called the chromosomal bouquet, arises preceding Bb formation. During the zygotene stage of meiosis I, the chromosomes orient as a bouquet with their telomeres clustered to one pole of the nuclear envelope (NE), while the chromosome loops face the opposing side [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref027">27</xref>]. The bouquet is a universal feature of meiosis and promotes the synapsis of homologous chromosomes to facilitate recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref027">27</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref033">33</xref>]. We hypothesized that the bouquet plays an additional role in oocyte polarity, whereby the nuclear axis of the bouquet predicts the oocyte AV axis.</p>
<p>Using quantitative image analysis and markers to define the early meiotic oocyte stages in zebrafish, we characterized the previously inaccessible early meiotic stages and analyzed the chromosomal bouquet configuration in zebrafish. We traced the first asymmetric localization of Bb precursor components to the telomere cluster of the bouquet as early as the onset of meiosis. We show that these early symmetry-breaking events lay upstream to the function of Bucky ball (Buc), the only known regulator of Bb formation. We further show in vivo that microtubules are required for both telomere clustering and Bb precursor localization during the zygotene bouquet, indicating that these cytoplasmic and nuclear events are mechanistically coordinated. In addition, we found that meiotic oocytes in zebrafish develop in nests with specialized cytoskeletal features, revealing a higher order organization of the nest. This organization indicates that centrosome positioning in meiotic oocytes is predetermined by a previous mitotic division. Overall, our data show that oocytes are polarized in two steps: first, mitotic divisions preset centrosome localization, but no other asymmetry is apparent; then, in the zygotene stage, symmetry is broken in a microtubule-dependent manner that clusters the telomeres of the bouquet and localizes Bb precursors to the region of the centrosome. To our knowledge, this is the first dissection of the early dynamics of oocyte symmetry breaking in a vertebrate, revealing that oocyte polarity aligns with a conserved nuclear polarity.</p>

<title>Bb Precursor Components Collectively Polarize in a Nuclear Cleft</title>
<p>To address when oocyte polarity is generated, we examined the localization of three core Bb components at earlier stages than previously studied: <italic>dazl</italic> mRNA, Buc, and the typical Bb-concentrated mitochondria (the Bb is also called the “mitochondrial cloud” in Xenopus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>]. As previously shown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref035">35</xref>], all three components localize to the mature Bb at the nuclear periphery of mid-diplotene stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; oocyte size of 50–70 μm in diameter). In earlier diplotene stages, we detected the three Bb components aggregated within an indentation of the NE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; 35–40 μm oocyte). Even earlier, at the onset of the diplotene stage, the nucleus exhibited a unique highly concave face, forming what we term a “nuclear cleft” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; 20 μm oocyte; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s008">S1 Video</xref>). At this stage all three Bb components were aggregated in the cytoplasm within the nuclear cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), which was also evident even earlier at the pachytene stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1A</xref>; 15–19 μm oocyte). We developed an algorithm to measure the Bb precursor intensities in the cleft versus noncleft cytoplasm of pachytene to early diplotene oocytes (“cleft analysis”, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref>). Our cleft analysis shows a robust enrichment of <italic>dazl</italic> (×6.5), Buc (×5.0), and DiOC6 (×1.8) in the cytoplasm of the nuclear cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s002">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s004">S3</xref> Figs, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>The concave shape of the NE during pachytene to diplotene stages was confirmed by LaminB1 labeling, images of live oocytes labeled with vital dyes, and ultrastructural analysis of whole ovaries (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s003">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s008">S1</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s010">S3</xref> Videos). We found that the nuclear cleft was most pronounced at the onset of diplotene and then gradually recedes to a typical spherical nucleus as the mature, spherical Bb forms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Interestingly, cleft stage nuclei lack detectable A-type lamins (LamA/C) that are evident at postcleft stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s003">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s011">S4 Video</xref>).

The specific absence of LamA/C from cleft stages may provide the nuclear flexibility that allows the cleft to form and suggests that this transient nuclear morphology is developmentally regulated.</p>

<title>Characterization of Early Meiosis in Zebrafish Oocytes</title>
<p>We found that Bb precursor components are polarized in an aggregate within a nuclear cleft at the onset of pachytene much earlier than previously known. We thus investigated if Bb precursors aggregate earlier in meiosis. However, early stages of zebrafish oogenesis are not well characterized, and meiosis was not addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref040">40</xref>]. We therefore characterized the stages preceding pachytene, the leptotene and zygotene bouquet stages. We investigated the telomere dynamics characteristic of these early meiotic stages, which is conserved across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref027">27</xref>], using a telomere FISH marker.</p>
<p>We also examined centrosome localization, which functions in mouse spermatocytes to cluster the telomeres of the bouquet stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s004">S3 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref041">41</xref>]. We found that in premeiotic oogonia, telomeres are randomly distributed in nuclei but become loaded radially on the NE at the leptotene stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2A</xref>); the centrosome at these stages is positioned perinuclearly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2B</xref>).

<p>We found that the centrosome localized to the cytoplasm facing the telomere cluster at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). At the pachytene stage, telomeres redistributed radially on the NE then detached from the NE at the onset of diplotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). At these two stages, the centrosome localized roughly to the center of the clearly evident nuclear cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). At later diplotene stages (&gt;25 μm), we could not detect the centrosome, consistent with its known loss during oogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref043">43</xref>].</p>
<p>During our analysis, we found that early meiotic zebrafish oocytes develop in nests (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). A germline cyst is defined as a cluster of germ cells, which are connected via cytoplasmic bridges that remain from previous incomplete mitotic divisions and are collectively surrounded by somatic follicle cells. A nest defines the same organization as that of the cyst, but where cytoplasmic bridges were not directly demonstrated. Development of germ cells within cysts is conserved from insects to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref044">44</xref>]. However, in zebrafish only premeiotic oogonia, not meiotic oocytes, were described in nests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref040">40</xref>]. We observed zygotene bouquet stage cells tightly adjacent to each other, with no follicle cells apparent between them, although they were detectable around the zygotene cell groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s014">S7 Video</xref>). β-Catenin staining of cell membranes was similar in premeiotic oogonia, leptotene, and zygotene cells consistent with these cells residing within a nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Electron micrograph (EM) images confirmed the presence of only two membranes, tightly juxtaposed to each other, between zygotene oocytes, ruling out the presence of follicle cells between oocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s005">S4A Fig</xref>, red arrowheads; <italic>n</italic> = 19 oocytes in 7 nests of two ovaries). While this organization may represent a cyst, we did not directly examine cytoplasmic bridges between oocytes and therefore define these as meiotic nests.</p>

<title>Earliest Asymmetry at Zygotene Bouquet Stage</title>
<p>Having identified the oogonia, leptotene, and zygotene stages, we then examined Bb precursor components during these oogenesis stages. We first addressed mitochondrial aggregation with DiOC6 labeling, which detects the Bb-enriched mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>). While the DiOC6 signal was radially distributed in premeiotic oogonia, it was enriched in zygotene stages in the perinuclear cytoplasm apposing the telomere cluster (“telomere cluster cytoplasm”; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>). Since DiOC6 does not detect mitochondria specifically, we examined mitochondrial localization ultrastructurally. Transmission electron microscopy (TEM) images clearly showed radially distributed mitochondria in oogonia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). At zygotene stages, the contact of synapsed chromosomes (SCs) with the NE marks the presumptive telomere cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, arrowheads), consistent with our zygotene confocal observations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, top). Counting the number of mitochondria in high-power images of the entire cytoplasm 360° around the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s005">S4A Fig</xref>) confirms the enrichment of mitochondria to the cytoplasm apposing the presumptive telomere cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>To measure potential enrichment of Bb precursor components in the telomere cluster cytoplasm, we developed a quantitative, high-throughput MATLAB program we term “zygotene nest analysis” (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec010">Materials and Methods</xref>). This algorithm is based on our observation that the centrosome is a reliable marker of the telomere cluster cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and tests for enrichment of other components in the cytoplasm surrounding it. We first measured the enrichment of DiOC6 labeling at the zygotene bouquet stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Indeed, our nest analysis results showed a 1.6-fold DiOC6 enrichment to the telomere cluster cytoplasm, specifically at zygotene stages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>We next investigated localization of the Buc protein, the only protein known to be required for Bb formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>]. Buc localizes to the mature Bb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref034">34</xref>] and to the pachytene Bb precursor aggregate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). We detected Buc radially distributed in oogonia cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). However, at zygotene Buc is enriched in the centrosome-telomere cluster cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Nest analysis reveals a 1.7-fold enrichment versus the remaining cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>), specifically at zygotene. As a control, we measured intensities of a transgene-driving DCLK-GFP (<italic>Tg(Ef1α</italic>:<italic>Dclk-GFP)</italic>), a microtubule binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref006">6</xref>]. Nest analysis showed no specific enrichment in either oogonia or zygotene oocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s005">S4B Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>). We investigated Buc localization relative to the centrosome in zygotene oocytes, colabeling cell membranes with β-Catenin. Indeed, Buc localized to the centrosome cytoplasmic region of zygotene oocytes (100%, <italic>n</italic> = 14 oocytes; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Therefore, Bb precursor components become specifically enriched in the telomere cluster cytoplasm at the zygotene stage.</p>
<p>GasZ is another protein resident to the Bb in mid-to-late diplotene stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref045">45</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). GasZ serves as a scaffold protein for the piRNA machinery in perinuclear nuage in mice testis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref046">46</xref>]. We found that perinuclear granules in early zebrafish oocytes contain the Vasa, Ziwi, and Zili proteins colocalized with the nuclear pore complex marker mAb414 (perinuclear spherules; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s005">S4C Fig</xref>), similar to Vasa (GLH-1) P granule localization to nuclear pores in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref048">48</xref>]. Consistent with its localization in mice testes, we detected GasZ colocalized with mAb414 to these perinuclear granules radially around oogonia nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s005">S4D Fig</xref>). GasZ immunostaining was not compatible with the Telo-FISH protocol, preventing a direct test for colocalization in the bouquet. However, we found that mAb414 spherule immunostaining localized to the telomere cluster at the bouquet stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). We therefore used mAb414 spherules as a reference for GasZ localization in the bouquet. GasZ exhibited a polarized pattern in the bouquet, similar to that of mAb414 spherules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Pixel-wise statistical analysis in zygotene stages confirmed colocalization of GasZ and mAb414 signals (average Pearson correlation coefficient = 0.5; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>; ~75% of each signal was colocalized with the other, Manders coefficient). GasZ bouquet localization was also confirmed by costaining for GasZ and DiOC6. Therefore, the Bb precursor GasZ protein localizes to the telomere cluster cytoplasm of the bouquet.</p>
<p>Consistent with GasZ and the mAb414 spherule dynamics, the piRNA processing enzymes, Ziwi and Zili, and the RNA binding protein in the piRNA pathway Vasa, exhibited the same transition from radial granules in oogonia to high localization to the telomere cluster apposing cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). While a role for such a polarized localization of perinuclear granules in the piRNA pathway is unclear, these granules might have been coopted to contribute components of similar functions, like GasZ, to the forming Bb. GasZ bridges different mRNA binding proteins within the nuage in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref049">49</xref>] and could function similarly within the forming Bb.</p>
<p>Having defined the mAb414 spherules as markers for the telomere cluster position at zygotene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), we utilized it to further analyze individual zygotene oocytes for their Buc localization. We identified zygotene oocytes blind to the Buc channel, and scored oocytes with clear mAb414-clustered localization, typical of its pattern in zygotene bouquet. We then turned on the Buc channel and examined its distribution in reference to the mAb414 signal position. Consistent with our previous analyses, this approach confirmed the transition of Buc from a radial distribution in oogonia to enrichment at the cytoplasm apposing the telomere cluster, as visualized by the mAb414 cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that Bb precursors transition from radial distribution in premeiotic oogonia to being enriched in the cytoplasm facing the bouquet telomere cluster (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). This association of Bb precursors, the centrosome and the telomere cluster, unveils the first symmetry breaking in the zebrafish oocyte. At this stage, the nuclear axis of the bouquet predicts the cellular AV axis in the oocyte, with the telomere cluster position marking the future vegetal pole.</p>

<title>The Chromosomal Bouquet Stage Asymmetries Lie Upstream of Buc</title>
<p>Before our current findings, early steps of Bb formation were unknown. A functional pathway for Bb formation has, therefore, yet to be constructed.

<p>We next examined Bb precursor enrichment in the nuclear cleft stages that follow the bouquet stage in <italic>buc</italic> mutants. Most <italic>buc</italic><sup>-/-</sup> oocytes from pachytene through early diplotene (17–25 μm) showed normal morphology, with a nuclear cleft enriched for DiOC6 signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Only at late diplotene stages (25–45 μm) were aberrant DiOC6 patterns detected; in most oocytes, DiOC6 was expanded completely radially, while in the remaining oocytes DiOC6 was expanded partly outside the nuclear cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). As expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>], all mid-diplotene <italic>buc</italic> mutant oocytes (≥50 μm) lack a Bb based on both DiOC6 and <italic>dazl</italic> mRNA localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). These dynamics show that while the mitochondrial aggregate disperses at late diplotene stages, its formation is intact through the zygotene—pachytene stages. Following its normal bouquet localization, the centrosome properly localizes consistently to the nuclear cleft in <italic>buc</italic> mutant oocytes through pachytene to early diplotene stages. Therefore, early polarization appears normal in <italic>buc</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> oocytes. These results altogether demonstrate that Buc is required for Bb formation downstream of the zygotene bouquet configuration and early asymmetry formation, and in parallel to or downstream of nuclear cleft formation.</p>
<p>Interestingly, <italic>dazl</italic> transcript is not enriched in the cleft of <italic>buc</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> pachytene to early diplotene (17–25 μm) oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>). We performed quantitative real-time polymerase chain reaction (QRT-PCR) analysis to compare <italic>dazl</italic> levels between Wt and <italic>buc</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> ovaries. No decrease in <italic>dazl</italic> levels was detected, indicating that <italic>dazl</italic> remains present but is no longer localized in <italic>buc</italic><sup><italic>-/-</italic></sup> oocytes, as reported previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref050">50</xref>]. Since Buc does not bind mRNA itself, but does interact with at least one RNA binding protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref034">34</xref>], it likely functions through such interactions to localize <italic>dazl</italic> to the cleft. A role for Buc in actively forming the large RNP Bb granule is consistent with Buc as an intrinsically disordered protein (IDP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref051">51</xref>]. IDPs provide adhesive scaffolds in mRNPs, promoting their phase separation from the soluble cytoplasm into distinct bodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref054">54</xref>]. Buc might serve a similar adhesive role in the Bb precursor aggregate. In the absence of Buc, the zygotene—pachytene mitochondrial aggregate does form but then disperses and fails to mature into a Bb. While Buc is required for Bb formation, Buc position is set upstream by the centrosome telomere-cluster cytoplasm during the symmetry-breaking events of the zygotene stage.</p>

<title>Microtubules in Early Meiotic Oocytes</title>
<p>We investigated further the relationship between bouquet formation and early asymmetry of Bb components.

Therefore, we characterized microtubule organization during early oogenesis as a possible link between chromosomal bouquet formation and Bb component aggregation.</p>
<p>We used a transgenic microtubule reporter line, <italic>EMTB-3GFP</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref056">56</xref>] and costained for γTubulin to visualize the centrosome. We found rather loose radially symmetric perinuclear microtubules in premeiotic oogonia without significant enrichment around the centrosome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). In zygotene stages, a denser network of microtubules appeared around the centrosome at the cytoplasmic site apposing the telomere cluster. At later zygotene stages the network appeared wider, concomitant with the wider nuclear distribution of telomeres (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">2A</xref>).

The organization of microtubules around the centrosomes during zygotene suggests that the centrosome functions as a microtubule organizing center (MTOC) at this stage and that the role of microtubules in bouquet formation is conserved in zebrafish.</p>

<p>We also examined acetylated microtubules during these early meiotic stages and found a specialized cytoskeletal organization unique to the meiotic nest. We observed long cables of acetylated tubulin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>). While varying in length, each cable emanated from a centrosome of one cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s015">S8 Video</xref>). The acetylated cables were specific to leptotene and zygotene nests: they were absent from premeiotic oogonia and were first detected in leptotene oocytes, where they appeared shorter and fewer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), suggesting that they grow and fully mature at zygotene. We never observed the cables in later stage oocytes. Costaining for Acetylated tubulin and telomeres showed that the cables extend from the position of the telomere cluster, consistent with their centrosome association (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s007">S6 Fig</xref>). Furthermore, costaining with β-Catenin indicates that some of these cables extend between cells in the nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s016">S9 Video</xref>). This observation also suggests that the cells in the meiotic nest are connected and some of the acetylated cables may extend through cytoplasmic bridges between oocytes.</p>
<p>Interestingly at the zygotene to pachytene transition, we detected microtubules extending significant distances between pairs of cells in what appeared to be cytoplasmic bridges connecting the microtubule meshworks that surround the centrosome of each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). We never detected acetylated tubulin staining at the zygotene to pachytene transition when these interoocyte connections were apparent. Only zygotene to pachytene transitioning oocytes displayed these microtubule connections, and they were always located in the periphery of a nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). These cells may be completing cytokinesis and separating from the nest. Such a release from the nest at the zygotene to pachytene transition is consistent with that of the mouse ovary, where early meiosis occurs in nests and individual oocyte folliculization initiates at pachytene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref057">57</xref>].</p>
<p>Intriguingly, the acetylated and then nonacetylated microtubules we observed here strikingly resemble the typical events of late cytokinesis, where midbody microtubules that extend in the cytoplasmic bridges are acetylated but then their deacetylation is required for cytokinesis completion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref063">63</xref>]. This suggests that zygotene—pachytene-transitioning oocytes complete cytokinesis for their release from the nest. Importantly, the nonacetylated microtubules connect the centrosome regions of the two connected oocytes, indicating that the final mitotic division of oogonia may set the centrosome position at zygotene. Remarkably, the centrosome region at this stage already defines the future vegetal pole of these oocytes. This indicates that the last mitotic division of oogonia may predispose the bouquet configuration and polarization. While polarization is, in effect, established at zygotene, these early events may preset its axis.</p>

<title>The Bouquet Microtubules Couple Telomere Clustering and Bb Precursor Localization</title>
<p>Our data show that oocyte symmetry breaking can be traced back to the zygotene bouquet stage, when Bb precursors transition from a radial distribution to localization at the centrosome cytoplasm apposing the telomere cluster of the bouquet configuration. We next tested this correlation functionally. Microtubules are key in generating the telomere movements that establish the chromosomal bouquet in mice spermatocytes and in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref041">41</xref>]. Our data show that the centrosome—microtubule—telomere bouquet cellular organization found in these organisms is conserved in zebrafish zygotene oocytes. Microtubules are, therefore, strong candidates to link the nuclear telomere movements with the cytoplasmic localization of Bb precursors.</p>
<p>To examine microtubule function and test the functional correlation of Bb precursor localization and telomere clustering, we aimed to disrupt microtubules and monitor Bb precursors and telomeres simultaneously. We established a protocol to isolate whole ovaries, culture them for a short period, and treat them for 80 min with the microtubule depolymerizing drug nocodazole or dimethyl sulfoxide (DMSO) as a control. The two ovaries from each fish were split between the nocodazole and DMSO groups, with the latter serving as an internal control. Nocodazole depolymerized microtubules of all oocyte stages, including zygotene bouquet oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Unexpectedly, we also found that nocodazole disrupted most of the acetylated tubulin cables of zygotene oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

</fig>
<p>We then examined Bb precursors and telomeres in zygotene oocytes where both populations of microtubules are absent. To monitor Bb precursors we used DiOC6 to mark Bb mitochondria, since it is the best Bb precursor marker that is compatible with the telomere FISH staining (the FISH protocol requires harsh conditions, which are deleterious for most antibodies and epitopes). We found that in control DMSO-treated ovaries, zygotene oocytes showed normal clustering of telomeres and typical localization of DiOC6 in the apposing cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). In contrast, nocodazole-treated zygotene oocytes showed partial to complete radial dispersion of telomeres. Moreover, the same oocytes showed a concomitant expansion of DiOC6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). We never observed an oocyte where one but not the other was affected. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6D</xref> schematizes these effects.</p>
<p>We next quantified these results. To avoid misinterpretation of results, we avoided early and late zygotene stage oocytes where telomere clustering is still incomplete or starting to disperse, respectively. Midzygotene oocytes display condensed chromosomes, a single peripheral nucleolus, and are approximately 12 μm in diameter, (10–11 μm are early and 14–15 μm are late zygotene). To test our ability to identify midzygotene oocytes based on these criteria, we scored the cells blind to the telomere channel and only selected oocytes of 11.5–13 μm in diameter. We then turned on the telomere channel and analyzed telomere clustering and DiOC6 patterns. Using this method, we found that 93% of DMSO-treated oocytes showed normal telomere clustering and apposing DiOC6 localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, blue dots, <italic>n</italic> = 45 oocytes in 7 nests of 2 ovaries). However, following nocodazole treatment, 88.5% of oocytes showed broad expansion of both telomeres and DiOC6, as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6C and 6E</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6E</xref> red dots, <italic>n</italic> = 71 oocytes in 11 nests of 4 ovaries). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g006">Fig 6F</xref> shows the pooled results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s001">S1 Data</xref>). These results demonstrate that microtubules are required for both telomere clustering and DiOC6 localization during zygotene bouquet, strongly arguing that they are coregulated and functionally linked.</p>
<p>In our experimental settings, we disrupted both the dynamic microtubule population and the acetylated tubulin cables. We cannot distinguish if one or both populations are required for telomere clustering and DiOC6 localization. However, we observed cases where nests in nocodazole-treated ovaries still showed intact acetylated tubulin cables, but DiOC6 was still dispersed. Since perinuclear microtubules were always disrupted, we believe that they may be more directly involved in telomere clustering and DiOC6 localization, and while the acetylated cables may be required, they are not sufficient.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We trace the first asymmetry in the zebrafish oocyte to chromosomal bouquet formation at the onset of meiosis, much earlier than previously known. Asymmetry is established when Bb precursors transition from radial distribution in premeiotic oogonia to being enriched in the cytoplasm facing the bouquet telomere cluster. Telomere clustering in the bouquet promotes homologous chromosomes to pair, facilitating recombination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref064">64</xref>]. We now report that Bb precursor components localize to the associated centrosome and telomere-cluster cytoplasm of the bouquet, facilitating Bb formation and vegetal pole specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). To our knowledge, our finding that the bouquet nuclear axis aligns with the oocyte AV axis provides the first evidence for the bouquet being linked to a process outside of meiosis. We propose that the bouquet association of the centrosome and the telomere cluster comprise a meiotic—vegetal center that couples meiotic genetic events with oocyte patterning.</p>

<title>Dynamics of zebrafish oocyte polarization.</title>
<p><bold>(A)</bold> Oocyte symmetry breaking model and early Bb formation. In the premeiotic oogonia, Bb precursors are distributed radially in the cytoplasm, telomeres are scattered intranuclearly, and the centrosome is at a perinuclear position. Nuclear and cytoplasmic asymmetry is first evident when meiosis initiates, and the centrosome and the telomere cluster form the meiotic—vegetal center (circled by a dashed line) during zygotene stages. Bb precursors transition to the cytoplasm localized around the centrosome and adjacent to the telomere cluster of the zygotene bouquet configuration. At this stage the nuclear axis of the bouquet configuration predicts the animal—vegetal cellular axis of the oocyte, with the telomere cluster and the centrosome marking the future vegetal pole. At the subsequent pachytene stage, the nuclear cleft forms at the position of the centrosome where the Bb precursor components also aggregate. The nuclear cleft is most pronounced at the onset of diplotene (20 μm). Throughout pachytene and early diplotene (17–25 μm), the centrosome is found at the center of the Bb precursor aggregate and the cleft. During the following diplotene stages, the nuclear cleft gradually rounds out and the mature, spherical Bb forms, marking the definitive vegetal pole in the oocyte. <bold>(B)</bold> Model for polarization in the cyst. Oogonia in the cyst are connected by cytoplasmic bridges due to incomplete cytokinesis. With the onset of meiosis, specialized acetylated tubulin cables may connect sister oocyte pairs through the cytoplasmic bridges of the last mitotic oogonial division (a highlighted pair is shown). The division plane of the mitotic oogonia therefore positions the centrosome and the future meiotic—vegetal center at zygotene. While the polarity axis may be preset in the mitotic oogonia, polarization is only active at the onset of meiosis, when symmetry is in effect broken.</p>

<p>The chromosomal bouquet is a universally conserved meiotic feature discovered in 1900 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref027">27</xref>], and the Bb is a universally conserved oocyte feature discovered in 1845 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref020">20</xref>]. For the first time to our knowledge, we link these two fundamental oocyte features in the establishment of oocyte polarity. In most vertebrates, oocyte polarization is crucial in setting up the body axes and specifying cell fates in embryonic development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref017">17</xref>]. In Xenopus, where the mature Bb has been well described, early dynamics of Bb precursors is lacking. While mitochondrial aggregates were described in premeiotic oogonia, it is not clear whether these are directly related to the mitochondria aggregates within the later mature diplotene Bb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref014">14</xref>]. The potential roles of the mammalian Bb and oocyte polarity in general are less clear. Nonetheless, a Bb does form in oocytes of all mammals including human [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref026">26</xref>], comprising at least a transient polarized oocyte morphology. While the mouse Bb is detected at diplotene stages between P3–P7, localization of Bb precursors at zygotene stages (E14.5) was not addressed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref026">26</xref>]. The wide conservation of the bouquet and the Bb argues for the conservation of the meiotic—vegetal center in generating polarity generally in oocytes.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, we provide the first evidence that a polarized nuclear morphology predicts cellular polarity. During asymmetric cell division in mitotic cells, interactions between the centrosome and the chromosomes or the nucleus serve as a platform for a polarized segregation of cell fate determinants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref065">65</xref>]. We show an analogous example in meiotic cells where polarity factors localize to the centrosome—telomere cluster cytoplasm in the zygotene bouquet stage. Importantly, before the bouquet stage, the centrosome is at a perinuclear position, but telomeres are not clustered on the NE and Bb components are radially distributed in the cytoplasm. Only when the centrosome associates with the telomeres in the bouquet stage do Bb precursor components begin to aggregate in the telomere cluster cytoplasm. This suggests a mechanistic connection between the centrosome and the clustered telomeres of the bouquet that is also required for the initiation of Bb component recruitment.</p>
<p>In the bouquet stage of various species, telomeres are connected to the centrosome via NE-resident Sun-KASH domain proteins and cytoplasmic microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref055">55</xref>]. However, the molecular nature of the centrosome—telomere association in the zebrafish meiotic—vegetal center, as well as the functional interactions that recruit Bb components to establish polarity in any vertebrate have been unknown. We analyzed microtubule localization in zebrafish zygotene oocytes and found that the bouquet centrosome—microtubule—telomere cellular organization is conserved. Furthermore, we find that microtubules are simultaneously required for both the telomere clustering and the apposing localization of Bb precursors of the bouquet. In their absence, telomeres and Bb mitochondria are dispersed. Thus, bouquet microtubules provide a mechanistic link between the nuclear events of the bouquet and the cytoplasmic events of Bb formation.</p>
<p>How microtubules localize Bb precursors is still an open question. Microtubules could localize Bb precursors either by movements that stir cytoplasm towards the centrosome or by serving as routes for dynein/kinesin motors that localize Bb precursors as cargo. The (−) end motor dynein is a more likely candidate since localization is towards the (−) end of microtubules at the centrosome. Intriguingly, dynein localizes to telomere-bound Sun/KASH proteins on the NE and is required for chromosome synapsis in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> zygotene oocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref031">31</xref>]. More experiments are required to distinguish between these possibilities in zebrafish.</p>
<p>Previous studies in Xenopus found no requirement for microtubules in localizing mRNA to the Bb [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref066">66</xref>]. However, these experiments were performed at much later stages of oogenesis addressing localization to the mature Bb. Our experiments show that microtubules are required for the initial localization of Bb precursors during its early formation. We also find a microtubule network at pachytene—early diplotene around the centrosome within the nuclear cleft, where Bb precursors are enriched. It will be interesting to address the roles of microtubules in Bb aggregation and cleft formation during these stages.</p>
<p>The tracing of oocyte symmetry breaking to the meiotic—vegetal center in turn raises the question of upstream regulation of the activation and positioning of its components, i.e., the centrosome and the site of clustered telomeres. Germ cells, from insects to humans, develop in germline cysts or nests [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref044">44</xref>]. While only premeiotic oogonia were described in zebrafish cysts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref038">38</xref>], we found that leptotene and zygotene oocytes develop within nests as well, some of which are clearly still connected by cytoplasmic bridges at the zygotene to pachytene transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5B–5D</xref>).</p>
<p>The synchronized development and polarization of oocytes within the nest provides an environment wherein a higher order organization of the nest could regulate their polarization. The nest could, for example, be organized by intrinsic positioning of the centrosome by preceding oriented cell divisions and/or by paracrine signaling from surrounding follicle cells. We found a novel cytoskeletal feature in the meiotic nest that argues for a higher order nest organization. We find cables of acetylated microtubules in leptotene to zygotene stages and then nonacetylated microtubules at the zygotene to pachytene transition that can extend between two oocytes in the nest, likely reflecting cytoplasmic bridges. This is strikingly similar to the typical events of late cytokinesis, where acetylated midbody microtubules in the cytoplasmic bridge are then deacetylated in order to complete cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref058">58</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref063">63</xref>]. This suggests that the two connected oocytes that we observe constitute daughter cells from the last mitotic division. Remarkably, these microtubule extensions connect the two cells via their centrosome cytoplasm, indicating that the last mitotic division plane may localize the centrosomes and the meiotic—vegetal center, and predispose the axis of the bouquet and oocyte polarization. While no asymmetry is observed in oogonia, polarization may be established in two stages. In this model, the last mitotic division presets the polarization axis, but then polarization is only active at zygotene, when Bb precursors first asymmetrically localize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g007">Fig 7B</xref>).</p>
<p>At zygotene stage, the cables of acetylated tubulin associate with centrosomes of the bouquet (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g005">Fig 5B and 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s007">S6 Fig</xref>), where dynamic perinuclear microtubules also reside. The structure of the acetylated cables strikingly resembles that of the axoneme of primary cilia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref067">67</xref>]. Similar to primary cilia, these structures in the nest may serve mechanical and/or signaling roles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref067">67</xref>]. Such cables may be affixed to the midbody (as discussed above) and serve as anchors or transmit forces important in the dramatic chromosomal movements that generate the zygotene bouquet configuration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref041">41</xref>].</p>
<p>Forward genetic screens have not identified the oocyte polarity regulators in early meiotic stages in vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref069">69</xref>], and the accessibility of these stages to in vivo and quantitative imaging techniques has been challenging. Our dissection of early oocyte polarization in zebrafish now enables a reverse genetic approach, utilizing the advances in CRISPR/Cas9 techniques. Our work redefines the zygotene bouquet as a global cellular organizer at the nexus of oocyte differentiation. The juvenile zebrafish ovary arises as an attractive model to study the intersection of the fundamental biological processes of cell polarity and spatiotemporal tissue organization, encompassing mitosis and meiosis in a key developmental context.</p>

To fix the ovaries for immunostaining, RNA-FISH, and DNA-FISH, fish were cut along the ventral midline and the lateral body wall was removed. The head and tail were removed and the trunk pieces, with the exposed abdomen containing the ovaries, were fixed in 4% PFA at 4°C overnight with nutation. Trunks were then washed in PBS, and ovaries were finely dissected in cold PBS. Ovaries were washed in PBS and then either stored in PBS at 4°C in the dark, or dehydrated and stored in 100% MeOH at −20°C in the dark. For microtubule staining, fixation was carried out using a microtubule stabilizing buffer (MSB), including 3.7% formaldehyde, 0.25% glutaraldehyde, and 0.5 μM Taxol (MSB-fix; [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref071">71</xref>]). Post-fix washes and dissections were done in MSB without fix and taxol, and ovaries were stored in MeOH at −20°C in the dark.</p>

<p>Ovaries were washed 2 times for 5 min (2 x 5 min) in PBT (0.3% Triton X-100 in 1 x PBS; if stored in MeOH, ovaries were gradually rehydrated first), then washed 2 x 20 min, 1 x 40 min, 1 x 20 min in PBT. Ovaries were blocked for 1.5–2 h in blocking solution (10% FBS in PBT) at room temperature and then incubated with primary antibodies in blocking solution at 4°C overnight. Ovaries were washed 4 x 20 min in PBT and incubated with secondary antibodies in fresh blocking solution for 1.75 hr and were light protected from this step onward. Ovaries were washed 4 x 20 min in PBT and then incubated in PBT containing DAPI (1:1,000, Molecular Probes), with or without DiOC6 (1:5,000, Molecular Probes) for 50 min and washed 2 x 5 min in PBT and 2 x 5 min in PBS. All steps were carried out with nutation. Ovaries were transferred into Vectashield (with DAPI, Vector labs). Ovaries were finally mounted between two #1.5 coverslips using a 120 μm spacer (Molecular Probes).</p>
<p>Primary antibodies used were mAb414 (1:1,000, Abcam), LamB1 (1:400, Abcam), γTubulin (1:400, Sigma-Aldrich), Buc (1:500) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref034">34</xref>], LamA/C (ready for use, Progen Biotech), GFP (1:400; Molecular Probes), Vasa (1:5,000) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref072">72</xref>], Zili (1:100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref073">73</xref>], Ziwi (1:250) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref074">74</xref>], GasZ (1:100) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref045">45</xref>], Acetylated tubulin (1:200; Sigma-Aldrich), β-Catenin (1:1,000; Sigma-Aldrich). Secondary antibodies used were anti-rabbit IgG, or anti-mouse IgG1, or anti-mouse IgG2b, Alexa 488, and Alexa 594 (all 1:500, Molecular Probes).</p>
<p>RNA-FISH was performed using the DNA-HCR-FISH technique (Molecular Instruments) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002335.ref075">75</xref>], following the company protocol, except for the hybridization temperature that was optimized for 50°C.</p>

If FISH procedures did not start immediately, ovaries were stored overnight in PBS at 4°C. During IHC that preceded RNA-FISH, all blocking solutions also contained RNAasin (1:100, Sigma-Aldreich), to protect against potential RNAases in the blocking serum. All transitions between SSC buffers and PBS were done gradually to protect tissue morphology. After staining was complete, DAPI (+/- DiOC6) staining and mounting was performed as described above.</p>

<title>Cleft analysis</title>
<p>We observed that in pachytene-early diplotene oocytes (17–25 μm) the centrosome localizes roughly to the center of the cleft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and roughly to the center of the Bb precursor aggregate within the cleft (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5A Fig</xref>). Based on these observations, we developed the code below, which utilizes the centrosome as a marker for cleft cytoplasm and measures intensities in “in-cleft cytoplasm” (centrosome-adjacent cytoplasm) versus “noncleft cytoplasm” (centrosome-nonadjacent cytoplasm).</p>
<p>Pachytene and early diplotene oocytes were manually staged according to the criteria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2</xref>. A region of interest (ROI) was hand-drawn on each slice of the three-dimensional (3-D) image stack to outline each oocyte. Within this ROI, subregions of the oocyte were identified by reference stain intensity. First, nuclear regions were defined as areas of the cell where DAPI was above a user-specified threshold, and gamma tubulin background staining (which is absent from the nucleus) was below a user-specified threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5B Fig</xref>, left column). All nuclear regions were subtracted from the ROI to specifically yield the cytoplasmic region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5B Fig</xref>, center column).</p>
<p>Next, we identified the centrosome and split the cytoplasm into a region close to the centrosome (“centrosome-adjacent”) and a region far from the centrosome (“centrosome-nonadjacent”). We defined a centrosome to be a three-dimensional (3-D) group of at least eight connected pixels with gamma tubulin staining above a minimum threshold. The center point of the 3-D pixel group was identified using the regional maxima of a Euclidean distance transform. To select the centrosome-adjacent cytoplasm, a sphere (radius = 4.8 μm) was drawn around the center of the centrosome. We called the cytoplasm within this sphere centrosome-adjacent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5B Fig</xref>, right column, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), and it represents “in-cleft cytoplasm.” To select centrosome-nonadjacent cytoplasm, a larger sphere (radius = 6 μm) was drawn around the center point of the centrosome. We called the cytoplasm outside of this sphere centrosome-nonadjacent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5B Fig</xref>, right column; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and it represents “noncleft cytoplasm". The sphere radii were chosen by measuring the approximate sizes of clefts in most oocytes and assigning a radius that most often captured the cytoplasm within the cleft.</p>
<p>The average pixel intensity of the experimental stain (<italic>dazl</italic> mRNA, Buc, or DiOC<sub>6</sub>) was measured in each region (nuclear, centrosome-adjacent cytoplasm, and centrosome-nonadjacent cytoplasm). To normalize pixel intensity across different 3-D image stacks, the average pixel intensity within the nuclear region was subtracted from the cytoplasmic intensities.</p>

<sec id="sec016">
<title>Zygotene nest analysis</title>
<p>We found that the centrosome localizes to the telomere cluster cytoplasm in zygotene oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) and can thus serve as a marker for this region. We also observed that, similar to premeiotic oogonia oocytes, zygotene oocytes reside in nests, where they are tightly clustered, with follicle cells collectively surrounding the clustered oocytes in each nest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s014">S7 Video</xref>). Because nests of zygotene oocytes are packed tightly, analysis of individual zygotene oocytes was challenging and potentially inaccurate. We instead developed the code described below to measure intensities in centrosome-adjacent cytoplasm (“telomere cluster cytoplasm”) versus the centrosome-nonadjacent cytoplasm (the remaining cytoplasm away from the telomere cluster) in entire zygotene nests, analyzing many cells simultaneously.</p>
<p>Nests of zygotene oocytes were identified manually, according to the criteria in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002335.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s004">S3 Fig</xref>. A region of interest (ROI) was hand-drawn around the zygotene oocytes of interest on each slice of the three-dimensional (3-D) image stack. These ROI’s may contain one or multiple zygotene nests. The close packing of these nests made it difficult to unambiguously distinguish between one nest and the next. Individual oocytes were not separated in this analysis, and the cytoplasm of the cells in the entire nest or groups of nests was measured in bulk. To identify specific subregions of the nest, first nuclei were defined by the presence of DAPI staining above a user-specified threshold and the absence of cytoplasmic background gamma tubulin staining defined by a user-specified threshold (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5C Fig</xref>, left column). All nuclear regions were subtracted from the ROI to specifically yield the cytoplasmic region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5C Fig</xref>, center column).</p>
<p>Next, we identified the centrosome and split the cytoplasm into regions close to centrosomes (“centrosome-adjacent”) and regions far from centrosomes (“centrosome-nonadjacent”). We defined a centrosome to be a three-dimensional (3-D) group of at least eight connected pixels with gamma tubulin staining above a minimum threshold. The center point of the 3-D pixel group was identified using the regional maxima of a Euclidean distance transform. To select the centrosome-adjacent cytoplasm, a sphere was drawn around the center of all centrosomes within the ROI (radius = 1.2 μm). The approximate distance between the centrosome and the nucleus in most cells determined the radius of the sphere. Cytoplasm within these spheres was defined as centrosome-adjacent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5C Fig</xref>, right column). To define the centrosome-nonadjacent cytoplasm, a larger sphere was drawn around the center of all centrosomes in the image (radius = 2.4 μm), and any cytoplasm not encompassed by these spheres was called centrosome-nonadjacent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002335.s006">S5C Fig</xref>, right column).</p>
<p>The average pixel intensity of the experimental stain (Buc or DiOC6, or Dclk-GFP) was measured in each region (nuclear, centrosome-adjacent cytoplasm and centrosome-nonadjacent cytoplasm). To normalize pixel intensity across different 3-D image stacks, the average pixel intensity within the nuclear region was subtracted from the cytoplasmic intensity.</p>

<title>GasZ and mAb414 Colocalization</title>
<p>A pixel-wise quantitative test for colocalization of GasZ with mAb414 signals was performed using the Coloc 2 plug-in on Fiji. We calculated a point spread function (PF) of ~2.5–3 pixels on average for each channel and image, based on PSF = [0.8 x Exitation wave length (nm) / objective’s NA] / pixel size (nm). Min and max thresholds were automatically set by the plug-in for each image. Pearson correlation coefficient (R) was calculated to be ~0.5. R values represent: −1 &lt; R &lt; 0, anticorrelation; R = 0, no correlation; 0 &lt; R &lt; 1, correlation. The plug-in then scrambles the pixels to generate a random image and test for the probability to yield the same Pearson coefficient from a random image. Scrambling was set to 100 iterations, generating 100 different random images from the tested image’s pixels. The probability of receiving Pearson coefficient of R = ~0.5 was <italic>p</italic> = 1.
