<p>Signalling by the cytokine TGF-β regulates mature CD4+ T cell populations but is not involved in the survival and function of regulatory T cells.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>TGF-β is widely held to be critical for the maintenance and function of regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells and thus peripheral tolerance. This is highlighted by constitutive ablation of TGF-β receptor (TR) during thymic development in mice, which leads to a lethal autoimmune syndrome. Here we describe that TGF-β–driven peripheral tolerance is not regulated by TGF-β signalling on mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Inducible TR2 ablation specifically on CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells did not result in a lethal autoinflammation. Transfer of these TR2-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to lymphopenic recipients resulted in colitis, but not overt autoimmunity. In contrast, thymic ablation of TR2 in combination with lymphopenia led to lethal multi-organ inflammation. Interestingly, deletion of TR2 on mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells does not result in the collapse of the T<sub>reg</sub> cell population as observed in constitutive models. Instead, a pronounced enlargement of both regulatory and effector memory T cell pools was observed. This expansion is cell-intrinsic and seems to be caused by increased T cell receptor sensitivity independently of common gamma chain-dependent cytokine signals. The expression of Foxp3 and other regulatory T cells markers was not dependent on TGF-β signalling and the TR2–deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells retained their suppressive function both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. In summary, absence of TGF-β signalling on mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is not responsible for breakdown of peripheral tolerance, but rather controls homeostasis of mature T cells in adult mice.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>TGF-β is a cytokine thought to be critical for the maintenance and function of tolerance in the immune system. In many studies the disruption of TGF-β signalling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (a type of white blood cell that coordinates immune responses) has resulted in autoimmune syndromes. We show here that the induced removal of this cytokine's receptor from these specialised blood cells results in an astonishingly mild outcome. Contrary to expectations, the number of regulatory T cells is actually increased, and we find that these cells are not dependent on TGF-β signalling. We also show that removal of the receptor from mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells does not lead to lethal autoinflammation; only when we removed the receptor during development of the cells did we see the characteristic lethal multi-organ inflammation reported previously in constitutive models of TGF-β receptor ablation. In summary, our findings indicate that although TGF-β regulates maintenance of mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, its signals are dispensable for immune tolerance within this cell population.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Transforming growth factor β (TGF-β1) is a cytokine that is expressed throughout the hematopoietic system. It was initially described to suppress T cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Kehrl1">[1]</xref>, but later found to also support differentiation of T cells into specialized subsets. Mice deficient in TGF-β1 show hyperactivation and uncontrolled expansion of T cells leading to a lethal multi-organ autoimmune disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Kulkarni1">[2]</xref>. Likewise, deficiency of either subunit of the heterodimeric TGF-β receptor (TR) is lethal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Oshima1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Larsson1">[4]</xref>. T-cell–specific expression of a dominant-negative receptor mutant (DN-TR2) under the CD4 promoter results in a lymphoproliferative disease with infiltrates to multiple organs and development of severe inflammatory bowel disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Gorelik1">[5]</xref>. Similar mice that express a DN-TR2 construct under human CD2 promoter presented with disease symptoms at the age of 3–4 mo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Lucas1">[6]</xref>. The lymphoproliferative disease in these mice is caused primarily by expansion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells that even progress to leukaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Lucas2">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Lucas3">[8]</xref>. Genetic ablation of TR2 in hematopoietic or, more specifically, in T cells leads to lymphadenopathy, splenomegaly, and inflammation of various organs followed by death at 3 wk of age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Leveen1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>. Thus, all these models of interrupted TR function suggest an essential, nonredundant role for TGF-β1 in the maintenance of T cell tolerance. The observed autoimmune syndrome was initially thought to be caused by the apparent loss of regulatory T (T<sub>reg</sub>) cells. Particularly thymic T<sub>reg</sub> development and survival seem to require TGF-β signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>. Yet neither reconstitution with WT T<sub>reg</sub> cells nor mixed bone marrow chimera experiments resulted in an amelioration of the autoimmune phenotype in these models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>. Notwithstanding that cell type and reason for T-cell–mediated autoimmunity in the absence of TGF-β signalling remain unclear, in all these models thymic development was found to be altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Liu1">[14]</xref>. A recent study shows that deletion of TR2 in mature T cells by dLck-Cre does not cause a fatal autoimmune syndrome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Zhang1">[15]</xref>. In this model, however, the role of TGF-β signalling in mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells could not be addressed, since dLck-Cre did not lead to deletion of TR2 in Foxp3<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Thus, our current, unbiased knowledge about the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of TGF-β for peripheral T, especially T<sub>reg</sub>, cells appears to be incomplete. To overcome this and analyze TGF-β function in T helper and T<sub>reg</sub> cells independent of developmental defects as well as systemic autoimmunity, we inducibly abrogated TGF-β signalling in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Surprisingly, loss of TR2 function in mature T cells, including T<sub>reg</sub> cells, did not lead to the spontaneous development of autoimmunity. Adoptive transfer of TR2-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells into lymphopenic hosts led only to colitis but not systemic disease. However, the induced TR2 deletion in thymocytes of lymphopenic mice resulted in a rapidly developing lethal auto-inflammatory disorder. When TR2 ablation was restricted to postthymic T cells, we observed that not only T<sub>em</sub> (CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD44<sup>hi</sup>) cells but also T<sub>reg</sub> cells exhibited hyperproliferation resulting from increased sensitivity to TCR signalling. TR2-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells retained their suppressive capacity both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. For mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the adult mouse, TGF-β seems therefore to solely be a regulator of T<sub>reg</sub> as well as T<sub>em</sub> cell expansion but is not required for the maintenance of tolerance.</p>

<title>Induced Ablation of TR2 From Peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells</title>
<p>Previous genetic studies of the function of TGF-β1 in T cells have either relied on germline gene deficiencies or involved cell-type–specific mutagenesis. Consequently, these models were biased by strong alterations in thymic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Doisne1">[13]</xref>. To specifically address the role of TGF-β signalling in mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we circumvented any developmental impact through the generation and use of a new tamoxifen-inducible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Seibler1">[16]</xref> CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup> knock-in strain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s001">Figure S1A,B</xref>). We first tested the tamoxifen-induced recombination of this strain with the help of two fluorescent reporter mouse strains (RAGE and ROSA-EYFP) and found efficient and specific recombination in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (unpublished data). As anticipated, recombination also took place in a small fraction of CD4<sup>+</sup> splenic dendritic cells (DCs) and innate lymphoid cells (unpublished data). Since removal of the neomycin resistance gene (Neo(R)) by FLP-mediated deletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Dymecki1">[17]</xref> reduced recombination efficiency without gain of specificity, a phenomenon observed before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-SchmidtSupprian1">[18]</xref>, we used animals bearing the Neo(R)-containing allele for all further experiments. To investigate the role of TGF-β signalling in peripheral T helper cells, we crossed the CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup> with a conditional TR2 allele (TR2<sup>f</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Leveen1">[9]</xref> obtaining CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup>/TR2<sup>f/f</sup> (hereafter called iCD4TR2) experimental mice as well as CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup>/TR2<sup>f/+</sup> and TR2<sup>f/f</sup> control mice. First, we tested ablation of TR2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells 14 d after commencing 5 d of tamoxifen treatment of iCD4TR2 mice (hereafter called tam-iCD4TR2 mice). mRNA levels within sorted naïve, central memory, effector memory/effector (T<sub>em</sub>) and regulatory (T<sub>reg</sub>) CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from tam-iCD4TR2 mice indicated a recombination frequency of 90%–95% in mature T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), placing it at similar efficiency as many constitutive Cre strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>. Equally high deletion efficiencies were observed in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from mesenteric LN (mLN) and the lamina propria (LP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Surface expression analysis of TR2 on blood and spleen CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells supported this observation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s002">Figure S2A</xref>, and unpublished data) and also showed that expression of TR2 by other cell types including CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). As expected, TGF-β–induced phosphorylation of Smad2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Feng1">[19]</xref> was virtually absent in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells from tam-iCD4TR2 mice 2 wk p.a. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). We thus conclude that target allele recombination in our inducible system is specific and efficient.</p>

<p>Because CD4-Cre-mediated TR2-ablation resulted in a strong thymic phenotype including reduction of single positive CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, abrogation of NK T cell development, and enhanced negative selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>, we investigated the extent and consequences of induced TR2 ablation in the thymus. Two weeks p.a. the surface expression of TR2 was reduced only slightly on CD4<sup>+</sup> thymocytes but not on any of the other major thymocyte compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Reduction of TR2 mRNA levels was found not only in CD4<sup>+</sup> but also in a small fraction of CD8<sup>+</sup> SP thymocytes only 2 wk p.a., indicating low-level and transient recombination at the DP stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Also, expression of CD4, CD8, CD5, CD24, CD62L, and CD69 were unchanged in the thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1F</xref> and unpublished data) as were number and phenotype of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Thus, our model allows the study of TGF-β signalling in mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells by pulse-chase experiments without significantly disturbing thymic T cell development.</p>

<title>Peripheral Abrogation of TR2 Signalling in CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells Does Not Lead to Autoimmunity</title>
<p>Constitutive ablation of TGF-β signalling during thymic development of αβT cells (CD4-Cre or Lck-Cre–mediated) but not during peripheral life (dLck-Cre–mediated) invariably results in a generalised and rapidly lethal autoimmune disorder <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Liu1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Zhang1">[15]</xref>. When we followed tam-iCD4TR2 mice after induction of receptor deletion, they appeared healthy and showed no weight loss 2 and 4 wk after 5 d of tamoxifen treatment and up to 3 mo after feeding with tamoxifen citrate for 2 mo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Because mild autoimmunity may not present clinically, we performed histopathological analysis of liver, kidney, pancreas, heart, colon, and thyroid gland but could not detect cellular infiltrates in any of these organs (unpublished data). We also tested for secondary dysregulation of B cell tolerance manifested by autoantibody production, as previously described upon thymic deletion of TR2 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>. Yet sera from tam-iCD4TR2 mice at 6 wk or even 5 mo p.a. did not contain significant levels of autoantibodies as shown by ELISA against dsDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Thus, removal of TR2 from mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells does not result in tolerance loss or autoimmunity. To exclude that recent thymic emigrants could dilute out cells lacking TR2, we thymectomized mice 1 wk before an 8-wk tamoxifen citrate treatment. Again, we failed to observe any signs of autoimmune disease by clinical appearance and weight loss up to 5 mo p.a. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) even though the frequency of TR2-deficient cells remained constant until the end of the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The absence of elevated serum antibody levels, autoantibodies, and organ infiltrates again excluded subclinical tolerance loss (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g002">Figure 2E,F</xref> and unpublished data). Furthermore, CD8<sup>low</sup> or CD4<sup>+</sup> NK1.1<sup>+</sup> T cells, proposed to carry autoreactive activity in the constitutive TR2-deficient models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>, were not detected 2 and 4 wk as well as 5 mo p.a. and after thymectomy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g002">Figure 2G</xref> and unpublished data). In conclusion, in contrast to models of constitutively impaired TGF-β signalling in T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Gorelik1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Lucas1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>, induced TR2 ablation from peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells does not result in the loss of self-tolerance.</p>

<title>Induced Ablation of TR2 During Thymic Development Combined with Lymphopenia Results in Lethal Autoimmunity</title>
<p>Abrogation of TGF-β signalling through CD4-Cre takes place during thymic development and affects all αβT cells including T<sub>reg</sub> cells. This thymic TR deletion results in lethal autoimmunity, in contrast to peripheral TR deletion through CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup>. To understand the underlying cause of the different outcomes of TR2 ablation in T cells, we assessed whether they were caused by deletion frequency, by ablation during thymic development, or by lymphopenia. To mimic the environment found in neonates with constitutive T-cell–specific TR2 ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>, we induced recombination during thymic development in a lymphopenic environment: We initiated treatment with tamoxifen of <italic>Rag-1</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mice 3 d before irradiation and reconstitution with bone marrow of iCD4TR2 or control mice (experimental scheme outlined in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Tamoxifen treatment led to deletion of TR2 in the thymus of mice reconstituted with iCD4TR2 bone marrow: both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells lacked TR2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The mice developed signs of sickness 28 d after bone marrow reconstitution (apathy, runted appearance, weight loss) and started dying after 30 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3B,C</xref>). Mice that received control bone marrow (CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup>/TR2<sup>f/+</sup>) did not shown any signs of disease (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Sick bone marrow chimeras presented with T cell infiltrates only in lung and liver tissue but not the colon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3D</xref> and unpublished data). The frequency of CD62L<sup>hi</sup>CD44<sup>−</sup> naïve T (T<sub>n</sub>) cells was severely reduced and of CD62L<sup>lo</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup> T<sub>em</sub> cells highly increased in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).

<p>The treatment of bone marrow chimeras with tamoxifen from the onset on led to deletion of TR2 also in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells, indicating efficient recombination already during the thymic DP stage. To exclude that these TR2-negative CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells were causing disease, we repeated the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3A–G</xref> with deletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Experimental chimeras treated with anti-CD8 antibody developed the lethal autoimmune syndrome only slightly later than those treated with isotype control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3J</xref>). Lungs and livers isolated from both groups of experimental chimeras presented with infiltrates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g003">Figure 3K</xref> and unpublished data). We found no difference in weight loss, survival, or tissue pathology between control mice treated with anti-CD8 antibody or isotype control. Also, TR2 deletion was equally efficient in both groups (unpublished data). Thus, CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells are the main effectors of disease upon TR2 ablation during thymic development in a lymphopenic situation.</p>
<p>Taken together, the fact that the TR2 deletion frequency in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells is similar in all these bone marrow chimerism experiments suggests that the cause of the autoimmune syndrome is either the absence of TR2 during thymic development or during repopulation of a lymphopenic environment, thus mimicking the observations made in constitutive models of TR2 deletion (i.e., CD4-Cre/TR2<sup>f/f</sup>).</p>

<title>Transfer of TR2-Deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cells Into Lymphopenic Hosts Does Not Lead to Multi-Organ Inflammation But to Colitis</title>
<p>To distinguish between altered thymic development and lymphopenia as cause of the autoinflammation, we assessed the influence that different lymphopenic conditions had on the behaviour of TR2-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. To achieve CD4<sup>+</sup> T-cell–restricted lymphopenia, we treated thymectomized animals with a low dose of anti-CD4 antibody. This treatment led to a ∼90% depletion of blood CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, and unpublished data) followed by acquisition of an activated phenotype by the remaining CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in both control and experimental mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). To obtain severe general lymphopenia we used sublethal irradiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g004">Figure 4C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). In this setting both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells acquired the activated phenotype (unpublished data). Even though in both acute lymphopenic conditions we observed pronounced lymphopenia-driven T cell expansion, none of the animals presented with signs of autoimmune disease by appearance, anti-dsDNA autoantibody titres, and histology until week 20 (unpublished data). Again, TR2 ablation was similarly efficient throughout these experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Only when we adoptively transferred TR2-deficient cells into a completely lymphopenic environment (RAG-1 deficiency), strong colitis developed within 30 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g004">Figure 4D,E</xref> and unpublished data), which was accompanied by a massive infiltration of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells to mesenteric lymph nodes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s004">Figure S4C</xref>). Interestingly, the mice presented with neither apathy nor runted appearance, and histology did not reveal any inflammation of lungs or livers, which is a characteristic feature in mice in which TGF-β signalling is abrogated in thymocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g004">Figure 4E</xref> and unpublished data). Thus, adoptive transfer-mediated colitis can be induced by TR2-deficient T cells even in the presence of T<sub>reg</sub> cells, but a general autoinflammatory syndrome is not observed. <italic>In vivo</italic> TR2 deletion in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells combined with acute lymphopenia, however, does not lead to loss of tolerance.</p>

<title>Dysregulated Effector CD4<sup>+</sup> T Cell Homeostasis in Absence of TGF-β Signalling</title>
<p>To better understand the role of TGF-β signalling in mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we analysed T effector homeostasis after TR2 removal in a longitudinal manner. We found slightly reduced CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell numbers in spleen and LNs 2 and 4 wk p.a. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and unpublished data) while the total number of CD8<sup>+</sup> and of central memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T (CD62l<sup>hi</sup>CD44<sup>+</sup>) cells remained unchanged (unpublished data). In addition, we observed a modest but significant expansion of T<sub>em</sub> cells. This phenotype was transient as cell numbers and the frequency of T<sub>em</sub> cells returned to normal 6 wk p.a. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and unpublished data).

(<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5C</xref> and unpublished data). To test whether the increase of T<sub>em</sub> cells was transient due to replacement by new TR2-expressing T cells, we thymectomized mice prior to TR2 ablation. In the absence of thymic emigration we observed that the elevated numbers of T<sub>em</sub> cells persisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

<p>To investigate whether the activation and proliferation of T<sub>em</sub> cells upon TR2 ablation was a cell-intrinsic property or driven in trans by cell extrinsic factors, we generated bone marrow chimeras by mixing WT CD45.1<sup>+</sup> and either iCD4TR2 CD45.2<sup>+</sup> or control TR2<sup>f/f</sup> CD45.2<sup>+</sup> bone marrow (scheme depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). In chimeras containing iCD4TR2 bone marrow, the frequency of mutant CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was increased significantly at 4 wk p.a. (unpublished data). Two weeks p.a. activation of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells and T<sub>em</sub> cell proliferation were restricted to cells lacking TR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). The TR2-deficient T<sub>n</sub> cell compartment was diminished while the mutant central memory compartment was unchanged (unpublished data). Analysis of control chimeras showed no differences between the CD45.1<sup>+</sup> and CD45.2<sup>+</sup> populations. These data thus suggest that TR2 regulates the homeostasis of mature T<sub>em</sub> and T<sub>n</sub> cells. While in models of constitutive TR2 ablation a large fraction of CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells developed into IFN-γ–producing Th1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>, we found only slightly increased IFN-γ production but no difference in T-bet levels after peripheral deletion of TR2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Production of Th2 cytokines was hardly detectable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g005">Figure 5G</xref>) and the expression of the chemokine receptors CCR4, CCR5, CCR6, and CCR7 was unchanged (unpublished data).</p>
<p>Thus, hyperactivation, increased proliferation of T<sub>em</sub> cells, and the reduction of the T<sub>n</sub> cell compartment are cell-intrinsic consequences of TR2 ablation. The postthymic abrogation of TGF-β signalling does not lead to spontaneous acquisition of a Th1 phenotype.</p>

<title>Increased TCR-Dependent Activation in Absence of TR2</title>
<p>Since the up-regulation of CD69 upon TR2 ablation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) supported the idea of a TCR-dependent effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Sancho1">[20]</xref> of TR2 signalling on proliferation rate of mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we hypothesized that TR2 alters either the sensitivity to TCR ligands or the signalling through homeostatic cytokine receptors. First we assessed whether the absence of TR2 would result in increased sensitivity to TCR triggering. We stimulated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells in the presence of titrated amounts of anti-CD3 antibody and found an increased response to TCR stimulation through suboptimal anti-CD3 concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), indicating an increased sensitivity to TCR stimulation after deletion of TR2. To exclude the possibility that this was the result of a larger fraction of experienced CD44<sup>hi</sup> cells within the pool of stimulated TR2-deficient cells, we activated naïve and effector memory cells separately. Again the TR2-deficient cells, naive and experienced, presented with higher sensitivity to TCR stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s005">Figure S5A</xref>).</p>

<p>Indo-1–based ratiometric analysis revealed a small but significant increase in steady-state cytoplasmic calcium concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Upon stimulation the calcium influx was accelerated, suggesting an increased sensitivity of TR2-deficient T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). We did not find, however, differences in phosphorylation of CD3ζ, SLP76, lck, ZAP70, or ERK upon TCR stimulation (unpublished data). While no differences in CD25 expression or IL-2 production were found (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), a slight increase of CD122 (IL-2Rβ) on CD4<sup>+</sup> tam-iCD4TR2 T cells was detected 2 wk p.a. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). This could potentially have led to altered sensitivities to IL-15 or IL-2. However, the hyperproliferation of TR2-deficient T cells stimulated by suboptimal TCR activation could not be corrected by blockade of the IL-2R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001674-g006">Figure 6E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s005">Figure S5B</xref>).

Furthermore, reactivity to IL-7 was unchanged in this <italic>in vitro</italic> assay (unpublished data). Thus, the hyperproliferative activity of TR2-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells appears to be the result of increased TCR sensitivity but not of cytokine-mediated signals. To rule out that increased survival of TR2-deficient cells was contributing to the observed expansion, we removed the receptor from splenic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and assessed survival. The result was an increased incidence of apoptosis by cells lacking TR2 as shown by Annexin V staining after 20 and 45 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s005">Figure S5C</xref>), thus excluding this possibility.</p>

Therefore, to investigate TCR hyperresponsiveness, splenocytes isolated from tam-iCD4TR2 and control mice 2 wk p.a. were CFSE-labelled and stimulated with different concentrations of anti-CD3 antibody. Increased proliferation of TR2-negative T<sub>reg</sub> cells was observed after 3 d of culture with suboptimal anti-CD3 concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001674.s006">Figure S6E</xref>). Similarly, sorted T<sub>reg</sub> cells showed hyperproliferation to anti-CD3–mediated stimulation when cultured alone or in presence of IL-2 (unpublished data). Taken together, TGF-β signalling suppresses overt T<sub>reg</sub> cell proliferation but does not seem to be required for maintenance of the T<sub>reg</sub> cell phenotype.</p>

<title>TR2 Expression by T<sub>reg</sub> Cells Is Not Required for Their Suppressive Capacity</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The pleiotropic nature of the TGF-β family members has made it extremely challenging to unravel their function <italic>in vivo</italic>. All models of constitutive ablation of TGF-β signalling in αβT cells during thymic development have invariably revealed autoimmune phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Gorelik1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Lucas1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Leveen1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li3">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Datto1">[35]</xref>. In most of these models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Liu1">[14]</xref> the T<sub>reg</sub> cell population collapsed, resulting in almost complete loss of T<sub>reg</sub>-mediated peripheral suppression. These observations led to the dogma that TGF-β1 is required for establishment and maintenance of T cell tolerance. Yet because gene ablation in all these systems took place prior to or during thymic development, it could not be excluded that the observed immune dysregulation was a consequence of T cell development in the absence of TGF-β signals. In fact, while Doisne and colleagues showed that NKT cells depend critically on TGF-β for their development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Doisne1">[13]</xref>, Ouyang and colleagues reported that even conventional T cell development is modified by TGF- β signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, to study the importance of TGF-β for peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T lymphocytes, we circumvented such thymus-related abnormalities through induced deletion of TR2 in mature T helper cells only by use of a novel CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup> system. It allowed induced recombination of the TR2 target allele within up to 95% of postthymic CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Recombination during thymic development remained small after short-term tamoxifen application, and we did not find a contribution of TR2-deficient CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells to the peripheral T cell pool in this setup. Even long-term treatment with tamoxifen resulted in recombination in only a small fraction of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Only in one experimental setup, when thymic development was initiated in the presence of tamoxifen, did we observe a higher recombination frequency in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells. Therefore, our CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup> system proved to be useful for the study of TR2 function in peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. The reason for the small recombination rate in DP thymocytes may lie in the fact that the cells reside only shortly at this stage. Also, during this stage expression of CreER<sup>t2</sup> is initiated and protein has to first accumulate. Therefore only a small number of DP cells is receptive and exposed to tamoxifen at the same time. Further, only a minor fraction of T cells is generated newly during the 5-d treatment setup and can thus contribute to the peripheral pool. Another factor influencing efficiency of Cre-mediated recombination is the accessibility of the target allele. Thus the extent of recombination in the thymus may depend on the target used as well as duration and route of tamoxifen application.</p>
<p>Taken together by using the tam-iCD4TR2 mouse for the analysis of TGF-β's role for CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we report (i) the absence of clinical or immunological manifestations of autoimmunity, even when removal of TR2 from CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells was maintained for months; (ii) the development of a lethal autoimmune syndrome only when TR2 ablation is induced during thymic development; (iii) an increase in T<sub>em</sub> and T<sub>reg</sub> proliferation as a result of increased TCR signal sensitivity in the absence of TR2; and (iv) that TGF-β signalling is not required for the maintenance of the suppressive capacity of mature T<sub>reg</sub> cells <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. We therefore propose that the widely held notion of TGF-β signalling being a major contributor to peripheral T cell tolerance and T<sub>reg</sub> cell maintenance results from observations of developmental aberrations due to the use of complete gene ablation during thymic development under lymphopenic conditions.</p>
<p>Since the autoimmune syndrome in the most drastic cases of TGF-β signal manipulation results in lethality at a very young age, we hypothesized that neonatal lymphopenia was a contributing factor. To distinguish between effects through mere lymphopenia and aberration in thymic development, we performed TR2 ablation in three different lymphopenic setups, but all of them failed to drive systemic autoinflammation. One condition, adoptive transfer of TR2-deficient T cells into a lymphopenic host, resulted solely in colitis, similar to a recently published study of dLck-Cre–driven TR2 ablation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Zhang1">[15]</xref>. We could show that the difference between development of colitis (CD4-CreER<sup>t2</sup>/TR2<sup>f/f</sup>, dLck-Cre/TR2<sup>f/f</sup>) and a lethal systemic autoimmune syndrome (our thymic deletion model, CD4-Cre/TR2<sup>f/f</sup>, Lck-Cre/TR1<sup>f/f</sup>) lies in whether TGF-β signalling is disrupted later than or at the DP thymic stage, respectively. By use of the acute lymphopenia models of sublethal irradiation and anti-CD4 depleting antibody treatment, we focused on systems which were shown to drive T cell proliferation by increased availability of IL-7, a setting which amplifies signals from weak TCR/self-pMHC contacts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Guimond1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Surh1">[37]</xref>. We again observed hyperproliferation and basically complete conversion to a (post)activated phenotype (unpublished data), yet neither organ-specific nor systemic autoimmunity developed. A difference in recombination frequencies could have been another cause of the difference in development of autoimmunity between the inducible and cell-type–specific systems, but we and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref> provided evidence to rule out this possibility. The decrease of T<sub>reg</sub> cell numbers or of their suppressive activity in the constitutive models are also an unlikely cause for development of autoimmunity since activated TR2-deficient T cells in these models were shown to be resistant to control by even WT T<sub>reg</sub> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie2">[27]</xref>. Taken together, minor differences in gene deletion efficiency as well as the presence/absence of T<sub>reg</sub> cells cannot account for the divergent autoimmune phenotypes of the constitutive and our inducible model. Also, impaired thymic negative selection was ruled out by a study that found actually a slight increase of negative selection in absence of TR2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>. Another possibility was that TR2 was not ablated in the T cell subset required for development of autoimmunity, but several studies indicated that both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells are responsible for the autoimmune phenotype in absence of TGF-β signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Kobayashi1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Letterio1">[39]</xref>. We excluded this possibility by depletion of CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells in the setup. This resulted also in lethal autoimmunity, albeit slightly delayed, and did not prevent weight loss and infiltration into the lung and liver. Further, a recent study showed that TR2-deficient CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells alone can induce autoimmune colitis under lymphopenic conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Zhang1">[15]</xref>, an observation that we confirmed in our model. One report placed the pathogenic activity of TR2-deficient T cells in unconventional NK T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>, but we show that NK1.1 expression is not a mandatory characteristic of such autoreactive T cells. Taken together, the only common denominator for development of severe lethal autoimmunity upon removal of TGF-β signalling in T cells is that recombination must occur in developing thymocytes in a severely lymphopenic animal. While a recent study reported that also the abrogation of TGF-β signalling in CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells leads to the development of autoimmune disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ramalingam1">[40]</xref>, this seems unlikely in our system since recombination in CD4<sup>+</sup> CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells was very rare.</p>
<p>When we used our model to analyze the role of TGF-β signalling for survival and homeostasis of peripheral CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, it revealed a modest increase in size of the T<sub>em</sub> and T<sub>reg</sub> compartments with both populations being activated (CD69<sup>+</sup>) and cycling (BrdU<sup>+</sup>). For T<sub>em</sub> cells such an effect has also been reported when TGF-β signalling was abrogated by CD4-Cre or through a CD4 promoter-driven dominant-negative TR2 transgene, but the extent was far stronger than in our model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Gorelik1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>. In all such models the hyperproliferation and activation in CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells was considerably larger than in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cell compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Gorelik1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>.</p>
<p>As reported before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Lucas3">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marie1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref> this hyperproliferation of TGF-β unresponsive T cells depends on specific peptide-MHC recognition. The introduction of a TCR transgene, whose antigen is not recognized in the periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Bettelli1">[41]</xref>, into our model resulted in amelioration of the proliferative phenotype (unpublished data). This is supported by data from dLck-Cre–mediated TR2 ablation, acting in late thymic development. In this model combination with OT-I TCR transgene showed increased TCR sensitivity when peptides of different affinities were used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Zhang1">[15]</xref>. Similarly, we also found increased sensitivity to TCR stimulation <italic>in vitro</italic> in the absence of TR2, which may be a result of increased steady-state intracytoplasmic calcium concentrations and faster calcium response. Taken together, in all models of abrogation of TGF-β signalling in T cells the threshold of productive TCR signalling is decreased.</p>
<p>Even though we and Zhang and Bevan showed that increased sensitivity of TCR signalling is a major factor in the increased proliferative phenotype of TR2-deficient T cells, also direct control of cell cycle by TGF-β signalling has been reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li4">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li5">[45]</xref>. Such cell-cycle control appears to be connected to the establishment of T cell tolerance (anergy) in the DO11.10 model, thus again highlighting the importance of TGF-β in maintaining T cell homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li5">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>As an additional cause of hyperproliferation and activation of TGF-β unresponsive T cells, dysregulated sensitivity to γc cytokines has been reported. The homeostasis especially of CD8<sup>+</sup> memory T cells was shown to be under IL-15 control, possibly due to higher expression of CD122 in comparison to CD4<sup>+</sup> memory T cells (for rev: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Surh1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Marrack1">[46]</xref>). In agreement with this, a CD2 promoter-driven dominant-negative TR2 transgene was found to present with a IL-15–dependent expansion of memory-like CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Lucas3">[8]</xref>. The T-bet–mediated up-regulation of CD122 in CD4-Cre TR2 model, however, was observed in both CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells and was considered to be central for maintenance and expansion of TGF-β–unresponsive memory T cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>. In our inducible model we found neither evidence of increased IL-2 production by activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells nor increased expression of CD25 (IL-2 Rα). We observed, however, a slight increase in CD122 expression (IL2Rβ chain) upon induced ablation of TR2 in CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Yet this did not lead to increased sensitivity to common gamma chain cytokines, making them an unlikely cause of the hyperproliferation seen in T<sub>em</sub> and T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Thus, the impairment of TGF-β signalling in peripheral T cells leads to hyperproliferation independent of cytokine signalling, while constitutive ablation during thymic development results in dysregulated γc cytokine production/signalling and massive autoimmunity.</p>
<p>We therefore conclude that TGF-β controls postthymic homeostasis of both naïve and memory CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. Yet the extent of hyperproliferation in induced TR2-deficient T cells is significantly lower than in constitutive TR2 mutants.</p>
<p>Previously, the almost complete absence of peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells in CD4-Cre/TR2<sup>f/f</sup> animals was taken as evidence for a prominent role of TGF-β in T<sub>reg</sub> cell maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>. In this model T<sub>reg</sub> cells and precursors also showed a hyperproliferative phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Li1">[11]</xref>, but in the periphery T<sub>reg</sub> cells died prematurely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ouyang1">[12]</xref>. Also, the drastic expansion of thymic T<sub>reg</sub> cells in TR1-deficient thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Liu1">[14]</xref> resulted in their failure to survive in the periphery. In contrast to these observations, upon peripheral TR2 ablation T<sub>reg</sub> cells show increased proliferation without associated collapse through massive apoptosis. This expansion of TR2-negative T<sub>reg</sub> cells in peripheral lymphoid organ in our model was restricted to Nrp-1<sup>+</sup> Foxp3<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells, most likely cells of thymic origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Weiss1">[23]</xref>. A specific increase of nT<sub>reg</sub> cells upon TR2 ablation is also supported by the increase in number of Helios<sup>+</sup> T<sub>reg</sub> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Thornton1">[47]</xref>. Conversely and similar to our observation, TGF-β1 gene ablation from activated peripheral T cells resulted in an expansion of T<sub>reg</sub> cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Gutcher1">[48]</xref>, possibly a consequence of decreased local TGF-β availability. Expansion of T<sub>reg</sub> cells could have been the result of IL-2 production by the increased number of activated T cells in tam-iCD4TR2 animals, but our data excluded this possibility. Also, only mutant T<sub>reg</sub> cells showed increased cycling in mixed bone marrow chimeras, thus ruling out any effects in trans. The up-regulation of CD69 by T<sub>reg</sub> cells and <italic>in vitro</italic> stimulation with suboptimal anti-CD3 concentrations suggest increased TCR sensitivity, similar to conventional T cells.</p>
<p>We are to our knowledge the first to study T<sub>reg</sub> cell physiology after induced peripheral abrogation of TGF-β signalling <italic>in vivo</italic>. Our finding of the TGF-β independence of the mature, postthymic T<sub>reg</sub> phenotype and function does agree with epigenetic imprinting taking place at the Foxp3 locus and also many other loci relevant for T<sub>reg</sub> cell physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Ohkura1">[49]</xref>. Upon induced TR2 ablation we observed neither reduction of Foxp3, CTLA-4, and GITR levels nor any decrease in the suppressive capacity of TR2-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells. Tone and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Tone1">[50]</xref> showed that TGF-β–induced Smad-mediated activation of the Foxp3 locus through interaction with a conserved Smad-NFAT response element (CNS1) in thymocytes is essential for nT<sub>reg</sub> cell generation. Once the T<sub>reg</sub> phenotype is established, expression of FoxP3 in nT<sub>reg</sub> cells is largely independent of the promoter region CNS1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Zheng1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Josefowicz1">[52]</xref>, which is supported by our observation of unchanged FoxP3 levels. Further, Miyao and colleagues recently showed that T<sub>reg</sub> cells represent a stable lineage, which robustly maintains its committed state once the Treg cell-specific demethylation region (TSDR) has been demethylated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Miyao1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>TGF-β receptor signalling is, however, required for the induction of Foxp3 among peripheral naïve CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells (iT<sub>regs</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Chen2">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Kretschmer1">[55]</xref>. In agreement with this, we found that in the lamina propria, where iT<sub>reg</sub> cells contribute substantially to the T<sub>reg</sub> pool, no T<sub>reg</sub> expansion can be observed upon induced TR2 ablation.</p>
<p>Finally, we could show that the proliferation of TR2-deficient effector cells can be inhibited by TR2-deficient T<sub>reg</sub> cells, a question that has been raised recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001674-Surh2">[56]</xref>. Thus, we propose that ablation of TGF-β signalling during thymic development leads to intrathymic hyperproliferation of T<sub>reg</sub> cells, which then cannot survive in the periphery. Conversely, when TR2 is removed from already established peripheral T<sub>reg</sub> cells, these cells keep their T<sub>reg</sub> cell characteristics and undergo increased proliferation.</p>
<p>Taken together, our study suggests that several misconceptions about TGF-β function for mature T cells are the result of gene ablation during T cell development. By restricting the genetic defect (TR2-deficiency) to mature CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, we show that TGF-β signalling is not essential for the suppression of autoimmunity. Furthermore, it is not obligatory for the maintenance of a functional T<sub>reg</sub> cell pool. Instead it is required for the homeostasis of T<sub>reg</sub> and T<sub>em</sub> cells by curbing TCR signalling and therefore overt proliferative activity. In contrast, ablation of TGF-β signalling during thymic development as well as during lymphopenia may predispose for development of autoimmunity. Thus, TGF-β1 remains a cytokine with critical function in the regulation of T cells, yet its role in peripheral tolerance has been overestimated.</p>
