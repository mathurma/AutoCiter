<title/>
<p>A global RNAi screening approach in Drosophila cells identifies a large group of transcription and splicing factors that modulate RAS/MAPK signaling by altering the expression of MAPK.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The small GTPase RAS is among the most prevalent oncogenes. The evolutionarily conserved RAF-MEK-MAPK module that lies downstream of RAS is one of the main conduits through which RAS transmits proliferative signals in normal and cancer cells. Genetic and biochemical studies conducted over the last two decades uncovered a small set of factors regulating RAS/MAPK signaling. Interestingly, most of these were found to control RAF activation, thus suggesting a central regulatory role for this event. Whether additional factors are required at this level or further downstream remains an open question. To obtain a comprehensive view of the elements functionally linked to the RAS/MAPK cascade, we used a quantitative assay in Drosophila S2 cells to conduct a genome-wide RNAi screen for factors impacting RAS-mediated MAPK activation. The screen led to the identification of 101 validated hits, including most of the previously known factors associated to this pathway. Epistasis experiments were then carried out on individual candidates to determine their position relative to core pathway components. While this revealed several new factors acting at different steps along the pathway—including a new protein complex modulating RAF activation—we found that most hits unexpectedly work downstream of MEK and specifically influence MAPK expression. These hits mainly consist of constitutive splicing factors and thereby suggest that splicing plays a specific role in establishing MAPK levels. We further characterized two representative members of this group and surprisingly found that they act by regulating mapk alternative splicing. This study provides an unprecedented assessment of the factors modulating RAS/MAPK signaling in Drosophila. In addition, it suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on classical signaling events, such as those controlling RAF activation, but also on the regulation of MAPK levels. Finally, it indicates that core splicing components can also specifically impact alternative splicing.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The RAS/MAPK pathway is a cornerstone of the cell proliferation signaling apparatus. It has a notable involvement in cancer as mutations in the components of  the pathway are associated with aberrant proliferation. Previous work has focused predominantly on post-translational regulation of RAS/MAPK signaling such that a large and intricate network of factors is now known to act on core pathway components. However, regulation at the pre-translational level has not been examined nearly as extensively and is comparatively poorly understood. In this study, we used an unbiased and global screening approach to survey the Drosophila genome—using Drosophila cultured cells—for novel regulators of this pathway. Surprisingly, a majority of our hits were associated to either transcription or mRNA splicing. We used a series of secondary screening assays to determine which part of the RAS/MAPK pathway these candidates target. We found that these factors were not equally distributed along the pathway, but rather converged predominantly on <italic>mapk</italic> mRNA expression and processing. Our findings raise the intriguing possibility that regulation of <italic>mapk</italic> transcript production is a key step for a diverse set of regulatory inputs, and may play an important part in RAS/MAPK signaling dynamics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The RAS/MAPK pathway consists of a core module of three kinases (RAF, MEK, and ERK/MAPK) that transmit signals downstream of the small GTPase RAS. Upstream factors such as receptor tyrosine kinases (RTKs), which respond to extracellular signals, lead to RAS activation by a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF). GTP-loaded RAS then triggers the sequential activation of RAF, MEK, and MAPK; active RAF phosphorylates and activates MEK, which in turn phosphorylates and activates MAPK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-McKay1">[1]</xref>. Unlike RAF and MEK, MAPK has a variety of cytoplasmic and nuclear substrates that include transcription factors such as c-Jun, c-Fos, p53, ELK1, c-Myc, c-Myb, STAT1/3, SRF, and SMAD1/2/3/4 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Turjanski1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Pulverer1">[4]</xref>. Phosphorylation of these targets, and others, by MAPK induces a wide range of cellular responses that include proliferation, differentiation, and survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Kolch1">[5]</xref>. Also, RAS/MAPK signaling's important role in oncogenesis and various developmental disorders has been recognized early on and abundantly studied <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Zebisch1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Schubbert1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Over the last two decades, genetic screens in metazoan models such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> have been instrumental in identifying a growing list of key regulators of the RAS/MAPK pathway such as <italic>sos</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Rogge1">[8]</xref>, <italic>csw</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Perkins1">[9]</xref>, <italic>ksr</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Therrien1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Sundaram1">[12]</xref>, <italic>Cbl</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Yoon1">[13]</xref>, <italic>dos</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Raabe1">[14]</xref>, <italic>mts</italic>/<italic>PP2A</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Wassarman1">[15]</xref>, <italic>sur-8</italic>/<italic>soc-2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Selfors1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Sieburth1">[17]</xref>, <italic>cnk</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Therrien2">[18]</xref>, <italic>spry</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Hacohen1">[19]</xref>, <italic>sur-6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Sieburth2">[20]</xref>, <italic>PTP-ER</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Karim1">[21]</xref>, <italic>let-7</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Johnson1">[22]</xref>, <italic>alph</italic>/<italic>PP2C</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Baril1">[23]</xref>, and <italic>hyp</italic>/<italic>ave</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Roignant1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Douziech1">[25]</xref>. Thus, these studies and research conducted in other systems have revealed a large network of factors whose regulatory activity converges on the core MAPK module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-McKay1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Kolch1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Zebisch1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Malumbres1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Udell1">[27]</xref>. This regulatory network includes complex features such as feedback loops <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Dougherty1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Gomez1">[30]</xref>, compartmentalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-McKay1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Ebisuya1">[31]</xref>, crosstalk with other signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Hurlbut1">[32]</xref>, allosteric modulation via dimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Udell1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Rajakulendran1">[33]</xref>, and the formation of larger order complexes called nanoclusters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Harding1">[34]</xref>. While the function of the core module is well characterized, many aspects of the network that surround it are still poorly understood, including its protein composition. Also, many of the identified regulators influence RAS-mediated RAF activation, which is in agreement with the fact that this particular step is subjected to a tight and complex regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Udell1">[27]</xref>. In comparison, fewer positively acting components have been found to act downstream of RAF, suggesting that MEK and MAPK activation depends on more simple regulatory mechanisms. Alternatively, such modulators might have eluded detection. Finally, most of the regulatory input that has been described so far acts at the post-translational level. Comparatively little is known on how RAS/MAPK component expression is controlled.</p>
<p>The success of the aforementioned genetic screens typically relied on the qualitative modification of a visible phenotype. This consideration, together with the technical limitations associated with genetic screening procedures, usually limit results to a handful of confirmed hits. RNA interference (RNAi) used as a functional genomics tool provides the possibility of a more comprehensive type of analysis providing a systematic means to functionally annotate the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-MatheyPrevot1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Boutros1">[36]</xref>. Moreover, the possibility of using quantitative assays, in particular, allows for the identification of a much wider range of regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Friedman1">[37]</xref>. However, the considerable number of candidates often identified by this methodology has made the perspective of rapid functional annotation a daunting task.</p>
<p>Here, we present the results of a genome-wide RNAi screen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells that specifically focused on signal regulation between RAS and MAPK. Validated hits were submitted to a series of secondary assays aimed at positioning their regulatory input with respect to the three core kinases. In addition to identifying and correctly positioning most of the components previously known to mediate RAS-induced MAPK activation, the screen led to the discovery of several new factors that act at different steps along the pathway. Notably, we identified five novel components that act upstream of RAF. The homologs of these five proteins are part of a complex named striatin-interacting phosphatase and kinase complex (STRIPAK) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Goudreault1">[38]</xref> that also includes PP2A, which is known to regulate RAF activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Abraham1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Jaumot1">[40]</xref>. Unexpectedly, the majority of our candidates did not map to the interval between RAS and RAF, but were instead positioned further downstream. These included some transcription factors that we found regulate the transcript abundance of <italic>mek</italic>, <italic>mapk</italic>, or of the MAPK phosphatase <italic>PTP-ER</italic>. However, most of the novel factors were associated with mRNA processing and were found to act downstream of MEK and to regulate <italic>mapk</italic> splicing. Among these were components of the exon junction complex (EJC), which we and others have previously reported to be involved in regulating the splicing of the <italic>mapk</italic> pre-mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-AshtonBeaucage1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Roignant2">[42]</xref>. In particular, depletion of the EJC was found to alter the splicing of <italic>mapk</italic>'s long introns and cause a reduction in the amount of functional protein product. In this study, we focus on the function of a larger group of canonical splicing factors that also regulate <italic>mapk</italic> splicing. We show that the impact of these factors on alternative splicing (AS) of <italic>mapk</italic> differs from what we previously described for the EJC, indicating that two different types of regulatory input act on this step in <italic>mapk</italic> expression.</p>
<p>Thus, in addition to providing a comprehensive view of regulatory factors influencing signal transmission between RAS and MAPK, this work suggests that pathway output does not solely rely on post translational regulatory events, such as those controlling RAF activation, but is also tightly governed by the regulation of the expression of core components. In particular, the expression of MAPK emerges as a focal point for multiple different regulatory inputs.</p>

<title>Identification of New RAS/MAPK Pathway Regulators</title>
<p>To systematically search for and categorize new factors that specifically modulate signaling between RAS and MAPK, we employed a screening strategy that involved three distinct steps: (1) a primary genome-wide RNAi screen, (2) a validation screening step aimed at eliminating false positives, and (3) validated candidates were submitted to a series of a secondary screens to establish the position of their regulatory input relative to known pathway components (epistasis) and assess their specificity to RAS/MAPK signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
<p>We employed an automated immunofluorescence-based microscopy assay that quantitatively detected variations of dually phosphorylated MAPK (pMAPK) in Drosophila S2 cells. This assay was used to screen a genome-wide long double-stranded RNA (dsRNA) library for modulation of pMAPK levels induced by RAS<sup>V12</sup> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s001">Figure S1B and S1C</xref>). The results from this primary screen and all subsequent screens are made available online at the IRIC RNAi database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinfo.iric.ca/iricrnai" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bioinfo.iric.ca/iricrnai</ext-link>). 309 hit genes, which reproducibly altered pMAPK signal, were identified in the primary screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s012">Table S1</xref>). Importantly, core RAS/MAPK pathway components (e.g., <italic>raf/phl</italic>, <italic>mek/Dsor1</italic>, <italic>mapk/rl</italic>, <italic>cnk</italic>, and <italic>ksr</italic>) were amongst the strongest hits that decreased the pMAPK signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g001">Figure 1A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s012">Table S1</xref>). Other known positively acting genes were also identified, such as <italic>14-3-3ζ</italic> and the RAF chaperone <italic>Cdc37</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Grammatikakis1">[43]</xref>. Another expected hit was <italic>βggt-I</italic>, which encodes a factor involved in RAS prenylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Therrien1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Kato1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Karim2">[45]</xref>.

<p>We next conducted two successive validation steps to address readily identifiable sources of false positives, namely effects on the <italic>pMet-RAS<sup>V12</sup></italic> expression system and dsRNA off-target effects. 101 genes of the initial 309 primary hits passed both validation criteria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s002">Figure S2</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s012">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s020">Text S1</xref>). Validated genes were then assigned to broad functional categories on the basis of their associated gene ontology (GO) terms and on the functions of predicted homologs. Interestingly, transcription and mRNA processing factors composed, together, roughly half of our candidates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and mRNA processing was the most highly enriched GO term of our hit set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s013">Table S2</xref>). Despite the fact that mRNA splicing factors are often enriched in RNAi screen hit lists <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Ramadan1">[46]</xref>, we chose not to apply a selection bias against any group of genes at this stage. Therefore, all of the candidate genes passing both primary and validation screen criteria were evaluated in secondary screens without distinction.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Secondary Screens: Epistasis</title>
<p>To further characterize the 101 candidate genes, we conducted a series of secondary screens that can be subdivided into three groups: (1) MAPK activation induced by stimuli upstream of RAS, (2) epistasis screens involving MAPK activation at the level of or downstream of RAS, and (3) JNK activation screens aimed at addressing specificity to the MAPK pathway context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s003">Figure S3</xref>; detailed results in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s014">Tables S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s015">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">S5</xref>).</p>
<p>Four distinct MAPK activation assays using RTKs or <italic>GAP</italic> RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s003">Figure S3</xref>) were conducted to assess the degree to which pathway activity could be perturbed by depletion of the candidate genes in different activation contexts occurring upstream of RAS. Although a few exceptions were found, in most cases, we observed signal modulation that was generally consistent with our RAS<sup>V12</sup> results.</p>
<p>Next, epistasis experiments were carried out using S2 cell lines expressing either constitutively activated forms of RAF or MEK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s003">S3</xref>). The aim of these experiments was to position the identified genes in relation to the core kinases of the pathway by comparing the values from the RAS, RAF, and MEK activation assays. To do this, we calculated the correlation of our screening data with theoretical profiles of hypothetical components acting within three possible epistasis intervals (RAS-RAF, RAF-MEK, and MEK-MAPK) using an uncentered Pearson's correlation metric (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g002">Figure 2C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s014">Table S3</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s020">Text S1</xref>). All known pathway components were positioned correctly by this approach. For example, <italic>Ras85D</italic>, <italic>ksr</italic>, <italic>cnk</italic>, <italic>hyp/ave</italic>, <italic>14-3-3ζ</italic>, <italic>14-3-3ε</italic>, and <italic>βggt-I</italic> are part of a group of genes that suppressed RAS<sup>V12</sup>, but not activated RAF or activated MEK; these components were thus correctly positioned in the RAS-RAF interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g002">Figure 2B and 2C</xref>). Nine additional genes also fell into this category (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s014">Table S3</xref>) and therefore represent potentially novel pathway regulators acting at this level. Strikingly, while only eight hits (including the RAF chaperone Cdc37) mapped between RAF and MEK, most of the candidates (69) were assigned to the MEK-MAPK interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s014">Table S3</xref>), with the majority of these being factors not previously linked to RAS/MAPK signaling. This unexpected finding suggests that additional regulatory events that escaped prior detection are lying downstream of MEK.</p>

One of these was the ALPH PP2C phosphatase, whose depletion increased both pMAPK and pJNK signals.

<title>Regulation of RAS/MAPK Pathway Gene Expression and Specificity</title>
<p>Given that several of our candidate genes are linked to RNA processing and transcription, we hypothesized that these factors might be acting on the expression of one or multiple RAS/MAPK pathway components. We first investigated the impact of our candidates on the expression of core RAS/MAPK pathway component transcripts (<italic>Ras85D</italic>, <italic>raf</italic>, <italic>mek</italic>, <italic>mapk</italic>, <italic>ksr</italic>, <italic>cnk</italic>, and <italic>PTP-ER</italic>) by quantitative PCR (qPCR) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s004">Figure S4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Tables S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s017">S8</xref>).

<title>Screen candidates modify the expression of RAS/MAPK components.</title>
<p>(A) The transcript levels of RAS/MAPK components are altered by the depletion of some candidates. All candidates were tested in an initial qPCR secondary screen; the results shown here are from a separate qPCR confirmation experiment (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s020">Text S1</xref>). The left panel shows transcript levels for the RAS/MAPK components listed on the top following treatment with the indicated dsRNAs (labels to the left). mRNA levels are expressed as log<sub>2</sub> ratios of <italic>GFP</italic> dsRNA treated controls. The right panel shows the associated <italic>p</italic>-values (unpaired two-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic>-test). dsRNA targeting <italic>gfzf</italic> had a similar effect to the <italic>mek</italic> dsRNA with a −2.86 reduction in <italic>mek</italic> transcript levels (<italic>p</italic>-value, 4.2×10<sup>−8</sup>). <italic>CG4936</italic> dsRNA caused a −1.37 reduction in <italic>PTP-ER</italic> transcript levels (<italic>p</italic>-value, 1.2×10<sup>−8</sup>), which was slightly weaker than the −1.88 reduction (<italic>p</italic>-value, 3.0×10<sup>−9</sup>) measured for the <italic>PTP-ER</italic> dsRNA. <italic>Cdk12</italic>, <italic>Fip1</italic>, and <italic>CG1603</italic> dsRNAs behaved similarly to <italic>eIF4AIII</italic> dsRNA, used as a control for <italic>mapk</italic> transcript depletion, with <italic>mapk</italic> transcript levels &lt;−0.75 and a <italic>p</italic>-value&lt;1×10<sup>−4</sup>. (B) <italic>In vivo</italic> RNAi experiments confirm cell culture qPCR results. Hairpin RNAi constructs were expressed in larvae under the control of a heat shock-inducible flip-out actin promoter. qPCR experiments were performed on L3 eye disc lysates. mRNA levels are expressed as log<sub>2</sub> ratios of a no RNAi control (flies carrying the flip-out promoter without a RNAi construct). Results were similar to those in cell culture qPCR experiments in (A): <italic>CG1603</italic> RNAi caused a reduction in <italic>mapk</italic> levels (−2.06; <italic>p</italic>-value, 5.3×10<sup>−4</sup>), <italic>gfzf</italic> RNAi reduced <italic>mek</italic> levels (−1.66; <italic>p</italic>-value, 5.4×10<sup>−4</sup>), and <italic>CG4936</italic> reduced <italic>PTP-ER</italic> levels (−1.06; <italic>p</italic>-value, 5.7×10<sup>−4</sup>).

<p>Surprisingly, aside from the candidates mentioned above, most hits did not appear to cause a significant change in the transcript levels of pathway components. We had previously observed that qPCR assays targeting <italic>mapk</italic> are not always strongly affected by the splicing changes induced by EJC depletion. On the other hand, a reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR) assay spanning the whole <italic>mapk</italic> transcript is a more sensitive tool allowing for detection of small splicing changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-AshtonBeaucage1">[41]</xref>. Based on this premise, and on the fact that almost all the splicing factors we identified mapped downstream of MEK, we decided to systematically examine the impact of these factors on <italic>mapk</italic> splicing. Consequently, we used the RT-PCR assay that had been used with the EJC to examine <italic>mapk</italic> splicing. Interestingly, not only did this experiment reveal that nearly all the splicing factors in our set caused shifts in the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profile, but these RT-PCR profiles were also clearly different from those produced by EJC depletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, while the impact of most of our candidates on <italic>mapk</italic> expression may not be apparent when measuring total transcript abundance, a clear impact on the different <italic>mapk</italic> isoforms can be observed by RT-PCR, indicating that these factors regulate AS of <italic>mapk</italic>.</p>
<p>In the case of the EJC, the splicing changes were accompanied by a corresponding decrease in MAPK protein levels. Because of this decrease, we decided to also measure the impact of our candidates on MAPK protein levels using quantitative immunofluorescence. This analysis confirmed that most of the factors positioned downstream of MEK (including most of the RNA processing factors) also caused a reduction of MAPK protein levels. Conversely, AKT protein levels, which were used as a control, were not generally sensitive to depletion of these same factors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We also verified the impact on MAPK and two other pathway components (RAS and CNK) by Western blot. Most candidates that caused a reduction in MAPK levels did not impact the levels of RAS, CNK, or AKT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s006">Figure S6</xref>), which mirrored the results from the immunofluorescence experiment. Thus, both evaluations of MAPK protein levels agreed with the RT-PCR experiments suggesting that the changes in splicing results in a reduction of MAPK protein abundance.</p>

<title>Splicing factors cause a decrease in MAPK protein levels.</title>
<p>(A) Candidates were tested in an immunofluorescence-based secondary screen to evaluate their impact on MAPK protein levels. The results from this experiment show that RNA processing factors (red) cause a reduction in MAPK levels without impacting AKT (used as a negative control). This impact is similar to that which was observed for EJC components (blue). <italic>mapk</italic> and <italic>Akt</italic> dsRNA positive controls are also shown (green). (B) The specific effect on MAPK levels is confirmed by Western blot for both <italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> dsRNA treated samples. The impact on MAPK is similar, albeit slightly weaker, to that observed following <italic>eIF4AIII</italic> depletion. The levels of other MAPK pathway components (RAS, RAF, and MEK) as well as other signaling pathway components (AKT and JNK) did not appear to vary significantly following depletion of these factors.</p>

<p>Most of the other hits, including those positioned at the RAS-RAF and RAF-MEK intervals, did not appear to cause a change in the expression of RAS/MAPK pathway components. However, we observed that a minority of candidates seemed to cause fluctuations in multiple proteins or transcripts. Likewise, these candidates also tended to impact some or all of the non-RAS/MAPK related assays we tested them in (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>). Moreover, these hits were also more frequently present in hit lists of other published RNAi screens (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s015">Table S4</xref>). Consequently, in order to discriminate such non-specific hits from higher quality candidates, we derived a scoring system that factored in results from the pJNK assays, pMet-green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression, hit occurrence in previously published RNAi screens, and the impact on measured protein and transcript levels (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s015">Table S4</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s020">Text S1</xref>). As expected, a few of the splicing factors in our list had low specificity scores. On the other hand, most of the factors that selectively affected MAPK levels, including the majority of the splicing factors, were not present in previous screen hit lists more frequently than <italic>bona fide</italic> RAS/MAPK factors and generally displayed a good specificity to the RAS/MAPK context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s015">Tables S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">S5</xref>). This finding suggests that discriminating against an entire category of genes on the basis of the enrichment of that category in previous screen hit sets is a strategy that can lead to elimination of meaningful candidates.</p>

<title>RAS-RAF Candidates: The Usual Suspects and STRIPAK</title>
<p>Most of the positive regulators positioned in the RAS-RAF interval were factors that had previously been linked either to RAS prenylation or regulation of RAF activation. As previously mentioned, one of the RAS prenylation factors we identified was <italic>βggt-I</italic>, which was originally identified in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Therrien1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Karim2">[45]</xref>. In addition to <italic>βggt-I</italic>, two other factors that are known to function in RAS prenylation in other organisms were also identified: <italic>Hmgcr</italic> and <italic>Fnta</italic> (CG2976). FNTA is the alpha farnesyltransferase subunit for mammalian RAS proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Reiss1">[48]</xref>.

In our Western blot experiments, all three of these factors were observed to cause a mobility shift in RAS suggesting that RAS geranylgeranylation is impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Lerner1">[51]</xref>, and thus that these factors act on RAS in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s006">Figure S6A, S6C, and S6J</xref>).</p>
<p>RAF activation is arguably the most tightly regulated step of the MAPK module <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-McKay1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Udell1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Wellbrock1">[52]</xref>. Multiple components are involved in a series of events that link up RAF to RAS, anchor RAF at the plasma membrane, allow RAF to adopt and maintain an active conformation and finally enable efficient substrate targeting <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Wellbrock1">[52]</xref>. Phosphorylation and dephosphorylation events control progression throughout these steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Wellbrock1">[52]</xref>. Of these, the removal of the phosphate moiety on the S346 residue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> RAF (equivalent to S259 of human RAF1) is one of the pivotal regulatory events as it is thought to trigger the release of 14-3-3, which otherwise sequesters RAF in the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Wellbrock1">[52]</xref>. Of the factors involved in RAF activation, all of the expected factors (<italic>ksr</italic>, <italic>cnk</italic>, <italic>hyp</italic>, <italic>14-3-3ε</italic>, and <italic>14-3-3ζ</italic>) were correctly positioned at the RAS-RAF interval (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Two other candidates, <italic>Pp1-87B</italic> and <italic>Sur-8</italic>, also clustered together with the set of known factors acting in the RAS-RAF interval. These two factors had not previously been shown to act on MAPK signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but evidence from other organisms indicates that they might act at this level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Selfors1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Sieburth1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Jaumot1">[40]</xref>, which is consistent with our results. Of particular interest, one study has found a mammalian complex composed of PP1, SUR-8, and MRAS and linked it to dephosphorylation of the S259 residue on C-RAF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-RodriguezViciana1">[53]</xref>.</p>
<p>The only other positive regulators in the RAS-RAF epitasis group that were not previously linked to RAS/MAPK signaling were five components that form the smallest of two complexes in our network (CKA, STRIP, SLMAP, FGOP2, and MOB4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Three of these components are distantly related to budding yeast alpha factor arrest (FAR) complex components, which are involved in signaling G1 arrest upon alpha factor stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Kemp1">[54]</xref>. More recently, a protein complex comprising Striatin, the catalytic subunit of PP2A, the STE20 family kinase STK24, and four additional core proteins was identified in human cells and named the STRIPAK complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Goudreault1">[38]</xref>. The core of this complex was suggested to serve as a protein platform that specifies PP2A and/or STK24 action. Remarkably, the five RAS-RAF proteins identified are homologs of the non-catalytic members that make up the core STRIPAK complex. CKA, which is the fly Striatin homolog, has previously been demonstrated genetically to act as a positive regulator of JNK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Chen1">[55]</xref>. MOB4 has also been previously studied genetically in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, where it appears to participate in mitotic spindle assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Trammell1">[56]</xref>. The three other members, STRIP, FGOP2, and SLMAP, have not been extensively studied in flies and are named on the basis of their mammalian counterparts.</p>
<p>Consistent with their ability to work together as a complex, the five STRIPAK homologs had similar effects in all the secondary screens and epitope-tagged variants co-immunoprecipitated in binary co-expression experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s007">S7</xref>). Notably, their depletion also suppressed JNK activation induced by RAC1<sup>V12</sup>, suggesting that CKA/Striatin modulates signaling through this pathway and that the other STRIPAK members act in conjunction with Striatin in this context. This is also consistent with the findings that TRAF3-interacting JNK-activating modulator (T3JAM), one of the SLMAP homologs, is linked to JNK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Dadgostar1">[57]</xref> and with a recent report that identified <italic>Cka</italic> as a suppressor of JNK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Bond1">[58]</xref>. Furthermore, depletion of STRIPAK components reduced pMAPK signal induced by insulin, activated Sevenless RTK (SEV<sup>S11</sup>) and GAP RNAi, but only marginally affected EGFR signaling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s005">Figure S5</xref>).

Fly eyes of the indicated genotypes were imaged by stereomicroscopy.

All fly eye images are from female flies except <italic>CG4936<sup>DG10305</sup></italic>/<italic>CG4936<sup>EY10172</sup></italic>, which is from a male fly; the rough eye phenotype was observed to be similar in males and females except in this case where males displayed a stronger genetic interaction.

<p>In addition to PP2A/<italic>mts</italic>, we noted that some of the other STRIPAK components described in Goudreault and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Goudreault1">[38]</xref> were not identified in our primary screen. However, one of these, <italic>GckIII</italic>, was one of the validated regulator in the InR-driven MAPK screen reported by Adam Friedman and Norbert Perrimon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Friedman2">[62]</xref>. This raised the possibility that <italic>GckIII</italic> might have an impact on pathway activity in alternate activation contexts. To address this, we examined the effects of depleting <italic>GckIII</italic> in RAS<sup>V12</sup>, insulin, and <italic>GAP</italic> RNAi assays. We found that while this had little impact on RAS<sup>V12</sup>-induced MAPK activation, <italic>GckIII</italic> depletion had an effect comparable to <italic>Fgop2</italic> depletion in the insulin and <italic>GAP</italic> RNAi contexts (unpublished data). This indicates that <italic>GckIII</italic> may function upstream or in parallel to RAS and raises the intriguing possibility that the STRIPAK complex regulates multiple aspects of the larger RTK/RAS/MAPK pathway.</p>
<p>Since Striatins are defined as PP2A regulatory (B) subunits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Moreno1">[63]</xref> and STRIPAK was initially described as a PP2A associated complex, it is possible that STRIPAK assumes this role in the context of RAF activation. We observed a modulation of RAS<sup>V12</sup> signaling upon depletion of the catalytic subunit of PP2A (<italic>mts</italic>), but not of the regulatory B subunit, <italic>tws</italic>, which support the notion that STRIPAK components are functioning as PP2A regulatory (B) subunits in this context (unpublished data). A similar function for STRIPAK has recently been described in the context of Hippo signaling, where it was found to associate with PP2A and HPO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Ribeiro1">[64]</xref>. Finally, in agreement with our findings, another recent report has linked the CKA subunit to RAS/MAPK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Horn1">[65]</xref> and another study conducted in <italic>Neurospora</italic> has indicated that MAPK regulates STRIPAK function, suggesting the possibility of regulatory feedback phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Dettmann1">[66]</xref>.</p>

<title>RAF-MEK Candidates: gfzf</title>
<p>Only 13 of our candidates were found to act downstream of RAF and upstream of MEK. Of these, the RAF chaperone <italic>Cdc37</italic> was the only <italic>bona fide</italic> pathway regulator. Among the others, <italic>CG8878</italic> was of interest as it is the homolog of the mammalian Vaccinia-Related Kinase (VRK) genes of which two (VRK1 and VRK3) have been recently identified in a recent screen for KRAS synthetic-lethal factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Barbie1">[67]</xref>. Also, another study has shown that VRK2 interacts with MEK and KSR1, potentially acting on MEK activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Fernandez1">[68]</xref>. However, in this context, VRK2 acts as a negative regulator whereas <italic>CG8878</italic> appears to act positively on RAS signaling in our experiments.</p>
<p>The most interesting candidate that fell within the RAF-MEK interval was GST-containing FLYWCH zinc-finger protein (<italic>gfzf</italic>). GFZF was initially found because of the property of its GST domain to bind to glutathione sepharose beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Dai1">[69]</xref>. It does not, however, have any clearly identified function assigned to it, though there are indications that it may act as a co-factor for the E2F transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Ambrus1">[70]</xref>. Also, recent RNAi screens have suggested that <italic>gfzf</italic> may be acting downstream of PDGF to control cell size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Sims1">[71]</xref> and as a factor functioning in the G2/M DNA damage checkpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Kondo1">[72]</xref>. In our qPCR experiments, <italic>gfzf</italic> clearly stood out from other candidates as it was the only factor that caused a strong reduction in <italic>mek</italic> transcript levels and had the closest profile to the <italic>mek</italic> RNAi itself (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g004">Figures 4A, 4B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s004">S4A</xref>). This observation also extended to the protein product as we observed a clear reduction in MEK levels upon <italic>gfzf</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In flies, two different <italic>gfzf</italic> loss of function alleles suppressed the <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> rough eye phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g006">Figures 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">S8A</xref>). <italic>gfzf<sup>cz811</sup></italic>also increased the severity of wing vein deletions in hemizygous <italic>csw<sup>lf</sup></italic> males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8D and S8K</xref>). Finally, knocking down <italic>gfzf</italic> reduced RAS<sup>V12</sup>-induced hemocyte proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Together, these observations suggest <italic>gfzf</italic> is regulating <italic>mek</italic>, possibly by acting as a positive transcription factor. Since FLYWCH domain proteins have been found to negatively control miRNA expression in <italic>C. elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Ow1">[73]</xref>, one interesting alternative is that <italic>gfzf</italic> represses the production of a miRNA that targets the <italic>mek</italic> transcript.</p>

<p>Another candidate, <italic>CG9797</italic>, was clustered close to <italic>gfzf</italic> through the functional screen data and the qPCR results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s004">S4A</xref>), and its protein product is predicted to interact with GFZF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).

From this, and since <italic>CG9797</italic> encodes another zinc finger protein, it is possible that this factor works in conjunction with GFZF as a transcriptional regulator. Recently, the chromatin remodeling factors <italic>Geminin</italic> and <italic>Brahma</italic> have been found to modulate MEK protein expression in drosophila wing discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Herr1">[74]</xref>, raising the possibility that <italic>gfzf</italic> might be acting in conjunction with these factors.</p>

<title>MEK-MAPK Candidates: Multiple Inputs Converge on mapk Splicing</title>
<p>mRNA processing and transcription factors formed the largest group of hits in our study and also the largest complex in our network analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g003">Figures 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s001">S1B</xref>), and almost all these factors mapped to the MEK-MAPK epistasis interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>). While the majority of the candidates in this category cause changes in <italic>mapk</italic> expression, one clear exception was <italic>CG4936</italic>. This gene encodes a zinc finger protein of unknown function that is distantly related to human ZBTB20, a BCL-6 like transcription factor that is expressed in hematopoietic tissues and lymphoid neoplasms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Zhang1">[75]</xref>. <italic>CG4936</italic> also mapped downstream of MEK, but was not found to influence <italic>mapk</italic> expression. A first clue as to the function of this factor was provided by the observation that <italic>CG4936</italic> behaved very similarly to <italic>PTP-ER</italic> in our functional screens; of all the candidates, it has the closest profile to <italic>PTP-ER</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). One of the two MEK<sup>EE</sup>-based MAPK activation assays involved the use of <italic>PTP-ER</italic> RNAi to increase the pMAPK signal. Surprisingly, while both <italic>PTP-ER</italic> and <italic>CG4936</italic> RNAi significantly increase MEK<sup>EE</sup>-induced pMAPK levels, combining <italic>CG4936</italic> and <italic>PTP-ER</italic> RNAi did not have an additive effect on pMAPK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g002">Figure 2B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>). This finding suggests that these factors work together in the same regulatory pathway. <italic>CG4936</italic> also clustered close to PTP-ER in our qPCR screen (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). Consistent with this, both qPCR and protein analysis revealed that <italic>CG4936</italic> knockdown respectively caused a specific reduction in <italic>PTP-ER</italic> transcript and protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g004">Figure 4A, 4B, and 4D</xref>). Furthermore, in our genetic interaction experiments, flies trans-heterozygous for two P-element insertion alleles of <italic>CG4936 (CG4936<sup>EY10172</sup></italic>/<italic>CG4936<sup>DG10305</sup></italic>) showed an enhancement of the <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> rough eye phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g006">Figure 6G</xref>) and suppressed lethality and phenotypes caused by a homozygous <italic>mapk</italic>/<italic>rl<sup>1</sup></italic> hypomorphic allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8C, S8G, and S8H</xref>). <italic>CG4936<sup>EY10172</sup></italic> alone suppressed the lethality and wing vein deletions of <italic>csw<sup>lf</sup></italic> hemizygous males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8I and S8K</xref>), as did the double <italic>CG4936</italic> mutant (unpublished data). Moreover, <italic>csw<sup>lf</sup></italic> homozygous females were observed in a background heterozygous for <italic>CG4936<sup>EY10172</sup></italic>, which is indicative of suppression as <italic>csw<sup>lf</sup></italic> is recessive lethal. Altogether, these data suggest that <italic>CG4936</italic> acts on <italic>PTP-ER</italic> transcription and that this action has bearing on RAS/MAPK dependent developmental processes.</p>
<p>Excepting <italic>CG4936</italic>, most of the other candidates positioned downstream of MEK (39) caused a decrease in MAPK protein levels (&lt;−0.25 log<sub>2</sub>-fold and <italic>p</italic>&lt;1×10<sup>−5</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>). A few of these factors caused a significant and reproducible reduction in <italic>mapk</italic> transcript levels as well, without significantly impacting the levels of other RAS/MAPK pathway components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s004">Figure S4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>). These factors include two EJC components (<italic>eIF4AIII</italic> and <italic>mago</italic>) as well as three other candidates: <italic>Cdk12</italic>, <italic>Fip1</italic>, and <italic>CG1603</italic>. Depletion of these latter candidates led to a significant drop in <italic>mapk</italic> transcript levels as measured by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s017">Table S6</xref>). However, these three factors could be distinguished from the EJC components by the fact that they did not cause a shift in the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s005">Figure S5</xref>), but only a decrease in the overall transcript abundance, suggesting that they do act at a different step of <italic>mapk</italic> expression. Finally, lethal alleles of <italic>CG1603</italic> and <italic>Fip1</italic> dominantly suppressed a <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic> induced rough eye phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g006">Figures 6H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">S8A</xref>). The <italic>CG1603</italic> allele also suppressed the extra wing vein phenotype caused by <italic>Egfr<sup>Elp</sup></italic>, as did <italic>Cdk12<sup>KG05512</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8E and S8J</xref>). However, none of the alleles had a readily observable impact on <italic>csw<sup>lf</sup></italic> phenotypes (unpublished data); although <italic>Fip1</italic> did cause a slight enhancement of <italic>csw<sup>lf</sup></italic> lethality (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8I</xref>). Finally, consistent with our cell culture data, knockdown of <italic>CG1603</italic> in larval imaginal disc clones was found to cause a pronounced decrease in MAPK protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Cdk12</italic> is the main RNA polymerase II C-terminal domain kinase. Phosphorylation of the C-terminal domain of RNAP II is required for transcription elongation, RNA processing, and splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Phatnani1">[76]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Kornblihtt1">[77]</xref>. Thus it is possible that <italic>Cdk12</italic> influences either of these steps in the case of <italic>mapk</italic> expression although it does not seem to induce AS. CDK12 has previously been shown to function in conjunction with Cyclin L in regulating AS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Chen2">[78]</xref>. Consistent with these data, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> CycL ortholog, <italic>CG16903</italic>, was also a hit in our screen that mapped to the MEK-MAPK interval (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s014">Table S3</xref>) and caused a shift in the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profile (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s005">Figure S5</xref>). However, <italic>CG16903</italic> did not significantly change <italic>mapk</italic> transcript levels measured by qPCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>).</p>
<p><italic>Fip1</italic> is also involved in transcript processing; its best studied ortholog in yeast is part of the pre-mRNA cleavage and polyadenylation complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Preker1">[79]</xref>. mRNA polyadenylation plays an important part in stabilizing spliceosome assembly on the 3′ most exon of the transcript, is an important pre-requisite for effective mRNA export, and also influences mRNA stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Hagiwara1">[80]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Rigo1">[82]</xref>. Thus, like <italic>Cdk12</italic>, <italic>Fip1</italic> may be regulating <italic>mapk</italic> expression by controlling transcript abundance or by influencing splicing efficiency.</p>
<p><italic>CG1603</italic> encodes a protein of unknown function that contains MADF type zinc finger domains that are related to Myb DNA binding domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Bhaskar1">[83]</xref>. <italic>CG1603</italic> is poorly conserved in humans, bearing distant homology to ZNF664 and ZNF322. Interestingly, ZNF322 was found to act as a transcriptional co-activator of SRF and AP-1 in humans, which would position it downstream of MAPK signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Li1">[84]</xref>, thus representing a potential feedback mechanism.</p>
<p>The majority of the factors that were observed to lower MAPK levels were either spliceosome components or factors associated to the splicing machinery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g005">Figure 5A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>). Intriguingly, multiple lines of evidence suggested that these splicing components can also play a specific role in modulating RAS/MAPK signaling: (1) most splicing factors did not have any detectable impact on CNK, AKT, and RAS levels, even though these proteins are all derived from intron-containing genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s006">Figure S6</xref>), (2) depletion of most splicing factors by RNAi did not significantly modulate PGN (peptidoglycan) and RAC1<sup>V12</sup>-induced JNK activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g003">Figure 3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s015">Table S4</xref>), and (3) these splicing factors scored as hits in previous screens less often than <italic>bona fide</italic> RAS/MAPK pathway components (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s015">Table S4</xref>). Accordingly, the majority of these splicing factors were categorized in the high specificity group. Importantly, many of these had impacts on MAPK levels that were comparable to or greater in strength than those splicing factors of the lower specificity group. This finding suggests that the higher specificity score is not simply attributable to lower knockdown efficiency or a weaker impact on constitutive splicing.</p>
<p>Interestingly, one indication that the canonical splicing factors might be acting differently on MAPK signaling than the EJC came from our qPCR expression data. Namely, some high specificity splicing factors such as the <italic>CG10754</italic> (the counterpart of human SF3A2, a U2 small nuclear ribonucleic particle [snRNP] associated factor involved in branch point binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Staknis1">[85]</xref>), <italic>CG3198</italic> (the ortholog of LUC7L3, a predicted splicing factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Shipman1">[86]</xref>), <italic>Prp19</italic> (the central component of the PRP19 spliceosomal complex involved in C complex assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Chan1">[87]</xref>), as well as <italic>CG4849</italic> and <italic>CG6686</italic> (two predicted tri-snRNP components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Achsel1">[88]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Jurica1">[89]</xref>) all caused a reduction in MAPK protein levels comparable to the EJC factors <italic>mago</italic> and <italic>eIF4AIII</italic>. However, no reduction of <italic>mapk</italic> mRNA was observed by qPCR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g004">Figure 4A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s016">Table S5</xref>). Furthermore, another important difference between the EJC and the canonical splicing factors was that the depletion of many candidates of the latter group caused an increase in nuclear pre-mRNA retention as measured by fluorescence in situ hybridization using a poly-A probe (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s004">Figure S4B and S4C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Farny1">[90]</xref>. This indicates—as might be expected—that most of these splicing factors also play a more general role in splicing.</p>
<p>The key difference between the EJC and canonical splicing factors suggested by the qPCR and pre-mRNA export data was readily observable using the whole-transcript <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR assay; both groups caused an alteration in the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR product, but the canonical splicing factors produced a clearly different pattern (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Since most of the candidates in the canonical splicing factors group produced similar shifts in the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profile, we selected two representative factors for more detailed follow-up experiments. The first, <italic>Prp19</italic>, was selected because it is a core spliceosome component that caused a strong reduction in MAPK levels and had a clear impact on the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g005">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g008">8B</xref>). The second, <italic>Caper</italic>, was selected because it is a serine rich (SR) AS factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Dowhan1">[91]</xref> that did not perturb global pre-mRNA export, and it caused a weaker reduction in MAPK protein levels and a less severe change in the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g005">Figures 5A, 5B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g008">8B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s005">S5</xref>). Consistent with the protein expression data, while both factors clearly altered the <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR products, similar RT-PCR assays targeting <italic>Ras85D</italic>, <italic>raf</italic>, <italic>mek</italic>, <italic>cnk</italic>, or <italic>ksr</italic> did not display any obvious change (unpublished data). Also, Western blot experiments showed a clear drop in MAPK protein levels with no effect on RAS, RAF, MEK, or AKT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g005">Figure 5B</xref>); this suggests that splicing of <italic>mapk</italic>, and not of other pathway components, is affected.</p>

<title><italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> regulate <italic>mapk</italic> AS.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of the four annotated <italic>mapk</italic> splice isoforms observed in S2 cells. Exons are numbered from I to VIII based on the rl-RE transcript for simplicity in addition to the official Flybase exon names (e.g., “rl:14”). Introns lengths are also indicated. (B) An RT-PCR assay encompassing the entire <italic>mapk</italic> transcript (primers bind in exons I and VIII) for the four principle <italic>mapk</italic> isoforms is used to evaluate changes in the <italic>mapk</italic> transcript. In the untreated and <italic>GFP</italic> dsRNA controls, the two most abundant bands on the gel correspond to the RD isoform (topmost) and the RB/RE isoform (immediately below RD). Both <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic> knockdown are found to cause important shifts in the abundance and length of the <italic>mapk</italic> transcript (red labels), which differ from those produced by the depletion of the EJC component, <italic>eIF4AIII</italic> (blue labels). By default, all labels refer to the RB/RE isoform unless otherwise indicated. (C) Sequencing of the RT-PCR products from (B) reveals that the shorter products can be attributed to exon skipping events. In particular, exons IV and VII are the most frequently skipped following <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic> knockdown. This contrasts with <italic>eIF4AIII</italic> knockdown where we previously observed skipping of multiple consecutive exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-AshtonBeaucage1">[41]</xref>. The proportion of normal “N,” truncated “T,” and frameshifted “F” protein products is also indicated for the sequenced transcripts. (D) <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic> cause a shift from the RB/RE/RF forms towards the RD form, which is characterized by retention of the first intron. (E) Exon-exon junction spanning primers are used to detect specific exon skipping events (top panels). Skipping of exons II–III (second row) and exons II–IV (third row) is more abundant in <italic>eIF4AIII</italic> depleted cells. Exon IV (fourth row) and exon VII (fifth row) skipping is more prevalent following <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic> knockdown. Exon IV and VII skipping could also be detected using assays in which both primers lie within an exon region (bottom panels).</p>

<p>Also lending strength to the idea that splicing factors may have a specific role in the RAS/MAPK context was the fact that three <italic>Prp19</italic> alleles and one <italic>Prp8</italic> allele, were isolated by our group in an independent genetic screen for modifiers of a dominant-negative form of CNK (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8B and CB,</xref> ML, MS, and MT, unpublished data). In addition to this finding, <italic>Prp8</italic> has been previously found to enhance the small wing phenotype induced by expression of the <italic>Egfr</italic> inhibitor <italic>aos</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Coelho1">[92]</xref>. Consistent with this result, the <italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Prp8</italic> alleles dominantly suppressed the RAS<sup>V12</sup> rough eye phenotype, as did an allele of <italic>Caper</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g006">Figures 6I, 6J</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">S8A</xref>). The <italic>Prp19</italic> alleles also dramatically enhanced <italic>csw<sup>lf</sup></italic> lethality and suppressed the <italic>Egfr<sup>Elp</sup></italic> wing phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8E, S8I, and S8J</xref>). Moreover, in <italic>mapk/rl<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygous flies, <italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> alleles enhanced the severity of wing vein deletions and rough eye phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g006">Figures 6K–6R</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">S8G, and S8H</xref>). Importantly, although flies carrying one copy of both <italic>Caper<sup>f07714</sup></italic> and <italic>Prp19<sup>CE162</sup></italic> were perfectly viable, this allelic combination was entirely lethal in a <italic>mapk/rl<sup>1</sup></italic> homozygous background (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s008">Figure S8G</xref>). This result constitutes another indication that these splicing factors are acting in concert on <italic>mapk</italic> expression. Finally, splicing of <italic>mapk</italic> was found to be altered in <italic>Prp19<sup>CE162</sup></italic> flies also homozygous for <italic>rl<sup>1</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s010">Figure S10A and S10B</xref>). The <italic>rl<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant alone reduces <italic>mapk</italic> transcript levels without altering the RT-PCR splicing profile [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Lu1">93</xref>; and unpublished data].</p>
<p>Complementing the genetic interaction experiments, expression of <italic>Prp19</italic> RNAi reduced the <italic>Ras<sup>V12</sup></italic>-induced proliferation of larval hemocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). In addition, clonal tissue expressing <italic>Prp19</italic> RNAi in wing imaginal discs consistently caused a reduction in MAPK levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), although the reduction was not as pronounced as that of <italic>mapk</italic> RNAi. Clonal regions sometimes showed signs of apoptosis (in one of the two RNAi constructs tested and in wing discs in particular) suggesting that these tissues may be more sensitive to knockdown of <italic>Prp19</italic> than S2 cells. Finally, splicing of <italic>mapk</italic> was found to be altered in wing disc segments where <italic>Caper</italic> had been knocked down (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s010">Figure S10C</xref>).</p>
<p>Altogether, these experiments suggest that these transcription and splicing factors are important in regulating MAPK levels, and thus are important for MAPK signaling. Furthermore, our genetic interaction data suggests that they can act in a number of different <italic>in vivo</italic> contexts. In particular, the <italic>Prp19</italic> alleles had an impact in all our RAS/MAPK genetic interaction experiments and displayed some of the strongest phenotype modifications. Thus, of the different groups of candidates, it is quite possible that splicing factors are relevant to the broadest range of RAS/MAPK regulatory and developmental contexts.</p>

<title>Analysis of mapk AS Induced by Caper and Prp19 Depletion</title>
<p><italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> RNAi display similar <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profiles, but <italic>Caper</italic> produces a more subtle shift in product size with less lower size bands observable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). To verify that these changes in the RT-PCR profile of <italic>mapk</italic> were due to altered splicing, we cloned and sequenced the RT-PCR products. We found that the lower size <italic>mapk</italic> transcripts produced by both <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic> RNAi were generated by a series of exon skipping events and, to a lesser extent, by retention of the 5′ most intron of the RB/RE isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g008">Figure 8A–8D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s018">Table S7</xref>). <italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> RNAi produced many single exon skipping events with exons IV and VII being the most frequently skipped. These AS events differed from those we had previously observed in EJC depleted samples, where skipping of multiple consecutive exons was observed immediately to the 3′ end of exon I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-AshtonBeaucage1">[41]</xref>. Interestingly, exon skipping events associated with the EJC mostly resulted in frameshifting due to the loss of the start site in exon II and/or skipping of exon III. On the other hand, the skipping of exons IV and VII associated with <italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> produce an in-frame deletion potentially giving rise to a truncated protein product. The fact that we did not observe any smaller size products may be due to the epitope being removed or to the smaller products being unstable and degraded (MAPK is mostly composed of a kinase domain and it is likely that these deletions would disrupt proper folding).</p>
<p>In order to confirm that depletion of <italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> produced AS changes in <italic>mapk</italic> that were different from those produced by EJC depletion, we designed RT-PCR assays aimed at detecting specific AS events. Using primer pairs in which the 5′ primer overlapped the exon junction between exons I and III or exons I and IV, we were able to detect an enrichment in exon II–III and II–IV skipping in <italic>eIF4AIII</italic> depleted samples, consistent with our previous results. However, these exon skipping events were not enriched in <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic> RNAi samples. Conversely, using the same strategy, increased skipping of exons IV and VII was observed for <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic>, but not for <italic>eIF4AIII</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Also, using primers targeting the exons on either side of the skipped exons, we were able to detect both the canonical and the alternative transcripts produced by either <italic>Prp19</italic> or <italic>Caper</italic> depletion in both S2 cells and wing disc tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g008">Figures 8E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s010">S10C</xref>). In sum, multiple lines of evidence indicate that <italic>Prp19</italic> and <italic>Caper</italic> cause specific changes in <italic>mapk</italic> splicing that differ from those associated to the EJC. This finding suggests that at least two different types of regulation act on <italic>mapk</italic> AS. By extension, it is likely that the other splicing factors identified in our screen can be grouped with <italic>Caper</italic> and <italic>Prp19</italic>—and not the EJC—since they produced <italic>mapk</italic> RT-PCR profiles similar to these factors.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this report, we presented the results of an RNAi screen for factors influencing signaling between RAS and MAPK in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. Most previously known pathway components have been identified in our screen, including a few that had not yet been found in flies (e.g., <italic>Sur-8</italic>, <italic>Pp1-87B</italic>, <italic>Hmgcr</italic>, and <italic>Fnta</italic>). On the basis of analyses of our secondary screen results and publicly available data, we assessed the specificity of our candidates, grouped them into protein complexes, and positioned their effect relative to the core RAS/MAPK pathway components (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We also evaluated the impact of our candidates on the expression of core components of the RAS/MAPK pathway. From these data, we identified distinct groups of factors with different roles in modulating RAS/MAPK signaling. Furthermore, we show that the largest group of candidates—which is composed of splicing factors—acts specifically on <italic>mapk</italic> expression. This discovery is surprising since most of the previously described regulators of MAPK signaling act at the level of RAF activation. Thus, our results uncover an unappreciated point of control governing <italic>Drosophila</italic> RAS/MAPK signaling that takes place through the control of <italic>mapk</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001809-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, the identification of two other factors (<italic>gfzf</italic> and <italic>CG4936</italic>) that act to control <italic>mek</italic> and <italic>PTP-ER</italic> expression adds another layer to the gene expression control network surrounding the RAS/MAPK pathway.</p>

<title>Regulatory input at the level of MEK, PTP-ER, and MAPK expression adds another layer to the network of factors that control RAS/MAPK signaling.</title>
<p>Schematic model of proteins associated with RAS/MAPK signal transmission discussed in this work. Components used in secondary screens (GAP1, NF1) are also depicted. <italic>Sur-8</italic>, <italic>PP1-87B</italic>, and the five STRIPAK complex components were positioned between RAS and RAF in our epistasis assays. Their position would be consistent with a role in the RAF activation process. As it has been previously shown in mammalian models, SUR-8 and PP1 may be acting on RAF activation by dephosphorylating the N-terminal 14-3-3 binding site. Because PP2A is also known to dephosphorylate this site and because STRIPAK has been characterized as a PP2A-associated complex, STRIPAK may be involved in facilitating PP2A binding to RAF. GFZF was positioned at the level of MEK and was found to impact MEK expression, presumably by regulating <italic>mek</italic> transcription. CG4936 was found to impact expression of the MAPK phosphatase, PTP-ER, and also probably acts at the level of transcriptional regulation. CG1603, FIP1, and CDK12 were found to act on MAPK expression, most likely acting as transcriptional regulators (CG1603) or involved in transcript maturation/processing (FIP1 and CDK12). Finally, components of the spliceosome, splicing factors and the EJC were found to modulate MAPK expression by altering the splicing of the <italic>mapk</italic> transcript. The particular sensitivity of MAPK to disruption of these spliceosome components may be due to their involvement in recruiting specific mRNA processing factors such as the EJC. Alternatively, the reason why <italic>mapk</italic> displays an increased requirement for this set of spliceosome components may be due to a feature in <italic>mapk</italic>'s gene structure. For example, intron length is correlated with sensitivity of transcripts to EJC depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-AshtonBeaucage1">[41]</xref>.</p>

<p>When comparing our results to those of three previous RNAi screens examining insulin receptor (InR) and EGFR induced MAPK signaling in <italic>Drosophila</italic> cells in culture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Friedman1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Friedman2">[62]</xref>, we found that our validated hit set had a relatively limited overlap with those studies; 44 of our 78 positive regulators were present in their list of 986 positive regulators and 18 of our 28 negative regulators were also present in their group of 1266 negative regulators (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s011">Figure S11A and S11B</xref>). 331 hits reported in the InR screen were tested for their ability to modulate RAS<sup>V12</sup> in an assay similar to the one used in our screen. However, very few of the candidates found to modulate RAS<sup>V12</sup> signaling in their secondary screen were also present in our validated hit set; 14 of our 106 validated genes were found to alter RAS<sup>V12</sup> induced pMAPK beyond 5% of controls in their study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001809.s011">Figure S11C and S11D</xref>). Furthermore, nine of these 14 genes were <italic>bona fide</italic> pathway components. This limited overlap between our studies can be explained by two things: First, their S2R+ InR assay involved the use of an exogenous source of YFP-tagged MAPK where the YFP signal was used to normalize pMAPK signal. This strategy makes detection of factors that modify endogenous MAPK expression impractical (a large proportion of our candidates are involved in exactly this type of regulation). Second, when selecting which hits to follow up in secondary screening, the authors elected to exclude certain genes linked to large molecular complexes, most likely excluding many of the splicing factors that were retained in our study.</p>

<title>Control of mapk Expression</title>
<p>With the exception of the well described regulation of RAS by <italic>let-7</italic> family miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Johnson1">[22]</xref>, surprisingly little is known on the regulation of MAPK module component expression. It was therefore surprising to find that our largest group of hits specifically decreased MAPK levels. Yet, control of MAPK expression is not unprecedented. For example, in yeast, both the FUS3 and HOG1 MAPKs are transcriptional targets of their respective pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Roberts1">[94]</xref>. Pumilio mRNA binding proteins are also known to reduce MAPK activity by lowering the expression of the <italic>C. elegans</italic> MAPK, Mpk-1, as well as ERK2/MAPK1 and p38α/MAPK14 in human embryonic stem (ES) cells, through the binding of specific sites on the 3′ UTR of their respective transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Lee1">[95]</xref>. Finally, LARP-1 RNA-binding proteins have been found to control the abundance of the transcripts of Mpk-1 and other pathway members in the <italic>C. elegans</italic> germ line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Nykamp1">[96]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that multiple splicing factors act downstream of MEK to specifically control MAPK levels. While some of these factors were associated with the regulation of AS, most were components of the spliceosome or factors that co-purify with the spliceosome. Interestingly, many lines of evidence suggest that AS can be modified by spliceosomal factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Adams1">[97]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Furney1">[106]</xref>. Global analyses of splicing events in yeast using a series of temperature sensitive alleles and deletions of splicing factors, found that spliceosome components differed in terms of which splicing events they altered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Pleiss1">[98]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Clark1">[99]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Albulescu1">[105]</xref>. Among these, the yeast homologs of <italic>Prp19</italic>, <italic>Prp8</italic>, <italic>U4-U6-60K</italic>, <italic>l(3)72Ab</italic>, <italic>Prp6</italic>, <italic>SmD2</italic>, <italic>SF3a120</italic>, <italic>CG4849</italic>, and <italic>CG10333</italic>—factors included in our set of hits—were found to differentially modulate the splicing of specific sets of transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Pleiss1">[98]</xref>. Moreover, studies conducted in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using an RNAi-based strategy have demonstrated that knocking down many so-called “core” spliceosome components caused specific changes in specific AS contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Park1">[100]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Katzenberger1">[101]</xref>. In particular, some of the “core” components identified in our screen have been shown to have selective effects. For example, knocking down <italic>Prp6</italic>, <italic>l(3)72Ab</italic>, <italic>crn</italic>, <italic>Caper</italic>, <italic>SF3a120</italic>, and <italic>CG10418</italic>, was found to differentially influence AS of <italic>Dscam</italic>, <italic>para</italic>, <italic>TAF1</italic>, and/or <italic>dAdar</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Park1">[100]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Katzenberger1">[101]</xref>. In mammals, SmB was also recently shown to be involved in regulating inclusion of alternative exons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Saltzman1">[103]</xref>. Finally, our observation that a <italic>Prp19</italic> knockdown had specific effects on MAPK protein levels and the identification of <italic>Prp19</italic> (as well as <italic>Prp8</italic>) in a separate CNK-based genetic screen supports the notion that these splicing factors are important for <italic>mapk</italic> expression <italic>in vivo</italic>. Thus, the fact that we identified specific spliceosome components in our screen and not others may reflect the importance of these particular components in regulating <italic>mapk</italic> splicing.</p>
<p>The specific elements of the <italic>mapk</italic> gene structure that dictate requirement of particular splicing factors have yet to be determined. Likewise, many—if not most—other genes may have structures that preclude AS regulation by components of the spliceosome. Still, AS processes in at least four other <italic>Drosophila</italic> genes seem to involve some of the same components of the splicing machinery that we have linked to <italic>mapk</italic>, indicating that a common characteristic may dictate the involvement of these spliceosome components in AS. On the other hand, the fact that some of the spliceosome factors are involved in specific AS contexts and not others, suggests that key differences exist. This observation is important as it implies that specific AS events can be modulated by controlling the activity of these spliceosomal factors. In support of this idea, one of the previously mentioned studies indicates that the control of <italic>TAF1</italic> AS by a series of splicing factors—which include <italic>Caper</italic> and other spliceosome components—is downstream of a Camptothecin-induced ATR pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Katzenberger1">[101]</xref>. Another example is the regulation of CD44 AS by RAS/MAPK-induced phosphorylation of Sam68, which has been found to function by regulating the activity of the U2AF65 spliceosome component <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Tisserant1">[107]</xref>. In addition to Sam68, other splicing factors and spliceosome components—including some that were identified in our screen—were recently found to be the targets of ERK phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Courcelles1">[108]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Pan1">[110]</xref>. Finally, a general splicing repressor, SRp38, has also been shown to function as a sequence specific splicing activator upon phosphorylation in response to cellular stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Feng1">[111]</xref>.</p>
<p>One explanation for our results, as well as some of the previous observations, would be that some of the spliceosomal factors in our set may be interchangeable or function as non-essential co-regulators. Thus, removing these components would not greatly disrupt general spliceosome function, but rather lead to an altered spliceosome activity that selectively impacts sensitive AS contexts. An example of this is the interplay between PUF60 and U2AF65, which both function in 3′ splice site recognition; the two factors can either work cooperatively or independently, producing different splicing outcomes on the basis of the presence or absence of either protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Hastings1">[112]</xref>. A further example is the stress-induced relocalization of certain spliceosome and splicing factors that leads to changes in spliceosome configuration and AS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Biamonti1">[113]</xref>. Cellular stress has also been associated with the production of “non-productive” AS variants or silent messengers (transcripts that are either degraded by the quality control machinery or that do not encode functional proteins) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Dutertre1">[114]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Ip1">[115]</xref>. In fact, the AS we observed in <italic>mapk</italic> is reminiscent of the AS observed for the E3 ligase MDM2 following camptothecin-induced genotoxic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001809-Dutertre2">[116]</xref>. In this study, the authors found that stress induced a number of non-productive MDM2 transcript isoforms that resulted in lower MDM2 protein levels and a stabilization of the MDM2 target, p53. It will be important to determine whether stress—or another signal—acts to control MAPK protein levels by inducing the AS we observe in our experiments.</p>
<p>The discovery that MAPK expression is specifically modulated by mRNA processing factors raises multiple questions. Not only will it be vital to define the upstream signals that dictate this activity but it will also be important to assess which other genes are similarly regulated and to identify the common characteristic that renders them sensitive to this type of regulation. Also, the time frame within which these changes occur will have implications as to the role that this type of regulation can play in MAPK signaling. Typically, RAS/MAPK signal modulation has been observed to occur through either rapid post-translational mechanisms or through slightly slower mechanisms involving control of protein stability and transcriptional control. However, the reduction in protein levels we observed as a consequence of AS are only apparent over a period of days, probably because the MAPK protein is relatively stable. This finding indicates that this regulation will not be relevant over the shorter timeframes of previously characterized regulatory events and also implies that a prolonged stimulus will be necessary to produce the effects we observe. Therefore, control of <italic>mapk</italic> splicing may be more important in the context of certain tissues and organs, in development or in disease.

Cells were resuspended and transferred to concanavalin A coated plates and allowed to settle and adhere for 1 h. Cells were then fixed in 4% paraformaldehyde/PBS, washed, and blocked in 0.2% Triton X-100/0.2% BSA/PBS (PBT/BSA) and incubated overnight with an anti-pMAPK antibody (1/2,000; Sigma number M8159), washed in PBT/BSA, and revealed using an anti-mouse Alexa Fluor 555-conjugated secondary antibody (1/1,000; Invitrogen number A-21424). DAPI (0.04 µg/ml) was used to stain nuclei. Mowiol (9.6% PVA, Fluka) was added to wells prior to imaging. An automated fluorescence microscopy system (Zeiss Axiovert) was employed for plate imaging. Autofocus, image acquisition, and analysis were conducted using MetaMorph (Molecular Devices) software. The cell-scoring application in MetaMorph was used for cell segmentation and quantification of fluorescent signal.</p>

<p><bold>Primary screen and screening strategy.</bold> (A) Primary screen hits are submitted to validation screening steps to eliminate false positives. Remaining candidates were submitted to secondary screens to assess the position of the regulatory input relative to known pathway components (epistasis) and specificity to the RAS/MAPK signaling context. In addition to this, candidates were screened for their impact on core RAS/MAPK component expression, both at the transcript (qPCR and RT-PCR) and protein level (quantitative immunofluorescence and Western blot). (B) The robustness of the primary screen assay was evaluated by monitoring changes in RAS<sup>V12</sup>-induced pathway activity following knockdown of <italic>mek</italic> and <italic>PTP-ER</italic>. The levels of pMAPK are then measured by quantitative microscopy. Results shown for each dsRNA are the mean of 43 sample wells in three separately prepared plates.

<p><bold>qPCR screen.</bold> (A) Unsupervised hierarchical clustering of qPCR screen results.
