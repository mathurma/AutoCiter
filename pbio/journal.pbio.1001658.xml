<p>This work reports the long-awaited identification of Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 as the M cell co-receptors that mediate the reverse transcytosis of secretory IgA molecules to mount a gut immune response.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Intestinal microfold (M) cells possess a high transcytosis capacity and are able to transport a broad range of materials including particulate antigens, soluble macromolecules, and pathogens from the intestinal lumen to inductive sites of the mucosal immune system. M cells are also the primary pathway for delivery of secretory IgA (SIgA) to the gut-associated lymphoid tissue. However, although the consequences of SIgA uptake by M cells are now well known and described, the mechanisms whereby SIgA is selectively bound and taken up remain poorly understood. Here we first demonstrate that both the Cα1 region and glycosylation, more particularly sialic acid residues, are involved in M cell–mediated reverse transcytosis. Second, we found that SIgA is taken up by M cells via the Dectin-1 receptor, with the possible involvement of Siglec-5 acting as a co-receptor. Third, we establish that transcytosed SIgA is taken up by mucosal CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> dendritic cells (DCs) via the DC-SIGN receptor. Fourth, we show that mucosal and systemic antibody responses against the HIV p24-SIgA complexes administered orally is strictly dependent on the expression of Dectin-1. Having deciphered the mechanisms leading to specific targeting of SIgA-based Ag complexes paves the way to the use of such a vehicle for mucosal vaccination against various infectious diseases.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Secretory IgA (SIgA) antibodies are secreted into the gut lumen and are considered to be a first line of defense in protecting the intestinal epithelium from gut pathogens. SIgA patrol the mucus and are usually known to help immune tolerance via entrapping dietary antigens and microorganisms and other mechanisms. SIgA, in complex with its antigens, can also be taken back up by the intestinal epithelium in a process known as reverse transcytosis. SIgA can thereby promote the uptake and delivery of antigens from the intestinal lumen to the Gut-Associated Lymphoid Tissues (GALT), influencing inflammatory responses. This reverse transcytosis of SIgA is mediated by specialized epithelial M cells. Because M cells possess the ability to take up antigens and are therefore important to the local immune system, they are a key target for the specific delivery of novel mucosal vaccines against various diseases. M cell receptors that take up the SIgA-antigen complexes, which serve as mucosal vaccine vehicles, represent an important aspect of this vaccine strategy. The identification of SIgA receptor(s) on the surface of M cells has, however, remained elusive for more than a decade. In this study, we now identify Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 as the key receptors for M cell–mediated reverse transcytosis of SIgA complexes. We further find that the glycosylation modification, and particularly sialylation, of SIgA is required for its uptake by M cells. We show that, when administered orally in complex with SIgA, the HIV p24 antigen is taken up in a strictly Dectin-1-dependent manner to stimulate a mucosal and systemic antibody response. These findings are considered important for understanding gut immunity.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The mucosal immune system comprises the largest part of the entire immune system, and the mucosal surface represents the primary site of entry for pathogenic agents. SIgA has long been recognized as a first line of defense in protecting the intestinal epithelium from enteric pathogens and toxins. It is generally assumed that SIgA acts primarily through receptor blockade, steric hindrance, and/or immune exclusion. In recent years evidence has emerged indicating that SIgA promotes the uptake and delivery of Ags from the intestinal lumen to DC subsets located in gut-associated lymphoid tissues (GALTs), and influences inflammatory responses normally associated with the uptake of highly pathogenic bacteria and potentially allergenic antigens. This particular feature of SIgA, called reverse transcytosis, is mediated by epithelial M cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Alpan1">[1]</xref>. However, although the potentially useful properties of M cells on SIgA uptake are now well known, the receptor(s) whereby SIgA is taken up and transported by M cells remain(s) elusive.</p>
<p>SIgA reverse transcytosis was first invoked to account for the binding of rabbit SIgA to M cells in Peyer's patches (PPs) of suckling rabbits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Roy1">[2]</xref>. Colloidal gold particles coated with IgA were subsequently detected within M cell cytoplasmic vesicles and in the extracellular space of M cell pockets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Weltzin1">[3]</xref>. Endogenous SIgA was also shown to bind to human PP M cells in paraffin sections of human ileum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mantis1">[4]</xref>. In frozen sections, labeled SIgA could be visualized bound at the apical surface, in transit through intracellular vesicles, in the intraepithelial pocket, and on basolateral processes extending toward the basal lamina. In a mouse ligated ileal loop assay, mouse SIgA, human SIgA2, but not human SIgA1, bound to PP M cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mantis1">[4]</xref>. Structural changes could explain the differences in reverse transcytosis between these subtypes. The IgA1 hinge features a 16 amino-acid insertion, lacking in IgA2, comprising a repeat of eight amino acids decorated with 3–5 O-linked oligosaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Royle1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mattu1">[6]</xref>. Recombinant IgA1 with a deleted hinge region gained M cell binding function, which was interpreted as the M cell's binding site comprising both domains Cα1 and Cα2, juxtaposed in mouse IgA and human IgA2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mantis1">[4]</xref>. Overall, IgA2 contains 4 N-glycosylation sites (Asn<sup>166</sup>, Asn<sup>263</sup>, Asn<sup>337</sup>, Asn<sup>459</sup>). In dimeric IgA, the Fc regions of the two monomers are linked end to end through disulfide bridges to the J chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Krugmann1">[7]</xref>. IgA, with or without bound secretory component (SC), selectively adheres to the apical surfaces of mouse PP M cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mantis1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>To date, only a limited number of M cell receptors and their ligands have been identified, but most of these receptors are expressed in M cells and neighboring enterocytes as well. Some important pathogen recognition receptors, such as toll-like receptor-4, platelet-activating factor receptor, and α5β1 integrin have been identified on the surface of human and mouse M cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Tyrer1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Chou1">[9]</xref>. The sialyl Lewis A (CA19.9) antigen lectin reacts with 80% of human M cells and, in contrast to the other ligands, binds only weakly to the enterocytes of the follicle-associated epithelium (FAE). Moreover, there is a wide variation in marker expression between M cells of different species and even between M cells at different portions of the intestine within the same species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Wong1">[10]</xref>. Indeed, M cells in murine, but not human, PP are preferentially bound with Ulex europaeus agglutinin–1 (UEA-1), a lectin specific to α-l-fucose residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Wang1">[11]</xref>. A first mouse M cell–specific monoclonal antibody (mAb NKM 16-2-4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Nochi1">[12]</xref> displaying specificity for α(1,2)-fucose–containing carbohydrate moieties was produced. Glycoprotein 2 (GP2) was also shown to be specifically expressed on M cells of mouse and human PPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Hase1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Terahara1">[15]</xref> and serves as an endocytic receptor for luminal antigens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Hase2">[16]</xref>. Another M cell marker, clusterin, is expressed in M cells and follicular DCs at inductive sites of human GALTs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Verbrugghe1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>To date, the molecular partner(s) involved in SIgA reverse transcytosis has(have) not been identified in mice or in humans. In this work, we sought to map the structural feature(s) responsible for the selective interaction between murine SIgA and M cells. Since it is impossible to keep M cells in culture, one valuable approach consists in using cell culture models that mimic essential features of the FAE tissue. An <italic>in vitro</italic> model was used, based on the co-culture of polarized Caco-2 cells grown on inverted inserts and exposed to human Raji B lymphocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Kernis1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Gullberg1">[18]</xref>. Following optimization in terms of functionality and reproducibility, we evaluated the transport of wild-type (wt) and mutant human IgA2 across newly differentiated M-like cells in comparison with other Ab isotypes. We found that glycosylation sites and in particular sialylation of the Cα1 region of IgA2 are required for M-like cell-mediated reverse transcytosis. We demonstrate for the first time that Dectin-1 expressed on the surface of M cells acts as a receptor involved in SIgA reverse transcytosis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Siglec-5 receptor seems also to participate in reverse transcytosis. Such a selective interaction has functional consequences <italic>in vivo</italic>, since targeting of HIV p24-SIgA complexes after oral delivery promotes the production of systemic and mucosal Ag-specific Abs in wt mice only, and not in Dectin-1 KO animals.</p>

<p>M cells display a reduced brush border at their apical surface and an invaginated basolateral membrane, forming a pocket filled with immunoreactive cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Weltzin1">[3]</xref>. Transmission electron microscopy shows that mono-cultures of Caco-2 cells exhibit a well-developed brush border with tightly packed microvilli, whereas in co-cultures with Raji cells, M-like cells characterized by the effacement of microvilli and enfolded lymphocytes are present (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g001">Figure 1d1</xref>). Moreover, the presence of desmosomes between M-like cells and the neighboring cells reveals their enterocytic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g001">Figure 1d1</xref>, inset). Using scanning electron microscopy analysis, we observed in mono-cultures that all Caco-2 cells possessed a regular brush border and well-developed tight junctions, whereas in co-cultures, approximately 20–30% of Caco-2 cells expressed short and irregular microvilli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g001">Figure 1d2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-DesRieux2">[20]</xref>. Immunolabeling of M-like cells with CA19.9 and enterocytes with UEA-1 (Ulex europaeus isoagglutinin I) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Gabor1">[21]</xref> indicated a similar percentage of conversion, assuming a surface equivalence for M and Caco-2 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g001">Figure 1e1</xref>). This was further verified by co-localization of human IgA2 with M cells labeled with CA19.9 mAb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g001">Figure 1e2</xref>), in agreement with Mantis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mantis1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>To verify functional Caco-2 cell conversion into M cells, the transport of yellow/green-conjugated, 0.2 µm nanoparticles (NPs) across mono- and co-cultures was examined. NPs have previously been used to study transcytosis in various M-like cell models <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Clark1">[22]</xref>.

The sum of these data confirmed that the <italic>in vitro</italic> model of human FAE allowed efficient Caco-2 cells to M-like cell conversion to occur (20–30%), and importantly, with a high level of reproducibility.</p>

<title>Structural Features Involved in the Specific Uptake and Transport of IgA2 in the <italic>in vitro</italic> Model of Human FAE</title>
<p>One feature of M cells is their ability to transport a broad range of materials including Abs from the lumen to the underlying follicles. Specific retro-transport of Abs was compared between mono- and co-cultures using a luciferase (Luc)-IgA fusion protein. The Luc tag did not affect the Ab functionality (unpublished data) and allowed for sensitive quantification. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g003">Figure 3a</xref>, a significant exclusive transport of the IgA2 monomer (m-IgA2) across the cell monolayer harboring M-like cells was observed (<italic>p</italic> = 0.03). No significant transport of m-IgA1, IgG, or IgE was detected. Specificity of IgA reverse transcytosis was further confirmed <italic>in vivo</italic> by using a ligated murine intestinal loop. IgA positive cells were 30 times more abundant than IgG positive cells in PPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). Dimerization, by incorporation of the J chain, or association with human SC did not modify IgA2 uptake by M-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g003">Figure 3a</xref>).</p>

<title>Specific transport of IgA2-Luc across the <italic>in vitro</italic> model of human FAE and in a mouse ligated loop containing a PP.</title>
<p>(a) Mono- and co-cultures were incubated for 90 min at 37°C with various IgA2 constructs, and transported IgA was evaluated by associated luminescence (<italic>n</italic> = 4).

<p>Next, mapping of regions and domains involved in IgA2 reverse transcytosis was performed with recombinant IgA2 lacking various portions of the heavy chain C-terminus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g003">Figure 3a</xref>). IgA2 monomer depleted of Cα2, Cα3, and the tailpiece (m-IgA2 dCα2/3) crossed M-like cells as well as m-IgA2 wt, whereas IgA2 monomer depleted of the tailpiece (m-IgA2 dPB) and IgA2 monomer depleted of both the Cα3 and tailpiece (m-IgA2 dCα3) were not transported. The hinge region did not influence uptake as m-IgA2 dCα2/3 and m-IgA2 Cα1 (IgA2 with only the Cα1 constant region) gave similar results. Strikingly, M-like cell-mediated transport of IgA2 with only the Cα1 constant region was equivalent to wt m-IgA2. These results demonstrate that in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model, the Cα1 region of IgA2 is sufficient to allow reverse transcytosis through M-like cells.</p>

<title>Influence of Glycosylation on the Uptake of IgA2 by M-Like Cells</title>
<p>Subclasses of human IgA are also different with respect to the number of N-glycosylation sites. In order to determine whether N-glycans present on IgA2 could influence their uptake and transport by M-like cells, transcytosis of a battery of constructs with engineered glycosylation sites was compared. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g004">Figure 4a</xref>, the efficiency of reverse transcytosis was highly dependent on the number of glycosylation sites. Indeed, there was a significant decrease in the transport of m-IgA2 G2, G1, G0, and m-IgA2 Cα1 G0 compared with m-IgA2. These findings were confirmed by enzymatic digestion of m-IgA2 by PNGase, an amidase that cleaves between the innermost GlcNAc and asparagine residues of high mannose, hybrid, and complex oligosaccharides from N-linked glycoproteins.</p>

<p>Sialic acid (Sia) can occur in different glycosidic linkages, most typically at the exposed, nonreduced ends of oligosaccharide chains attached to a wide variety of proteins like IgA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Imberty1">[24]</xref>. To assess the function of Sia in IgA binding to M-like cells, IgA was exposed to neuraminidase, which has the capacity to selectively cleave the glycosidic linkages of neuraminic acids. An important and significant decrease in transport of IgA2 lacking Sia, resembling that measured for m-IgA2 G0 or m-IgA2+PNGase, was observed. Identical results were obtained with another recombinant IgA2 Ab molecule specific for CD20, with SIgA purified from colostrum and with plasma IgA treated by neuraminidase or PNGase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). The absence of remaining carbohydrates or Sia on the different IgA was verified by Western blot using labeling with lectins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g004">Figure 4c</xref>), while the integrity of the IgA2 polypeptide following enzymatic treatment was verified by analysis on SDS-PAA gels (unpublished data).

<title>IgA Binds to Intestinal M-Like Cells Via Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 Receptors</title>
<p>As the above results provide solid evidence of the contribution of glycosylation to reverse transcytosis, we postulated that the IgA2 receptor of M-like cells is a glucan receptor. Blocking experiments were performed using a series of β-glucans, mono-, and disaccharides. A statistically significant decrease in IgA2 transport was observed in the presence of β-glucans including curdlan, laminarin, and zymosan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5a</xref>).

<p>To further explore the possible involvement of glycans in IgA2 binding to M-like cells, Abs directed against the most common sugar receptors were used in blocking experiments. The use of an anti-Dectin-1 mAb targeting this β-glucan receptor led to an almost complete inhibition of IgA2 reverse transcytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). In contrast, blocking of the mannose receptor with an anti-CD206 mAb or of the lipopolysaccharide receptor with anti-TLR4 and anti-CD14 mAbs did not influence IgA2 transport. Consistently, the presence of Dectin-1 was observed on M-like cells present in co-culture conditions only (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5c–e</xref>). Other receptors that have been described as being involved in IgA transport were evaluated. Transferrin receptor expressed by enterocytes (CD71) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-MatysiakBudnik1">[25]</xref>, which binds IgA1 Abs, did not block IgA2 passage, thus confirming the exclusive transport of IgA2 by M-like cells. Similarly, targeting of the human myeloid IgA Fc receptor (CD89) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Morton1">[26]</xref> with a specific mAb did not block the transport of IgA2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5b</xref>).</p>
<p>To confirm the inability of desialylated IgA2 to target M-like cells <italic>in vitro</italic>, blocking experiments were also carried out using mAbs directed against various Siglecs, a family of receptors that specifically recognize Sia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Crocker1">[27]</xref>. The unique involvement of Siglec-5 in IgA2 reverse transcytosis was demonstrated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5b</xref>), in contrast to all the other members of the family. The surface of M-like cells was Siglec-5<sup>+</sup> in co-culture conditions only, with no labeling observed in mono-cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5c–e</xref>). Moreover, N-Acetylneuraminic acid severely affected SIgA2 reverse transcytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5a</xref>). Mabs to either Dectin-1 or Siglec-5 strongly inhibited transport of IgA2 <italic>in vitro</italic>, reaching up to 90% when added together (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5b</xref>). Binding of monomeric IgA2 and SIgA to Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 was verified by ELISA using recombinant Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 as coating molecules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g006">Figure 6a</xref>). In support of previous data, deglycosylated IgA2 and IgA1 were unable to recognize Dectin-1 and Siglec-5. Specificity of IgA2 recognition was further confirmed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g006">Figure 6b</xref>) and flow cytometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g006">Figure 6c</xref>) using HEK cell transfectants expressing both Dectin-1 and Siglec-5. Importantly, co-localization between partners of the triad was observed in both types of analyses.

<p>We next assess the relevance of these findings in the human in vitro system. HeLa transfectants stably expressing DC-SIGN added to the compartment bathing the basolateral pole of Caco-2 cells were used as surrogates of DCs populating the SED region of PPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Rochereau1">[33]</xref>. Control of DC-SIGN expression was demonstrated by the inhibition of gp120 binding on HeLa-DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> cells by specific blocking mAbs (unpublished data). The binding of IgA2 that had previously crossed the monolayer containing M-like cells was observed by immunostaining of HeLa-DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g010">Figure 10c</xref>), but not with wt HeLa cells used as a negative control. In another control, CHO expressing Langerin placed in the basolateral compartment did not bind transcytosed IgA2 (unpublished data). The transport of integral IgA2 through M cells, and also their preserved capacity to interact with DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> DC–expressing cells is another indication of the steps involved to ultimately lead to immune responses as detected above. These findings have also been confirmed by flow cytometry using human monocyte-derived DCs known to express DC-SIGN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g010">Figure 10d</xref>).</p>
<p>The sum of these data shed light on the biochemical partners involved in reverse transcytosis of SIgA by PPs. SIgA is first taken up by M cells via the Dectin-1 receptor and/or Siglec-5, and is subsequently targeted to mucosal CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> DCs bearing the DC-SIGN receptor. In the context of immune complexes, this process explains the functional production of mucosal and systemic Ab responses to the associated antigen.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>M cells possess a high transcytotic capacity, allowing a wide range of materials to be transported including particulate Ags, soluble macromolecules, and pathogens. They are delivered from the intestinal lumen to inductive sites of the mucosal immune system. M cells are also the primary route through which SIgA are delivered to the GALT. Corthésy <italic>et al.</italic> have previously shown that after selective interaction with M cells, SIgA are targeted to DCs located in the SED region of PP, resulting in limited mucosal and systemic immune responses against a non-self-associated protein Ag <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Rey1">[34]</xref>. Selective adherence to the apical surface of M cells is a prerequisite for efficient transepithelial transport, but the identity of receptors involved in SIgA endocytosis has remained elusive. In the current study, we investigated the transport of human SIgA2 across a model mimicking human FAE. At the level of IgA2, we provide evidence that both the Cα1 domain and associated glycosylation, more particularly Sia residues, are involved in M-like cell-mediated reverse transcytosis, while at the receptor level, both Dectin-1 and Siglec-5 have been identified as essential partner in the process. Finally, we validate our <italic>in vitro</italic> results upon analysis of murine and human tissues, ultimately demonstrating that Dectin-1/Siglec-5-mediated uptake of SIgA-based complexes results in productive mucosal and systemic antigen-specific Ab responses.</p>
<p>Initially, we studied reverse transcytosis of IgA2 across human M-like cells using a cell culture model that reproduces features of the FAE tissue. We confirmed that human IgA2, with or without J chain and/or bound SC, but not IgA1, IgG, or IgE, selectively bound to the apical surface of <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiated human M-like cells. Using a battery of deletion mutants, we demonstrated that domains Cα2 and Cα3 of IgA2 are dispensable to keep reverse transcytosis through M-like cells highly active. Low or absent transport of m-IgA2 dCα3 and m-IgA2 dPB comprising the Cα1 region suggests that subtle structural changes may affect optimal folding of these two particular recombinant proteins. Our <italic>in vitro</italic> results obtained with human cells do not totally correlate with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results of Mantis et al., who showed that both domains Cα1 and Cα2 were required for IgA binding to mouse PP M cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mantis1">[4]</xref>. Differences in the expression systems for IgA constructs (deletion versus domain swab) and the glycosylation pattern may explain this discrepancy. It is conceivable that a critical density of glycans must be present to ensure uptake, as was recently described for Dectin-1 efficiently binding β-glucan polymers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Goodridge1">[35]</xref>. In conclusion, our study unequivocally demonstrates that IgA transport requires the presence of the properly glycosylated Cα1 domain within the Ab structure. The model opens the path toward <italic>in vitro</italic> assays of transport across reconstituted FAE, examination of the mechanisms of uptake, and investigation into vaccine or intestinal microbe delivery.</p>

Glycosylation patterns on pathogens are frequently used for adherence to, and passage across, the mucosal epithelium and in particular M cells in the FAE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Jones1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Tyrer2">[38]</xref>. Similarly, it is conceivable that abundant carbohydrates located on the surface of SIgA may intervene in the process of selective recognition of M cells. The sum of our data confirms this working hypothesis, and demonstrates the prominent influence of glycosylation on the uptake of IgA2 by M cells. Additional experiments dealing with deletion of particular glycosylation sites and enzymatic desialylation allowed us to confirm the role of Sia residues in reverse transcytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Several members of the β-glucan superfamily were also identified as competitors of IgA2 transcytosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This adds to the multiple functions of carbohydrates in SIgA including, for example, neutralization of bacterial toxins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Perrier1">[39]</xref> and interaction with commensal bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mathias1">[40]</xref>.</p>
<p>Having unraveled the structural features responsible for the selective transport of SIgA in the reconstituted FAE model, we sought to identity the receptor(s) by which SIgA is taken up and transported by M cells. The use of blocking Abs against known IgA receptors including CD89 and CD71 did not prevent SIgA2 reverse transcytosis. These data, combined with the sufficient role of the Cα1 region of IgA2 in M-cell-mediated reverse transcytosis, led to the conclusion that no other known IgA receptor (pIgR, Fcα/μ receptor, and the asialoglycoprotein receptor) was involved in the process. Given the established involvement of Sia and β-glucan moieties, we speculated that the IgA2 receptor of M cells is a glucan- and/or Sia-receptor. Our work provides evidence of the presence of Dectin-1 on M-like cells, together with its involvement in reverse transcytosis of SIgA2. Dectin-1 is a type II transmembrane protein of the C-type lectin family, expressed by myeloid phagocytes (macrophages, DCs and neutrophils), which recognizes β-glucans in fungal cell walls and transduces signals triggering phagocytosis and the production of reactive oxygen species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Herre1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Weck1">[42]</xref>. In contrast, as recognition of soluble ligands by Dectin-1 does not lead to inappropriate activation signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Goodridge1">[35]</xref>, its presence on M cells is consistent with simple SIgA capture and internalization.</p>
<p>Co-operation between Fc galactosylation and Dectin-1–inducing anti-inflammatory activities suggests that Dectin-1 is capable of working in combination with other partners in the cell plasma membrane. In view of the involvement of Sia in IgA2 reverse transcytosis via M cells, we investigated whether a Siglec receptor could serve this function. The majority of Siglecs, including CD33-related Siglecs like Siglec-5, appears to be naturally masked owing to cis-interactions with adjacent Sia. Unmasking of Siglecs can also occur in some cases by cellular activation or by exposure to sialidases. The unmasked Siglec would then be capable of <italic>de novo</italic> interactions with surrounding ligands in the environment. This could result in increased interactions with exogenous materials including glycosylated SIgA. Such a scenario of Siglec serving as a co-receptor has been reported in the case of HIV-1 entry mediated by CD4 in macrophages.</p>
<p>Preparation of murine duodenal ligated loops validated the results generated in the <italic>in vitro</italic> model of human FAE. This method has proven valuable in documenting the interaction of mouse IgA with PP M cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Mantis1">[4]</xref>. Tissue immunolabeling both confirmed the transport of SIgA2 by UEA-1<sup>+</sup> and GP2<sup>+</sup> M cells, and that of murine SIgA by Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g007">Figure 7a and b</xref>). However, the absence of cross-reactivity of the anti-human CD170 mAb prevented us from confirming the role of Siglec-5 in the reverse transcytosis of SIgA in mice. Consistent with the <italic>in vitro</italic> data gathered in the model based on human cells, human biopsy analyses resulted in specific co-localization between IgA2-GFP and Dectin-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g007">Figure 7d</xref>) or Siglec-5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g007">Figure 7e</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, oral immunization of wt, Dectin-1 KO, or chimeric mice with p24-SIgA complexes unambiguously demonstrated that reverse transcytosis of SIgA is strictly dependent on Dectin-1 expressed on M cells. The further confirmation of the essential role of Dectin-1 in the <italic>in vivo</italic> context provides an explanation to the uptake of antigen-bearing SIgA by M cells, a feature resulting in systemic and mucosal immune responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Corthsy1">[43]</xref>. The lack of a murine functional ortholog of human Siglec-5 prevented us from confirming the associated role of Siglec-5 in SIgA reverse transcytosis <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Cornish1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Zhang1">[46]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, the uptake of murine SIgA by murine CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> DCs present in the GALT could also be documented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g010">Figure 10b</xref>). In the SED region, CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> DCs play a central role in antigen sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Niess1">[47]</xref>. In contrast to CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs, CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> cells represent a nonmigratory gut-resident population, which displays poor T-cell stimulatory capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Bogunovic1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Schulz1">[49]</xref>. In contrast to CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs that serve classical DC functions and initiate adaptive immune responses in local lymph nodes, CX3CR1<sup>+</sup> populations might modulate immune responses directly in the mucosa and serve as a first line barrier against invading enteropathogens. This supports the low activation properties of SIgA targeting antigen to DCs in the SED region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Favre1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Boullier1">[51]</xref>. A recent study has shown that small intestine goblet cells function as passages delivering the low molecular weight soluble dextran (10 kDa) to CD103<sup>+</sup> DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-McDole1">[52]</xref>, which promote IgA production, imprint gut homing on lymphocytes, and induce the development of regulatory T cells. As HIVp24 is administered in the form of a complex with SIgA (400 kDa), we believe that this pathway need additional characterization before it can be considered as operative for large molecules.</p>
<p>Transcytosis across M cells is known to enable the selective transport of particulate antigens in the absence of any assessable damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Owen1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Neutra1">[54]</xref>. This holds true for soluble SIgA, as the transcytosed Ab released by M cells in the human <italic>in vitro</italic> and murine <italic>in vivo</italic> models was still able to specifically target cells expressing DC-SIGN in the basolateral environment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g010">Figure 10a/c/d</xref>). In mucosal tissues such as the rectum, uterus, and cervix, DC-SIGN is abundantly expressed by DCs present in the lamina propria and PPs, further substantiating the importance of the localization of DC-SIGN<sup>+</sup> DCs as a first line of defense against viruses and pathogens. Delivery in the form of SIgA-based immune complexes may thus combine the onset of limited immune responses, which translates into the absence of spurious inflammatory reactions. Moreover, this receptor, by binding to ICAM-3, favors the generation of antigen-specific suppressive CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells, which produce IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Li1">[55]</xref>, a cytokine that intervenes in both intestinal homeostasis and the production of local IgA.</p>
<p>This work defines Dectin-1 expressed on the surface of M cells as a receptor involved in SIgA reverse transcytosis both <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. Besides bringing new information on the mechanism involved in SIgA retro-transport, deciphering the identity of such receptors may lead to the further development of mucosal vaccines targeting M cells. In future work, it will be critical to test the expression of Dectin-1 on other mucous membranes such as nasal/bronchial, endocervical, or buccal mucosa order to evaluate the broad applicability of this finding to active and passive immunization. As a perspective to future works, one can argue that intestinal villous M cells serving as an antigen gateway for the sampling of gut bacteria and inducing Ag-specific immune responses in a PP-independent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001658-Jang1">[56]</xref> may contribute to SIgA reverse transcytosis as well.</p>

Several major changes were made and are listed below. Inverted Transwell polycarbonate inserts (12 wells, pore diameter of 3.0 µm, Corning) were coated with Matrigel, a basement membrane matrix (BD Biosciences) prepared in pure DMEM to a final protein concentration of 100 µg/ml for 1 h at room temperature. The coating solution was removed and inverted inserts washed with 300 µl of DMEM. Caco-2 cells (3×10<sup>5</sup>), resuspended in 300 µl of supplemented DMEM, were seeded on the lower insert side and cultured overnight. The inserts were then inverted and placed in a 12-well culture dish and kept for 9 d. Raji B cells (5×10<sup>5</sup>), resuspended in supplemented DMEM, were then added to the basolateral compartment of the Caco-2 cells, and co-cultures were maintained for 5 d. Mono-cultures of Caco-2 cells, cultivated as above but without the Raji B cells, were used as controls. Finally, the inserts were inverted in six-well plates, and a piece of silicon tubing (14×20 mm, Labomoderne) was placed on the basolateral side of each insert. Cell monolayer integrity, both in mono- and co-cultures, was controlled by measurement of TEER using an Endohm tissue resistance chamber (Endohm-12, World Precision Instruments) connected to a Millicell-ERS Ohmmeter (Millipore). The resistance of medium alone (9 Ω×cm<sup>2</sup>) was considered as background resistance and subtracted from each TEER value.

<title>Antibody Production</title>
<p>Light and heavy chain encoding genes from a human TNF-alpha–specific IgA Ab were cloned in a single vector (pGTRIO) designed for efficient Ab expression in HEK293 and CHO cell lines. pGTRIO is a derivative of pVITRO2 (Cayla-InvivoGen, Toulouse, France), a multigenic plasmid that contains two distinct transcription units. In pGTRIO, the antibiotic resistance gene is under the control of the EF1 alpha/HTLV promoter combined with the CMV enhancer that together constitutes a third transcription unit with the EF1 polyadenylation signal. The kappa constant region was cloned downstream of the FerL promoter together with the CMV enhancer, and the heavy chain constant regions were cloned downstream of the FerH promoter together with the human aldolase A enhancer. Unique restriction sites were introduced upstream of each constant region in order to allow the cloning of the variable region as SgrAI-BsiWI and AgeI-NheI fragments for VL and VH, respectively. All variable heavy chain regions were fused at the C-terminal end of secreted luciferase. CHO cells were transfected with pGTRIO constructs using the LyoVec system (Cayla-InvivoGen) in accordance with the manufacturer's instructions. Stable transfectants were selected in antibiotic-containing medium and screened for the production of Abs with a neutralizing activity on the HEK-Blue TNF-alpha/IL1-beta reporter cells (Cayla-InvivoGen) stimulated with TNF-alpha. IgA preparations were purified using Kappa affinity chromatography, IgG preparations were purified using protein G affinity chromatography, and IgE preparations were purified using protein L affinity chromatography. Ig-Luc constructs specific for TNF-alpha maintained their ability to block the cytokine, indicating proper assembly and folding. The following Abs were obtained by this method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g002">Figure 2</xref>): human m-IgA2 (monomer); human GFP-IgA2 (monomer); human d-IgA2 (+ J chain - dimer); murine m-IgA (monomer); human IgE; human IgG1; human m-IgA1 (monomer); human m-IgA2 G0 (no glycosylation – monomer); human m-IgA2 G1 (1 glycosylation (Asn<sup>263</sup>)- monomer); human m-IgA2 G2 (2 glycosylations (Asn<sup>263</sup> and Asn<sup>469</sup>) – monomer); human m-IgA2 dPB (without basal part – monomer); human m-IgA2 dCα3 (without basal part and Cα3 – monomer); human m-IgA2 dCα2/3 (without basal part, Cα3 and Cα2 – monomer); human m-IgA2 Cα1 G0 (only Cα1 without glycosylation); and human m-IgA2 Cα1 (only Cα1 with glycosylation). M-IgA2 was desialylated and deglycosylated with neuraminidase and PNGase, respectively (Enzymatic CarboRelease Kit, QA-Bio). Purity and assembly of the Abs were controlled by SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001658-g002">Figure 2b/c</xref>).

During this time and throughout the remainder of the experiment, animals were also maintained on sterile food and acidified in sterile water (containing 0.004% HCl). Animals received two doses of full body irradiation at 5 Gy (2×500 rads). Each dose was separated by a 3 h interval to limit gastrointestinal problems. Irradiated mice were returned to individually ventilated cages for 24 h. Bone marrow was isolated from the femurs and tibia of donor Dectin-1 KO and wt C57BL/6 males under sterile conditions in the absence of red blood cell lysis. Nucleated cells were counted on a haemocytometer. Irradiated Dectin-1 KO mice each received 2×10<sup>6</sup> total nucleated bone marrow cells from wt C57BL/6 mice intravenously via the lateral tail vein. The phenotype of these mice, named chimeric-KO:wt, is thus wt at the systemic level and Dectin-1 KO at the mucosal level. Irradiated wt C57BL/6 mice were similarly injected with the same number of Dectin-1 KO donor cells. The phenotype of these mice, referred to as chimeric-wt:KO, is Dectin-1 KO at the systemic level and wt at the local level. Animals were maintained in individually ventilated cages as described above for a further 6 wk. Five weeks after bone marrow injections, 50 µl of tail vein blood was taken from each animal to characterize the cell phenotype, and red blood cells lysed for 2 min at room temperature in 1× Pharmlyse buffer.

The tubing was introduced at a fixed distance of 1.8 cm from the incisors. Immunizations consisted of three administrations of 100 µl at 1-wk intervals. Dectin-1 KO (<italic>n</italic> = 5), chimeric-KO:wt (<italic>n</italic> = 5), and chimeric-wt:KO (<italic>n</italic> = 5) mice were immunized with 100 µg of HIVp24-SIgA per administration.</p>

<title>Measurement of HIVp24-specific IgG and IgA Abs</title>
<p>Serum and feces samples were recovered 1 wk after the last immunization. Five fresh feces were collected from each animal. Feces were incubated with Halt Protease Inhibitor Cocktail (Thermo Scientific), centrifuged at 16,000× <italic>g</italic>, and stored at −20°C until use. Specific Abs against HIVp24 were measured using a quantitative ELISA. Maxisorp 96-well plates were coated with either 50 µl of HIVp24 Ag solution (5 µg/ml in sterile PBS) or 50 µl of a 1/3,200 dilution of an equal mixture of anti-mouse Ig kappa and lambda light chain–specific mAbs (Serotec), and then incubated O/N at 4°C. Murine IgG or IgA immunoglobulins (Igs) (Southern Biotech) were used as standards. Bound or captured Igs were detected by incubation with HRP-conjugated goat anti-mouse (IgG), while IgA was detected using biotinylated goat anti-mouse IgA (Southern Biotech) followed by streptavidin-HRP (Amersham). Results are given as the means of concentrations ± SEM.</p>
