      <abstract>
        <p>In the study of circadian rhythms, it has been a puzzle how a limited number of circadian clock genes can control diverse aspects of physiology. Here we investigate circadian gene expression genome-wide using larval zebrafish as a model system. We made use of a spatial gene expression atlas to investigate the expression of circadian genes in various tissues and cell types. Comparison of genome-wide circadian gene expression data between zebrafish and mouse revealed a nearly anti-phase relationship and allowed us to detect novel evolutionarily conserved circadian genes in vertebrates. We identified three groups of zebrafish genes with distinct responses to light entrainment: fast light-induced genes, slow light-induced genes, and dark-induced genes. Our computational analysis of the circadian gene regulatory network revealed several transcription factors (TFs) involved in diverse aspects of circadian physiology through transcriptional cascade. Of these, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor a (<italic>mitfa</italic>), a dark-induced TF, mediates a circadian rhythm of melanin synthesis, which may be involved in zebrafish's adaptation to daily light cycling. Our study describes a systematic method to discover previously unidentified TFs involved in circadian physiology in complex organisms.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>For most animals whose lives are dependent on the sun, circadian clocks govern their daily behaviors and physiology. In different animals, novel functions under the circadian clock's control can evolve as adaptations to their specific environment. A zebrafish demonstrates a remarkably high level of interplay between external light and its internal circadian clock due to its transparent nature. In a genome-wide study, we identified a large number of circadian oscillating genes as well as genes whose expression is highly sensitive to the light or dark in zebrafish. Our computational analysis of gene regulatory networks revealed a number of transcription factors (TFs) that mediate novel circadian functions. We investigated one example in depth, a key TF that relays the control of the circadian clock to the enzymes synthesizing melanin in a dark-induced pathway thus causing the daily change of pigmentation in zebrafish. This dark-induced circadian melanogenesis can lead to an anticipatory change in zebrafish skin color allowing zebrafish to adapt to its environment. This mechanism allows zebrafish to better evade predators and effectively adjust its daily light-sensitivity in the pigment cells. Our study provides an excellent example of how the circadian clock is adapted in a specific organism to control its behavior, thus enabling evolutionary adaptation to the organism's ecological niche.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The circadian rhythm evolved as an adaptation to the Earth's daily light cycle. In complex animals, each tissue or cell type contains a functional clock that is controlled by the central pacemaker. In mammals, the suprachiasmatic nucleus (SCN) in the hypothalamus acts as the central circadian pacemaker that coordinates most aspects of behavior and physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Lee1">[1]</xref>. In lower vertebrates, circadian pacemakers are also present in the eyes and the pineal gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Menaker1">[2]</xref>. It is not surprising that circadian rhythm controls physiological processes universal to all tissues such as metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Huang1">[3]</xref> and cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Khapre1">[4]</xref>. However, tissue-specific functions are also controlled by the circadian clock. Meta-analysis of all existing mammalian circadian gene expression studies indicates that there are thousands of genes showing circadian expression in a given tissue, although only a small number of circadian genes are expressed in more than one tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>This raises the question as to how genome-wide tissue-specific circadian gene expression is regulated? A simple answer is that all circadian gene expression is entirely regulated by core circadian genes. However, there are only a few transcription factors (TFs) within the core circadian circuit, including <italic>Arntl</italic>/<italic>Clock</italic> (<italic>Bmal1</italic>/<italic>Clock</italic>) and <italic>Bhlhe40</italic>/<italic>41</italic> (<italic>Dec1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>) (binding the E-BOX), <italic>Rora</italic>/<italic>b</italic>/<italic>c</italic> and <italic>Nr1d1</italic>/<italic>2</italic> (<italic>Rev-erb α</italic>/<italic>β</italic>) (binding RRE), and <italic>Dbp</italic>/<italic>Hlf</italic>/<italic>Tef</italic> and <italic>Nfil3</italic> (binding the D-BOX), each of which either activates or represses target genes in mammals. Recent ChIP-seq experiments have revealed 2,049 genome-wide binding sites for <italic>Bmal1</italic> in mouse liver targeting only 16% of the circadian oscillating genes that are expressed in liver and are represented in the circadian gene database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Rey1">[6]</xref>. From this we can conclude that, circadian oscillations in gene expression in different tissues are unlikely to all be under the direct regulation of known core circadian TFs, but rather they are likely to be regulated by other TFs that are themselves regulated by core circadian genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Chen1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Sancar1">[8]</xref>. In particular, tissue-specific circadian functions might be regulated by tissue-specific TFs relaying signals from core circadian genes.</p>
      <p>Typically, circadian gene expression studies are conducted in a few selected tissues at a time. In mouse, the most studied circadian model in vertebrates, genome-wide circadian gene expression has been studied in only 14 tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>. An additional difficulty is that many tissues or cell types, with potential importance to circadian rhythm are difficult to access without specialized techniques. For example, in Drosophila, Kula-Eversole et al. have studied circadian gene expression in PDF-expressing ventral lateral neurons: s-LNvs and l-LNvs and observed marked differences with those in fly head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-KulaEversole1">[9]</xref>. In this study, we attempt to circumvent these difficulties by a genome wide analysis of circadian gene expression in whole larval zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>). The zebrafish larva is an established model for the study of animal development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Kimmel1">[10]</xref>. Decades of gene expression studies in zebrafish, most of which used <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization (ISH) provide a rich resource of spatial information on gene expression (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://zfin.org" xlink:type="simple">http://zfin.org</ext-link>). Therefore, circadian oscillating genes identified in this study can be mapped to specific tissues and cell types using a spatial expression atlas.</p>
      <p>We have identified a number of tissue-specific TFs that were not previously known to be involved in circadian rhythm. Through the analysis of gene regulatory networks, we identified a novel circadian TF, microphthalmia-associated transcription factor a (<italic>mitfa</italic>), controlling circadian melanin synthesis in pigment cells. <italic>mitfa</italic> shows strong circadian rhythm in expression and is dark-induced. This observation lead us to hypothesize that melanin synthesis itself is similarly circadian controlled. We confirmed this experimentally and speculate that a dark-adaptation pathway is involved. Circadian- regulated melanin synthesis is likely to be crucial to species, including fish and reptiles, that change skin color to evade predators in response to the daily light-cycle. Our study highlights the possibility that different organisms may employ the circadian rhythm differently to control their specific behavior allowing adaptation to their ecological niche.</p>

        <title>Larval zebrafish exhibit global circadian gene expression</title>
        <p>We monitored the circadian behavior of larval zebrafish under an infrared behavioral monitoring platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s016">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Wild-type (WT) larval zebrafish were raised in 14 h∶10 h light/dark (LD) cycle from birth. Starting at 5 days post-fertilization (dpf), they were monitored under either LD or constant dark (DD) conditions. In both conditions, the fish demonstrated robust circadian changes in their locomotor activities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) implying that circadian activities have been fully established at this stage of zebrafish development. The amplitude of oscillation was significantly lower in DD larvae compared to that in LD larvae indicating strong dependence of circadian activities on light entrainment. We subsequently collected larval zebrafish starting at 5 dpf every 4 hours for a period of 48 hours under both LD and DD conditions. The whole-genome transcriptome profiles of the animals were assayed on Agilent zebrafish microarrays.</p>
        <p>Circadian oscillating genes were identified using Fisher's g test, and their circadian phases were determined by fitting to cosine functions with shifting phases (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We identified 2,856 circadian oscillating genes in both LD and DD conditions with an overall False Discovery Rate (FDR)≤5% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s006">Table S1</xref>). These account for over 17% of expressed genes in larval zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We thus refer to these zebrafish circadian oscillating genes in both LD and DD as “zebrafish circadian oscillating genes” (ZCOGs). The mean circadian phases under LD and DD are used to represent the circadian phases of ZCOGs. This dataset displays a prominent bimodal distribution with peaks at CT2 (Circadian Time 2; CT0 is lights-on and CT14 is lights-off) and CT16 corresponding to 2 hours after lights-on and lights-off respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We annotated the biological functions of ZCOGs using the Gene Ontology (GO) and KEGG databases. ZCOGs are enriched in GO terms related to light and abiotic stimuli and transporter functions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s007">Table S2</xref>). As expected, circadian rhythm is the most significantly enriched KEGG pathway among ZCOGs. We then used a sliding window approach to identify the specific time window when the biological functions of ZCOGs are enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Components of the lysosome are enriched around CT16, proteasome components are enriched around CT20, and those involved in ribosome biogenesis are enriched around CT0. We compiled a spatial gene expression atlas from annotations in the ZFIN database, which contains expression information for 96,189 records encompassing 6,429 genes in 1,173 tissues or cell types in larval zebrafish. A total of 1,310 ZCOGs were mapped to the tissues or cell types of expression and we computed the enrichment of circadian oscillating genes in these tissues. We found that ZCOGs are most enriched in retina photoreceptive layer, intestine bulb, and retina.</p>
        <p>Zebrafish homologs of almost all known mammalian core circadian genes are represented among ZCOGs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002940-t001">Table 1</xref>), indicating that the basic circadian circuit is highly conserved between zebrafish and mammals. To search for novel circadian genes conserved between mammals and zebrafish, we obtained an extended list of mouse circadian genes oscillating in at least six tissues from our previously constructed circadian gene databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>. The circadian phases of these genes have very low variability across different mouse tissues. We identified 74 ZCOGs that are homologs of 48 mouse circadian genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s008">Table S3</xref>). Many circadian genes in zebrafish have undergone gene duplications including <italic>arntl1</italic> (<italic>bmal1</italic>), <italic>clock</italic>, and <italic>per1</italic>. Duplicated circadian genes tend to have similar circadian phases. In addition to commonly known core circadian clock genes, heat/cold shock proteins, purine nucleoside phosphorylases, and ubiquitins are also among the conserved circadian oscillating genes between mouse and zebrafish. Interestingly, we observed a nearly anti-phase (9 hour shift) relationship between zebrafish and mouse among conserved circadian genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Such phase shift could arise from different entrainment conditions between zebrafish and mouse (14∶10 LD for zebrafish and 12∶12 LD for mouse) and other species differences such as activity patterns.</p>

        <title>Light entrainment influences circadian gene expression</title>
        <p>In larval zebrafish, the amplitude of circadian activity is significantly reduced under DD compared to that under LD conditions. Using the same false discovery rate (FDR) parameters, the number of circadian oscillating genes under DD is also significantly lower than that under LD. To examine the effects of light entrainment on circadian gene expression, we first compared the phases and amplitudes of circadian oscillations of ZCOGs between DD and LD conditions. Among 2,856 ZCOGs, the circadian phases are highly consistent between DD and LD (circular correlation coefficient r = 0.93) with only 169 (6%) ZCOGs showing phase shifts of more than four hours. In contrast, 233 ZCOGs oscillate at reduced amplitudes with only 21 ZCOGs oscillating at increased amplitudes under DD compared to LD. Thus light entrainment tends to enhance the amplitudes of circadian oscillation of gene expression.</p>
        <p>Next, we searched for genes having reduced amplitudes as a consequence of either decreased peak levels or elevated trough levels in DD compared to LD. To include the genes that might have lost rhythmicity under DD, we examined 3,677 LD oscillating genes (FDR≤10%) regardless of their rhythmicity under DD. Among them, we identified 464 genes showing decreased peaks and 113 genes showing elevated troughs in DD compared to LD (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We defined 366 peak decreased genes with LD circadian phases lying in the light period as “light-induced” because their expression increases in the light period in LD but remains at low level in DD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g002">Figure 2A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s009">Table S4</xref>). Similarly, 50 trough-increased genes with LD circadian phases lying in the dark period were defined as “dark-induced genes”. Furthermore, we observed that the LD circadian phases of light-induced genes were predominantly distributed around CT5. The expression of these genes increases rapidly after lights-on and reaches a peak after 5 hours in LD. Thus we defined 197 light-induced genes with LD circadian phases between CT2 and CT8 as “fast light-induced genes”. This group includes known light-sensitive genes (e.g. <italic>per2</italic>, <italic>cry5</italic>, <italic>cry-dash</italic>, and <italic>tefa</italic>). It also contains genes showing significantly enriched expression in epiphysis and the retinal photoreceptive layer (e.g. arrestin 3 (<italic>arr3a</italic>/<italic>b</italic>) and interphotoreceptor retinoid-binding protein (<italic>irbp</italic>)). The remaining light-induced genes show a slow increase in expression during the light period, reaching a peak before lights-off in LD. Accordingly, they were defined as “slow light-induced genes”. This group includes key circadian genes (e.g. <italic>cry2a</italic>/<italic>b</italic>, <italic>arntl1b</italic>, and <italic>nfil3-5</italic>). The expression of dark-induced genes is repressed during the light period but increases in the dark period reaching peak level after lights-off. Among the dark-induced genes are melatonin synthesizing enzyme (<italic>aanat1</italic>), dopamine D4 receptor (<italic>drd4a</italic>) and two genes related to pigmentation (<italic>mitfa</italic> and <italic>slc24a5</italic>). In short, there are complex, dynamic responses to light entrainment during circadian gene expression.</p>

        <p>In another set of experiments, we collected larval zebrafish fertilized and raised under either DD or LL (constant light) conditions and exposed them to light or dark, respectively for 20 hours starting at 5 dpf. The expression of one representative gene from each of the previously described groups was measured by quantitative real-time PCR (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s016">Text S1</xref>): <italic>per2</italic> from the fast light-induced genes, <italic>cry2a</italic> from the slow light-induced genes, <italic>aanat1</italic> from the dark-induced genes and the <italic>clock</italic> gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, primers used for real-time PCR are in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s010">Table S5</xref>). The first few hours after light/dark exposure were sampled more frequently. Without light/dark exposure, the circadian clock was desynchronized in animals kept in DD or LL conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Kaneko1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Dekens1">[12]</xref>. The expression levels of <italic>per2</italic> and <italic>cry2a</italic> are significantly higher in LL than DD and <italic>aanat1</italic> was expressed at a significantly lower level in LL than DD whereas the expression level of the <italic>clock</italic> gene showed no significant difference between LL and DD. After light exposure, the expression of <italic>per2</italic> increases rapidly and reaches a peak after 3 hours whereas, after dark exposure, it decreases rapidly within 3 hours. In contrast, <italic>cry2a</italic> expression increases slowly after light exposure and decreases slowly after dark exposure only reaching its peak or trough about 12 hours after lights-on or lights-off, respectively. The expression of <italic>aanat1</italic> increases quickly upon dark exposure and drops just as rapidly after light exposure. The expression of <italic>clock</italic> shows a slow increase of expression reaching its peak around 12 hours after light exposure and an even later increase around 20 hours after dark exposure. These results indicate that the endogenous circadian clock has been resynchronized after the exposures and may regulate the induction and repression of slow light-induced genes and dark-induced genes.</p>

        <title>A transcriptional cascade regulates diverse circadian functions</title>
        <p>To understand what drives the circadian oscillation of ZCOGs, we developed a comparative genomics pipeline to predict TF binding sites for zebrafish genes. Our pipeline uses orthologous promoter sequences from teleost fish genomes, including zebrafish, fugu, medaka, stickleback, and Tetraodon (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Our ZCOGs consist of 140 TFs, including novel circadian TFs in addition to the known core circadian TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s011">Table S6</xref>). We focused on the 54 circadian TFs with known DNA-binding motifs in the TRANSFAC database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Wingender1">[13]</xref> for promoter analysis.</p>
        <p>Because the circadian phases of ZCOGs show a bimodal distribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), we divided ZCOGs into two groups, the first with peak times within CT22-CT10, and the second with peak times within CT10-CT22. In the first group, we identified E-BOX as the most enriched promoter motif (p value = 2.5×10<sup>−10</sup>, odds ratio = 2.3), while RRE is significantly enriched in promoters from the second group of genes (p value = 1.3×10<sup>−5</sup>, odds ratio = 2.0). This is consistent with observations in mouse except that the enriched phases are also shifted by about 10 hours following the same phase-shift of homologous TFs in zebrafish and mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>. We then used a sliding window approach to identify the specific time window when the circadian phases of circadian TF targets are enriched (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s012">Table S7</xref>). In addition to E-BOX and RRE, we also observed that targets of <italic>ppargc1b</italic>, <italic>yy1a</italic>/<italic>b</italic>, <italic>atf</italic>/<italic>creb</italic>, <italic>hnf1a</italic>, <italic>foxo3b</italic>, and <italic>myog</italic> were enriched at a specific time window (p&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g003">Figure 3</xref>). There are varying delays between phases of TFs and enriched phases of their targets.

        <p>To assist sequence-based TF-target prediction, we generated co-expression groups of zebrafish genes using zebrafish microarray data available in the Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO) database (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and mapped ZCOGs to these groups. By making use of the fact that co-expression often indicates co-regulation by TFs, we were able to identify the TF motifs enriched in the promoters of the co-expression groups and their associated circadian TFs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s013">Table S8</xref>). A group consisting of mostly mitochondrial genes is enriched with ZCOGs and their circadian phases are around CT0. The genes in this group are predicted to be regulated by <italic>yy1a</italic>. Consistent with our GO analysis, proteasome components form a co-expression group having circadian phases around CT18, although no known TF motifs are enriched in the group. Other co-expression groups regulated by circadian TFs include heat shock proteins regulated by <italic>hsf2</italic>, liver-specific genes regulated by <italic>hnf1a</italic>, and genes in visual processing regulated by <italic>crx</italic> (core-rod homeobox).</p>
        <p><italic>Hnf1a</italic> is known to be a liver-specific TF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Gong1">[14]</xref> and expression of <italic>crx</italic> is restricted to retinal photoreceptor cells and the epiphysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Liu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Halpern1">[16]</xref>. Using the spatial gene expression atlas in zebrafish, we searched for tissue-specific TFs among ZCOGs by requiring that the predicted targets of the TFs are predominantly expressed in the same tissue as the TFs themselves. We systematically identified 11 tissue-specific circadian TFs. They include several well-known tissue-specific TFs: <italic>mitfa</italic> in pigment cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Lister1">[17]</xref>, <italic>cdx1b</italic> in the intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Flores1">[18]</xref>, <italic>ppargc1b</italic> in the liver, <italic>mef2a</italic> in heart and muscle tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Wang1">[19]</xref>, <italic>pax6a</italic> in nerve tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Kleinjan1">[20]</xref>, <italic>smad1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Hami1">[21]</xref>, <italic>smad3a</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Smith1">[22]</xref>, and <italic>myog</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Du1">[23]</xref> in muscle tissue. A less well-known tissue-specific circadian TF, <italic>maf</italic>, is expressed in the lens vesicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Reza1">[24]</xref>. There is evidence that <italic>maf</italic> plays an important role in lens development and in lens fiber cells in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Ogino1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, two key circadian TFs appear to be tissue-specific: <italic>nr1d1</italic> and <italic>rorab</italic> are expressed in epiphysis and retina, while their predicted targets show enriched expression in the same tissues. Notably, <italic>nr1d1</italic> plays an important role in photoreceptor development and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Mollema1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>From this data we constructed a gene regulatory network of circadian TFs to depict how they regulate each other and how circadian oscillating genes in specific tissues are regulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In this network, circadian-oscillating TFs were grouped by TF-motif and motif-target relationships, where TF-motif relationships were obtained from the TRANSFAC database, while motif-target relationships were predicted through promoter analysis in our comparative genomics pipeline (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). This approach successfully recapitulated the known core transcriptional feedback loop in circadian clock regulation: E-BOX binding TFs <italic>arntl</italic>/<italic>clock</italic> regulate <italic>nr1d1</italic> and <italic>rorab</italic>, which in turn regulate <italic>arntl</italic> through RRE. Most circadian TFs are directly regulated by the circadian clock via known circadian <italic>cis</italic>-elements. For example, <italic>mef2a</italic>, <italic>hsf2</italic>, <italic>tef</italic>, <italic>bhlhe40</italic>/<italic>41</italic> (<italic>dec1</italic>/<italic>2</italic>), <italic>tfcp2l1</italic>, <italic>foxo3b</italic>, and <italic>ahr1a</italic> via E-BOX, <italic>myog</italic>, <italic>nfil3</italic>, <italic>atf4b1</italic> via RRE and <italic>yy1a</italic> and <italic>smad3a</italic> via D-BOX. The remaining TFs are indirect targets of core circadian TFs via further transcriptional cascades.

        <title>Circadian control of melanogenesis is mediated by <italic>mitfa</italic></title>
        <p>In order to show that TF-mediated circadian control can have novel functional consequences, we focused on <italic>mitfa</italic>, one of our identified circadian TFs and the most enriched TF in the pigment cells. It is also a dark-induced gene. The mammalian homolog of <italic>mitfa</italic> is <italic>Mitf</italic>, which is a key TF controlling melanogenesis in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Steingrimsson1">[27]</xref>. In zebrafish, <italic>mitfa</italic> is specifically expressed in pigment cells and retinal pigment epithelium (RPE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Lister2">[28]</xref>. Notably, <italic>mitfb</italic>, a gene duplicate of <italic>mitfa</italic>, does not show circadian rhythm in our microarray result. To validate the function of <italic>mitfa</italic> in zebrafish, we generated <italic>mitfa</italic> MO knock-down zebrafish larvae. The <italic>mitfa</italic> morphants lost melanin production in melanocytes of the fish trunk and had smaller eyes compared to WT and control morphants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s002">Figure S2</xref>). It has been reported that <italic>Mitf</italic> directly regulates <italic>Tyr</italic>, <italic>Tyrp1</italic>, and <italic>Dct</italic>, genes encoding three key enzymes involved in melanin synthesis, in addition to other genes involved in melanogenesis in mouse and human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Shibahara1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yasumoto1">[30]</xref>. In our study, <italic>tyrp1b</italic> (the zebrafish homolog of <italic>Tyrp1</italic>), <italic>slc24a5</italic> (another gene known to be involved in melanogenesis) and <italic>dct</italic> all showed circadian peaks around CT20 in LD, reduced oscillation amplitudes and elevated troughs in DD, similar to <italic>mitfa</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s003">Figure S3</xref>). We then measured the mRNA levels of these genes in <italic>mitfa</italic> morphants by real-time PCR. All showed reduced expression in <italic>mitf</italic>a morphants compared to WT and control morphants, suggesting that they are also <italic>mitfa</italic> targets in zebrafish.</p>
        <p>We reasoned that the circadian oscillation of <italic>mitfa</italic> expression implies that melanin synthesis also oscillates on a daily basis. To experimentally demonstrate the circadian oscillation of melanin synthesis, we first measured the areas of melanocytes in the head regions of larval zebrafish under LD beginning at 4 dpf (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and found a significant circadian rhythm in pigmentation with a peak around CT0 (p&lt;0.001, Fisher's g test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Then we quantified total melanin concentration using a melanin assay in whole larval zebrafish. The melanin concentration showed a strong circadian rhythm with a circadian phase also around CT0 in LD (p&lt;0.002, Fisher's g test after detrend, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) starting at 4 dpf, while the absolute amount of melanin increased during development. To determine the effect of <italic>clock</italic> on pigment synthesis, we examined the melanin concentration rhythm in <italic>clock</italic> morphants. The melanin concentration showed a significantly reduced circadian rhythm in LD compared to control morphants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Melanin oscillations were not significant in DD in either <italic>clock</italic> morphants or controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Similarly, the amplitude of <italic>mitfa</italic> expression was significantly reduced by over 30% in <italic>clock</italic> morphants in LD compared to WT and controls, and oscillations are nearly absent in DD. From this we conclude that the circadian control of melanogenesis is mediated by <italic>mitfa</italic> in zebrafish larvae.</p>

        <p>The melanogenesis signaling pathway has been well-characterized in mammals. Alpha-melanocyte stimulating hormone (α-MSH) activates melanocortin receptor in pigment cells leading to the up-regulation of <italic>Mitf</italic> through cAMP signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Wagle1">[31]</xref>. Consistent with this, we identified a conserved CRE in the promoter of <italic>mitfa</italic> in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In mammals corticotropin releasing hormone (CRH) secreted from the paraventricular nucleus (PVN) of the hypothalamus affects the secretion of α-MSH in the pituitary gland thus forming a hypothalamus-pituitary-melanocyte (HPM) axis. In our study, the mRNA level of <italic>crh</italic> shows circadian oscillation at CT9 in LD and reduced amplitude in DD. To examine if the HPM axis controls the expression of <italic>mitfa</italic> in zebrafish, we treated zebrafish larvae with the Crh receptor 1 antagonist antalarmin. We observed significant reduction of <italic>mitfa</italic> expression upon antalarmin treatment at CT0 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s016">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Thus, it appears as though the circadian oscillation of <italic>mitfa</italic> may be regulated by the <italic>crh</italic> signaling cascade through the HPM axis.</p>
        <p>The <italic>mitfa</italic> gene is involved in the early development of the neural crest from which pigment cells are derived <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Johnson1">[32]</xref>. Multiple neural cell types are also derived from the neural crest cells and <italic>mitfa</italic>'s control of melanogenesis is likely to be only one aspect of its function. To investigate the broader regulatory functions of <italic>mitfa</italic> in zebrafish early development, we collected <italic>mitfa</italic> morphants together with WT and control morphants at 48 hpf (hours post-fertilization) and 50 hpf for microarray experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s016">Text S1</xref>). We identified 555 down-regulated genes and 691 up-regulated genes in <italic>mitfa</italic> morphants, compared to WT and control larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s014">Table S9</xref>). In addition to <italic>tyr</italic>, <italic>tyrp1b</italic>, <italic>dct</italic>, and <italic>slc24a5</italic>, we also identified <italic>tcf7l2</italic>, <italic>lef1</italic>, <italic>camk2d2</italic>, and <italic>slc45a2</italic> which are also involved in melanogenesis, as being down-regulated in <italic>mitfa</italic> morphants. Mapping of the down-regulated genes onto the spatial gene expression atlas revealed that the retina is the most common tissue for their expression. This is consistent with the small eye phenotype of <italic>mitfa</italic> morphants. Genes involved in brain development and the <italic>wnt</italic> signaling pathway are enriched in the down-regulated genes. Of the <italic>mitfa</italic>-affected genes represented by ZCOGs, we found 87 ZCOGs down-regulated and 213 ZCOGs up-regulated in the <italic>mitfa</italic> knock-down. Among these, two TFs, <italic>six3a</italic> and <italic>vsx1</italic>, are involved in retina development and both show circadian peaks at CT16. We conclude that, in addition to mediating circadian melanogenesis, <italic>mitfa</italic> is also likely to mediate circadian control of early development in other tissues such as the retina.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Until now, studies of circadian rhythm have been limited to a handful of organisms such as mouse, fruitfly, Neurospora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Liu2">[33]</xref>, cyanobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Kondo1">[34]</xref>, and Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Millar1">[35]</xref>, species with large evolutionary distances separating them. Mouse is the only vertebrate species in which the circadian rhythm has been extensively studied. However, other vertebrate model systems have been largely unexplored. In recent years, zebrafish has become a model organism to study the vertebrate circadian rhythm, including at the molecular level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Cahill1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Whitmore1">[37]</xref>. Our results suggest that the molecular mechanism of the zebrafish circadian rhythm has many characteristics in common with the mammalian system. Following the duplication of many core circadian genes in zebrafish, the relative phase relationship of the duplicates has been largely conserved. Our genome-wide comparison of circadian gene expression between zebrafish and mouse identified novel evolutionarily conserved circadian genes in vertebrates that deserve further functional studies in both species.</p>
      <p>The transparent nature of larval zebrafish has also made it an excellent system to study light entrainment of the circadian rhythm. Our study shows that the amplitudes of many circadian oscillating genes are significantly reduced in DD compared to LD but their phases are still similar between LD and DD. Comparing gene expression under LD and DD conditions, we discovered that circadian gene expression was induced by light in a progressive manner. The fast light-induced genes showed the most dramatic up-regulation, within eight hours of light-onset. In comparison, expression of the slow light-induced genes rose slowly and reached their peak only near the time of light-off. The transcripts of slow light-induced genes may have longer degradation times than those of fast light-induced genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Rey1">[6]</xref>. Gavriouchkina et al. (2010) identified a set of light-induced genes in zebrafish from a light exposure experiment in early embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Gavriouchkina1">[38]</xref>. Among the 19 light-induced genes identified in their experiment, we detected 16 on our microarray. Twelve of these 16 light-induced genes were identified as fast light-induced genes except for <italic>cry2a</italic> and <italic>cry2b</italic> which were identified as slow light-induced genes in our study. The light-exposed samples in Gavriouchkina et al.'s experiment were collected after nine hours of light exposure which is close to the time to reach peak expression after light-onset among our fast light-induced genes. Weger et al. (2011) analyzed light-induced transcriptome change in zebrafish larvae, heart and cell cultures after one and three hours of light exposure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Weger1">[39]</xref>. Although very few genes changed their expression after one hour of light exposure, after three hours of light exposure 74 were up-regulated and 24 down-regulated in larvae. Among the up-regulated genes, we identified 32 as being fast light-induced genes and 8 as slow light-induced genes in our study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002940.s015">Table S10</xref>). Notably, none of the 24 down-regulated genes in Weger et al's study overlap with the dark-induced genes in our study. The distinct kinetics of light induction has also been observed in Neurospora <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Chen1">[7]</xref> and Drosophila <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Wijnen1">[40]</xref>. In Neurospora, early light response genes peak within minutes and late light response genes peak after 30 minutes or more, response times which are much faster than observed in zebrafish. In our study, <italic>tefa</italic> is a fast light-induced TF binding the D-BOX, whose expression spikes at CT4 under LD. Our promoter analysis also supports the possibility that D-BOX is enriched in the promoters of fast light-induced genes. Among ZCOGs, the targets of D-BOX were enriched around CT5 at which time fast light-induced genes reach their peaks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002940-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Thus we conclude that the up-regulation of fast light-induced genes is under the direct control of light via D-BOX. This observation is consistent with the results of Gavriouchkina et al (2010), in which light-induced genes were mostly regulated by <italic>tef</italic>. Vatine et al. (2009) have shown that light entrains circadian rhythm via D-BOX in <italic>per2</italic>'s promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Vatine1">[41]</xref>. In Neurospora, the light responses largely depend on the white collar complex (WCC), which consists of WC-1 and WC-2, via an early light response element (ELRE). D-BOX performs a similar role in fast light-induced genes in zebrafish. Dark-induced genes have been previously observed in both Arabidopsis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Fujiki1">[42]</xref> and cyanobacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Hosokawa1">[43]</xref>. Fast light-induced genes in zebrafish include core clock genes such as <italic>per2</italic>. Therefore dark-induced genes and slow light-induced genes are likely to be regulated by fast light-induced genes through clock regulatory mechanism. In support of this, the expression of <italic>clock</italic> gene increases during the DD to LL experiment, reaching the peak at CT12 in subjective time. Further studies are needed to separate the direct light-response from the indirect clock regulation. Among the dark-induced genes, <italic>aanat1</italic>, a key enzyme that synthesizes melatonin at night, is known to be suppressed by light in the zebrafish retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Appelbaum1">[44]</xref>. In addition, the mouse homolog of dopamine D4 receptor (<italic>drd4a</italic>) has also been reported to be involved in dark sensing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Jackson1">[45]</xref>. We also observed that two dark-induced genes, <italic>mitfa</italic> and <italic>slc24a5</italic>, are involved in melanogenesis, which led us to investigate the circadian and photic controls of melanogenesis in more detail.</p>
      <p>On considering previous studies of circadian rhythm in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Bozek1">[46]</xref>, we find that our zebrafish network contains homologs of many known mouse circadian TFs. The basic core transcriptional feedback loops are similar in these two networks. However, the zebrafish network includes a number of novel TFs showing circadian rhythm in zebrafish larvae. Among them, only <italic>crx</italic> has been previously associated with circadian functions. It has been proposed that <italic>Crx</italic> and cAMP responsive TFs synergistically activate <italic>Aanat</italic> and <italic>Asmt</italic>, which encode the two enzymes synthesizing melatonin in rat pineal gland <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Li1">[47]</xref>. The mRNA level of <italic>Crx</italic> in rat pineal gland showed a circadian peak in the middle of night. In our result, the circadian phase of <italic>crx</italic> (CT17) also occurs in the middle of night and just precedes the circadian phase of <italic>aanat1</italic> (CT20), the zebrafish homolog of <italic>Aanat</italic>. Similar to mouse, zebrafish <italic>crx</italic> is also expressed in retina in addition to epiphysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Liu1">[15]</xref>. <italic>Crx</italic>-deficient mice were affected in circadian entrainment as well as photoreceptor- and pineal-specific gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Furukawa1">[48]</xref>. Among the <italic>Crx</italic>-targeted genes identified in ChIP-seq experiments in the mouse retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Corbo1">[49]</xref>, we identified 40 of them as having zebrafish homologs exhibiting circadian oscillation, including the retinal arrestin gene and prostaglandin synthases.</p>
      <p>The target genes of some circadian TFs tend to peak at a specific time of day. We predicted that <italic>yy1a</italic>, oscillating at CT12, regulates a group of mitochondrial genes oscillating around CT0. Support for this prediction comes from a <italic>Yy1</italic> ChIP-seq assay in human cells that identified <italic>Yy1</italic> targets as being enriched in mitochondrial genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Xi1">[50]</xref>. The coordinated oscillation of genes in the mitochondrial respiratory chain has also been observed with mouse SCN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Panda1">[51]</xref>. This was suggested to provide the maximal metabolic output during the active phase of SCN neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Langmesser1">[52]</xref>. The time-lag between circadian TF peaks and that of their targets can vary from immediate up to 12 hours. This is likely to reflect differences between TFs with respect to time delays in their translation and the trans-activation of their target <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements.</p>
      <p>The circadian system in the whole zebrafish larva consists of a collection of peripheral clocks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Whitmore1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Whitmore2">[53]</xref>. Although the mRNAs collected from zebrafish larvae are a mixture of transcripts originating from different tissues, we could associate different transcripts with tissues or cell types of expression using the spatial expression atlas in zebrafish. We observed that many circadian TFs show tissue- or cell-type specific expression. We postulated that they are effectors of tissue-specific circadian output from core circadian genes via transcriptional cascades, as implied by the reduction of their amplitude or loss of their rhythmicity in <italic>clock</italic> morphants. This may be the key to explaining why such a wide range of circadian functions can be driven by a handful of core circadian genes. We then focused on <italic>mitfa</italic>, a novel circadian TF governing melanogenesis and found not only that melanogenesis followed a circadian rhythm but that this was mediated by circadian oscillation of <italic>mitfa</italic>.</p>
      <p>Interestingly, a similar pathway mediating circadian control of melanogenesis has been elucidated for the circadian control of cortisol synthesis in adrenal gland along the hypothalamus-pituitary-adrenal (HPA) axis in mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Oster1">[54]</xref>. In the HPA axis, adrenocorticotropic hormone (ACTH) is released by the pituitary gland to stimulate cortisol release in the adrenal gland. In fact, ACTH and α-MSH are generated from the same protein precursor: proopiomelanocortin (POMC) in the pituitary gland. Thus, it is conceivable that the HPM axis governs the circadian synthesis of melanin in zebrafish melanocytes in the same way as the HPA axis governs circadian synthesis of cortisol in the mammalian adrenal gland. The dark-inducing or light-suppressing signals may be first transmitted to the hypothalamus from the retina and then relayed to melanocytes through the HPM axis. However, the circadian system in zebrafish has a very different organization from that of the mouse, as individual peripheral clocks in zebrafish are directly light responsive <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Whitmore2">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Kaneko2">[55]</xref>. Our whole-larva study cannot distinguish the direct impact of light on peripheral clocks from the indirect systemic effects based on light input to specialized photoreceptor tissues such as the pineal complex and deep brain photoreceptors. It is possible that the light signals enter melanocytes and influence the local clock directly. Although melanogenesis is strongly activated by darkness, it is not entirely driven by the light/dark cycle because residual circadian oscillations in <italic>mitfa</italic> and <italic>slc24a5</italic> still persist even under DD conditions. This is perhaps a consequence of the persistent oscillation of cAMP level governed by the local clock. In the zebrafish retina, the concentration of cAMP oscillated in a circadian manner and was regulated by the <italic>clock</italic> gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Li2">[56]</xref>. Furthermore, the circadian phase of cAMP concentration is in the subjective early morning, close to the peak time of <italic>mitfa</italic>. Another dark-induced gene, <italic>aanat1</italic>, is also regulated by the cAMP signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Ganguly1">[57]</xref>. In our study, two adenylate cyclases, <italic>adcy2b</italic> and <italic>adcy8l</italic> (<italic>LOC560410</italic>), showed circadian oscillation at CT16 under DD conditions, indicating that cAMP level is likely to be still oscillating under DD conditions in melanocytes. In combination, local clock and external photic signals may synergistically control melanogenesis mediated by <italic>mitfa</italic>.</p>
      <p>Organisms can use circadian rhythms to control their specific physiological behavior in adapting to their own ecological niche. In Neurospora, four genes encoding enzymes in the consecutive steps of the carotenoid biosynthesis pathway, which produces photoprotective pigments, are all early light-induced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Chen1">[7]</xref>. In contrast, in zebrafish larvae, melanin synthesis is dark-induced which may lead to skin color adaptation to their environment so that they can better evade predators. This may also help them to adjust their daily light-sensitivity in pigment cells. The melanin biosynthesis pathway regulated by <italic>mitfa</italic> conforms to a network motif common in gene regulatory networks, namely the single-input module (SIM), a master TF controlling a group of target genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Alon1">[58]</xref>. A SIM can generate temporal order of gene expression in metabolic pathways such as arginine biosynthesis in <italic>E.coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Zaslaver1">[59]</xref>. The wiring of such modules in the circadian pathway may have evolved to generate a daily change of pigmentation in larval zebrafish.</p>
      <p>Tissue-specific TFs such as <italic>mitfa</italic> mediate the circadian control of the central circadian clock by receiving inputs from the central clock and relaying signals to multiple targets, thus generating circadian-linked physiological changes such as circadian melanin synthesis. This phenomenon is not unique to zebrafish. In the mouse heart, the circadian cycle controls cardiac arrhythmogenesis through a <italic>Bmal1</italic>/<italic>Clock</italic> targeted TF, kruppel-like factor 15 (<italic>Klf15</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Jeyaraj1">[60]</xref>. <italic>Klf15</italic> then regulates the circadian expression of Kv channel-interacting protein 2 (<italic>KChIP2</italic>) thus leading to a daily change of susceptibility to heart arrhythmia. Notably, TF-encoding genes are enriched among <italic>Bmal1</italic> targets in a genome-wide ChIP-seq experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Rey1">[6]</xref>. Mouse homologs of zebrafish circadian TFs investigated in this study (e.g. <italic>Mef2a</italic>, <italic>Foxo3</italic>, <italic>Ppargc1b</italic>, <italic>Smad1</italic>, and <italic>Maf</italic>) have been identified as <italic>Bmal1</italic> targets in mouse. <italic>Mef2a</italic> in heart, <italic>Smad3</italic> in skeletal muscle, and <italic>Ppargc1b</italic> and <italic>Foxo3</italic> in liver showed strong circadian oscillations in their respective tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>. Their tissue-specific circadian functions merit further investigation. Our results suggest that the transcriptional cascade via TFs from a central clock is a universal mechanism that generates diverse circadian functions in all complex organisms.</p>

        <p>Time-series of microarray expression values were converted from time domain to frequency domain using discrete Fourier transform algorithm. The significance of the observed periodicity compared to random noise was estimated by Fisher's g-test <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Brockwell1">[61]</xref> from the GeneCycle package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Wichert1">[62]</xref> in R. We chose a dominant period of 24 h to identify circadian oscillating genes in our data. The false discovery rate (FDR) was estimated by performing Fisher's g-test on randomly permuted time-series data 1,000 times. The FDR for genes oscillating in both LD and DD (ZCOGs) was estimated from permutations of LD and DD data simultaneously. The selection criteria used were as follows: g-test p values less than 0.5 in LD and g-test p values less than 0.5 in DD with dominant period as 24 h each corresponded to an overall FDR less than 5%. Circadian phases were estimated by fitting the time-series data to a set of cosine curves with 24 h periods but shifting phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Yan1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To identify the genes affected by light-entrainment, we searched for the DD amplitude-reduced genes reflecting either decreased peaks or elevated troughs among LD oscillating genes. We fitted the joint LD/DD gene expression values to a set of cosine curves with 24 h periods of shifting phases in LD but constant levels at either +1 (elevated troughs) or −1 (decreased peaks) in DD. A G-test p value less than 0.15 was used to select 3,677 LD oscillating genes (FDR≤10%). A p value less than 0.0001 was used in the fit of joint LD/DD expression values. Among the peak-decreased genes, those with LD phases between CT2 and CT16 were defined as light-induced genes. A delay of 2 hours from light period was used here so that the gene expression increases after light onset. In addition, the light-induced genes with LD phases between CT2 and CT8 were defined as fast light-induced genes and those with LD phases between CT8 and CT16 were defined as slow light-induced genes.

        <title>Melanocyte area measurement</title>
        <p>WT larvae were raised in a 14 h∶10 h LD cycle from birth to 3 dpf at 28°C. From CT0 of 4 dpf, 10–15 larvae were collected under LD conditions at 4 h intervals for a 72 h period. Larvae were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde (PFA) for 12 h at 4°C and were then embedded in 1% low melting point agarose. Images were taken using an Olympus microscope SZX16 equipped with a DP71 CCD camera controlled by DP Controller software. The covered area of melanocyte was measured in a 1,360×1,024 pixel frame in the head region from the pineal gland to the optic vesicles excluding the eyes using ImageJ 1.41 software.</p>

        <title>Melanin quantification assay</title>
        <p>WT and MO-injected larvae were raised in 14 h∶10 h LD cycle from birth to 3 dpf at 28°C. WT larvae were collected in LD from CT0 of 4 dpf at 4 h intervals for 72 hours. Control MO and <italic>clock</italic> MO-injected larvae were collected under both LD and DD conditions simultaneously from CT0 of 4 dpf at 4 h intervals for 48 hours. Each time point consisted of two or three sample replicates and each sample contained 15 individual larvae. The melanin quantification assay protocol used was based on the published work by Maldonado et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002940-Maldonado1">[68]</xref> with minor modifications. Briefly, 15 larvae per sample were placed in 300 µl buffer (20 mM Tris-HCl, 2 mM EGTA, 1 mM PMSF, pH 7.1). They were immediately placed on ice to anesthetize the larvae and then stored at −80°C. The amount of melanin was measured as follows: whole bodies of larvae were homogenized with a disposable pestle (T10, IKA). Then 100 µl DMSO, 500 µl of 2M NaOH and 100 µl dH<sub>2</sub>O were added to each tube. The standard melanin was freshly made from the common cuttlefish (<italic>Sepia officinalis</italic>) (M2649, Sigma) at 1 mg/ml in 1% hydrogen peroxide and diluted to a concentration gradient of 0 µg/ml, 50 µg/ml, 100 µg/ml, 200 µg/ml, 300 µg/ml, and 400 µg/ml. The larval samples and standards were then heated for 2 h at 80°C and centrifuged at 12,000 g for 10 min. The supernatant was collected and the absorbance analyzed at 350 nm using FlexStation 3 (Molecular Devices Inc.). The melanin quantities were obtained by a linear fit to the standard curve using the OriginPro 8 software.</p>

          <p>Zebrafish larva locomotor activity recording system. (A) An infrared behavioral monitoring platform. The locomotor activities of all larvae in the 96-well plate can be tracked simultaneously. The activity curve of a selected fish in the red rectangle was displayed in real time on the computer screen. The color of the curve reflected the intensity of the locomotion: white, lower than freezing threshold; red, higher than burst threshold; green, between freezing threshold and burst threshold. Freezing threshold and burst threshold parameters for detection were matched to visual observation of the locomotion of single larva. (B) Locomotor activities of larval zebrafish beginning at 5 dpf of development exhibited robust circadian rhythm in LD and the rhythmicity persisted in DD but with reduced amplitude. The average activities of 10 larvae were plotted. The y-axis indicates the mean value of pixels per second. The x-axis indicates light (white) and dark (black) in LD, subjective day (grey) and subjective night (black) in DD.</p>
