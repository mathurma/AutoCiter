<p>Mast cells, best known as effector cells in pathogenic immunoglobulin-mediated responses, can sense a variety of “danger” signals; if manipulated to enhance their resulting inflammatory responses, they also exacerbate inflammatory diseases such as arthritis and lung inflammation.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Mast cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, this notion based on studies in mast cell-deficient mice is controversial. We therefore established an <italic>in vivo</italic> model for hyperactive mast cells by specifically ablating the NF-κB negative feedback regulator A20. While A20 deficiency did not affect mast cell degranulation, it resulted in amplified pro-inflammatory responses downstream of IgE/FcεRI, TLRs, IL-1R, and IL-33R. As a consequence house dust mite- and IL-33-driven lung inflammation, late phase cutaneous anaphylaxis, and collagen-induced arthritis were aggravated, in contrast to experimental autoimmune encephalomyelitis and immediate anaphylaxis. Our results provide <italic>in vivo</italic> evidence that hyperactive mast cells can exacerbate inflammatory disorders and define diseases that might benefit from therapeutic intervention with mast cell function.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Mast cells mediate allergic and anaphylactic immune reactions. They are also equipped with innate pattern recognition, cytokine, and alarmin receptors, which induce inflammatory responses. Correlative studies in human patients hinted at roles for mast cells in autoimmune and inflammatory diseases. However, studies using mast cell-deficient mice have yielded contradictory results in this context. In this study we determined that A20, the negative feedback regulator, restricts inflammation downstream of the mast cell antigen (allergen) receptor module, innate pattern recognition receptors, and the alarmin receptor IL-33R. By mast cell–specific ablation of A20 we established a mouse model for exaggerated inflammatory but normal anaphylactic mast cell signaling. With these mice we evaluated the impact of increased mast cell-mediated inflammation under experimental conditions aimed at mimicking several inflammatory human diseases. Our results demonstrated that the lack of A20 from mast cells exacerbated disease in mouse models for rheumatoid arthritis and innate forms of asthma, but did not impact disease progression in a mouse model for multiple sclerosis. Our data provide direct evidence that enhanced inflammatory mast cell responses can contribute to disease pathology and do so via sensing and amplifying local inflammatory reactions driven by “danger” stimuli and/or tissue damage that leads to the release of alarmins.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mast cells are innate immune cells that localize preferentially to vascularized tissues at the host-environment barrier. Through their high-affinity IgE receptor (FcεRI) they can capture circulating IgE and are hence primed to degranulate and produce cytokines upon antigen encounter. Mast cells store large amounts of histamine, heparin, and various proteases, which they release within minutes during degranulation. In contrast, the release of pro-inflammatory lipid mediators and most cytokines requires <italic>de novo</italic> synthesis upon activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Abraham1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Galli1">[2]</xref>. Mast cells are also equipped with a range of cell surface receptors allowing them to sense microbial invasion, inflammation, and tissue damage, among them several TLRs, the IL-1R, and the receptor for the alarmin IL-33, the IL-33R. Engagement of these receptors initiates a pro-inflammatory gene expression program via NF-κB transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Abraham1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Kalesnikoff1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Schmitz1">[4]</xref>.</p>
<p>More than 100 years after their discovery, the physiological roles of mast cells in health and disease remain heavily disputed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Rodewald1">[5]</xref>. It is widely accepted that they are central mediators of IgE-dependent allergic responses, which can cause life-threatening anaphylactic shock in susceptible individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Galli1">[2]</xref>. These deleterious mast cell properties could be overshooting, misdirected responses originally designed as components of allergic host defense against environmental irritants, noxious foreign substances, and envenomation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Palm1">[6]</xref>. Although these functions might explain the evolutionary pressure that led to the development and preservation of mast cells, it is generally believed that further protective properties await identification. Furthermore, the observation that human patients suffering from asthma, allergic rhinitis, atopic dermatitis, and autoimmune and malignant disorders consistently contained mast cell accumulations at affected locations indicated a role for mast cells in these diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Kalesnikoff1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Sayed1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Mouse strains lacking mast cells due to different loss-of-function mutations in the receptor tyrosine kinase c-Kit were instrumental to elucidate mast cell <italic>in vivo</italic> functions. However, in the context of autoimmune, inflammatory, allergic, and malignant disease studies, these mouse strains often yielded conflicting results, presumably due to additional effects of c-Kit deficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Rodewald1">[5]</xref>. Moreover, recent experiments employing novel Kit-independent mast cell-deficient mouse models have challenged some of their initially proposed functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Feyerabend1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Otsuka1">[10]</xref>. Regardless of the particular model, loss-of-function approaches describe the consequences of absent function, which is not always inversely correlated with excessive function, and functional compensation by other cell types can be a problem. We aimed to establish a new mouse strain modeling gain-of-function of inflammatory mast cell responses, as they are at the center of controversy.</p>
<p>In various immune lineages, the ubiquitin-editing enzyme and NF-κB negative feedback regulator A20 (also known as Tnfaip3) is critical for the prevention of inflammation and autoimmunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Chu1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke1">[16]</xref>. Polymorphisms in the <italic>A20</italic> gene locus or its binding partner <italic>TNIP1</italic> are significantly associated with a number of human inflammatory and autoimmune conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ma1">[18]</xref> and in case of <italic>TNIP1</italic> also with asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Li1">[19]</xref>. Therefore, we postulated that A20 deficiency in mast cells should provide an ideal genetic model system to address their pro-inflammatory properties in a gain-of-function approach. We employed conditional gene ablation to demonstrate that A20 restricts NF-κB activation downstream of the IgE:FcεRI module, TLRs, the IL-1R, and the IL-33R in mast cells. Exaggerated signaling from these receptors to NF-κB strongly enhanced mast cell pro-inflammatory responses, but did not affect degranulation. The presence of these hyperactive inflammatory mast cells exacerbated late phase cutaneous anaphylaxis reactions, allergic lung, and autoimmune joint inflammation. Our findings are, to our knowledge, the first direct demonstration that enhanced inflammatory mast cell responses can contribute to disease pathology.</p>

<title>A20 Is a Negative Regulator of TLR-, IL-33R-, and IgE/FcεRI-Induced NF-κB Activation in Mast Cells</title>
<p>Upon priming with IgE and subsequent aggregation, the mast cell FcεRI activates NF-κB in a similar way to B and T cell antigen receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Klemm1">[20]</xref>, whereas the receptor for IL-33 initiates signaling cascades analogous to TLR and IL-1R engagement via MyD88 and TRAF6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Schmitz1">[4]</xref>. We thus hypothesized that in analogy with other immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ma1">[18]</xref>, induced expression of A20 could restrict NF-κB activation downstream of the IgE/FcεRI module and the IL-33R, as well as the IL-1R and TLRs in mast cells.</p>
<p>To biochemically address this hypothesis, we first investigated A20 expression kinetics in murine bone-marrow-derived mast cells (BMMCs) upon activation by LPS, IL-1β, IL-33, and FcεRI cross-linking. A20 transcript levels peaked 3 h after activation and declined steadily afterwards, with IL-33 being the most potent inducer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). A20 protein levels increased 3–6 h after activation and remained elevated for up to 12 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). In order to avoid potential biases through effects of gene deficiencies during mast cell <italic>in vitro</italic> development, we employed the novel <italic>Kit<sup>CreERT2</sup></italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Heger1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Klein1">[22]</xref>. This allowed very efficient inducible expression of a fluorescent reporter protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and excision of conditional <italic>A20</italic> and <italic>MyD88</italic> alleles in BMMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) did not affect c-Kit and FcεRI levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). A20-deficient mast cells activated by LPS, IL-33, and FcεRI cross-linking showed enhanced activation of NF-κB as indicated by prolonged degradation and delayed resynthesis of its inhibitor I-κBα, while no differences in the activation of MAPK signaling were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g001">Figure 1D–F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s001">Figure S1D</xref>).</p>

<title>Mast Cell-Specific Ablation of A20 <italic>in Vivo</italic> Does Not Induce Spontaneous Pathology</title>
<p>We observed dramatically enhanced NF-κB activation in A20-deficient mast cells in response to various physiologically relevant stimuli <italic>in vitro</italic>. Therefore, we generated mice lacking A20 specifically in connective tissue-type mast cells (<italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Scholten1">[23]</xref>. In order to specifically dissect innate MyD88-dependent from other signals, we generated mice containing mast cells deficient for both A20 and MyD88 (<italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup>MyD88<sup>F/F</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Kleinridders1">[24]</xref>. Most experiments were controlled with <italic>Mcpt5Cre</italic> transgenic animals and, to a lesser extent, with nontransgenic littermates. As we did not observe any differences between those two groups, they are shown together as control mice.</p>
<p><italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice developed normally, showing no macroscopic signs of disease (unpublished data). A20-deficient mast cells homed to their natural positions in the dermis and normal proportions were located in close proximity to blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Mast cell numbers in the ear and dorsal skin were not significantly altered in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). A20 deficiency did not affect the proportions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) or surface phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) of mast cells in the peritoneal cavity. However, absolute mast cell numbers were significantly increased in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice in comparison to controls, due to an overall increase in peritoneal cellularity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Furthermore, we observed enhanced frequencies of TNF-, IL-4–, and IL-13–producing peritoneal mast cells in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> in comparison to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Ablation of MyD88 in addition to A20 led to a normalization of mast cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) and cytokine production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Complete ablation of A20 and MyD88 was confirmed by Western blotting of peritoneal cavity-derived mast cell (PMC) cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). To confirm that the <italic>Mcpt5Cre</italic> transgene does not lead to A20 deletion in cell types other than mast cells, we performed quantitative probe-based real-time PCR on genomic DNA from cell populations purified from <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> animals. Using this sensitive approach we determined that less than 0.1% of A20-deficient cells are contained among sorted leukocytes (T and B cells) and various myeloid cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s002">Figure S2D</xref>), if any. Interestingly, analysis of secondary lymphoid organs revealed minor splenomegaly in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice in comparison to controls, which depended on signals via MyD88 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s002">Figure S2E</xref>).</p>

<title>A20 Deficiency Prolongs Survival and Enhances Proliferation of Activated Mast Cells</title>
<p><italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice showed elevated mast cell numbers in the peritoneal cavity. This could be due to enhanced mast cell survival as A20 has also been implicated in cell death responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Kool1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Tavares1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ma1">[18]</xref>. To clarify the function of A20 in mast cell survival, we studied growth factor deprivation-induced apoptosis, which in BMMCs is antagonized by prosurvival members of the Bcl-2 family including the NF-κB target genes Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> and A1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ekoff1">[25]</xref>. As A20-deficient mast cells showed stronger NF-κB activation in response to stimulation, we reasoned that loss of A20 could protect activated mast cells from IL-3 and SCF withdrawal-induced cell death.</p>
<p>A20 deficiency <italic>per se</italic> did not affect growth factor deprivation-induced cell death, and stimulation with monomeric IgE generally enhanced mast cell survival by an A20-independent pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, treatment with LPS remarkably increased survival only of mast cells lacking A20. IL-33 had a small effect on wild-type mast cells but profoundly inhibited cell death in the absence of A20 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Stimulation with LPS or IL-33 enhanced the transcription of all tested pro-survival members of the Bcl-2 family in A20-deficient cells in comparison to controls, with A1 being most prominently affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Enhanced expression of Bcl-x<sub>L</sub> protein was confirmed by Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). All these processes were strictly MyD88-dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>). We thus conclude that A20 deficiency increases the up-regulation of pro-survival Bcl-2 family members upon innate activation. This is one potential mechanism of how loss of A20 can lead to a dramatically enhanced protection against apoptosis. In addition, cell cycle analysis showed an increase in proliferative activity of LPS and IL-33–stimulated A20-deficient mast cells, which depended on signals transmitted via MyD88 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).</p>

<title>Loss of A20 in Mast Cells Enhances Allergic Airway Inflammation</title>
<p>Next we investigated the consequences of mast cell-specific A20 deficiency in allergic, inflammatory, and autoimmune conditions. Asthma is a chronic inflammatory disease of the airways characterized by increased presence of eosinophils and production of Th2 cytokines, such as IL-13, that causes bronchial hyperreactivity and goblet cell metaplasia. The classical mouse asthma model, which is induced by injection of ovalbumin (OVA) together with alum adjuvant, is mast cell independent in <italic>Kit<sup>W/Wv</sup></italic> and <italic>Kit<sup>W-sh/W-sh</sup></italic> mice. In contrast, a clear role for mast cells has been demonstrated in models of asthma that employ OVA as an allergen in the absence of alum <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Williams1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Nakae1">[27]</xref>. To address the effect of mast cell-specific A20 deficiency in mouse asthma models, we immunized mice with OVA either in the presence or absence of alum, and challenged mice 10 d later with 1% OVA aerosols. In the OVA/alum model, loss of A20 in mast cells did not affect the number of bronchoalveolar lavage (BAL) fluid eosinophils, B and T cells, and the production of IL-13 by mediastinal lymph node (MLN) mononuclear cells or serum levels of OVA-specific IgE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In contrast, when mice were actively sensitized to OVA in the absence of alum, all these parameters were significantly elevated in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<p>House dust mite (HDM) allergens are the most common triggers of allergic asthma and robustly induce IgE-dependent lung inflammation with many features of human asthma in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Willart1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Coyle1">[30]</xref>. To our knowledge, the role of mast cells has not yet been genetically addressed in this arguably more relevant model. Thus we measured the responses of <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> and control mice to active sensitization induced by administration of HDM extracts via the nasal route followed by five HDM challenges 7 d later. Mast cell-specific ablation of A20 caused increased levels of BAL fluid eosinophils and B cells, and HDM-specific serum IgE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Dendritic cells (DCs) induce and maintain Th2 immunity to inhaled allergens such as HDM and OVA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Lambrecht1">[31]</xref> and are necessary and sufficient for the development of asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Plantinga1">[29]</xref>. Suto et al. showed that mast cells control the activation of DCs via the release of TNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Suto1">[32]</xref>. We therefore evaluated whether A20 deficiency in mast cells affects DC responses to HDM exposure. Indeed HDM treatment led to enhanced recruitment of DCs to the lung and MLNs in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice in comparison to controls. In addition, these DCs had taken up significantly more fluorescent antigen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These findings are in line with our observations that A20-deficient mast cells produce more TNF upon activation. As mast cells have been shown to control vascular permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Dudeck1">[9]</xref>, we wondered whether the increase in airway inflammation in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice could also be linked to enhanced vascular leakage. Therefore, we injected fluorescently labeled 500 nm microspheres intravenously 1 h after HDM allergen challenge and measured their extravasation 5 min later. In line with our hypothesis, <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice displayed a strong increase in vascular leakage compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). We and others have previously reported that the HDM-driven model of asthma depends on the activity of IL-33 and is driven by antigen-presenting DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Willart1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Oboki1">[33]</xref>. In control mice, three intranasal administrations of IL-33 induced an increase in the total cell and DC influx into the lungs, which was enhanced by ablation of A20 specifically in mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). In addition, there was a trend towards increased numbers of eosinophils, neutrophils, and monocytes in the lungs of <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Hence, the increased sensitivity of A20-deficient mast cells towards IL-33 could contribute to the enhanced allergic responses observed in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice. This notion is supported by the fact that <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice showed significantly elevated numbers of granulocytes, lymphocytes, and DCs in the BAL fluid after OVA aerosol challenge, when the OVA sensitization occurred in the presence of IL-33 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We employed the above-described PCR assay (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s002">Figure S2D</xref>) to confirm that under inflammatory conditions, <italic>Mcpt5Cre</italic>-mediated recombination of loxP-flanked A20 alleles is still restricted to mast cells.

<title>A20 Deficiency Does Not Affect Immediate But Exacerbates Late Phase Anaphylactic Mast Cell Responses</title>
<p>In order to dissect how A20-deficient mast cells exacerbate pathological immune responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, we first addressed IgE/FcεRI-induced mast cell activation that prominently provokes degranulation, in addition to pro-inflammatory NF-κB activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Klemm1">[20]</xref>. To explore consequences of A20 deficiency in connective tissue-type mast cells on anaphylactic responses <italic>in vivo</italic>, we performed FcεRI-mediated immediate phase passive cutaneous anaphylaxis (PCA) and passive systemic anaphylaxis (PSA) experiments, which depend on mast cell degranulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Feyerabend1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Klemm1">[20]</xref>.

<title>A20 Deficiency Causes Mast Cell Hyperactivity Leading to Increased Cytokine Production, Activation Marker Expression, and Alarmin Production in Fibroblasts</title>
<p>As A20 deficiency did not affect mast cell degranulation, we examined if enhanced pro-inflammatory reactions could account for the exacerbated responses observed in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice. Hence, we dissected the activation state of A20-deficient mast cells <italic>in vitro</italic>. Stimulation with LPS, IL-33, and IL-1β induced dramatically augmented transcription and secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines such as TNF, IL-6, and IL-13 from A20-deficient in comparison to control mast cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g008">Figure 8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s006">Figure S6A</xref>–C). PMA/Iono-induced release of IL-2 was unchanged (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s006">Figure S6D</xref>). A trend towards an increase in IL-1β secretion was also observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s006">Figure S6E</xref>). In addition, the enhanced responses of A20-deficient mast cells to LPS and IL-33 were demonstrated by increased up-regulation of the activation markers OX40L, CD30L, CD25, Fas, and 4-1BB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). Ablation of MyD88 completely abolished the enhanced production of cytokines and rescued the hyperactive phenotype caused by A20 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g008">Figure 8A and B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s006">Figure S6B</xref>,C, and E). A20-deficient mast cells also produced more pro-inflammatory cytokines than wild-type mast cells in response to priming with IgE and to FcεRI cross-linking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001762-g008">Figure 8C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001762.s006">Figure S6F and G</xref>). A recent study proposed that during arthritis IL-33 released by synovial fibroblasts activates mast cells, which in turn, by their secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, could enhance IL-33 expression in the former, leading to a paracrine feed-forward loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Xu1">[38]</xref>.

<p>Collectively, our results demonstrate that in mast cells A20 is a selective negative feedback regulator of NF-κB–mediated inflammatory signaling events but not of anaphylactic IgE:FcεRI–induced degranulation. Loss of A20 dramatically enhances their pro-inflammatory properties and causes profound mast cell hyperactivation. A20-deficient hyperactive connective tissue-type mast cells exacerbate lung as well as late phase skin inflammation and CIA, pointing to an important contribution of mast cells in these diseases.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Experiments in mast cell-deficient mice that carry hypomorphic c-Kit mutations have not only positioned mast cells as central mediators of allergic and anaphylactic responses but also in inflammatory and autoimmune diseases. However, recent experiments employing novel Kit-independent mast cell-deficient mice challenged this notion, which urged for a reassessment of their exact role in immunological and inflammatory reactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Rodewald1">[5]</xref>. To study their contribution to particular immune reactions, one can assay the presence of mast cells and their activation status, the effects of mast cell deficiency, or the effects of mast cell hyperactivity, akin to the modified Koch's postulates for immunology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Lambrecht2">[40]</xref>. Hence, we established a novel gain-of-function <italic>in vivo</italic> approach by ablating the NF-κB negative feedback regulator A20 specifically in connective tissue-type mast cells. This led to hyperactive mast cells with overshooting inflammatory responses to common disease-causing stimuli. We cannot completely exclude the possibility that loss of A20 has consequences on mast cell differentiation and/or functions in addition to amplifying inflammatory signaling and that this might influence the outcome of our experiments. However, A20's function as a very potent activation-induced negative feedback regulator in mast cells indicates that our interpretation of its role in the context of inflammatory diseases is warranted. This view is strongly supported by the fact that many of the phenotypes we observed can be neutralized by co-ablation of MyD88.</p>
<p>Our results demonstrate that A20 does not regulate instant degranulation, which is triggered by antigen binding to the IgE:FcεRI module and is critical for immediate cutaneous and systemic anaphylactic reactions. In contrast, A20 serves as a feedback inhibitor of FcεRI-initiated NF-κB activity and in its absence the secretion of pro-inflammatory cytokines, and thereby late phase PCA reactions are strongly amplified. Therefore, it should be possible to modulate A20 function without provoking anaphylactic reactions. Although pharmacological augmentation of A20 function is mainly discussed in the context of treating inflammatory and autoimmune diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke2">[17]</xref>, its inhibition might be beneficial to enhance immunogenicity of vaccines and the management of viral infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Hammer1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Maelfait1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>In addition, also in mast cells A20 limits pro-inflammatory gene expression upon stimulation with TLR ligands and cytokines. Furthermore, inflammation can be triggered by alarmins released by dying cells, such as the recently identified IL-33 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Lthi1">[42]</xref>. Mast cells can sense IL-33 by virtue of their characteristic high constitutive IL-33R α-chain expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Moritz1">[43]</xref>. We discovered that A20 acts as a key negative feedback inhibitor of IL-33–induced MyD88-dependent NF-κB but not MAPK activation in mast cells. A20 deficiency leads to dramatically enhanced cytokine production, activation marker expression, resistance to apoptosis, and increased proliferation upon stimulation with IL-33. As IL-33 can also be sensed by dendritic and myeloid cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ohno1">[44]</xref>, IL-33–induced activation in the steady state could contribute to the spontaneous MyD88-dependent pathologies observed in mice that lack A20 specifically in these cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Matmati1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Hammer1">[14]</xref>. Furthermore, IL-33 triggers activation of group 2 innate lymphoid cells, Th2 cells, NKT cells, B cells, NK cells, eosinophils, and basophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ohno1">[44]</xref>. We therefore propose that A20's role in limiting IL-33–mediated NF-κB activation is of general importance in the immune system.</p>
<p>Loss of A20 in connective tissue-type mast cells <italic>in vivo</italic> did not cause dramatic spontaneous inflammation. However, A20-deficient peritoneal mast cells displayed a pre-activated or poised state, which depended entirely on the presence of MyD88. This indicates that mast cells, similar to other innate leukocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Matmati1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Hammer1">[14]</xref>, constantly receive tonic signals that are controlled by A20, via one or more MyD88-dependent receptors, such as TLR, IL-1R, IL-18R, or IL-33R. The fact that A20-deficient connective tissue-type mast cells, unlike macrophages or DCs lacking A20 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Matmati1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Hammer1">[14]</xref>, do not cause pronounced spontaneous inflammation suggests that these cells are intrinsically less potent inducers of inflammatory reactions and/or have developed additional control mechanisms.</p>
<p><italic>A20</italic> is a susceptibility gene locus for rheumatoid arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke2">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ma1">[18]</xref>, and mast cells are implicated in the pathogenesis of this disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Eklund1">[34]</xref>. Several recent studies pointed to a crucial role of IL-33 during arthritis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Palmer2">[45]</xref>, which could promote joint inflammation, at least in part, by activating mast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Xu1">[38]</xref>. This notion is in line with our observation that hyperactive A20-deficient mast cells caused earlier onset as well as exacerbation of CIA symptoms. In contrast, A20-deficient connective tissue-type mast cells did not worsen symptoms of MOG peptide-induced EAE, possibly because initiation of this disease is IL-33 independent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Oboki1">[33]</xref>. Our results do not strictly exclude a role of mast cells in this model, as it remains possible that general mast cell hyperactivation might have different or more pronounced effects than those elicited by the loss of A20 in connective tissue-type mast cells alone. Nevertheless, our results illustrate that profound hyperactivation of the inflammatory properties of connective tissue-type mast cells does not affect the outcome of EAE induction.</p>
<p>Arthritis can develop in absence of an adaptive immune system, driven solely by A20-deficient innate immune cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Matmati1">[12]</xref>. We propose that in the context of autoimmune arthritis, A20-deficient mast cells exacerbate local inflammation in the joint. Tissue damage or physical stress during the early stages of arthritis development cause local release of endogenous TLR ligands or alarmins such as IL-33. Pro-inflammatory cytokine secretion by A20-deficient mast cells results in a locally restricted auto-amplification loop by enhancing IL-33 expression in synovial fibroblasts leading to stronger mast cell activation in a paracrine fashion. This scenario is supported by our data that MyD88 deficiency in mast cells counteracts the early onset and disease severity caused by ablation of A20.</p>
<p>Amplification of detrimental IL-33–mediated feed-forward loops by loss of A20 function might not be restricted to initial stages in arthritis but could also play an important role in other inflammatory conditions including psoriasis, systemic sclerosis, inflammatory bowel disease, and asthma, which have an IL-33 component and are associated with <italic>A20</italic> or A20 binding partner (<italic>TNIP1</italic>) gene locus polymorphisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Li1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ohno1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Palmer2">[45]</xref>. Furthermore, IL-33 is increased in human asthmatics, and recent genome-wide association studies have identified the genes encoding for IL-33 and its receptor as susceptibility loci for asthma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Ohno1">[44]</xref>. Also in our asthma models, IL-33 is released by stromal cells, such as epithelial and smooth muscle cells, after HDM provocation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Willart1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Hammad1">[46]</xref>. Mast cell numbers increase during allergic airway inflammation and then localize within the smooth muscle, where they enhance bronchial hyperreactivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Brightling1">[47]</xref>. This localization hence enables mast cells to easily sense IL-33, and A20 deficiency amplifies their ensuing responses, exacerbating immune cell activation and lung inflammation. Fittingly, IL-33 could also be used as an adjuvant to induce Th2 immunity, which was enhanced by mast cells in <italic>Mcpt5Cre A20<sup>F/F</sup></italic> mice, possibly by promoting an initial pro Th2 innate response to IL-33 as indicated by the increased DC numbers in the airways. The stronger general immune activation elicited by alum probably overrides these mast cell-dependent effects in the OVA/alum model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Williams1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Nakae1">[27]</xref>. Since the HDM model is much closer to the human situation, our data clearly indicate that inflammatory functions of connective tissue-type mast cells can contribute to allergic inflammatory airway diseases. The role of mast cells in airway hyperreactivity has been studied predominantly in mast cell-deficient c-Kit mutant mouse strains, which did not allow dissecting the role of individual mast cell subsets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Williams1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Nakae1">[27]</xref>. Our model, with selective hyperinflammatory properties of connective tissue-type mast cells, points to an important role for this subset in controlling asthma. However, our findings do exclude a role for mucosal mast cells in this disease.</p>
<p>In conclusion, our data demonstrate that loss of A20 specifically amplifies NF-κB controlled gene expression programs in connective tissue-type mast cells during inflammatory, allergic, and autoimmune conditions. We demonstrate that, in addition to its known function downstream of TLRs and the IL-1R, A20 also plays a critical role as a negative feedback inhibitor of IL-33R– and FcεRI-initiated pro-inflammatory signaling pathways. It does not, however, regulate IgE-dependent anaphylactic responses. As a result, the magnitude of inflammatory responses can be controlled through pharmacological intervention modulating A20 levels or activity without affecting anaphylactic reactions. Our study demonstrates, to our knowledge for the first time, the consequences of inflammatory mast cell hyperreactivity, identifying mast cells as therapeutic targets in airway inflammation and autoimmune arthritis. Our data also suggest that alterations in mast cell function could contribute to the pathologies linked to genetic polymorphisms in the <italic>A20</italic> gene locus or some of its binding partners (for example, TNIP1) that are associated with autoimmune, such as rheumatoid arthritis, or allergic diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Vereecke2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001762-Li1">[19]</xref>.</p>
