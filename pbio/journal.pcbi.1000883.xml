<p>Gene therapy is an emerging alternative to conventional anti-HIV-1 drugs, and can potentially control the virus while alleviating major limitations of current approaches. Yet, HIV-1's ability to rapidly acquire mutations and escape therapy presents a critical challenge to any novel treatment paradigm. Viral escape is thus a key consideration in the design of any gene-based technique. We develop a computational model of HIV's evolutionary dynamics in vivo in the presence of a genetic therapy to explore the impact of therapy parameters and strategies on the development of resistance. Our model is generic and captures the properties of a broad class of gene-based agents that inhibit early stages of the viral life cycle. We highlight the differences in viral resistance dynamics between gene and standard antiretroviral therapies, and identify key factors that impact long-term viral suppression. In particular, we underscore the importance of mutationally-induced viral fitness losses in cells that are not genetically modified, as these can severely constrain the replication of resistant virus. We also propose and investigate a novel treatment strategy that leverages upon gene therapy's unique capacity to deliver different genes to distinct cell populations, and we find that such a strategy can dramatically improve efficacy when used judiciously within a certain parametric regime. Finally, we revisit a previously-suggested idea of improving clinical outcomes by boosting the proliferation of the genetically-modified cells, but we find that such an approach has mixed effects on resistance dynamics. Our results provide insights into the short- and long-term effects of gene therapy and the role of its key properties in the evolution of resistance, which can serve as guidelines for the choice and optimization of effective therapeutic agents.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>A primary obstacle to the success of any anti-HIV treatment is HIV's ability to rapidly resist it by generating new viral strains whose vulnerability to the treatment is reduced. Gene therapies represent a novel class of treatments for HIV infection that may supplement or replace present therapies, as they alleviate some of their major shortcomings. The design of gene therapeutic agents that effectively reduce viral resistance can be aided by a quantitative elucidation of the processes by which resistance is acquired following therapy initiation. We developed a computational model that describes a patient's response to therapy and used it to quantify the influence of therapy parameters and strategies on the development of viral resistance. We find that gene therapy induces different clinical conditions and a much slower viral response than present therapies. These dictate different design principles such as a greater significance to the virus' competence in the absence of therapy. We also show that one can effectively delay emergence of resistance by delivering distinct therapeutic genes into separate cell populations. Our results highlight the differences between traditional and gene therapies and provide a basic understanding of how key controllable parameters and strategies affect resistance development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>With no HIV-1 vaccine or cure in sight, treating and controlling the virus continues to be a major global health concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Johnston1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Richman1">[2]</xref>. The advent of highly active antiretroviral therapy (HAART) has remarkably prolonged patients' survival, but has failed to eradicate the virus or to control the epidemic. In particular, HAART is a lifelong treatment, and as such presents major obstacles, including cumulative toxicities, severe side effects, a strict and complicated regimen, and problematic economics. Its major problem, however, is HIV-1's ability to escape it by developing drug-resistant mutants, which is further worsened by poor patient compliance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Clavel1">[3]</xref>. Currently, the pace of development for new therapies lags behind HIV's rapid evolution of drug resistance, and alternative approaches are sought to either complement or replace HAART.</p>
<p>Gene therapy is an emerging and promising approach to treating HIV-1 infection, whereby engineered genes are delivered <italic>ex vivo</italic>, and potentially ultimately <italic>in vivo</italic>, into a patient's cells. They then act within these cells to disrupt the viral life cycle. Gene therapy offers the potential to attain sustained viral suppression and a restored immune system, with the added advantage of a simplified regimen, very few medical interventions, and reduced toxicities. To date, a plethora of potent gene-based inhibitors have been developed in the lab and some have undergone early-phase clinical trials (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rossi1">[4]</xref>). While the trials demonstrated safety and feasibility, the infused gene-modified cells did not accumulate with time and consequently could not exert meaningful clinical effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Levine1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vanLunzen1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Morgan1">[7]</xref>. Achieving therapeutic proportions of gene-modified cells <italic>in vivo</italic> is thus a necessary preliminary step for gene therapy's success. Ultimately, however, this approach must prove efficacious in the presence of viral resistance in order to qualify as a feasible therapeutic option. Indeed, as with HAART, viral escape is presently a major concern in the design of any gene-based technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Swan1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Das1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lu1">[11]</xref>, and combinatorial gene cassettes are commonly developed as a means of limiting escape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-terBrake1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Li1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Scherer1">[14]</xref>. While the qualitative relations between key design parameters and viral escape are generally understood, a more rigorous quantitative investigation is essential to better understand the parameters' long-term effects under clinically-relevant conditions. The focus of this work is on a computational modeling approach to illustrate the contribution of therapy parameters and strategies to delaying the emergence of resistant virus in a patient.</p>
<p>Modeling HIV dynamics is by now a well-accepted tool for elucidating mechanisms of interest and for understanding viral evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Nowak1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Nowak2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Perelson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rouzine1">[18]</xref>. A great deal of work has been published with regards to HAART, and has had much success largely due to its clinical validation against patient data. For novel treatments like gene therapy, however, substantial clinical data is not yet available. One must then resort to theoretical investigation as a much-needed step in therapy design. However, very few models have explored viral dynamics under gene therapy, and these have focused primarily on the response of virus that is sensitive or not resistant to the therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lund1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Weinberger1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>. Interestingly, this work revealed major deviations from HAART-like dynamics, thus underscoring a need for a dedicated model of viral resistance under gene therapy conditions.</p>
<p>Leonard <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Leonard1">[22]</xref> developed a stochastic <italic>in vitro</italic> model that elucidates HIV's escape from RNA interference (RNAi) gene therapy. While powerful for studying escape <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Leonard2">[23]</xref>, the model has several features that limit its relevance to <italic>in vivo</italic> scenarios. First, it focuses on RNAi therapies that degrade viral transcripts, an intervention that occurs after a cell has been infected and may thus not facilitate sufficient outgrowth of the gene-modified cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, as was later suggested in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>. Conferring the modified cells with substantial outgrowth capacity is essential in any practical setting due to severe limitations on the fraction of cells that can be genetically modified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Dropulic1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer2">[25]</xref>. Other properties that diverge from <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions include simulations that often predict complete viral eradication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lund1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>, and small population sizes that might under-represent minority viral strains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Johnson1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lapadula1">[27]</xref>. Since sustained viral replication and pre-existing mutants both play a crucial role in fueling resistance, they should be included in an <italic>in vivo</italic> model. Recently, von Laer <italic>et al.</italic>'s study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref> suggested that genes which inhibit early stages in the viral life cycle (by preventing cell binding, membrane fusion, reverse transcription, or integration) have the capacity to propel major cell expansion and therapeutic benefit. A variety of suitable gene-based techniques can be used, including RNAi- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-An1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Anderson1">[29]</xref>, ribozyme- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Li1">[13]</xref>, zinc-finger nuclease- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Perez1">[30]</xref>, and antibody-mediated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Swan2">[31]</xref> disruption of the CCR5 co-receptor, expression of fusion-inhibitory and binding-inhibitory peptides and of single-chain antibodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Masiero1">[32]</xref>, and interference with capsid uncoating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Li2">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we developed a hybrid stochastic-deterministic approach for describing the evolution of HIV's resistance to early-stage gene-based inhibitors <italic>in vivo</italic>. We extended prior modeling work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lund1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref> to incorporate a diverse viral population entailing varying degrees of sensitivity to therapy, and to account for the random effects that dominate early phases of resistance development. Our aim is to provide a general model that captures the commonalities of a broad range of technologies and that can be further adapted to faithfully describe any specific treatment. We apply the model to elucidate the general principles that govern resistance evolution and present extensive simulation results that quantify the tradeoffs between controllable therapy parameters. We show that the fundamentally different dynamics under gene therapy suggest different design guidelines from HAART's. Specifically, unlike HAART, in which drugs provide nearly-homogeneous protection to most cells, protected (gene-modified) and unprotected (untreated) cells co-exist under gene therapy. We find that this property can be harnessed to impede escape, provided that the mutations are associated with non-negligible fitness losses in non-modified cells.</p>
<p>We also investigate a novel delivery strategy to combat resistance, whereby different genes that target different viral functionalities are delivered into separate cell populations. Model simulations indicate that under some conditions, this idea, which is uniquely applicable to gene therapy and has not been analyzed previously, can dramatically prolong viral suppression and decrease the likelihood of escape. Finally, we study the development of resistance when the gene-modified cells have a proliferative advantage over untreated cells. Simulations demonstrate mixed implications on viral escape, namely, that it is less frequent but that when it does occur, it occurs more rapidly. The presented work provides a basic and general understanding of the key characteristics of gene therapy and their role in the evolution of resistance. Model predictions thus offer guidelines to optimizing therapy for long-term suppression of HIV-1 in patients.</p>

<title>Motivating Data</title>
<p>Gene therapy is still a nascent technology; however, there have been a number of studies that serve to motivate our model. Here, we briefly outline the methodology and findings of several studies and discuss how our modeling work was inspired by them.</p>
<p>The first study is a phase I trial in which CD4+ T cells were harvested from five HIV-positive patients, transduced <italic>ex vivo</italic> with a lentiviral vector expressing an antisense RNA targeting HIV, amplified, and then infused back to the patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Levine1">[5]</xref>. The patients were followed for several years, throughout which their immunological function and the persistence of the gene-modified cells were assessed. This trial not only demonstrated long-term survival of these cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, but also showed sustained and statistically significant reductions in the viral load in several patients. However, the modified cells declined in number following the infusion, and persisted at frequencies lower than 1% for most of the trial duration. These findings suggest that the cells are imposing some sort of selective pressure on the virus, although their mechanism of action is currently unclear as gene modification frequencies were too low to account for the observed changes.</p>
<p>As we mentioned earlier, current transduction efficiencies are low, implying that the modified cells must accumulate <italic>in vivo</italic> to reach therapeutic numbers. Such trend has not yet been observed in early-phase anti-HIV trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Dropulic1">[24]</xref>, indicating that the selective advantage of these cells <italic>in vivo</italic> is not sufficiently high. This may be because the engineered genes or their products lose their activity <italic>in vivo</italic>, and/or because the cells' proliferative capacity was impaired during their <italic>ex vivo</italic> manipulation. Current attempts to tackle these issues focus on increasing the vector-copy numbers per cell, and on intensive development of culture systems that better enrich and maintain T cell subsets which display extensive replicative capacity (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-June1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Paulos1">[35]</xref>). Encouraging results from two recent studies are also worth noting. In one study, cells modified with zinc-finger nucleases expanded to therapeutic levels and induced substantial clinical effects in a mouse model of HIV infection, thus demonstrating their efficacy and selective advantage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Perez1">[30]</xref>. A clinical trial to test this approach in humans is currently underway. In a second study, the long-term (i.e., two years) expression of therapeutic genes in human blood cells <italic>in vivo</italic> was confirmed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-DiGiusto1">[36]</xref>. Clearly, the enabling technology is yet to mature, but once these barriers are overcome and gene therapy enters the clinic, viral resistance is to become the major concern. This is the starting point to our study, and one of our goals is to understand the implications of a potent gene therapy on viral evolution and what may be done to prolong its therapeutic effects in the presence of a rapidly mutating virus.</p>
<p>Another noteworthy phase I trial is a very recent one, in which CD34+ hematopoietic progenitor cells of four patients were transduced with a lentiviral vector expressing a combination of three unique gene therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-DiGiusto1">[36]</xref>. While combination therapy similar to HAART has been promoted in the gene therapy field as a method for combating viral escape, this is the first trial to put this idea into practice. In this trial, all three therapies were expressed from the same vector, a technique that provides the highest levels of protection in each cell, but also requires significant optimization and is subject to constraints. Given that more combination therapies will likely be developed, we asked how effective such combinations are in maintaining long-term viral suppression. Furthermore, gene therapy opens up a unique opportunity to split such combinations across cells, such that some cells express one therapy and others express another therapy. Such approach may offer an appealing and less technically demanding alternative to current combinatorial approaches. Here, we aim to explore its potential to provide significant improvements in preventing escape.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Model Overview</title>
<p>The model consists of two types of susceptible CD4+ T cells: transduced cells that are infused to the patient (protected (P) cells), and naturally occurring cells that were not manipulated (unprotected (U) cells). The overall CD4+ T cell pool is maintained by homeostatic proliferation, which saturates according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-DeBoer1">[37]</xref>. Both cell types are regulated by the homeostatic mechanism in the same manner, and contribute equally to saturation, thus equally competing for presence in the pool. The renewal of susceptible cells is assumed to rely mainly on self-proliferation, with additional minor contribution from the bone marrow, modeled as a constant export of mature cells from the thymus. In this work, we focus on delivery of T cells, as opposed to stem cells, and hence the bone marrow engenders only U cells. HIV infection dynamics follow standard HIV models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Nowak2">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Perelson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Perelson2">[38]</xref>, with the therapy effects manifested as an inhibition of viral infectivity of the P cells.</p>

<title>Schematic illustration of infection dynamics under gene therapy and of the development of resistance to it.</title>
<p>(A) Diagram of the baseline model, which considers only a single sensitive viral strain. Two types of T cells are considered: gene-modified cells which are protected from infection (shown in red) and non-modified cells that are susceptible to it (shown in blue). The proliferation rate of both cell populations is determined by a saturating function, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which takes a Michaelis-Menten form. Therapy effects are conveyed via an infectivity inhibition factor (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for gene-modified cells. (B) An example of a possible evolutionary path towards the emergence of a highly resistant strain. A genetic barrier <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to a set of three resistance-conferring sites (hashes), where any combination of these sites can be mutated (stars). At each integration step of the simulation, a strain may only accrue a single mutation in one of the non-mutated sites. The degree of resistance is determined by the number of mutations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and is manifested as improved infection of P cells (i.e., higher infection rates due to an increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Mutations are also associated with a loss in fitness that negatively affects the ability of these mutants to infect U cells, and that also depends on the number of mutations.</p>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The model considers a viral population consisting of a sensitive wild-type (WT) strain as well as other strains to which WT may evolve through a series of mutations. There are <italic>n</italic> genomic sites that confer resistance to therapy, and each mutant strain can have any combination of them mutated away from their WT form. Resistance is assumed to gradually intensify with increasing numbers of mutated sites, and it manifests as an improved ability to infect P cells, but is at the same time associated with a fitness cost when infecting U cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The model captures all interactions via ordinary differential equations (ODE), but uses a stochastic routine to treat populations at low densities, such as those of newly-emerging species (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for details).</p>

<title>Viral Dynamics in the Absence of Resistance</title>
<p>We start by exploring a restricted baseline model, similar to the model of Lund <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lund1">[19]</xref>, in which resistant strains are absent. We use it to demonstrate the inherent differences between gene therapy and HAART and to quantify the effects of different parameters on the achievable viral suppression levels.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g002">Figure 2A</xref> shows <italic>in vivo</italic> dynamics following a P cell infusion, as simulated with default parameter values (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). The P cells are shown to expand, thereby impeding the supply of U cells and thwarting viral replication. The establishment of a P cell reservoir brings the virus to a new reduced set point. The P cells' expansion is driven by a selective advantage they possess over U cells, which derives from a reduced susceptibility to infection. The expansion thus slows down as the viral load declines.</p>

<title>Infection dynamics under gene therapy and the dependence of the viral suppression gain on the inhibition factor and on the thymus contribution.</title>
<p>(A) Dynamics in the absence of viral resistance. Simulations were performed with default parameter values (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). (B) The suppression gain (<italic>G</italic>) is the ratio between the viral loads in the pre-therapy and post-therapy steady states of the baseline model (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for an explicit expression). It depends linearly on the inhibition factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (x-axis) and is depicted on a logarithmic scale. The inset (depicted on a linear scale) demonstrates that decreasing the inhibition factor below a few percent has negligible contribution to viral suppression. The pre-therapy steady state becomes the stable solution when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is approximately 0.98 (not shown). All parameters were set to their default values (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). (C) The thymus' relative contribution (x-axis) is the fraction of the total T-cell mortality that is replaced by the export of mature cells from the thymus, as opposed to by self-proliferation of the T-cell pool. The suppression gain is inversely proportional to it and diminishes quickly. HAART-like gains may be achievable only for diminutive relative contributions. When the contribution is sufficiently large, no viral reduction is obtained, and the pre-therapy steady state becomes the stable solution (not shown). In order to keep the pre-therapy conditions fixed for all points, the proliferation rates and parameters were adjusted to compensate for a varying thymus input. Other parameters were set to their default values (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section).</p>

<p>In comparison to post-HAART behavior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rong1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Simon1">[40]</xref>, three substantial differences are clear: the heterogeneity of the target-cell population, the slow nature of the response, and the limited reduction in viral load. In particular, HAART blocks viral replication on nearly the entire target-cell population, resulting in a rapid viral decline. This is in contrast to our model, where the U cells experience only a slight decline, and continue to facilitate viral replication, albeit at lower volumes due to their reduced turnover rates. In addition, HAART takes effect promptly and comprehensively, whereas gene therapy induces a gradual depletion of the U-cell supply, fueled by the inherently slow process of P cell accumulation. To summarize, the two approaches exhibit different mechanisms of action: brute-force disruption of viral activity by blocking access to existing resources (HAART) versus draining the supply of those resources in favor of more robust ones (gene therapy). Since gene therapy profoundly re-structures the blood system to render it less susceptible to HIV, it is slow to exert its effects. Yet, only innate changes of this kind can facilitate sustained virus control with limited medical intervention. HAART, on the other hand, is quick to act, but once interrupted, results in immediate viral rebound and thus necessitates a strict lifelong adherence to an elaborate drug regimen.</p>

<title>Therapy efficacy</title>
<p>We developed metrics and analysis to quantify the therapy's potency in suppressing the virus. Within this work, we assumed that infectivity is inhibited by a factor of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We further assumed that virion production in infected P cells is completely eliminated, which can be realized by inserting additional antiviral genes that target late stages of the infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rossi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Kiem1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer3">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Egelhofer1">[43]</xref>. Importantly, both infectivity inhibition and progeny suppression contribute similarly to disrupting viral replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rong1">[39]</xref>; however, the former is essential to the expansion of P cells, whereas the latter does not confer them with any selective advantage. Due to very low dosages of infused cells, progeny suppression alone would only exert a weak and transient effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>; however, by providing a selective advantage to modified cells, infectivity inhibition allows the P cells to reach therapeutic levels and, in combination with progeny suppression, provide the latter with the opportunity to further disrupt HIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>. This can be thought of as an “ideal” best-case scenario, which elucidates the ultimate potential of infection inhibition. We also compared the ideal case to the baseline case, where virion production is unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and found that for currently plausible <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values (a few percent or less <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann2">[44]</xref>), the differences in dynamics were negligible. We thus performed steady-state analysis of the best-case model and found that despite the complex suppression mechanism, the degree of viral reduction depends only on three parameters: the inhibition factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the thymus-input rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the infected-cell life span <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for explicit expression).</p>
<p>We define the <italic>suppression gain G</italic> to be the ratio between pre-therapy and post-therapy steady-state viral loads, and the expression for this metric (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section) enables analysis of the system's dependencies on key parameters. Interestingly, <italic>G</italic> depends linearly on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g002">Figure 2B</xref> (note that <italic>G</italic> is depicted on a logarithmic scale). It ranges between a maximum of nearly two logs at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and zero at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> very close to 1. From a therapy design perspective, the important point here is that there is negligible incremental benefit for highly potent inhibition, especially when going below the reasonably achievable levels of a few percent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann2">[44]</xref> (shown in the inset). This finding echoes previous predictions that were derived from different models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>. However, as we shall see later, potent inhibition is instrumental in controlling viral resistance and hence should not be overlooked.</p>
<p>In addition, <italic>G</italic> has an inversely-proportional dependence on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is expressed in terms of the thymus' relative contribution to overall T cell renewal, a measure that is proportional to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. One can see that significant gains are achievable for extremely small thymus contributions, but they quickly diminish up to a point of no viral reduction, in which case the post-therapy set point becomes unstable. This indicates that the bone-marrow contribution can significantly undermine the ability to achieve considerable viral declines. Although its relative contribution is known to decay with age and to account for a small fraction of the T cell renewal in adults, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has not been accurately quantified to date, and current estimates range from a tiny fraction to more than one tenth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Murray1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lamar1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Douek1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Mackall1">[48]</xref>. Quantifying <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> thus constitutes an important step in understanding the potential clinical benefits and limitations of a T-cell based approach. A possible way to circumvent such limitations is by enhancing the P cells proliferative capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>, and we will examine it later from the viewpoint of viral resistance.</p>

<title>Emergence and Fixation of Resistant Mutants</title>
<p>The integration of resistance into our model gives rise to an additional therapy characteristic, namely, a genetic barrier <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which we define as the number of mutations that the virus must accumulate in order to completely overcome inhibition by P cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). To preserve the simplicity and tractability of the model, we assumed that a mutant's phenotype is determined by the number of accumulated mutations, but not by their actual identity or location (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). In other words, strains that possess different combinations of <italic>m</italic> mutations are phenotypically indistinguishable. Our model limits the mutational effects to modified infection rates (i.e., varying attenuations of WT's infection rate) for two reasons. First, this is the most likely route to escape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>. Second, it is the most effective one, since once the P cells expand and the increased infection rates allow the virus to infect significant portions of them, only then virion production can exert meaningful effects. As gene therapy involves two cell populations, the model accounts for contradicting effects on both cell types, as follows. On one hand, resistance confers the virus an improved ability to infect P cells, while on the other hand, the accumulation of mutations in key regions of the virus targeted by the therapy can also be associated with a reduction in fitness in the absence of therapy, that is, in U cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Leonard2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Pena1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Montville1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Krakauer1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Collins1">[52]</xref>. The model assumes that both effects gradually escalate with each additional mutation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Montville1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Collins1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Bonhoeffer1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Doyon1">[54]</xref>. Since our model attempts to broadly apply to several techniques, it perceives the genetic barrier as a general property and disregards its specific origins. A large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> may thus correspond to several inhibitors acting concomitantly, or to a single inhibitor whose interaction with the virus spans a large domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>. A similar interpretation applies to the inhibition factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>We performed stochastic simulations with our model and aggregated the mutants' densities according to number of mutations, such that all strains with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mutations (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) count as one species. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows the outcome of a typical simulation of the stochastic trajectory when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It demonstrates an accumulation of increasingly fitter mutants at the expense of less competent pre-existing (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and early-appearing mutants (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Mutants that possess higher numbers of mutations (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are increasingly more competent, and eventually reach levels that give rise to even fitter strains (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), which soon outgrow them. In the presence of highly resistant strains, the P cells lose their advantage and decline (not shown). Note that the decline of pre-existing mutants with one or two mutations is a consequence of both the drop in the WT viral population, which continuously feeds the mutants populations, and of their susceptibility to therapy. However, the decline is slow, thereby constituting a major obstacle for gene therapy, as it fuels progressive mutation accumulation and expedites the emergence of non-existing resistant strains. In contrast, under HAART, pre-existing strains swiftly drop to very low levels, and while still present, their mutation into more resistant strains is severely confined by their small absolute numbers.</p>

<title>Dynamics of resistance evolution in a typical hybrid stochastic-deterministic simulation.</title>
<p>Following T cell infusion, a decline in wild-type (WT) virus and pre-existing mutants is accompanied by the emergence of fitter and highly resistant mutants. Mutant strains are aggregated according to the number of resistance mutations they carry (<italic>m</italic>), which determines their resistance phenotype. Carrying more mutations renders a strain more resistant, with the most resistant strain carrying <italic>n</italic> = 6 mutations. Stochastic effects are observed at very low densities, where advantageous mutations experience drifts before accumulating to critical levels which enable their consistent expansion. Populations whose density decreases below a pre-defined threshold (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> entities per µL) are considered extinct until they resurface. In this simulation, the total mutant density reaches WT density at approximately 550 days after infusion, marking the fixation of the resistant strain. Simulation was performed with default parameter values (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section).</p>

<p>The stochasticity that arises from the random effects that dominate at small population sizes can be seen for existing mutants with three mutations and for newly emerging mutants. New advantageous mutations occur at random and may drift away before reaching critical levels, thereby delaying emergence in comparison to fully-deterministic trajectories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rouzine1">[18]</xref>. As delays build up along the evolutionary process, larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s are progressively associated with increasingly varying fixation times of highly resistant strains (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s001">Figure S1</xref>). As a result of this stochasticity, it is striking that two “identical” patients (i.e., infected with the “same” virus) can experience remarkably different clinical outcomes.</p>
<p>As a measure of the treatment's efficacy, we computed the fixation time, defined as the time required for the resistant strains to reach 50% of the viral population. Treatment was considered successful if fixation had not occurred within four years of its initiation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4A–4C</xref> provides an overview of the three figures of merit by which we evaluate a treatment. Each point in the plots summarizes the results of 500 simulations with default parameter values (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). The blue curves correspond to a standard application of gene therapy, as discussed above, whereas the red curves correspond to a more advanced strategy and will be discussed in a later subsection. At this point, we limit discussion to the blue curves. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4A</xref> shows how the fraction of successful treatments, called the success rate, varies with the genetic barrier <italic>n</italic>. Interestingly, success rates exhibit a threshold-like behavior, which was found to be typical with many other parameter choices (not shown). Such an effect becomes important when one considers combining several gene-based inhibitors within a P cell as a means of increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. If a therapy is near the threshold, the addition of an inhibitor can make a dramatic difference in its efficacy. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows average fixation times for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s for which therapy success rates were below 0.9 (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). As expected, larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s result, on average, in prolonged viral suppression. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4C</xref> shows the average of the corresponding viral load reductions (i.e., the inverses of the suppression gain) obtained at the fixation time.

<title>Replication Fitness over a Heterogeneous Target Environment</title>
<p>The notion of <italic>replication fitness</italic> has long been used for understanding HIV's evolution under HAART <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Goudsmit1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Maree1">[56]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Wu1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Dykes1">[58]</xref>. It is a model-derived measure of a strain's ability to expand over time in a given environment, and provides a tool for understanding and predicting clinical outcomes. This measure, however, was derived from HAART models and does not apply to gene therapy, whereby HIV is faced with a mixed cell composition and may display different replication traits within each cell subpopulation. We used our model to extend this notion to the case of a heterogeneous target-cell environment (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s005">Text S1</xref> for derivation).

(1), yield an overall replication fitness. Importantly, <italic>U</italic> and <italic>P</italic> are time dependent, and so <italic>F</italic> varies as therapy progresses. Yet, changes to <italic>U</italic> are minor in our model, and <italic>P</italic> transiently increases until it saturates.</p>
<p>Eq. (1) encapsulates the key determinants of viral resistance and provides insights into therapeutic design tradeoffs. We illustrate this point with a simple example. Consider a potent therapy that inhibits WT's infectivity with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and suppose that the U and P cell densities both equal <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cells/µL. The WT virus' fitness is then given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Consider two strategies to weaken the virus: applying a tenfold-stronger infectivity inhibition (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) or interrupting its normal function such that it experiences a modest fitness loss of 5% (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) but the same inhibition as before (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The corresponding changes to the replication fitness amount to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the first case, compared to a more favorable <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the latter case. Even starting with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and applying a 100-fold decrease (yielding the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) attains only a decrease of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the first case, which is somewhat more comparable to the losses from the moderate 5% replicative cost. Clearly, realistic tradeoffs depend on the U and P densities as well as on simultaneous changes in all parameter values, but this example stresses the different impact of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on controlling viral replication. It shows that viral fitness in the U cell pool plays an important role in restraining replication, provided that mutations are associated with a replicative cost, and that powerful protection in P cells has a modest contribution in comparison. Next, we use simulations to show that modest fitness penalties can impede resistance as effectively as major increases in potency.</p>

<title>Effects of Fitness Cost and Inhibition Potency</title>
<p>To further explore the roles of mutational fitness cost and inhibition potency in controlling resistance, we simulated the model over a wide range of parameters. We first varied the average fitness cost that the virus incurs with each additional mutation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), while fixing all other parameters at their default values. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g005">Figure 5A–5B</xref> shows success-rate and fixation-time graphs, spanning a range of fitness costs. As expected, greater fitness penalties hamper escape and shift the “success threshold” towards lower <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s. Increased penalties also delay therapy failure (fixation time), allowing for greater viral reductions (not shown). One can also see that it is essential for gene therapy to target viral functionalities for which resistant mutations incur non-negligible costs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>

The data summarize the outcomes of 500 simulation runs per each parameter set, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4</xref>. In each panel, different colors are used to depict different parameter values, with black depicting the default case. The plots demonstrate that increasing the fitness cost (lowering <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and decreasing the inhibition factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> both result in prolonged viral suppression. This is manifested in improved success rates and in delayed resistance emergence. Panels C and D depict the effects of varying the inhibition factor for two distinct fitness costs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), illustrating the tradeoff between the two factors. It can be seen that a tenfold increase in inhibition (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is as effective as a slight decrease in fitness cost (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Panels C and D also point out that minor fitness costs (e.g., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) must be compensated by powerful inhibition (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in order to attain long-term suppression with potentially achievable genetic barriers (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).</p>

Here, the inhibition was amplified tenfold each time, resulting in meaningful improvements.

The tradeoffs between the two factors are exemplified by the two sets of nearly overlapping curves (shown in dashed lines), which correspond to a tenfold increase in inhibition coupled with a slight decrease in fitness cost.</p>
<p>While mutational fitness cost for viral replication in the U cell pool appears to dominate resistance dynamics, our simulations also indicate that powerful inhibition can in fact control the virus, and constitutes an important design criterion. It takes effect by weakening early mutants, such that for a given <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, more mutations are needed to reach a sufficiently fit virus. One means to achieve increased potency may be through combination therapy, provided that the individual effects are multiplicative. Nonetheless, to the best of our knowledge, the incremental contributions of single therapies within an ensemble have not been determined to date.</p>

<title>Divide and Conquer – An Effective Strategy to Combat Resistance</title>
<p>Combination therapy has traditionally been the treatment of choice against the rapidly mutating HIV-1. Simultaneous targeting of several functional domains slows down resistance by concurrently increasing the genetic barrier and strongly suppressing replication. Gene therapy adopted this principle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-terBrake1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Li1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Kiem1">[41]</xref>, but more importantly, opened the door to a new combination strategy that has hitherto been infeasible, that is, of combining targets across cell populations as opposed to within individual cells.</p>
<p><italic>Ex vivo</italic> gene transduction provides the clinician with control over the destination of delivered drugs, which, in turn, enables the infusion and <italic>in vivo</italic> expansion of distinct P cell pools, each containing different inhibitors that target distinct viral functionalities. In this setting, a strain that resists one inhibitor is confined to replicate only on a fraction of the P cell population, and is still suppressed within the rest of it until it acquires additional mutations. The idea, then, is to limit the resources available to the evolving virus by forming sub-populations of P cells.</p>
<p>We illustrate this principle and explore its potential using a computational model (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s005">Text S1</xref>). Since this strategy can be used on top of any gene therapy technique, it represents an additional mechanism to combat resistance. We thus seek to quantify its added value compared to using homogeneous protection. Our model considers two gene therapies, P1 and P2, targeting distinct viral functions such that cross-resistance between them is excluded. This may apply, for example, to binding and/or fusion inhibitors (P1) combined with integrase and/or reverse-transcriptase inhibitors (P2). Both therapies are modeled as equally powerful - they display the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and same <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and each may correspond to one or to several concurrent inhibitors. When introduced into two cell populations, they divide the P cells into two smaller sub-populations and give rise to a complex quasispecies environment with viral strains that display a range of resistance levels to one or both therapies. The baseline case, as captured by the previously discussed model, corresponds to use of just one of these therapies.</p>
<p>The resulting average fixation times and success rates were compared to their single-therapy counterparts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4A–4B</xref>). We found that fixation times improved gradually (but modestly) throughout the entire range, until a dramatic increase in favor of therapy combination took place at <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). The same effect is manifested as a meaningful shift in the success-rate curve in favor of combination therapy - it suffices to use two therapies with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e093" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as opposed to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e094" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is required for a successful stand-alone approach (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4</xref> pertains to simulations performed with default parameter values, but we observed the same trend for a wide range of other parameter values, with some variation in the position (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e095" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the dramatic shift (data not shown). Simulations with three distinct therapies showed further improved gains at all levels, as expected (data not shown). We conclude from our findings that this approach is powerful when used judiciously within the “right” <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e096" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> range.</p>

<title>To Split or Not to Split – Comparison of Combinatorial Strategies</title>
<p>Another interesting question is how the added value of splitting therapies across cells compares with the added value of increasing the genetic barrier.

In light of these challenges, splitting therapies may offer an alternative to pursuing large multi-component payloads.</p>
<p>We used our model to answer the following question: is it more beneficial to use two therapies whose genetic barrier is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e098" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or to invest the effort to design one therapy with an enhanced barrier <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e099" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>? We show that there is not a definitive answer to this question, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g006">Figure 6A</xref> for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e100" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

(A) The efficacies of the two strategies are compared in terms of their resultant average fixation times, for three different inhibition factors (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). All other parameters are set to their default values (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section).

<p>We interpret our ambiguous results by examining the viral replication fitness (Eq. (1)) under both conditions. Consider a resistant strain <italic>M</italic> whose replication fitness equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. When two therapies are split across cells, one can think of it as downsizing the pool of P cells susceptible to <italic>M</italic> by a factor of two, corresponding to a replication fitness of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e110" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. On the other hand, an enhanced genetic barrier typically renders the mutants less resistant than before the enhancement, as they now need to overcome additional inhibitory mechanisms. In our model, this is reflected in a smaller inhibition factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which should be compared to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. An important point here is that in practice, the extent of decrease from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is case-dependent.

Our results are therefore model-specific, yet they support our main point that the answer is nontrivial and that strategies should be compared on a case basis.</p>
<p>We further linked our findings to the suggested interpretation by computing the ratios <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In our model, resistance is a function of the number of mutations, giving rise to five distinct ratios <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each case considered, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g006">Figure 6B</xref>.

The correlation between the ratios and the advantageous strategy can be readily observed – the more potent a therapy is (i.e., smaller <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the sooner the ratio curve crosses one, at which point the single-therapy strategy imposes stronger inhibition. For example, in the weakest therapy case (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the curve is entirely below one, which means that the “splitting strategy” presents the virus with harsher conditions throughout its escape route. In the other extreme case (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), a single therapy exerts stronger inhibition fairly early in the evolutionary process, even on pre-existing mutants. The middle case shows mixed effects, which balance out to yield similar fixation times.</p>
<p>In our analysis, we assumed that increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has no implications for therapy potency, or in other words, that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is independent of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, when an increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is achieved by the insertion of additional genes into each P cell, it may be reasonable to assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> concomitantly becomes smaller. If we further assume that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> decreased tenfold during the transition to a larger <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then our simulations indicate that fixation times are consistently longer for the single therapy regimen (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). As we already emphasized, this might be a model-specific prediction that may not hold true under other conditions, but we can certainly state that a simultaneous decrease in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> renders the single-therapy strategy more powerful than before. Finally, we stress that such scenario-specific results stand in contrast to the comparison we made earlier, where we found that splitting equally-powerful therapies across cell populations is always advantageous over using one of them alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of Proliferation Enhancement</title>
<p>As we showed earlier, the potential reductions in viral load under gene therapy are limited in comparison to HAART (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> to enhance the selective advantage of P cells by extending their proliferation capacity are being explored, as a means of boosting their expansion, such that lower viral set points could be attained. Proposed techniques include expression of stimulatory interleukins, microRNAs, and telomerase reverse transcriptase (hTERT) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-June1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rowley1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Chen1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Dagarag1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hsu1">[65]</xref>. While each technique carries the risk of uncheck proliferation that could result in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Roth1">[66]</xref>, engineering additional safety controls could eventually solve this problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-June1">[34]</xref>. We chose to consider the idea of proliferation enhancement even though the underlying technology is not fully developed yet, so that we can better understand its impact on the emergence of resistance.</p>
<p>The potential gains from proliferation enhancement were previously illustrated by von Laer <italic>et al.</italic>'s modeling study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer1">[21]</xref>, and our baseline model displays similar trends of reduction in the viral load. Since latently infected cells are precluded from the model, a sufficiently powerful enhancement can in fact eradicate the virus. It also expedites P cell accumulation, thereby intensifying the selective pressure on the virus soon after therapy begins, but at the same time accelerating viral decline (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s002">Figure S2</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g007">Figure 7A–7C</xref> shows the outcomes of simulations of viral evolution under this strategy, with a range of improved proliferative abilities and with default parameter values. We modeled enhanced proliferation as a constant percentage increase in the proliferation rate of P cells with respect to U cells, represented by a factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). We found that enhancing proliferation consistently expedited the fixation of resistant strains and, as explained below, seemingly paradoxically improved the success rates. Overall, the improvements are modest, and gains diminish with increasing <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The major therapeutic benefit of this approach is in improved viral reduction before resistance emerged, despite the faster emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). In particular, improvements become major for large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s, amounting to one to two logs. Note that under such conditions, early-appearing mutants that are weakly resistant to therapy may reach 50% of the viral population at very low densities sometime during WT's decline to extinction, albeit without expanding much further. We therefore modified the definition of fixation to exclude cases where the entire viral population continues to circulate well below detectable levels (e.g., 0.01/µL).</p>

A factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> stands for a constant boost (of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> percent) to the proliferation rate of P cells in comparison to the proliferation rate of U cells.

Each point summarizes the outcomes of 500 simulation runs with default parameter values, similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4</xref>. Success rates consistently improve as a consequence of proliferation enhancement (A), but when the virus escapes, fixation is generally expedited (B). Major improvements in viral reductions take place before fixation occurs (C).</p>

<p>The shortened fixation times are not surprising and reflect a combined influence of acceleration in both WT's decline and P-cell expansion. As P cells accumulate, the selective pressure on the virus builds up and fuels the expansion of resistant strains. P cell levels are also higher, which further assists those strains. In light of these factors, it is rather surprising that success rates gradually improved with further enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We attribute this result to a strong counteractive effect of the drastic viral decline and extinction, which cuts down the <italic>de novo</italic> generation of highly resistant strains. It is also worth noting that we further explored resistance dynamics when proliferation is impaired (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), as that may reflect current conditions in gene therapy trials. Therapy effects on the entire viral population are weakened and slowed down in this case, and so, as expected, lesser gains from therapy are associated with weaker and delayed resistance (data not shown).</p>
<p>The effects of proliferation enhancement resemble those of the intensification of traditional anti-HIV drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Nowak2">[16]</xref>, and, in fact, the similarity to post-HAART dynamics manifests itself in another way – it allows the P cells to “take over” the immune system. This is because sufficiently intense proliferation renders them advantageous even in the absence of HIV, allowing them to populate the system at the expense of a dwindling U cell reservoir (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Fitter P cells occupy bigger portions of the immune system and bring it closer to HAART's homogenous conditions. To summarize, in the absence of resistance, proliferation enhancement constitutes an important step towards achieving HAART-like performance. However, when resistance is accounted for, this strategy may be associated with adverse effects and may prove beneficial under limited conditions.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We developed a computational model of HIV-1's evolutionary dynamics in the presence of gene therapy to study its long-term efficacy against the virus. We used the model to quantify the contributions of key therapy-design parameters and different treatment strategies to the suppression of viral resistance. We find that when judiciously designed, gene therapy has the potential to provide long-term suppression of HIV-1, but meeting this goal requires highly powerful and robust antiviral genes, which may not be currently available. In particular, large barriers, ranging from 5 to 9 (depending on therapy parameters), are needed in order to guarantee that viral suppression below a few percent of pre-therapy loads lasts at least four years. In addition, gene therapy is characterized by very slow dynamics in comparison to HAART, as a consequence of its inherently different mechanism of action. In particular, it can take about two years to reach a new viral set point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). This, in turn, makes a long-lasting resistance control even more critical, if one aims to fully realize the therapy's clinical benefits. We find that delaying resistance emergence merely to the point of reaching a new steady-state viral set point still requires fairly large genetic barriers, which are only slightly smaller than those required for a four-year viral control.</p>
<p>We find that two controllable parameters play a key role in delaying emergence of resistance – the replicative fitness cost associated with mutation (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and the therapy's inhibition factor (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Our results demonstrate that intensifying both factors can severely impair the competence of mutants, and thereby offset the effects of a significant mutational influx of newly emerging strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Our analysis stressed the difference between the ways by which the two factors <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> take effect, where the mutational fitness cost acts primarily by hindering viral replication in U cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) and the inhibition potency serves to hinder the virus as it replicates in P cells. This brings into attention a major difference between gene and traditional therapies, namely that gene therapy leaves a major fraction of the target cells unprotected. As it turns out, one can harness this apparent weakness to improve virus control. Our model predictions support this by showing that small relative decreases in the average fitness cost per mutation dramatically improve success rates and delay resistance emergence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The fitness of mutants in the U cell reservoir, thus, plays an important role here, and targeting highly conserved regions may prove to be particularly beneficial for gene therapy. These results also stress the importance of assessing the fitness of resistant mutants on cultures of unprotected cells as part of a therapy's evaluation.</p>
<p>Our model predicts that sufficiently potent inhibition also provides a powerful means for preventing the development of resistance. However, major amplifications in potency are required in order to achieve benefits that are comparable to those attainable by minor relative changes in fitness cost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For example, we find that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s as low as 10<sup>−4</sup> can successfully hamper resistance when combined with a barrier <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Whether such <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s are practical or not is yet to be determined. Combination therapy, possibly involving different gene-based techniques, may provide a viable approach to achieving this goal, and may simultaneously feature large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rossi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Scherer1">[14]</xref>. Nonetheless, its promise depends on the synergistic interaction between multiple concurrent agents. For example, potent inhibition may be achieved when their joint potency (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) amounts to the product of their individual <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s, rather than to their sum. Importantly, such cumulative effects have not yet been quantified or validated in the context of gene therapy. Note also that the importance of highly potent inhibition in preventing resistance stands in contrast to its negligible contribution in reducing the sensitive virus load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).</p>
<p>The methods presented above are conventional approaches to enhancing an antiretroviral treatment's efficacy, as applied to gene therapy. However, there are supplementary, less obvious, ways to boost gene therapy's performance, which are not possible with HAART. One such method is to combine multiple therapies <italic>across</italic> cells such that the P cells form several sub-populations, where each population is susceptible to different viral strains. We illustrated this novel principle through simulations of an abstracted model, which considers several distinct and equally powerful therapies. Our results demonstrate that dramatic improvement in success rates as well as in fixation times can be obtained in this manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g004">Figure 4</xref>). However, these occur only within a certain window of genetic barriers. When applied outside this window, improvements are modest, albeit increasing with increasing number of therapies. One must therefore reliably characterize the individual therapies before attempting such a strategy.</p>
<p>It is also interesting to compare the improvements obtained by splitting therapies to those obtained by increasing the genetic barrier of a single therapy. We find that the “winning” strategy varies, depending on the therapy parameters and on the resistance spectrum of intermediate mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g006">Figure 6</xref>). The comparison result particularly depends on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and on whether it decreases while <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> increases. It is reasonable to expect that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would decrease when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is extended by an insertion of additional therapeutic genes, as long as they exert their effects via distinct independent pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Li1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Scherer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Kiem1">[41]</xref>. In this case, our model predicts that a single improved therapy will perform at least as well as a two-therapy approach. If this is not the case, it is difficult to predict the overall effect on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and which strategy performs better. An example of the latter case is a combination of RNAi targets, which is constrained by a maximum tolerable level of siRNA molecules so as to avoid toxicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Grimm1">[67]</xref> and competition for cellular resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Castanotto1">[68]</xref>. It is possible that overall inhibition power may not decrease or may even increase under such constraints, especially when numerous targets are involved. Although combination gene therapy has been extensively studied via experiments over the past few years, we are unaware of any quantitative results that can be used within our model. Nonetheless, our analysis points out the key parameters which need to be quantified in order to compare the two options, namely, the therapies' entire spectrum of inhibition potencies.</p>
<p>Gene therapy pressures the virus indirectly by way of a slow P cell expansion, and its limitations derive from the persistence of U cells. It has been argued that it could be improved by boosting proliferation of P cells, such that they outcompete U cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer3">[42]</xref>. We explored the implications of such strategy on resistance dynamics and observed mixed effects on clinical outcomes: the likelihood of viral escape is decreased for a narrow range of genetic barriers, but when escape does occur, it occurs more rapidly than without enhancement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Overall, both effects are moderate, even for increases of 30%–40% in proliferative activity. In light of our results, it is worth noting that this technique is appealing for other reasons. It induces rapid viral decline, powerfully suppresses WT virus, and facilitates an extensive re-population of the immune system with P cells. These major improvements may be associated with further clinical advantages that are not captured by our model, such as the recovery of the lymphocyte homeostasis mechanism, which is believed to be impaired in the presence of high HIV load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Douek1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-McCune1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Ribeiro1">[70]</xref>.</p>
<p>It is also worthwhile to consider alternative ways for gene therapy to overcome its limitations. Resorting to hematopoietic stem cells may not suffice, as simulations we conducted show that when the infused fraction is small, both approaches are confined by the same factors and exhibit similar dynamics and efficacies (data not shown). Only when large fractions are infused, can meaningful improvements over T-cell-based methods be obtained (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This is concerning in light of results of recent clinical trials which indicate that current delivery efficiencies reach several percent at best <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rossi1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Kiem1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Mitsuyasu1">[71]</xref>. A potentially promising way to overcome this limitation is by including a selectable genetic marker in the antiviral payload that renders the P cells resistant to a chemotherapeutic agent, to which stem cells are normally sensitive. It thereby allows for their chemotherapeutic selection and expansion <italic>in vivo</italic>. Recent progress in this direction is encouraging, as substantial selective expansions were observed in large animal models that were treated with such drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Neff1">[72]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Maier1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Trobridge1">[74]</xref>, suggesting that these may be used with humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-DiGiusto1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Trobridge1">[74]</xref>. Another option is to ablate the immune system to make space for the P cells, and despite its associated risks, is it currently applied in a number of ongoing clinical trials <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Cohen1">[75]</xref>. From a modeling perspective, these approaches can be captured by increasing the fraction of infused stem cells. Our simulations then suggest that the effects of increased fractions on resistance dynamics are qualitatively similar to those of proliferation enhancement, although they are more modest (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s004">Figure S4</xref>). At any rate, a more elaborate modeling study of stem-cell delivered therapy is required to map the conditions that facilitate considerable responses. This exceeds the scope of this work but the ideas and models presented here are readily applicable to this case.</p>
<p>Gene therapy could also potentially be combined with HAART, so as to benefit from HAART-induced suppression. The problem with this approach is that HIV is the driving force behind the expansion of P cells, and their selective advantage over U cells becomes small with decreasing viral loads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-vonLaer3">[42]</xref>. It thus appears that methods for stimulating P cell proliferation and/or selection must be developed, such that the P cells can accumulate independently of the infection, and can then be effectively combined with HAART. Moreover, these methods can then leverage on a broad range of agents, including a variety of RNA-based inhibitors (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Rossi1">[4]</xref>), which may not propel sufficient cell expansion, but do provide powerful viral suppression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s005">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>A number of simplifying assumptions were incorporated into our model to retain its generality and tractability. First, we assumed a fixed incremental effect of each subsequent mutation on a strain's phenotype. In reality, individual effects depend on the actual mutational composition and on order of appearance, and not all mutational routes yield a viable virus. We therefore neglected epistatic interactions between mutations and parameterized only the average incremental contribution. Second, we assumed that fitness in P cells is monotonically increasing with a mutant's order, and thus mutants of sufficiently high order always thrive under therapy conditions, and will likely emerge if generated. Other choices of fitness functions, such as ones that are non-monotonic or monotonic but assigning lower fitnesses to all strains, can render such high-order mutants less competent. Such choices would result in quantitatively different (more optimistic) emergence statistics, and would mostly depend on therapy effects on pre-existing mutants. Clearly, once data for specific therapies become available, the model should be revised to generate more precise predictions, but at this point, we focus on capturing the key features involved in the development of viral resistance, namely, the tradeoffs between the effects of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These qualitative findings do not depend on the monotonicity assumption since the same factors determine the ability of pre-existing strains to outgrow in the mixed-cell environment. The ideas and analysis pertaining to combinatorial approaches also apply regardless of the mutants order and are not function-specific. However, the effects of proliferation enhancement may differ under non-monotonic fitness assignments and should be revisited once relevant data are available.</p>
<p>We also assigned equal mutational fitness costs to replication in both cell types, which may not always apply. This implies that a strain is never fitter in P cells than in U cells, and matches recent experimental findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Leonard2">[23]</xref> (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). However, if highly resistant strains replicate better in P cells, our predictions are over-optimistic - they provide upper bounds on therapy efficacy and overestimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s impact on escape. Another simplification entails neglecting escape routes that are unlikely under HAART but may be selected in mixed cell compositions. Consider, for example, a strain with several mutations that partially resists therapy and is less fit than WT in U cells. Suppose that an additional mutation then partially rescues its fitness in U cells and possibly boosts its resistance as well. If such compensatory routes exist, they may be selected in environments where both fitness traits are valuable, and our assumption excluded such possibilities from consideration. Future work may further investigate the consequences of such complex fitness landscapes.</p>
<p>We extended our model to account for the contribution of recombination to the formation and loss of resistant strains. To maintain reasonable model complexity and size (especially for large <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s), we included only simple recombination patterns, whereby mutations from distinct strains are adjoined, and mutations are lost during recombination with WT. The complete details are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000883.s005">Text S1</xref>. We observed very little quantitative effects on the average treatment outcome, even under very high recombination rates. Therefore, in the interest of clarity and simplicity, we omitted recombination from the model. However, a more detailed treatment of recombination, particularly in conjunction with epistatic interactions, may reveal other outcomes, as it was previously shown that recombination effects are pronounced only in the presence of epistasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Bretscher1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Arora1">[77]</xref>. A detailed analysis of this type requires a large dedicated model (see e.g. the work in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Arora1">[77]</xref>) and is not practical when studying a wide range of genetic barriers as was done here. Future work may incorporate such detailed mechanisms for special cases of interest. An additional extension we considered entailed a homeostasis control of thymus input rates as opposed to constant rates, but that did not qualitatively affect our results either (data not shown).</p>
<p>Many of our assumptions can be partially corroborated by <italic>in vitro</italic> assays. For example, it is common practice to characterize the spectrum of potentially resistant mutants through serial passage experiments. In our case, one can assess the attenuated infection rates from single-round infection assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann2">[44]</xref> and reconstruct an approximate “resistance profile”. Similar tests should be conducted with U cells to quantify both fitness traits. Assays with a mixed cell population can serve to probe the fitness landscape and identify mutants that trade their resistance to therapy for recovered fitness in U cells, as these may be selected <italic>in vivo</italic>. Experiments can also help determine the incremental contributions of single agents in combinatorial settings and whether they interact multiplicatively, additively, or in any other way. The real challenge is in extrapolating <italic>in vitro</italic> findings to clinical settings, since these do not fully reflect their <italic>in vivo</italic> counterparts, but yet are indicative of relative competence among strains. Clinical data are invaluable to validating our model, but to the best of our knowledge, sustained P cell expansion has not yet been reported in any clinical trial. Thus, experimental data from animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Kiem1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Trobridge2">[78]</xref> can provide a starting point for better characterizing P cell expansion and viral suppression, by fitting variations of our model to clinical measurements.</p>
<p>To summarize, we use a generalized model of HIV gene therapy to identify both the most effective routes to control the virus and the critical properties of the antiviral genes that must be experimentally assessed during the design of such therapies.</p>

We added two equations that track the densities of healthy P cells (<italic>P</italic>) and productively-infected P cells (<italic>I<sub>P</sub></italic>). These follow similar dynamics, using modified parameter values. Additionally, we modified the T cell dynamics, such that two sources contribute to T cell renewal: a constant influx of naïve T cells from the thymus, and self-proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-DeBoer1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Berzins1">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Jameson1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-ThomasVaslin1">[81]</xref>. Since we consider therapy delivery by T cell infusion, the thymus contribution is limited to U cells. The proliferation mechanism, in contrast, encompasses both cell types, and saturates according to Michaelis-Menten kinetics. This form was derived in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-DeBoer1">[37]</xref> based on the idea that the activation and proliferation of T cells are confined by their competition for antigen-presenting sites. Our formulation also reflects an assumption that the <italic>ex vivo</italic> manipulation of P cells did not compromise their proliferative ability and that they display a normal T cell phenotype. Importantly, both cell types are assumed to equally contribute to saturation, thus equally competing for presence in the T cell pool. In the presence of gene therapy, the model dynamics are governed by the following equations:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e160" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the thymus-input rate, <italic>r</italic> and <italic>h</italic> are Michaelis-Menten constants, <italic>d</italic> is the lymphocyte death rate, <italic>k</italic> is the rate at which WT infects susceptible cells, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the death rate of infected cells, <italic>c</italic> is the virion clearance rate, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the rate of virus production from infected cells.

If the proliferation of the P cells is enhanced, the rate is multiplied by an acceleration factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, yielding a rate <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

Since the viral load maintains the same ratio relative to the infected U cell density in all three cases (i.e., <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e177" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we compare the infected cell densities (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e178" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) between the latter two states, instead of the viral loads.

Combining these estimates yields a maximal suppression gain of approximately two logs. To realize gains comparable to HAART <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Simon1">[40]</xref>, the thymus' relative contribution should be considerably lower than a few percent. We used Eq.

<p>At this point, we note that our choice of the baseline model was guided by a comparison we conducted between this model and a model of a different type of protection, whereby the genes inhibit expression of viral proteins in infected cells rather than infectivity.

<p>We modeled the replication fitness of a mutant as dependent on the number of resistance-conferring sites that are mutated away from their WT form.

However, the reasoning behind our choice is twofold. First, if several protective genes are combined, we assume their inhibitory effects are multiplicative. Partial resistance can then be thought of as escaping a subset of therapies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Curlin1">[86]</xref>. Second, recent experiments with traditional antiretroviral therapies support a similar multiplicative form of declining efficacy with mutation accumulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Doyon1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Arora1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Baxter1">[87]</xref>. In the context of gene therapy, we are aware of one recent work that partially quantified the infectivity inhibition of intermediate mutants under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Hermann1">[10]</xref>, indicating that single-mutation contributions are non-additive and nonlinear, thus further supporting our modeling assumption. Moreover, our understanding of the mechanism of HIV's escape from RNA-mediated inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Lu1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000883-Leonard1">[22]</xref>, where potency correlates with the goodness of match between the genome and the target sequence, further motivates our choice.</p>

<title>Mutations</title>
<p>Our model accounts only for first-order accrual of point mutations, that is, each strain may be added at most a single point mutation at each ODE integration step (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000883-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). For simplicity, we also excluded the reverse mutational process (i.e., towards less-resistant strains), as its contribution is minor due to much-lower densities of higher-order mutants. Our assumptions thus imply that an <italic>m</italic>-order mutant may be directly preceded by each of the (<italic>m</italic>−1)-order mutants whose mutated sites form a subset of its <italic>m</italic> sites. For example, if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e213" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 3-point mutations away from WT (the subscripts label the mutated sites), then its predecessors are the 2-order mutants <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e214" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e215" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e216" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<p>The above assumptions allude to perfect symmetry among same-order mutants, as any <italic>m</italic>-order mutant experiences a fitness cost factor of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e217" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and an inhibition factor of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We exploited it to obtain a smaller and simplified model. For each <italic>m</italic>, we grouped all <italic>m</italic>-order strains into one class and summed the various densities over all class mutants. The resulting equations appear as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e219" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>n</italic> is the order of the fully-resistant mutant, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the aggregate densities per <italic>m</italic>. The multiplicity coefficient (<italic>n</italic>−<italic>m</italic>+1) accounts for the affiliation of each (<italic>m</italic>−1)-order strain with the predecessor sets of multiple <italic>m</italic>-order strains. For example, when <italic>n</italic> = 3, the mutant <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> contributes to the influx of both <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e224" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e225" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<italic>m</italic> = 2), whereas WT contributes to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e226" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e227" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e228" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<italic>m</italic> = 1).

<title>Heterogeneous Protected-Cell Composition</title>
<p>We assumed the availability of two distinct protective-gene cassettes, which target different viral components, and thereby give rise to two non-overlapping sets of resistance-conferring sites, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e231" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000883.e232" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>Stochastic effects that dominate mutant appearance result in large variations in fixation times. Effects of increasingly larger genetic barriers n (x-axis) on the time to fixation (y-axis), which is the time required for the resistant strains to reach 50% of the viral population, measured from therapy initiation at day 0. Each marked point represents the average of at least 50 simulation runs in which fixation occurred within four years from therapy initiation. The bars correspond to one standard deviation. Each curve depicts the aggregate outcome for different parameter choices, where w is a fixed average fitness cost per mutated site and ε is the therapy's inhibition factor (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section for more details). All other parameters were set to their default values. The figure shows that larger n's are associated with increasing variation in fixation time. This is because the stochastic fluctuations of newly emerging mutants build up along the evolutionary process. When n becomes larger, more mutations are needed in order to confer sufficient resistance, and hence the time to fixation of such highly-mutated strains depends on the appearance times of their preceding mutants, which experience random drift as well.</p>

<p>Infection dynamics under enhanced proliferation of protected cells. System dynamics in the absence of viral resistance and when the P cells have a proliferative advantage over the U cells. Enhanced proliferation of P cells was modeled as a constant percentage increase in their proliferation rate compared to the U cells' proliferation rate.

Enhanced proliferation expedites P cell accumulation and viral decline and drives the virus to extinction.

<p>Infection dynamics following infusion of a large fraction of protected stem cells. System dynamics in the absence of viral resistance and when protected stem cells are infused to the patient. Stem cell infusion was modeled by an addition of a constant thymus-export term to the renewal of P cells, and by a reduction in the rate of thymus export to the U cell compartment. The modified terms are determined by the fraction of the protected stem cells in the bone marrow (see the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section). The simulation corresponds to 90% of the stem cells being protected, and to a bone-marrow contribution of 10%, and was performed with default infection and therapy parameter values.
