Radiation-induced foci (RIF) are believed to be located where DNA damage occurs. To test this assumption, we analyzed the spatial distribution of 53BP1, phosphorylated ATM, and γH2AX RIF in cells irradiated with high linear energy transfer (LET) radiation and low LET. Since energy is randomly deposited along high-LET particle paths, RIF along these paths should also be randomly distributed. The probability to induce DSB can be derived from DNA fragment data measured experimentally by pulsed-field gel electrophoresis. We used this probability in Monte Carlo simulations to predict DSB locations in synthetic nuclei geometrically described by a complete set of human chromosomes, taking into account microscope optics from real experiments. As expected, simulations produced DNA-weighted random (Poisson) distributions. In contrast, the distributions of RIF obtained as early as 5 min after exposure to high LET (1 GeV/amu Fe) were non-random. This deviation from the expected DNA-weighted random pattern can be further characterized by “relative DNA image measurements.” This novel imaging approach shows that RIF were located preferentially at the interface between high and low DNA density regions, and were more frequent than predicted in regions with lower DNA density. The same preferential nuclear location was also measured for RIF induced by 1 Gy of low-LET radiation. This deviation from random behavior was evident only 5 min after irradiation for phosphorylated ATM RIF, while γH2AX and 53BP1 RIF showed pronounced deviations up to 30 min after exposure. These data suggest that DNA damage–induced foci are restricted to certain regions of the nucleus of human epithelial cells. It is possible that DNA lesions are collected in these nuclear sub-domains for more efficient repair.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>DNA damages are daily cellular events. If such events are left unchecked in an organism, they can lead to DNA mutations and possibly cancer over a long period of time. Consequently, cells have very efficient DNA repair machinery. Many studies have focused on the different molecular factors involved in the repair machinery, neglecting to consider the spatial context where damage occurs. Therefore, little is known about the role the nuclear architecture might have in the DNA damage response. In this study, we introduce computer modeling and image analysis tools in order to relate the position of DNA damage markers to morphologically distinct regions of the nucleus. Using these tools, we show that radiation-induced damages locate preferentially in non-condensed DNA regions or at the boundary of regions with condensed DNA. These results contradict the current dogma that the molecular response to randomly generated DNA damages is independent of their nuclear locations. Instead, this suggests the existence of repair centers in the nucleus. Overall, our approach shows that nuclear architecture plays a role in the DNA damage response, reminding us that the nucleus is not simply a soup of DNA and proteins.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This research was supported by US National Aeronautics and Space Administration grant T6275W, NASA Specialized Center for Research in Radiation Health Effects.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="12"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Costes SV, Ponomarev A, Chen JL, Nguyen D, Cucinotta FA, et al.

Radiation-induced foci (RIF) are believed to form at or adjacent to sites of DNA damage. However, the use of RIF as an unequivocal indicator of double strand break (DSB) is problematic. The readout of RIF is complex as it is based on optical limitations during image acquisition (e.g., point-spread function (PSF)), non-homogeneity of the detector (i.e., nucleus), and biological kinetics. Our previous work and that of others have suggested that the detection of RIF reflects several factors: (1) the severity of the damage, (2) the efficiency of damage recognition, (3) repair capacity, and (4) the biological function of the specific RIF proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, some reports suggest that there are nuclear regions that are excluded from forming RIF. More specifically, in studies using densely ionizing particles that would lead to continuous DSB along their trajectories, nuclei showed discontinuous MRE11 RIF, with large gaps (&gt;1 μm) in regions where DNA was present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b015">15</xref>]. Finally, others have shown that some types of RIF are not necessarily associated with DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b012">12</xref>].</p><p>In studying DNA damage responses using RIF, how can one interpret results if RIF are not necessarily related to DSB? To sort out these discrepancies, one could compare the spatial distributions of RIF from different radiation qualities and relate them to the expected energy deposition described by physical attributes. We propose to compare γ-rays and high energy particles (HZE), which lead to very distinct spatial distributions of energy deposition. HZE are high-LET radiation and deposit their energy in random clusters along a linear path [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b017">17</xref>]. Their complex physical interactions with cells have been well characterized and therefore can be modeled [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b018">18</xref>]. Cells exposed to HZE provide an excellent model in which to study the relationship between chromatin patterns and energy deposition since energy deposition, and therefore image analysis, is reduced to essentially 1-D linear profiles in a plane of the nucleus. In contrast, γ-rays are low-LET radiation that deposit energy uniformly in a small volume and thus induce single DSB randomly across the nucleus. While these events are easily modeled, characterizing low-LET RIF spatially is more complex since it requires 3-D image analysis of nuclei.</p><p>We have previously used parameters determined by fitting data from DNA fragments sizes measured in pulsed-field gel electrophoresis (PFGE) experiments to show that radiation-induced DSB are generated as a stochastic process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b021">21</xref>]. This assumption has led to computation models that simulate the production of DSB in hypothetical spatial geometries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b023">23</xref>]. In this study, we further refine these models to include higher order nuclear territories such as euchromatin and heterochromatin. Artificial microscope images of RIF and nuclei can then be generated by including optical limitations of light microscopy. We then show that we can predict the DNA damage pattern for any given radiation by generalizing the theoretical model to an image-based model. The central point is to use the image-based model to test the controversial equivalence between RIF and DSB. If RIF are in fact DSB observed at a much lower resolution, then we would predict similar spatial distribution and frequencies. However, our results show that within 5 to 30 min following exposure to high-LET and low-LET radiation, RIF distributions deviate from the predicted DSB distribution. We further show that RIF non-randomly locate in specific regions of the nucleus. This suggests that nuclear organization modulates the DNA damage response of human epithelial cells, which has important implications for understanding DNA damage response and repair mechanisms.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Generation of Pseudo RIF in Synthetic Nuclear Images</title><p>In this approach, the 3-D space was divided into cubic pixels of the size equal to that of microscopy image (i.e., 0.16 μm pixels). DNA in the simulated nucleus was arranged into two types of intermittent bands: dense regions of DNA based on random-walk geometry (heterochromatin), and low-density homogenous regions (euchromatin). DNA double strand breaks (DSB) were simulated by Monte Carlo simulations for single traversal of 1 GeV/amu Fe ions or for exposure to 1 Gy of low-LET radiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b024">24</xref>]. Theoretical DSB are absolute, whereas the visualization and quantitation of RIF are subject to optical limitations during image acquisition. Therefore, to more closely approximate RIF from theoretical DSB, DSB locations were blurred by applying a Gaussian filter with σ = 0.16 μm, determined by the PSF of the microscope. The resulting images were similar to images collected experimentally as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g001">Figure 1</xref>. Applying the Gaussian blurring (Gaussian convolution) to the DSB frequency image produces images with foci-like objects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which we refer to as pseudo-foci (pRIF). pRIF reflects the appearance of DSB at light microscope resolution should they bind enough antibody to emit sufficient fluorescence to be detected. Both high-LET (1 GeV/amu Fe ion tracks) and low-LET simulated images are depicted and compared with real images labeled for the DNA damage marker γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g001">1</xref>B, respectively). One can appreciate from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g001">Figure 1</xref>A the fact that many close-by DSB along high-LET tracks cannot be resolved and end up appearing as large foci, a phenomenon that has been reported previously on experimental data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b011">11</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0030155-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030155.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Comparison between Simulated and Experimental Images for Different Types of Radiation</title><p>(A) Shows RIF within a nucleus traversed by high energy Fe ions (1 GeV/amu Fe).</p><p>(B) shows a nucleus exposed to photons.</p><p>Shown at the top are RIF images of nuclei taken from a microscope (DAPI in blue and DNA damage marker γH2AX in green) 5–10 min post-IR.

The measured frequencies are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030155-t001">Table 1</xref>. For high-LET radiation, we observed excellent agreement between pseudo- and measured RIF, leading to a maximum of 0.73 RIF/μm 4.5 min following exposure to 1 GeV/amu Fe. On the other hand, consistent with our previous findings and those of others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b015">15</xref>], the maximum measured frequencies for low-LET RIF in 3-D volume occurred 30–60 min after exposure and was 60% lower than predictions. Unfortunately, comparing pRIF to RIF at such late time points is difficult to interpret as DSB repair is significant over the first hour following irradiation. Comparing at earlier time points is not ideal either, as RIF frequencies at 4.5 min post-IR were even lower (70% lower than prediction, unpublished data). Note that the PFGE data used to predict DSB in our model do not distinguish DSB from heat-labile sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b025">25</xref>]. However, removing DSB from these sites would not be sufficient to have predictions that match measurements for low LET.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030155-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030155.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>RIF Frequencies in Experimental Data and Simulations for High-LET and Low-LET Radiation</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030155.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left" valign="top"><hr/>Type of Images</td><td valign="top"><hr/>Marker</td><td valign="middle"><hr/>1 GeV/amu Fe (Foci/&mu;m) (4.5 min Post-IR)<sup>a</sup></td><td valign="middle"><hr/>1 Gy of Cs (Foci/Nucleus) (30&ndash;60 min Post-IR)<sup>b</sup></td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td valign="middle">Real</td><td valign="middle">&gamma;H2AX</td><td valign="middle">0.69 &plusmn; 0.03<sup>a</sup></td><td valign="middle">15.9 &plusmn; 0.5<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle">ATMp</td><td valign="middle">0.82 &plusmn; 0.05<sup>a</sup></td><td valign="middle">16.0 &plusmn; 1.9<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle">53BP1</td><td valign="middle">0.76 &plusmn; 0.03<sup>a</sup></td><td valign="middle">16.3 &plusmn; 0.6<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle">Simulations</td><td valign="middle">DSB</td><td valign="middle">1.10 &plusmn; 0.48<sup>c</sup></td><td valign="middle">38.1 &plusmn; 5.9<sup>c</sup></td></tr><tr><td valign="middle">pRIF</td><td valign="middle">0.73 &plusmn; 0.22<sup>c</sup></td><td valign="middle">37.0 &plusmn; 5.5<sup>c</sup></td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p><sup>a</sup>The highest frequency for foci along tracks was measured within the first 5 min following exposure to radiation.

For low-LET simulations, there is little variance between predicted DSB and pRIF. In this case, a 1:1 correspondence between DSB and pRIF is expected since such sparse damage events remain separate after optical blurring. On the other hand, for HZE, the frequency of pRIF and theoretical DSB, both generated in synthetic nuclear images, differ by 30%. The 30% loss between DSB and pRIF is due to clustered DSBs that are not resolvable by light microscopy. Since RIF frequencies match pRIF frequencies for HZE, experimental RIF in this case must represent clustered DSBs at a resolution lower than the original scale of DNA breaks (nm versus μm for microscopy). Interestingly, this also suggests that if damages are more complex or span over a larger DNA range (i.e., cluster of DSBs), it will rapidly induce RIF (within 5 min), whereas a single DSB may not always lead to RIF and/or may have a slower formation kinetic.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Use of an Imaging Approach To Predict DSB Location in Real Images</title><p>pRIF predictions presented previously are based on DNA patterns from hypothetical nuclei, modeled at the nm scale. As described in methods, DSB are predicted to be dependent on DNA density. As such, any given nucleus has a unique DNA imaging pattern and a unique set of spatial probability for radiation-induced DSB. Therefore, we cannot directly predict the DSB patterns in real images and compare their spatial distributions to RIF using a theoretical model of the nucleus.</p><p>To answer such need, we introduce here an imaging methodology that can predict DSB location for any given DNA nuclear pattern from real images. This methodology is based on the same Monte Carlo concepts described in Materials and Methods for the generation of DSBs in artificial nuclei: i.e., the probability of a DSB at a given location is proportional to the DNA density at the same location. This statement is true at high resolution, if each pixel could contain a single DSB. However, this rule may not be true at the sub-micron resolution of a microscope, where each pixel encompasses large amounts of DNA, where neighboring pixels are slightly correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b026">26</xref>], and where individual DSBs are not always resolvable.</p><p>We illustrate our imaging approach using high-LET radiation data, where RIF tracks demarcate the damaged nuclear regions. Within these tracks, spatial 1-D profiles of DNA density and the number of foci (<italic>Nspot</italic>) can be determined (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Assuming that the probability of a RIF at a given location along the track is proportional to the DNA density at that location, one can then compute the probability per unit pixel intensity to have a focus as follows:

On the other hand, even though the main shape of the pRIF distribution was conserved in the reshuffled pRIF distribution, the smaller variations were lost.

The nuclear dye 4′,6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) binds to AT base pairs or to single strands by electrostatic interaction. Therefore, one can assume as a first-order approximation that the pixel intensity in a DAPI image is proportional to the DNA concentration at that location. We therefore used DAPI as an indicator of DNA densities in real images. Primary antibodies to ATMp, γH2AX, or 53BP1 and fluorescently labeled secondary antibodies were used to detect RIF.</p><p>Our results show that distribution of foci along tracks in cells irradiated by 1 GeV/amu Fe deviate from truly random distribution. This deviation increases with time independently of the marker used for damage. This is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g004">Figure 4</xref> for γH2AX, where the distance distribution between consecutive foci is compared with the distribution of reshuffled γH2AX foci at 4.5 and 30 min following exposure to 1 GeV/amu Fe. As early as 4.5 min post-IR, only 60% of the RIF distribution correlated with the distribution of predicted damages (i.e., reshuffled RIF). We predicted that the majority of damages would be less than 1 μm apart. Instead, the majority of measured RIF were more than 1 μm apart. The exclusion of close-by foci in the experimental data also increased with time. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g005">Figure 5</xref>A summarizes these results for all the time points (4.5, 11.5, 31.5, 61.5 min) by plotting the average correlations measured between predicted (i.e., reshuffled foci) and measured distance distribution for the different DNA damage RIF. All RIF show the same trend with an increasing deviation from random distribution over the first hour following exposure to 1 Gy of 1 GeV/amu Fe. Note that the predicted RIF distance distribution is based on reshuffling the exact same number of detected RIF for each individually analyzed track. Therefore, the loss of close-by foci cannot be attributed to their diminishing frequency (shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g005">Figure 5</xref>B).

We can further test these concepts by measuring <italic>Rdna</italic> and <italic>Rgrad</italic> in the simulated data previously discussed where we know what to expect. For 1 GeV/amu Fe simulations, we logically find that <italic>Rdna</italic> values for pRIF are greater than one (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030155-t002">Table 2</xref>), reflecting the fact that generation of damage is proportional to the amount of DNA: i.e., the more DNA, the more likely radiation will produce a break. On the other hand, <italic>Rgrad</italic> values are also larger than 1. This result at first hand might look surprising as one would assume that there should be no preferential location of DSB with respect to nuclear interfaces. However, this result simply reflects the fact that gradient values are larger in denser regions of DNA.

In this work, we extended such models to predict the pattern of radiation-induced DNA damage detected by protein markers in biological images after taking into account the optical properties of the microscopy. Two distinct radiation qualities were considered, low LET (i.e., photons) and high LET (i.e., 1 GeV/amu Fe ions) using this model. DSBs or clusters of DSBs appeared as foci in simulated images or pRIF). We found that the frequency pRIF matched the frequency of RIF from three different markers measured shortly (i.e., 4.5 min) after exposure to 1 GeV/amu Fe. Using these simulations, we noted that Fe tracks had many close-by DSBs that could not be resolved by optical microscopy, which led to larger and fewer foci along these pseudo tracks. This phenomenon was reported previously on experimental data for high-LET tracks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b011">11</xref>]. The fact that frequencies were the same for pRIF and RIF in this case also suggests that when DNA damage extends over large regions in the nucleus it leads to a systematic and rapid formation of focal protein marks. Therefore, RIF are a good indication of DNA damage induced by HZE. In contrast, the frequencies measured for low-LET RIF from 4.5 to 60 min post-IR were reduced by more than 60% from what we predicted. RIF in this case is probably not a good DNA damage marker, suggesting that non-complex DSBs lead to a lower and/or slower RIF response.</p><p>We then introduced an image-based model that could predict DNA damages for low LET or high LET in real nuclear images. This was done by randomly reshuffling the locations of detected foci, using DAPI intensity of each pixel as the probability to have damage at that pixel location. After validating this approach on the simulated nuclei previously analyzed for pRIF frequencies, we applied it to real data. We observed that the majority of RIF along tracks were spaced by gaps larger than 1 μm, whereas our image-based approach predicted the majority of damages to be less than 1 μm apart. This was observed as early as 4.5 min post-IR and the deviation from prediction was even greater at 30 min following exposure. To determine whether this result reflected preferential locations of foci in the nucleus, we introduced a new set of imaging parameters that quantify the location of RIF relative to the nuclear DAPI pattern. Using this tool, we showed for both high-LET and low-LET radiation that RIF were more frequently located in low DNA density regions than predicted by image-based modeling. We also showed that RIF occurred predominantly at the interface between high and low DNA density regions. Interestingly, ATMp did not show as strong a trend as the other markers, supporting its early, but mobile, role in the DNA damage response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b031">31</xref>]. Finally, we measured a rapid increase in the co-localization between different DNA damage markers over the first 10 min following exposure to both radiation qualities.</p><p>We conclude from these studies that nuclear organization plays an important role in the response to DNA damages. Specifically, foci locating preferentially in low DNA density regions suggest that damages occurring in condensed regions of the DNA are not always detected, leading to their lower proportion. Detection in condensed areas might then depend on either local decondensation of the chromatin as suggested by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b033">33</xref>] or movement of the damaged site to more open regions of the chromatin. We tend to be in favor of the DSB movement hypothesis for the following reasons. First, the rapid accumulation of RIF at the interface between high and low DNA density contradict what we know about the way radiation deposits its energy in tissue; second, imaging of HeLa cells transfected with histone H1.2 GFP exposed to a high radiation dose (5 Gy) of X-rays did not show a change in chromatin pattern compared with unexposed cells. Furthermore, it has been shown that some genes become transcriptionally active only upon relocating into open regions of the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b034">34</xref>]. In fact, whole parts of a chromosome have been reported to be able to move over a 1–5 μm path within a few minutes during transcription activation in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b035">35</xref>]. The only way to resolve these hypotheses unequivocally is to use live cell imaging of GFP-fused proteins recruited at the site of DNA damage such as NBS1 or 53BP1 exposed to physiological doses of ionizing radiation.</p><p>Another important aspect of DNA damage response to radiation provided in this work is the fact that damage appears to be spatially organized. Specifically, the lack of foci in close proximity along tracks suggests the existence of discrete self-excluding nuclear regions where DNA damages are clustered. This result supports the existence of “repairosomes” in mammalian cells, which has been suggested by Savage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b037">37</xref>]. These nuclear domains would provide the necessary clamping and orientation for repair to take place but could also lead to translocations or chromosome aberrations when multiple breaks would be simultaneously processed. The existence of “repair centers” has already been shown in yeast <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> where Lisby et al. engineered a system of fluorescently marked DSB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b038">38</xref>]. They showed in such a system that in 40% to 50% of the cases, two individual DSB relocalized into one common focus which was rich in Rad52 proteins. On the other hand, there is no direct evidence of repair centers in mammalian cells, although some reports have suggested their existence. For example, DiBiase et al. hypothesized that Ku proteins might recruit DSB to DNA-PKcs (catalytic subunit of DNA-PK) since it is fixed on the nuclear matrix, allowing fast DNA repair via nonhomologous end-joining [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b039">39</xref>]. More recently, it was also shown that MRN complex “tethers” damaged DNA to help activate ATM by increasing locally the concentration of DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b040">40</xref>]. Therefore, our work adds to this hypothesis by identifying for the first time in mammalian cells morphological features in the nucleus where protein markers of damage response preferentially locate. More work is needed to identify features that define these subnuclear regions.</p></sec><sec id="s4" sec-type="materials|methods"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Cell culture.</title><p>Human mammary epithelial cells (HMEC-184; 184v; passage 7–10) were cultured in serum-free medium as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030155-b041">41</xref>].

The image pixel size was measured to be 0.16 μm, but based on the NA of the objective, the actual resolution of the image in the FITC channel was ∼0.5 × 0.488/NA = 0.26 μm.

All image manipulation and analysis were done with Matlab (MathWorks, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.mathworks.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.mathworks.com/</ext-link>) and DIPimage (image processing toolbox for Matlab, Delft University of Technology, The Netherlands).</p><p>For track analysis, Fe ion tracks were manually identified on the most-in-focus slice in a conventional image stack. Tracks were defined only if there were four or more foci within the nucleus, and if the cells on the stack slice had parallel tracks, reinforcing the assertion that the line in question was the result of a particle traversal and not a simple random alignment of points (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g002">Figure 2</xref>). To keep track of the radial (perpendicular to the track) displacement of foci, a stripe of 0.8 μm width along each track was sampled for the maximum intensity in the direction perpendicular to the track. This led to a 1-D intensity curve with maximal intensities along the track. Herein this curve was called the “maximum intensity profile,” or simply the “1-D profile.” Using the intensity-inverted 1-D profile, foci were detected by searching for local minima along the track using watershed algorithms as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030155-g003">Figure 3</xref>. For cells exposed to γ-rays, 3-D images had to be acquired since foci were not restricted along a line anymore. This made maxima detection more difficult.

The resulting image was then intensity-inverted, and watershed algorithms were applied to detect minima as was done for the 1-D profile.
