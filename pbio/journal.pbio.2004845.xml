<abstract>
<p>FtsZ, the primary protein of the bacterial Z ring guiding cell division, has been recently shown to engage in intriguing treadmilling dynamics along the circumference of the division plane. When coreconstituted <italic>in vitro</italic> with FtsA, one of its natural membrane anchors, on flat supported membranes, these proteins assemble into dynamic chiral vortices compatible with treadmilling of curved polar filaments. Replacing FtsA by a membrane-targeting sequence (mts) to FtsZ, we have discovered conditions for the formation of dynamic rings, showing that the phenomenon is intrinsic to FtsZ. Ring formation is only observed for a narrow range of protein concentrations at the bilayer, which is highly modulated by free Mg<sup>2+</sup> and depends upon guanosine triphosphate (GTP) hydrolysis. Interestingly, the direction of rotation can be reversed by switching the mts from the C-terminus to the N-terminus of the protein, implying that the filament attachment must have a perpendicular component to both curvature and polarity. Remarkably, this chirality switch concurs with previously shown inward or outward membrane deformations by the respective FtsZ mutants. Our results lead us to suggest an intrinsic helicity of FtsZ filaments with more than one direction of curvature, supporting earlier hypotheses and experimental evidence.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>FtsZ is a tubulin homologue and the primary protein of the bacterial Z ring that guides cell division. In vivo, but also in reconstituted systems, FtsZ shows an intriguing treadmilling dynamic along circular tracks of approximately 1 micrometer in diameter. In cells, this treadmilling along the circumference of the division site is suggested to dynamically guide peptidoglycan—and thus new cell wall—synthesis. In vitro, when reconstituted along with its membrane adaptor FtsA on flat supported membranes, FtsZ self-organizes into similarly treadmilling vortices as observed in vivo but with a clear chirality. With the aim of thoroughly investigating these dynamics, revealing the origin of chirality, and potentially relating it to a membrane-transforming ability of FtsZ, we reconstituted different membrane-targeted mutants of FtsZ on flat membranes. In this minimized system, we found that dynamic ring formation is an intrinsic feature of FtsZ without the need of any other protein. However, self-organization into dynamic treadmilling only occurs within a specific protein, cation, and guanosine triphosphate (GTP) concentration range. Our work led us to propose that the observed chirality of FtsZ treadmilling may be explained by an inherent helical character of the filaments with more than one direction of curvature.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>For the fundamental task of cell and organelle division, life has evolved various strategies, many of which are based on ringlike contractile structures assembling from within a compartment to induce binary fission. The exact mechanisms of contraction of these rings are, however, poorly understood due to the plethora of different molecules involved, concealing presumably simple fundamental motifs. The bacterial FtsZ ring is a good example of such a structure. The FtsZ protein, a self-assembling GTPase present in the cytoplasm of most bacteria, is a tubulin homologue and the main component of the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> divisome, the molecular machinery driving cytokinesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref002">2</xref>]. It interacts with additional anchor proteins to form a dynamic ring at the cytoplasmic membrane, which acts as a scaffold to recruit the remaining regulating elements of the divisome and cell wall–building machinery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref003">3</xref>]. Intriguingly, FtsZ filaments were recently found to treadmill circumferentially around the division plane, guiding cell wall synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref005">5</xref>]. In spite of this compositional complexity, the primary role of FtsZ in the contractile ring of many organisms is unquestioned. However, based on the structural analysis of the protein and its assemblies, so far, no decisive model has surfaced for how exactly structural changes within monomers and filaments could be transmitted into large-scale contractile forces [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref006">6</xref>]. Guanosine triphosphate (GTP)-dependent structural changes of FtsZ monomers and membrane-attached filaments toward greater curvatures have been proposed, but evidence has been lacking for how a continuously shrinking membrane orifice could be engineered from them. This is mainly due to the fact that although the closure dynamics of Z rings could be observed in vivo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref008">8</xref>], there is yet no direct proof that purified Z rings may actively proceed to closure through all stages of increasing curvature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>For membrane attachment, FtsZ requires either FtsA or ZipA. Together they form the so-called proto-ring, the first molecular assembly of the divisome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref010">10</xref>]. FtsA is an amphitropic protein that associates to the membrane by an ATP-linked process mediated by a short amphipathic helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref011">11</xref>]. The bitopic membrane protein ZipA contains a short N-terminal region facing toward the periplasmic space, a transmembrane region, and a C-terminal FtsZ-interacting domain connected by a flexible linker region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref012">12</xref>]. FtsZ binds the proto-ring tethering elements through its C-terminal end, which is also the interaction region for FtsZ-regulating proteins such as MinC, inhibiting FtsZ polymerization and hence FtsZ ring formation at undesired locations. Thus, the C-terminal region of FtsZ acts as a central hub, integrating signals that modulate divisome assembly in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref002">2</xref>]. The membrane anchor proteins can be bypassed by an FtsZ chimera—FtsZ–yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)–membrane-targeting sequence (mts)—through replacing the FtsZ central hub with a YFP and an amphipathic helix to provide autonomous membrane attachment. This mutant was found to become internalized and accumulated in narrow regions of tubular liposomes, forming ringlike structures. Polymerization of this chimeric FtsZ protein at the external face of liposomes has also shown to induce inward or outward deformations, depending on the location of the mts (C-terminus or N-terminus) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Recently, the coreconstitution of FtsZ and FtsA on supported bilayers has revealed that FtsA promotes the self-organization of FtsZ fibers into dynamic patterns, giving rise to coordinated streams and swirling rings with preferential directions, due to treadmilling dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref015">15</xref>]. In contrast, this dynamic behavior was not observed when FtsZ was tethered to the membrane through ZipA or when the membrane-targeted FtsZ variant was used. Interestingly, FtsZ–FtsA dynamic vortices showed no apparent change in size and curvature, suggesting that the functional role of the energy-consuming circumferential movement of FtsZ in a ring of apparently conserved radius was a secondary one: i.e., the sequential spatial targeting of downstream enzymes for cell wall assembly. There was further evidence by recent in vivo studies demonstrating the circumferential treadmilling dynamics of FtsZ in dividing cells and directly connecting it to spatial targeting of peptidoglycan synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref005">5</xref>]. However, in spite of a wave of new papers targeting the exact role of FtsZ in ring architecture, the current models of how exactly the Z ring is constricting over time, and how the large accessible range of FtsZ filament curvatures may be exploited in this process, are still disappointingly vague.</p>
<p>To study the intrinsic role of FtsZ in the formation of dynamic patterns, we thus revisited the in vitro reconstitution of the membrane-targeted chimeric FtsZ variant, FtsZ-YFP-mts, to flat supported membranes. We further addressed the question whether the pronounced spatial dynamics in FtsZ vortices on the membrane could constitute a direct, rather than indirect, spatial cue in the constriction process of the Z ring. To this end, we compared FtsZ mutants that showed different deformation phenotypes when targeted to free-standing membranes.</p>
<p>Our results can be summarized as follows:</p>
<list list-type="order">
<list-item><p>In contrast to what was proposed by Loose and Mitchison, the membrane adaptor FtsA is not required for the emergent spatial self-organization dynamics of FtsZ. Its role can be fully accounted for by an mts to FtsZ.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>A narrow range of protein concentrations on the membrane, modulated by free Mg<sup>2+</sup> and dependent on GTP hydrolysis, supports the formation of dynamic FtsZ swirls.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>Treadmilling results from a directional growth of curved and polar filaments from nucleation points at the membrane. The preferential addition of GTP subunits to the leading edge establishes a GTP–guanosine diphosphate (GDP) gradient along membrane-attached filaments, in which the “older” GDP-rich end is more likely to become destabilized.</p></list-item>
<list-item><p>There is a striking relationship between the vortex chirality of treadmilling and membrane attachment and deformation. FtsZ with C-terminal mts bending the membrane toward the attachment interface treadmills clockwise, while the N-terminal attachment mutant bending the membrane away from the attachment interface treadmills counterclockwise.</p></list-item>

<title>Membrane-targeted FtsZ self-organizes into dynamic rotating vortices</title>
<p>The protein chimera FtsZ-YFP-mts (0.5 μM) in its GDP-bound form (corresponding to a nonassembled state, according to sedimentation velocity, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) did not form visible structures on a supported lipid membrane, as revealed by a total internal reflection fluorescence microscope (TIRFM). We have found that FtsZ-YFP-mts under assembly-promoting conditions (4 mM GTP, 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup>) formed filaments on supported lipid bilayers (SLBs), which self-organize with time into dynamic ringlike structures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s007">S1 Movie</xref>). The assembly of the dynamic rings is a time-dependent phenomenon. After several minutes of GTP addition—during which highly dynamic short filaments were observed to attach, detach, and diffuse on the surface—longer curved filaments appeared to grow directionally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1A</xref> panel 5:00). At this stage, intrinsic motion drives filament–filament interactions to create small and dim closed circular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1A</xref> panel 15:00). These structures tend to be highly unstable: Closed filaments were able to open, to fuse with adjacent filaments, or to close back. At later times, closed circular strands turned into thicker ringlike structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1A</xref> panel 30:00).</p>

Frames correspond to the times (min) indicated after the addition of GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>. (B) Polar clockwise growth of a single FtsZ from a nucleation point. Growth seems to occur stepwise and depend on the accessibility of small filaments nearby (panel 1 and 2). Lower local protein density (white arrow) correlates with a higher flexibility of the polymer (panels 7–12). Breakage occurs primarily in trailing regions (15). After about 3 min, a primitive ring made of 3 distinct short filaments is exhibited (17). (C) Directional filament gliding via treadmilling. Fragmentation or depolymerization destabilizes the trailing (“older”) edge as shown in the kymograph (d-labeled white line). Images in (B) and (C) were taken every 2 s, and the scale bar represents 500 nm. Further details are under “Results.” Movies reconstructed from the whole collection of images can be found in supporting information <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s008">S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s009">S3</xref> Movies.

<p>To understand the formation of circular structures and how they evolve into stable and thicker rings, we resolved and tracked individual filaments (consisting of several protofilaments) before stable ring formation. Here, we identified nucleation sites where clockwise chiral growth leads to the formation of circular structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s008">S2 Movie</xref>). Despite the fact that growth seems to be a discontinuous phenomenon limited by the accessibility of soluble protein, we can estimate a mean growth rate (slope p in the kymograph) which was found to be around 60 nm/s. Strikingly, these images also showed filament flexibility (panels 7–12) and breakage (panels 15–18) resulting in the formation of short free fragments. Such fragments were found to glide and “explore” the surface via treadmilling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s009">S3 Movie</xref>), indicating that this process fuels filament–filament interactions and therefore ulterior formation of closed circular structures. The kymograph in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1C</xref> showed a representative example of one filament growing in the leading edge (p-line) and shrinking in the trailing edge (d-line). A coarse estimation of the velocity of displacement of this filament was about 55 nm/s.</p>

<title>Surface FtsZ concentration—linked to Mg—critically modulates the emergence of dynamic chiral ringlike structures</title>
<p>We further investigated the impact of protein concentration on the stability and dynamics of FtsZ vortex formation in the presence of GTP (4 mM) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (5 mM). Below 0.2 μM, no FtsZ filaments could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Interestingly, increasing the protein concentration to around 1.0 μM resulted in the formation of abundant three-dimensional polymer networks on the membrane, and no dynamic FtsZ rings were observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref015">15</xref>]). These results showed that the self-organization behavior of membrane-targeted FtsZ polymers was critically dependent on total protein concentration.</p>
<p>Next, we compared the kinetics of protein binding to the membrane at 0.2 μM and 0.5 μM of protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), under conditions previously used to detect the swirling rings (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Upon the addition of GTP (4 mM) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (5 mM), a similar membrane adsorption rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) and the parallel appearance of short and highly dynamic filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) were initially found for the two protein concentrations. Remarkably, the transition from short filaments to rudimentary circular structures (gray area in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) also occurred at similar times in both cases. After a lag time of around 10 min, the adsorption rate was found to be significantly slower at 0.2 μM than at 0.5 μM, suggesting that the kinetics of ring stabilization and widening of the structures was concentration dependent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). These differences, found at elapsed times greater than 10 min, also correlated with the fact that the morphology of the rings observed at a protein concentration of 0.2 μM after 45 min incubation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, bottom right panel) was similar to the ones obtained after a lag time of 20 min when 0.5 μM protein was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, upper mid panel). The morphological similarity found at these two time points (denoted as 2 and 3 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) occurred at a similar protein coverage of the membrane, suggesting that protein surface density, rather than bulk concentration, is the key parameter determining the nature of the network that assembles on the membrane. The correlation between the morphologies at time points 2 and 3 of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2A</xref> was further established by determining the average diameter of the formed rings to be about 1 μm at both protein concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). This suggests that although the adsorption rates were different at these time points, the proteins condensed into similar structures.</p>

<title>Dependence of FtsZ-YFP-mts vortex formation on protein surface concentration.</title>
<p>(A) Time dependence of the average fluorescence intensity of FtsZ-YFP-mts on the bilayer upon 4 mM GTP and 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> addition, as measured by TIRFM, at 0.2 (blue line) and 0.5 (red line) μM protein concentration. The gray area marks the intensity when first closed rings are observed, which is approximately the same for both protein concentrations. After closed rings have formed, the further accumulation of protein at the surface is strongly concentration dependent. The dashed line represents the phase in which clearly discernible, locally stable dynamic vortices are observed. While at 0.2 μM, the system reaches this regime after an elapsed time of 45 min (time point 3); at 0.5 μM, it only takes approximately 20 min (time point 2). (B) Representative images of the experiment shown in panel (A). Frames were taken at elapsed times in minutes. Right: Ring size distributions at time points 2 and 3, indicated in panel (A), with average diameters of 0.94 +/− 0.16 μm, <italic>N</italic> = 140, and 0.98 +/− 0.14 μm, <italic>N</italic> = 128, respectively.

<p>Then, we monitored the impact of GTP concentration (0.04, 0.4, and 4 mM) on the formation of swirling vortices at fixed protein (0.2 μM) and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (5 mM) concentration. Surprisingly, at the lowest GTP assayed (0.04 mM), a highly ordered mesh of static filaments was found at <italic>t</italic> = 0. These filaments retained a certain degree of curvature and behaved as a nematic phase that entirely covered the membrane area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g003">Fig 3</xref>, left panel). A similar behavior was also observed at intermediate GTP concentration (0.4 mM) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Notably, the surface mean intensity is 3-fold (approximately 1,500) increased, compared to the minimal density to form rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2</xref>), suggesting that the parallel arrangement of filaments correlates with a high-density regime of protein. Furthermore, aligned filaments showed no significant change after 10 min, in contrast to dynamic rings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>

Next to each image, the mean fluorescence intensity, proportional to the FtsZ-YFP-mts density on the membrane, is shown (average of 3 experiments). The protein network observed at 5 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup> correlates with a high FtsZ-YFP-mts density regime, at least 3-fold larger (approximately 1,500 A.U.) than required for ring formation (approximately 500 A.U.)

<p>It is known that Mg<sup>2+</sup> favors self-association and assembly of FtsZ both in solution and at membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref017">17</xref>]. Therefore, one possibility could be that the free Mg<sup>2+</sup> controls the surface protein density, rather than the total GTP concentration, since GTP is known to bind Mg<sup>2+</sup> with affinity in the millimolar range [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref018">18</xref>]. To examine this alternative, we repeated the self-organization assays at 0.04 mM GTP in the presence of 1 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which resulted in the formation of chiral vortices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g003">Fig 3</xref>, right panel). Interestingly, the emergence of chiral vortices was found to correlate with a significantly lower mean surface protein density than the one measured at 0.04 mM GTP and 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> that resulted in the dense packing of static polymers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g003">Fig 3</xref>, left panel). These findings show that free Mg<sup>2+</sup> controls the concentration of GTP FtsZ-YFP-mts polymers at the membrane and then the self-assembly of the FtsZ filaments in the membrane.</p>

<title>Directionality of vortices and destabilization of the trailing edge</title>
<p>After formation, single rings reach a quasi-steady state as rotating vortices, meaning that the light intensity along their perimeter shows a nearly periodic time dependence. These rotating structures formed by the membrane-targeted FtsZ-YFP-mts (mts C-terminal) consistently showed a chiral clockwise rotation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s010">S4 Movie</xref>). The directional ring dynamics were confirmed by the positive slope of kymographs generated along the ring circumference.

<p>We next sought to understand whether there was any relationship between the structural features of the protein and the obviously chiral dynamics of our FtsZ mutants. Hence, we made use of a previously established chimera variant that was shown to have opposite effects on deformable membranes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref019">19</xref>]. In the presence of GTP, FtsZ-YFP-mts is able to induce inward (concave) deformations on lipid vesicles. Strikingly, when the mts sequence is switched to the N-terminus, an outward (convex) deformation is observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref014">14</xref>]. To study the role of the position of the mts in our dynamic vortices, we carried out similar self-organization assays using an FtsZ chimera in which the membrane attachment was located at the opposite—the N-terminal—end (mts-H-FtsZ-YFP). Upon addition of GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, defined dynamic rings were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Strikingly, now the FtsZ swirls appeared to rotate counterclockwise (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s010">S4 Movie</xref>), a feature that was confirmed by the negative slope of the kymographs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). As before, we measured the slope of kymographs for <italic>N</italic> = 50 different rings to calculate the velocity distribution with a mean of about 25 nm/s or 2.8° sec<sup>−1</sup> for a ring of 500 nm radius. This velocity is slower than that of the FtsZ-YFP-mts vortices (34 nm/s) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). These observations show that the positioning of the mts determines the direction of polymerization, as it does for membrane binding and transformation. The fact that the N-terminal mts mutant—without a protein spacer between the FtsZ and the membrane attachment—results in the same qualitative dynamic behavior, although being inverted in chirality, also refutes potential speculations that YFP may take over a necessary (sterical) role of FtsA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>To further investigate how exactly GTP hydrolysis influences the formation of collective streams, we carried out similar self-organization assays using a variant of the FtsZ chimera with no GTPase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), in which the Threonine at position 108 was replaced by an Alanine (FtsZ*[T108A]-YFP-mts). Well-defined rings similar in size to the ones found with FtsZ-YFP-mts could be observed upon the addition of GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, these rings did not seem to treadmill and rotate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s010">S4 Movie</xref>), as evidenced by the lack of clear patterns in the kymographs generated to track polymer dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Interestingly, FtsZ*[T108A]-YFP-mts rings grow from nucleation points in a less dynamic manner compared to FtsZ-YFP-mts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s011">S5 Movie</xref>). From these results, we conclude that GTPase activity is not required for the formation but for the quasi-steady-state rotational dynamics of the ring patterns, suggesting that GTPase activity particularly promotes filament destabilization in the trailing edge.</p>
<p>Treadmilling can be explained by an imbalance between growth and shrinkage at the two opposite ends of the polar filament. Since treadmilling is obviously GTP-turnover dependent, and the growth into ringlike structures by capturing preformed diffusing filaments is not, the critical requirement for treadmilling seems to be the destabilization and shrinkage at the trailing edge. In order to directly visualize the destabilization dependent on nucleotide state, we developed a single molecule assay using FtsZ-YFP-mts incubated with fluorescently labeled nanobodies (green fluorescent protein [GFP]-Booster-Atto647N, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec007">Materials and methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g005">Fig 5A</xref>) to investigate the protein turnover at the membrane, implying that faster disassembly suggests higher destabilization. By measuring the probability of protein detachment as a function of time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), we could calculate the mean residence time of single FtsZ subunits within the filaments on the membrane. Using this analysis, we found that the mean residence time of FtsZ-YFP-mts in fragments forming dynamic rings was <inline-formula id="pbio.2004845.e001"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2004845.e001g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2004845.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M1"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mn>11</mml:mn><mml:mo>.</mml:mo><mml:mn>5</mml:mn><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), in good agreement with previous fluorescence recovery after photobleaching (FRAP) studies with native FtsZ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref021">21</xref>].

<p>Our single molecule experiments also allowed us to directly elucidate the impact of free Mg<sup>2+</sup> and, in particular, its obvious role in the formation of the high-density FtsZ mesh.

Also, the residence time of FtsZ in GDP form at 5 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup> was increased (<inline-formula id="pbio.2004845.e005"><alternatives><graphic id="pbio.2004845.e005g" mimetype="image" position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.2004845.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M5"><mml:msub><mml:mrow><mml:mi>t</mml:mi></mml:mrow><mml:mrow><mml:mi>r</mml:mi></mml:mrow></mml:msub><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mo>=</mml:mo><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mn>1.72</mml:mn><mml:mi> </mml:mi><mml:mi mathvariant="normal">s</mml:mi></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>) compared to 1 mM.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In our minimalistic <italic>in vitro</italic> reconstitution study, we found that polymers of an artificially membrane-targeted variant of FtsZ autonomously and without the presence of FtsA self-organize on a supported bilayer upon addition of GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> to form chiral ringlike dynamic patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1</xref>), displaying a clockwise or counterclockwise protein movement, dependent on whether the membrane attachment was enforced through the C-terminal or N-terminal end of the protein, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). The mts in both cases was taken from MinD, one of the elements of the site-selection MinCDE complex, which allows FtsZ to be peripherally attached to the membrane. We thus showed that the ability of FtsZ to create dynamic patterns is an intrinsic property (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) rather than a specific interaction with a specific protein anchor. Instead, the formation of dynamic FtsZ ring structures in vitro is highly linked to (i) the surface protein density and (ii) GTPase activity, destabilizing surface-bound filaments and thus being key for treadmilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that the most decisive factor for the emergence of dynamic vortices of FtsZ on membranes is the overall surface coverage by protein monomers and filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g006">Fig 6A</xref>), which varies over time upon protein adsorption to the membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and is controlled by free Mg<sup>2+</sup> concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Dynamic vortices appear primarily in an intermediate density regime (surface mean intensity: 450–1,000 arbitrary units [A.U.]) and isotropic bundles in a high-density regime (surface mean intensity &gt; 1,000 A.U.). Transitions from highly dynamic vortices to isotropic bundles occur upon an increase in lateral contacts that arrest treadmilling filaments, increasing their mean effective length (as in the case of ZipA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref015">15</xref>]). This was clearly observed in our single molecule assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g005">Fig 5B</xref>) that shows a slower turnover in the situation of dense isotropic bundles, i.e., longer filaments. Along these lines, the increase in lateral interactions at high free Mg<sup>2+</sup> also explains the rapid formation of filaments at 5 mM free Mg<sup>2+</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g003">Fig 3</xref>), since larger FtsZ assemblies bind to the membrane and interact with each other more frequently (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Presumably, the main reason why Loose and Mitchison failed to observe dynamic vortices in the case of the FtsZ-YFP-mts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref015">15</xref>] is because of the high protein concentration used in their experiments (1.5 uM).</p>

<title>(A) FtsZ-YFP-mts ring formation is dependent on GTP and protein surface concentration.</title>
<p>At low protein concentration and no GTP and Mg2+, FtsZ transiently binds to the membrane without forming visible structures. With GTP, dynamic chiral rings are formed as a function of time. Once stable swirls are built, they exhibit a mean velocity of 34 nm/s and a turnover time of short fragments of 11.5 s. From the velocity and the turnover time, the average length of the protofilaments can be estimated to 390 nm. However, ring formation is only observed at intermediate protein density regimes. At high protein density, a parallel network of filaments (nematic phase) is observed. (B) To guarantee chirality, attachment needs to have a perpendicular component to both the ring curvature and filament polarity to have a preferential binding face. In this case, the mts interacts with the flat surface on opposite sides of the FtsZ filament, so curvature is also in the opposite direction. (C) We here suggest that an intrinsic helical FtsZ shape, characterized by a radius and a pitch, can alternatively explain previous FtsZ-induced inwards/outwards deformations in the following way: Due to the intrinsic pitch, the growing filament would either pull up (left) or push down (right) the surface. On the contrary, if the surface is not deformable (SLB), the filament would experience a strain, get destabilized, and eventually break upon growth.

<p>Our results are compatible with previous atomic force microscopy analysis of static structures formed by FtsZ polymers on mica as a function of protein concentration at the surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref023">23</xref>]. The protein concentration–dependent formation of dynamic FtsZ patterns also nicely correlates with a recent theoretical study suggesting that protein density at the membrane controls the formation of vortex patterns on membranes in a phase-like behavior. According to this, independent curved polar filaments showing chiral motion and repulsion can self-assemble into vortex or ringlike structures in an intermediate density regime. While at low protein densities filaments travel independently, at the high-density regime they form isotropic networks and jammed bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>By gradually increasing protein concentration on the membrane, we were able to investigate the initial formation phase of dynamic rings. At low density (surface mean intensity &lt; 450 A.U.), curved and polar filaments initially emerge from nucleation points, which presumably are small attached filaments above a critical length. Intriguingly, the overall adsorption rates to the membrane at this stage are similar for protein concentrations of 0.2 μM and 0.5 μM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Upon sufficiently high membrane coverage of nucleating filaments after the initial phase, protein binding from solution begins to scale with total (i.e., bulk) protein concentration. Whether nucleators are directly formed on the membrane after GTP addition or whether short polymers are formed in solution and an increase in affinity with growth brings them to the membrane cannot be determined based on our data and will be the topic of further investigation.</p>
<p>We found that filaments growing from nucleators are prone to fragmentation, resulting in free fragments that may stay connected to the membrane. There, they assemble with other attached filaments by diffusion and directional treadmilling, which ultimately results in closed rings in which the treadmilling continues. Our experiments demonstrate that treadmilling, particularly via destabilization of the trailing edge, is highly regulated by GTPase activity. When GTPase activity is switched off (FtsZ*[T108A]-YFP-mts), rings seemed to grow only from nucleation points and do not treadmill, at least on time scales found for FtsZ-YFP-mts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). Moreover, the residence time of single FtsZ*[T108A]-YFP-mts subunits in the filaments is comparable with the photobleaching control, implying that protein turnover is almost nonexistent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). It has been suggested that a kinetic and structural polarity at monomeric level and a GTP/GDP gradient are requirements for robust treadmilling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref025">25</xref>]. As seen from our experiments of the initial vortex growth phase, a GTP/GDP gradient along the treadmilling direction is likely to result from the preferential addition of GTP subunits to the existing filaments at the polar front and a more likely GTP turnover toward the “older” tail.</p>
<p>In light of the role of GTPase activity for the formation of dynamic vortices, the measured velocity of the FtsZ + FtsA vortices reported by Loose and Mitchison is about 3-fold faster (108 nm/s) compared to our FtsZ-YFP-mts rings (34 nm/s). In addition, these authors reported a higher GTPase activity of the FtsZ + FtsA compared to the FtsZ-YFP-mts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref015">15</xref>]. Nonetheless, it is not clear how variables such as GTPase activity and attachment strength influence the speed of rotation. For instance, our mutant mts-H-FtsZ-YFP has shown a considerable decrease in rotation speed compared to the FtsZ-YFP-mts. Remarkably, to observe mts-H-FtsZ-YFP dynamic rings, we had to increase the bulk concentration to 1.25 uM. This may be due to a reduced affinity for membranes, affecting the overall dynamics.</p>
<p>The most remarkable outcome of this study is the clear dependence of vortex chirality on the positioning of the membrane anchor, which, in turn, has severe effects on the topology of membrane deformation by FtsZ. Chirality is inverted by switching the membrane anchor from the C-terminus (clockwise) to the N-terminus (counterclockwise). Intriguingly, these two different mutants cause concave (C-terminal) or convex (N-terminal) deformations when bound to deformable liposomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref014">14</xref>]. To explain these different deformations, Erickson and colleagues have previously depicted FtsZ filaments as arc segments with a direction of membrane attachment either parallel or antiparallel to the vector of curvature. In order to support the here-observed chiral treadmilling of curved rings on planar membranes, however, attachment through the preferential binding face of the filaments needs to have a perpendicular component to both the ring curvature and filament polarity. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g006">Fig 6B</xref> shows a curved filament with a C-terminal (clear gray) and N-terminal (dark gray) face perpendicular to the curvature of the filament. Note that the mts is represented here with one parallel component to the curvature, as suggested by Erickson, and one perpendicular component to accommodate flat membrane binding. In this flat representation of a curved FtsZ filament, treadmilling is explained by a polar growth at the leading edge and a destabilization mechanism, driven by GTP hydrolysis, toward the GDP-enriched region at the trailing edge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>Nevertheless, due to the fact that curved structures can be either attached along their axis of apparent curvature (in vivo, Osawa and Erickson [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref014">14</xref>]) or perpendicular to their axis of primary curvature (as reported here), we have to conclude that either the membrane attachment of the filament is immensely flexible or—and this is more likely, based on previous structural investigations—that the filament does not have a single but rather more than one direction of curvature, like a helix or a twisted arc [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref026">26</xref>]. Indeed, a very similar geometry with more than one curvature direction has recently been reported for endosomal sorting complex required for transport III (ESCRTIII) filaments (nicely reviewed by Chiaruttini and Roux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref027">27</xref>]). This is particularly intriguing as, among many other roles in eukaryotic and prokaryotic cells connected with membrane abscission, ESCRT is the alternative system to FtsZ with respect to cell division in Archaea [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref029">29</xref>].</p>
<p>Therefore, in light of evidence showing that FtsZ forms helical structures <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref033">33</xref>] and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref019">19</xref>], we here suggest an alternative structural model to the one depicted in 6B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). We propose that an FtsZ filament with more than one main direction of curvature, such as a helix, would much more elegantly accommodate the combination of inward/outward deformations and chiral treadmilling for the opposite mts mutants. Such a corkscrew-like FtsZ filament can be simply described by an intrinsic radius and a pitch, in which the latter would reflect on the attachment direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). On a deformable surface (deflated liposome), the growing filament would either pull up (left) or push down (right) the surface due to the respective pitch. The interplay between the elastic response of the membrane (increased membrane tension) and local changes in the helix radius due to GTP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref035">35</xref>] could explain the stabilization of higher curvature or smaller radii regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004845.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). On a nondeformable surface (SLB), however, since the surface is not resilient, the filament would experience a strain, get destabilized, and eventually break upon growth.</p>
<p>Thus, together with the very recent studies showing the linkage between treadmilling of FtsZ polymers and peptidoglycan synthesis in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref004">4</xref>] and <italic>B</italic>. <italic>subtilis</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref005">5</xref>] cells, our findings shed new light on the interplay between FtsZ structure and treadmilling dynamics but may also hint to a direct mechanical link of these to bacterial division. The minimal system we used unambiguously shows that the observed chiral vortices are the result of intrinsic GTP-linked FtsZ polymerization dynamics on the membrane without the need of additional complex interactions with FtsA and ATP, pointing to a fascinating archetypal feature of this important structural protein. The reduced number of components allowed us to selectively determine the influence of key factors—e.g., the surface density of FtsZ—on the self-organization behavior, thus contributing to a much better mechanistic understanding of FtsZ’s dynamic architecture and its potential physiological implications.</p>

S., ImageJ, US National Institutes of Health, Bethesda, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/" xlink:type="simple">http://rsb.info.nih.gov/ij/</ext-link>, 1997–2007). Images correspond to an average of 5–10 frames from a time-series experiment. For the kymograph analysis, time-series acquisitions were filtered using a standard mean filter and were drift corrected (Image J). A MATLAB script allows the user to define a ring by providing 2 coordinates. Every ring is automatically fitted to a circle with radius r. Then, 3 trajectories corresponding to 3 concentric circles having radii r, r+1, and r−1 pixels are determined. At this point, the script will read the time-series data and calculate a kymograph for each time point and trajectory. The final kymograph corresponds to the average of the 3 different trajectories. To automatically calculate the slope, we first smooth the kymograph with a Savitzky-Golay filter of order 2 and enhance its contrast using a contrast-limited-adaptive-histogram-equalization (CLAHE) routine (MATLAB). Next, using Fourier analysis, we find the characteristic frequency for the patterns on the kymograph (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004845.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Finally, the slope corresponds to the change in phase at this frequency. Quality criteria are properly chosen to reject low-quality regions over the kymograph.

<title>Single-molecule imaging and residence time measurement</title>
<p>FtsZ-YFP-mts previously incubated 1:1 with the nanobody GFP-Booster Atto647N (ChromoTek, Germany) for at least 1 h at 4°C under agitation. To filter out nonbound nanobody, we centrifuge our protein in a 30 KDa Amicon unit. The GFP-Booster Atto647N was excited with a 640 nm diode laser (30 mW, before objective). Single molecule imaging was performed using a standard Cy5 filter set. After 10 min of GTP addition, a significant number of spots in the single molecule channel (Atto647N) were observed and imaged at a rate of 1 fps or 3 fps with 0.3 s exposure time. To improve imaging conditions, we added 10 nM protocatechuate-dioxygenase (PCD) and 2 mM 3,4-protocatechuicacid (PCA) as an oxygen-scavenging system. To determine the position of every single molecule and calculate its residence time, we employed a MATLAB routine designed by Weimann and Ganzinger [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref038">38</xref>]. Briefly, a bandpass filter was used to remove low- and high-frequency noise. Then, single molecule positions with intensity above a user-defined threshold were determined by their brightness-weighted centroid. The detection algorithm is highly efficient for detecting particles with a signal-to-noise ratio above 1.5. The user-defined threshold was chosen to detect the largest number of spots and kept constant for all experiments. Single molecules were tracked among consecutive frames in an area given by a radius of 10 pixels (pixel size = 0.042 μm).

<title>FtsZ-YFP-mts sedimentation velocity analysis.</title>
<p>c(S) sedimentation coefficient distributions obtained for the chimeric FtsZ variant (7 μM) obtained from experiments done in working buffer at the following conditions: 4 mM GTP and 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (A), 4 mM GTP but no Mg<sup>2+</sup> added (B), 0.05 mM GDP and 5 mM Mg<sup>2+</sup> (C), and 0.05 mM GDP and no Mg<sup>2+</sup> added (D). These experiments show that FtsZ-YFP-mts is a well-behaved self-associating protein. In the absence of GTP and/or Mg<sup>2+</sup> (B–D), the protein exists mainly as a slowly sedimenting species with s-value of around 6S (C–D), compatible with the heterodimeric FtsZ-YFP form. In the presence of both GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup> (A), most of the protein (70%) sediments as a polydisperse mixture of higher-order species with an average s-value of 20 +/− 5 S. These results are important because they allowed us to control the association state of the membrane-targeted FtsZ variant by GTP and Mg<sup>2+</sup>, which was crucial to obtain the reproducible dynamic ringlike structures on the bilayers shown in this work (see main text). The broad distribution of higher-order species shown in (A) contrast with the sharp s-values observed in previous studies from the Rivas lab under specific experimental conditions of protein and buffer composition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref017">17</xref>]. These differences in sedimentation coefficient distributions of FtsZ under assembly-promoting conditions could, in part, be related to the presence of the mts-tag. However, they are also compatible with the behavior of self-assembling systems as plastic as FtsZ, in which it would take only a very small free energy perturbation to produce large changes in the relative abundance of the species present as higher-order oligomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004845.ref017">17</xref>].

<title>FtsZ-YFP-mts assembles into circular vortices as a time-dependent process at a protein concentration of 0.5 μM.</title>
<p>After GTP addition, monomers are released into solution in which the polymerization is triggered. Then, short protofilaments from solution slowly return to the membrane, forming small structures with high lateral diffusion (5 min). After 10 min, those short filaments formed unstable and small circular structures that transiently open and close. At later times, ringlike structures with a defined center become predominant (15 min). In long-time regime, rings become larger and thicker.
