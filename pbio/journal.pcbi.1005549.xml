<abstract>
<p>As proteins are synthesized, the nascent polypeptide must pass through a negatively charged exit tunnel. During this stage, positively charged stretches can interact with the ribosome walls and slow the translation. Therefore, charged polypeptides may be important factors that affect protein expression. To determine the frequency and distribution of positively and negatively charged stretches in different proteomes, the net charge was calculated for every 30 consecutive amino acid residues, which corresponds to the length of the ribosome exit tunnel. The following annotated and reviewed proteins in the UniProt database (Swiss-Prot) were analyzed: 551,705 proteins from different organisms and a total of 180 million protein segments. We observed that there were more negative than positive stretches and that super-charged positive sequences (i.e., net charges ≥ 14) were underrepresented in the proteomes. Overall, the proteins were more positively charged at their N-termini and C-termini, and this feature was present in most organisms and subcellular localizations. To investigate whether the N-terminal charges affect the elongation rates, previously published ribosomal profiling data obtained from <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic>, without translation-interfering drugs, were analyzed. We observed a nonlinear effect of the charge on the ribosome occupancy in which values ≥ +5 and ≤ -6 showed increased and reduced ribosome densities, respectively. These groups also showed different distributions across 80S monosomes and polysomes. Basic polypeptides are more common within short proteins that are translated by monosomes, whereas negative stretches are more abundant in polysome-translated proteins. These findings suggest that the nascent peptide charge impacts translation and can be one of the factors that regulate translation efficiency and protein expression.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Which factors shape the sequence of amino acids that will form a protein? The biochemical features of amino acids, such as their charge and hydrophobicity, are important drivers of protein tridimensional folding, which creates interaction sites for binding other molecules and directs proteins to specific cellular compartments. These features all impact the activity of the proteins after they are produced. Another less obvious factor that influences the protein’s primary structure may be how efficiently a given amino acid sequence is produced by the ribosome. It is known that a repetitive stretch of positively charged amino acids may interact with the negative charges in the ribosome exit tunnel, slowing, or even halting, translation. By analyzing the charge of protein stretches in different organisms, we observed that proteins tend to present positively charged stretches at their extremities, and high charge values can slow (for positive charges) or speed (for negative charges) translation. An interesting consequence of this trend is that proteins that are translated in high quantities by several ribosomes at the same RNA (polysomes) tend to have more negatively charged stretches than proteins that are translated by a single ribosome per RNA (monosomes).</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The translation of messenger RNAs is the final step in translating the genetic code from DNA to proteins and is an essential, energetic expensive reaction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref001">1</xref>]. The translation process is regulated by different mechanisms, primarily at the initiation phase. These mechanisms include initiation factor levels and posttranslational modifications, mRNA accessibility, microRNA activity and trans-acting protein activity[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref001">1</xref>]. The termination phase may also be subject to regulation by permitting frame-shifting or the insertion of amino acids where the translation should end[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref001">1</xref>]. The elongation rate can be influenced by the messenger RNA secondary structure[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref001">1</xref>], rare codon usage[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref003">3</xref>] or nascent polypeptide charge[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref004">4</xref>] and appears to be tightly coupled to co-translational folding[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref005">5</xref>]. The translation efficiency is directly affected by the elongation rate as slow rates can, in certain cases, lead to ribosome stalling and interruption of translation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref006">6</xref>]. The elongation and initiation rates can also determine whether the transcripts are translated in the monosomes or polysomes[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>Most nascent polypeptides are synthesized in the ribosomal exit tunnel. This tunnel provides a passage that is approximately 100 Å long through the large subunit from the peptidyl transferase center to the cytosol[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref008">8</xref>] and houses approximately 30 amino acids residues of the nascent polypeptide[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref009">9</xref>]. The tunnel is composed primarily of nucleic acids and contains two proteins (L4 and L17) that line the tunnel’s interior[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref009">9</xref>]. Because nucleic acids are the major constituents, the electrostatic potential is negative, ranging from -8 mV to -22 mV[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref010">10</xref>]. Experiments using recombinant proteins designed to function as molecular tape measures have shown that positively charged sequences (rich in arginine/lysine residues) are able to arrest translation, while neutral or negatively charged sequences promote faster elongation rates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref004">4</xref>]. This finding indicates that positively charged residues are able to interact with the ribosome exit tunnel and possibly promote ribosome stalling.</p>
<p>The effect of the nascent polypeptide composition on the translation rates has also been investigated using the ribosome profile technique, which is based on the deep sequencing of ribosome-protected mRNA fragments during translation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref011">11</xref>]. Using this technique, there are certain contradictory conclusions that appear to originate from the use of translational inhibitors, such as cycloheximide, which are usually added to stabilize the ribosomes prior to the cell lysis[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref014">14</xref>]. When performed in the absence of such drugs, experiments tend to consistently show that positively charged sequences are able to promote slower elongation rates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>If the nascent polypeptide charge is an important factor affecting ribosomal translation efficiency, one might expect that the distribution of charges across a protein sequence should be shaped not only by structural and functional pressures but also by their effect on protein synthesis. It has already been demonstrated that there is a higher concentration of positively charged residues at the N- and C-termini of proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref017">17</xref>]. Tentative explanations for this observation involve either the charge effect on translation or the importance of the positive stretches to the protein structure. An early work using the technique of ribosome profiling to assess the speed of translation showed that the translation rates were slower at the N-termini of proteins. The authors suggested that the so-called ribosomal ramp is an inherent component of the translation initiation and is important for organizing polysomal translation and avoiding jams[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref018">18</xref>]. This model could explain the enrichment of positive charges at the N-terminus because this could be one of the factors that causes the increase in the ribosomal density in this area. However, many aspects of this hypothesis have been debated in the literature[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref020">20</xref>]. Even the functional meaning of a ribosomal ramp has been questioned since the observed increase in the ribosome density at the beginning of the transcripts appears to be induced by the addition of cycloheximide during the sample preparation and, therefore, cannot be considered a natural characteristic of ribosomal translation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>An alternative hypothesis was offered by Charneski and Hurst[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref017">17</xref>], who suggested that the enrichment of positively charged residues at the protein extremities could be explained by the presence of positive patches adjacent to the transmembrane protein segments. These basic domains lie on the cytoplasmic side and control the protein orientation by electrostatic interactions with the inner layer of phospholipids[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref017">17</xref>]. By analyzing the first 30 amino acids of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> and <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> proteins, the authors found that basic N-termini are present in membrane proteins but not in cytoplasmic proteins. The authors also demonstrated that the specific distribution of Arg or Lys in the N- and C- termini could be caused by the natural tendency for positively charged patches to occur close to the protein extremities. Taken together, these data indicate that there is no consensus regarding whether the translation efficiency is a factor that influences the distribution of charges in the primary structure of proteins.</p>
<p>In this study, 551,705 proteins from different organisms from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to <italic>H</italic>. <italic>sapiens</italic> were analyzed to search for charged sequences and their biological relevance. We found that there are more negatively charged sequences than positively charged sequences, and extremely positively charged sequences are underrepresented in most proteomes. Proteins tend to concentrate their positively charged sequences at their N- and C-termini, and this feature appears to be strongly conserved across different organisms and subcellular locations, including cytoplasmic proteins. By analyzing previously published ribosome-profiling analyses of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> that were performed without cycloheximide, we concluded that the nascent polypeptide charge can modulate the ribosome occupancy, but this effect is only apparent in peptides with a net positive N-terminal charge ≥ +5 and ≤ -6. Finally, using ribosome-profiling data from different monosomal/polysomal population, it is possible to observe that the N-terminal net charges are associated with monosomal translation, whereas neutral and negative stretches are more common in the N-termini in proteins that are translated by polysomes. Moreover, because most proteins contain basic stretches within the net-charge range that have little effect on the translation rate, our analysis suggests that a widespread ribosomal ramp is not important for organizing the polysomal translation. These data corroborate the notion that the translation rate can act as a selection force to shape the charge distribution along the primary structures of proteins.</p>

<title>Extremely positively charged protein segments are underrepresented in most proteomes</title>
<p>To determine the charge frequency of protein segments in various proteomes, we developed a program that is able to screen the sequence of a given protein and calculate the net charge of every 30-amino acid segment, which is the estimated polypeptide length that occupies the ribosome exit tunnel[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The net charge was calculated by considering the protonation state of the amino acids according to their pKa values at a physiological pH of 7.4. Positively charged residues (lysine and arginine) were considered +1; negatively charged residues (glutamic and aspartic acid) were considered -1; and all other residues were considered 0. For the sake of simplicity, we eliminated the C- and N-termini charges and disregarded the cysteine contribution (charge at 7.4 = − 0.085). Histidine deserved special attention since its pKa value can vary from 2.4 to 9.2 depending on the chemical environment within the protein[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref022">22</xref>]. In an unfolded peptide of five amino acids (Ala-Ala-His-Ala-Ala), the pKa of histidine was determined to be 6.5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref022">22</xref>]. This finding means that at physiological pH values of 7.0–7.4, histidines are more likely to be uncharged. However, because previous analyses considered histidine a positively charged amino acid[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref017">17</xref>], calculations were performed by considering both His +1 and His 0.</p>
<p>The annotated and reviewed proteins in the UniProt database (Swiss-Prot) were analyzed, including 551,705 proteins from different organisms and 180 million 30-amino acid segments. The histidine charge affected the distribution of the net charge in the protein segments. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, the presence of charged histidines caused a shift in the frequency distribution curve toward positive net-charge values, and as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1A</xref> (right inset), the charged histidines increased the proportion of positively charged sequences relative to the negatively charged segments.</p>

<p>Another observation was that super-charged segments with positive net-charges &gt; +14 appeared less frequently than segments with negative net-charges &lt; -14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1A</xref>, left inset). This feature can be better observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, in which the ratio of the number of 30-amino acid sequences that possess equal but opposite net-charge values (negative/positive) was determined. If the number of negative and positive stretches of a given charge value is approximately the same, the result is one. Values greater than one reflect a ratio of negative over positive stretches, and values smaller than one reflect the opposite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The plot shows that the negatively charged sequences become more abundant than the positively charged stretches at net-charge values greater than 10. Furthermore, the histidine charge primarily affects the sequences with moderate net-charge values (i.e., 5–10). When His is considered +1, the average ratio of these charge values shifts toward positively charged sequences; however, at net-charge values greater than 10, the negatively charged segments become more frequent regardless of the histidine charge. In most organisms, the intracellular pH, except in certain specific organelles, varies between 7.0 and 7.5[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref023">23</xref>]. Therefore, a net charge of 0 was adopted to more closely resemble the physiological scenario in all subsequent analyses.</p>

<p>Previous analyses by other groups indicated that the N- and C- termini of proteins tend to be enriched with positively charged residues.

The color of each tile corresponds to the net charge of 30 consecutive amino acids (i.e., first tile 1–30, second tile 2–31, etc.).

<p>The subsequent analysis provided information regarding the charge at each position in the first and last 30 amino acid residues of proteins. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g003">Fig 3A–3F</xref>). In this analysis, each data point represents the average charge of the residues that occupy a specific position in the protein sequence. For example, the first point is always zero since it represents the starting methionine. A similar pattern was observed in all organisms analyzed. At the N-terminus, the second amino acid residue tends to be negatively charged, followed by positive charges up until amino acid number ten; from amino acid 11 to 30, the average charge tends to be only slightly positive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The C-terminal analysis shows a different distribution in which there is a steep increase in positive charges around the last ten to fifteen amino acids (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g003">Fig 3</xref>).

<p>Certain aspects of the specific distribution of the amino acid charges can be readily explained. The first amino acid tends to be neutral, which is logical because the first amino acid is usually a methionine residue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g003">Fig 3</xref>). The second amino acid tends to be negative (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g003">Fig 3</xref>). This observation can be explained by the Kozak consensus sequence, which predicts a high prevalence of G after the initiation codon AUG[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref025">25</xref>]. Every codon that starts with G codes for either a neutral or a negatively charged amino acid, which explains this observed phenomenon. When proteins with secretion signal peptides are removed from the analysis, the average charge of the second amino acid is even lower. This observation can be explained by the common presence of lysine residues at amino acid position two in the signal peptides, which tend to be rich in positively charged residues[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref024">24</xref>]. An increased occurrence of basic peptides in the C-termini of proteins was also observed. This result is consistent with previous analyses that show that the basic amino acids in the last two positions before the stop codon can greatly enhance the translation termination efficiency[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref027">27</xref>]. However, these observations alone cannot account for the general and conserved tendency of the positively charged protein segments to encompass dozens of residues at the N- or C-termini of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

The positively charged N-termini could be observed in different organelles and cytoplasmic proteins from different species.

When the mitochondrial proteins were removed, the distribution of positive charges changed considerably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>Unarguably, the post-translational function has a profound influence on the protein charge distribution as observed in the structure of membrane proteins[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref017">17</xref>] and the contribution of the MTS to the N-terminal charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g005">Fig 5</xref>). Furthermore, ribosome interacting proteins tend to present dynamic N and C termini that are enriched with positively charged residues, which facilitates the RNA interaction[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref030">30</xref>]. However, there is no clear explanation for the specific charge distribution in a vast number of proteins (i.e., cytoplasmic proteins).

<title>N-terminal net charge does not correlate with the different parameters of the protein biology</title>
<p>While many proteins have positively charged stretches at their N and C-termini, not all proteins have net positive charges in this area. Therefore, we attempted to find a consistent correlation between the net charge of the first 30 amino acid residues of <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> proteins and different aspects of protein synthesis and stability, such as the elongation rate, mRNA half-life or protein molecules per cell. The results of the correlation analysis are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s005">S1 Table</xref>. Some analyses resulted in statistically significant P-values (&lt; 0.005), but the squares of the correlation coefficient (r<sup>2</sup>) were all very small. For example, the best correlation value, i.e., a negative correlation between the net charge and the ORF length, had a P-value &lt; 0.0001 with r<sup>2</sup> = 0.01124, indicating that only 44 of the 4,448 analyzed proteins would show net charge values that vary with the protein size. Another significant negative correlation was found between the net charge and the total elongation time (P = 0.0002) and had even lower r<sup>2</sup> values (0.0036). In conclusion, it was not possible to draw any functional hypotheses from these analyses. One possibility is that the correlation analysis is too stringent to detect co-variations that are likely not linear (see next sections) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Because positive charges are related to slower translation rates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref004">4</xref>] and translation rates are related to co-translational protein folding[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref031">31</xref>], we investigated whether the N-terminal positive net charges are associated with chaperone recruitment.

<title>N-terminal net charge correlates with ribosome occupancy</title>

Because most of these proteins have a nuclear localization, we investigated whether the NLS is present at the N-termini of these sequences and, therefore, is an important factor contributing to ribosome stalling. It is important to note that the NLS have diverse structures and compositions; therefore, prediction programs usually compute a probability score for putative motifs[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref035">35</xref>]. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6C</xref> shows the cumulative distribution of the putative NLS determined by NucPred for the first 30 residues of proteins that belong to the charge groups analyzed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. Considering the recommended score threshold of 0.8 (sensitivity of 0.30 and specificity of 0.61)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref035">35</xref>], only two proteins from the &gt; +8 group presented an NLS at their N-terminal. Lowering the threshold to 0.5 did not substantially alter the number of putative NLS present in the positively charged group of proteins, excluding the possibility that the presence of an NLS accounts for the stalling of ribosomes, which is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. A mitochondrial targeting signal is also not common in the &gt; +8 group, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6A</xref>. Only six proteins had an MTS at their N-terminal, and the average ribosomal occupancy in the &gt; +8 group was the same regardless of whether these proteins were excluded. Moreover, when we analyzed the ribosomal profiling of all yeast mitochondrial proteins (n = 414), the result was very similar to that in proteins with a 0 net charge at the N-termini (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6A</xref>, compare dashed line with black line). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, it becomes clear that the group of proteins with N-terminal net charges ≥ +8 belong to an exceptional set of proteins with net-charge values that are much higher than those in any other group that is created by cellular localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).</p>
<p>We also analyzed the presence of the MTS and NLSs in the 2,307 super-charged proteins with net charges ≥ +14 located at any position of the protein in all organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Only 1% (25 proteins) were mitochondrial proteins. In contrast, we observed that NLSs are more common in the super-charged proteins than in a random group of yeast protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), and approximately half of the NLSs with probability scores ≥ 0.8 were within the 60 residues that contained the supercharged stretch. Therefore, the super-charged proteins are enriched with NLSs, but the signal alone is not responsible for the particular high charge in this group (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, compare blue symbols with red symbols).</p>
<p>Because most of the basic stretches at the N-terminal were within the range in which no important effect on translation efficiency was observed, the association between a physiological ramp and positively charged sequences, as proposed by Tuller <italic>et al</italic>.[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref016">16</xref>], may not be correct. Our conclusion is consistent with other work that has challenged this hypothesis. For example, studies suggest that cycloheximide influences ramp formation[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref019">19</xref>], and more recently, it has been observed that the ribosome profile of the polysomal fraction of the translating ribosomes has no ramp[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref007">7</xref>]. Nevertheless, it is clear that highly charged negative or positive peptides can modulate the ribosome occupancy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Moreover, rather than organizing the translation process, the important delay that is observed in ribosome movements with extremely positively charged proteins may signal errors, thereby reducing the translation efficiency. This delay could be one of the selection forces that act against extremely positively charged protein segments in the proteomes of different organisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>Positively charged protein segments are enriched in monosomes</title>
<p>Translating ribosomes exist in the following two different populations: monosomes, when a single ribosome is bound to the mRNA, and polysomes, when two or more ribosomes are bound to the mRNA. Polysomes are usually regarded as the active fraction of the ribosomal pool, but a recent study demonstrated that monosomes also actively translate and are responsible for processing transcripts that have initiation rates that are slower than the elongation and termination rates[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref007">7</xref>]. This condition was consistently found in ORFs shorter than 590 nt, in which the initiation time usually exceeds the elongation time; therefore, termination occurs before a second ribosome can initiate the translation. This condition was also present in longer ORFs, in which other factors may contribute to extending the initiation time, such as the presence of upstream open reading frames (uORFs)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref007">7</xref>]. Polysomes, however, are formed in long transcripts with fast initiation rates.</p>
<p>Because the ribosome occupancy analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6</xref>) suggested that the nascent polypeptide charge can affect the translation rate, we investigated whether the charged stretches could be related to monosomal or polysomal translation. To answer this question, we analyzed <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> proteins that were classified according to their distribution in the monosomal or polysomal fractions as previously determined experimentally as follows[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref007">7</xref>]: “ORFs &lt;590”, with proteins shorter than 590 nt (&lt;590); “Monosome enriched”, with proteins longer than 590 nt but mainly found in the monosomal fraction; “No enrichment” (NE), with proteins equally found in both groups; and “Polysome enriched”, with proteins mainly translated by polysomes. The net charge of the first 30-amino-acid stretches was calculated, and the frequency of the distribution of these sequences is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g007">Fig 7A</xref>. A shift toward a more basic net charge was observed in the “ORFs&lt;590” and “Monosome enriched” groups compared to the “No enrichment category” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g007">Fig 7A</xref>, 7A inset and 7B). Then, the average net charge of each group was analyzed with a focus on the N-terminal, core and C-terminal segments of each group of proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). It is clear that the monosome-enriched proteins had a higher N-terminal net charge (Monosome vs. Polysome, P &lt; 0,05, **) and that the polysome-enriched proteins had a lower, even negative, N-terminal net charge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). This result indicates that proteins with positively charged N-termini are over-represented in the monosomal translation pool (groups “ORFs&lt;590” and “Monosome enriched”), while negatively charged stretches are more abundant in the polysomal translation pool.</p>

<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6B</xref> shows that the ribosome occupancy is more affected by the high values of the N-terminal net-charge. This observation prompted us to analyze the distribution of the different charge values in the monosomal and polysomal groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Proteins with positively charged N-termini are over represented in the &lt;590 nt monosomal fractions (orange line), while the negatively charged N-termini tend to be translated by polysomes (black and red lines). It should be noted, however, that the monosome group formed by mRNAs with more than 590 nts is not enriched with proteins with highly basic N-termini (green line). Heyer and Moore noticed that this group is mainly populated by regulatory proteins with low expression levels. Some sequences contain uORFs that decrease the downstream reinitiating efficiency. However, for other sequences, it was not possible to find a simple explanation for the extremely long initiation time. Here, we show that a high concentration of basic charges cannot account for this effect, even though it could play a role together with other factors, such as the codon arrangement.</p>
<p>The presence of more proteins with highly positive N-termini in the ORFS &lt;590 nt monosomal group is not a direct consequence of the N-terminal charge because the elongation and termination of sequences of this size are typically faster than the initiation time[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref007">7</xref>]. Moreover, the GO analysis of this group showed an enrichment in ribosomal and mitochondrial proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s007">S3 Table</xref>), suggesting structural reasons for the presence of more positively charged sequences in the ORFS &lt;590 nt group. However, we observed that the polysome and polysome top300 groups are even more enriched with ribosome components; however, in this high throughput mode of translation, sequences with neutral or negatively charged N-termini are more abundant than proteins with basic segments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). This distribution may reflect a selection for a rapid translation initiation and efficient elongation on polysomes, while short proteins, which are usually translated by monosomes, allow longer initiation or elongation times due to the basic polypeptides.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our study shows that, universally, there are more negatively charged sequences than positively charged sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g001">Fig 1</xref>). This difference is even greater in extremely charged sequences (charges greater than 14), suggesting that there is a strong evolutionary pressure against super positively charged proteins. Consistently with previously published works, we observed that the N- and C-termini of proteins tend to be enriched with positive stretches (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s002">S2</xref>). Only a part of this distribution can be explained by the presence of localization signals at their N-termini or functional and structural reasons. Even though there was no substantial correlation between the N-terminal charge and certain aspects of translation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s005">S1 Table</xref>), the super positively charged proteins were indeed able to significantly affect the translational speed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g006">Fig 6</xref>). In fact, proteins with super positive N-termini are enriched with functions that are related to nucleic acid binding, such as ribosomal proteins and histones. This finding indicates that proteins that contain very positive stretches for a specific functional reason, such as nucleic acid binding and stabilization, may have to endure a lower translational efficiency. Since there is a translational stall in the synthesis of these positive proteins, it is possible that these proteins might require chaperone assistance to complete their folding or protect themselves from quality-control mechanisms, but no evidence for this hypothesis was observed. Finally, the N-terminal charge was compared across monosomal and polysomal populations. A positive charge and slow translation rates are suggested to aid polysomal translation because these factors can prevent ribosome jamming and collisions[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref016">16</xref>], but we observed an opposite trend (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005549.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Positive N-termini appear to be related to monosomal translation (groups “ORFs &gt; 590” and “Monosome enriched”), which is associated with slow initiation rates, while neutral or negative stretches are more common in proteins that are translated by polysomes, in which fast initiation and elongation rates are favored. The presence of basic peptides in short proteins that are translated by monosomes may be less disruptive than that in long proteins, in which a sudden drop in the translation speed may cause jams and abort translation. This analyses suggest that the translational efficiency may be one of the factors that shape the charge composition and distribution along the primary structures of the proteins.</p>

<title>Net charge and individual charge calculation</title>
<p>To calculate the net charge in a given sequence, a program that is able to screen the primary sequence of a given protein and attribute different values to different amino acids was developed. To determine the charge values for the amino acid residues, we considered the contribution of individual p<italic>K</italic>a values to the Henderson-Hasselbach equation at pH 7.4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The final peptide net charge was determined by summing each amino acid charge[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005549.ref037">37</xref>]. The following charge values were obtained: lysine = +0.999 (rounded value = + 1); arginine = +1.000; histidine = +0.048 (rounded value = 0); glutamic acid = -0.999 (rounded value = -1); aspartic acid = -1.000; cysteine = -0.085 (rounded value = 0) and all other amino acids = 0.000. The N- and C-termini were attributed the charges +0.996 and -1.000, respectively. After the charge attribution, the program calculated the net charge of every 30-amino-acid window in the primary sequence. The distribution of the protein fragments’ net charge from the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> proteome was determined considering charge values with 3 decimal places. The result was compared with a simpler calculation, which considered rounded charge values and disregarded the C- and N-terminal contributions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005549.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Because the distributions were very similar, the rounded values were used in all other calculations.</p>
<p>To calculate the individual charge distribution, we developed a program that is able to screen the primary sequence of a given protein and attribute the same values as the last program, but this program provides the individual charges of the first and last 30 amino acids of the primary sequence.</p>

When Table B values were used, we can observe a slight increase in the negatively charged peptides (upper-right inset). <bold>B.</bold> Net charge ratio between the negative and positive sequences shows a steep increase around charge 14 in both calculations. <bold>C.</bold> Heat map of the <italic>S</italic>. <italic>cerevisiae</italic> proteome with both calculations shows very similar net charge distributions. Red tiles represent the positively charged sequences, black tiles represent the neutral sequences and green tiles represent the negatively charged sequences. The first tile was omitted since the value was very positive (+1.7) because of the contribution of N-term (+1) of each protein.</p>
