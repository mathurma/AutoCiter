<title/>
<p>During plant embryogenesis, once the suspensor organ of the plant embryo has fulfilled its role, it is removed by programmed cell death (PCD). The pro-death cathepsin protease NtCP14 initiates this PCD, but is inhibited by the cystatin NtCYS until the suspensor function is fulfilled.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Plant zygote divides asymmetrically into an apical cell that develops into the embryo proper and a basal cell that generates the suspensor, a vital organ functioning as a conduit of nutrients and growth factors to the embryo proper. After the suspensor has fulfilled its function, it is removed by programmed cell death (PCD) at the late stages of embryogenesis. The molecular trigger of this PCD is unknown. Here we use tobacco (<italic>Nicotiana tabacum</italic>) embryogenesis as a model system to demonstrate that the mechanism triggering suspensor PCD is based on the antagonistic action of two proteins: a protease inhibitor, cystatin NtCYS, and its target, cathepsin H-like protease NtCP14. <italic>NtCYS</italic> is expressed in the basal cell of the proembryo, where encoded cystatin binds to and inhibits NtCP14, thereby preventing precocious onset of PCD. The anti-cell death effect of NtCYS is transcriptionally regulated and is repressed at the 32-celled embryo stage, leading to increased NtCP14 activity and initiation of PCD. Silencing of <italic>NtCYS</italic> or overexpression of <italic>NtCP14</italic> induces precocious cell death in the basal cell lineage causing embryonic arrest and seed abortion. Conversely, overexpression of <italic>NtCYS</italic> or silencing of <italic>NtCP14</italic> leads to profound delay of suspensor PCD. Our results demonstrate that NtCYS-mediated inhibition of NtCP14 protease acts as a bipartite molecular module to control initiation of PCD in the basal cell lineage of plant embryos.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Similar to animals, plants eliminate tissues and organs that have transient function via programmed cell death (PCD). This is especially apparent during plant embryogenesis, when a plant zygote divides into an apical cell, which develops into a mature embryo, and a basal cell, which generates a single organ called the suspensor. During early seed development, the suspensor connects the embryo to the surrounding seed tissues and transports the nutrients and hormones required for its early development. Once its functions are fulfilled, the suspensor is subsequently eliminated by PCD. In this study, we answer a long-standing question in the field by elucidating the mechanism that is responsible for initiating suspensor PCD at a specific time during embryogenesis. Our findings show that in tobacco plant embryos, suspensor PCD is controlled by two antagonistically acting proteins—the pro-death cathepsin protease NtCP14 and its inhibitor cystatin NtCYS, which co-localize to the basal-most cell of the suspensor. High expression levels of <italic>NtCYS</italic> during early embryogenesis confer suspensor growth and viability by suppressing NtCP14 activity. When the suspensor ceases to grow, <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression is downregulated, leading to increased NtCP14 activity and to the initiation of PCD. The genetic modulation of this <italic>NtCYS</italic>/<italic>NtCP14</italic> expression ratio either delays or hastens suspensor PCD, demonstrating its indispensable role in plant embryo development.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Plant development begins with asymmetric division of the zygote, giving rise to two daughter cells with distinct developmental fates. A small apical cell is the founder of cell lineage generating the embryo proper, whereas a larger, basal cell establishes cell lineage leading to the embryo-suspensor. The function of the suspensor is to connect embryo to the surrounding seed tissues and to transport nutrients and growth factors to the embryo proper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Yeung1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Kawashima1">[5]</xref>. The suspensor is an ephemeral organ, which is not required at the advanced stages of embryogenesis and therefore eliminated, providing the earliest manifestation of programmed cell death (PCD) in plant ontogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Bozhkov1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Kawashima1">[5]</xref>. Dismantling of the suspensor cells is a slow process characterized by the gradual digestion of all cellular content by the growing lytic vacuoles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Bozhkov1">[4]</xref>, and is therefore ascribed to the class of vacuolar cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-vanDoorn1">[6]</xref>. Apart from the requirement of type II metacaspase mcII-Pa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Suarez1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Sundstrm1">[8]</xref> and short polypeptide kiss of death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Blanvillain1">[9]</xref> for the execution of suspensor PCD in Norway spruce and <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> embryos, respectively, molecular regulation of suspensor PCD remain elusive. In particular, molecular trigger responsible for the timely initiation of cell death in the suspensor is unknown.</p>
<p>Tobacco (<italic>N. tabacum</italic>) embryos provide a tractable model system to address the molecular mechanisms of suspensor PCD, because of the formation of a single file of four or five suspensor cells through a highly stereotyped and precisely timed sequence of cell divisions, beginning from the first zygotic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Maheshwari1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Zhao1">[12]</xref>. As the first step towards the molecular understanding of the early stages of tobacco embryo development, we recently identified two groups of genes differentially expressed in the apical and basal cells of two-celled proembryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Ma1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<p>Here we demonstrate the function of one of the basal cell-specific genes, <italic>NtCYS</italic>, which encodes a cysteine protease inhibitor cystatin. We show that NtCYS protects the basal cell lineage from precocious initiation of cell death and is indispensable for suspensor formation and completion of embryogenesis. NtCYS exerts its anti-cell death effect by directly inhibiting cathepsin H-like protease NtCP14. Our findings establish NtCYS-dependent inhibition of NtCP14 as a bipartite molecular module regulating the fate of the basal cell lineage at the early stages of plant embryogenesis.</p>

<title>NtCYS Is a New Member of the Cystatin Family in Tobacco</title>
<p>From a single cell transcript profile analysis designed to identify cell lineage-specific genes in two-celled proembryos of tobacco <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Ma1">[13]</xref>, we selected EST 858 (National Center for Biotechnology Information [NCBI] [<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov" xlink:type="simple">http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov</ext-link>]: HS084274, HS084275) because of its strictly basal cell-specific expression pattern. Rapid amplification of cDNA ends (RACE) followed by three rounds of genome walking produced a 683-bp cDNA and a 4,247-bp upstream region containing an ATG initiation codon. Analysis of the ORF indicated that the gene contains a complete ORF of 420 nucleotides encoding a protein of 140 amino acids. BLASTP search returned several matches to proteins containing a cystatin-like domain and a cystatin-specific QxVxG motif, indicating that the gene is a new member of the cystatin family in <italic>N. tabacum</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The gene was named <italic>NtCYS</italic>. The encoded protein clusters most closely with proteins from <italic>Populus trichocarpa</italic>, <italic>Glycine max</italic>, and <italic>Medicago truncatula</italic>, but is distant from homologs present in <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> and <italic>Brassica oleracea</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s001">Figure S1B</xref>).</p>
<p>Most cystatins can inhibit activity of cysteine proteases from the papain C1A family <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Arai1">[14]</xref>. To investigate the biochemical properties of NtCYS, inhibition assays with recombinant NtCYS were carried out against papain (from papaya latex) and human liver cathepsins L and B using substrates Z-FR-AMC, Z-FR-AMC, and Z-RR-AMC, respectively. While NtCYS efficiently inhibited the activities of papain (K<sub>i</sub> = 64.5±5.9 nM) and human cathepsin L (K<sub>i</sub> = 0.39±0.04 nM), no measurable inhibition of human cathepsin B was detected. These data establish NtCYS as a member of the cystatin family with inhibitory activity against a subset of cysteine proteases.</p>

<title><italic>NtCYS</italic> Is Exclusively Expressed in the Basal Cell</title>
<p>To investigate the expression pattern of <italic>NtCYS</italic>, RNA was extracted from sperm cells, egg cells, zygotes, two-celled proembryos, and eight-celled, 32-celled, and heart embryos, and <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression was determined using semi-quantitative reverse transcription PCR (RT-PCR). <italic>NtCYS</italic> transcripts were detected in all samples, except for sperm cells and heart embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We also assessed the levels of <italic>NtCYS</italic> transcripts at nine successive stages of embryogenesis, as well as in different plant organs by quantitative real-time RT-PCR (RT-qPCR). <italic>NtCYS</italic> was highly expressed in two- and four-celled proembryos (stages 1 and 2, respectively) and in the eight-celled embryos (stage 3), whereas the expression was barely detectable at more advanced stages of embryogenesis and was absent in non-embryonic organs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain insight into the spatio-temporal pattern of <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression, we generated transgenic plants carrying the <italic>proNtCYS</italic>::<italic>NtCYS-GFP</italic> construct. In the two-celled proembryos, NtCYS-GFP was detected only in the basal cell, but never in the apical cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). When the apical cell divided, giving rise to a two-celled embryo proper, NtCYS-GFP signal continued to stay exclusively in the basal cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Surprisingly, two rounds of cell divisions in the basal cell lineage did not change the localization of NtCYS-GFP, which remained restricted to the basal cell of the two- and four-celled suspensors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>). <italic>NtCYS-GFP</italic> expression markedly declined in the basal cell of the eight-celled embryos (stage 3) and was barely detectable in embryos at stage 4 and 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1H and 1I</xref>). These results confirm basal cell-specific expression of <italic>NtCYS</italic> in the two-celled proembryos and demonstrate that NtCYS-GFP has strict basipetally polarized distribution, resulting in its persistent localization in the basal cell throughout the early stages of embryogenesis.</p>

<title>Suspensor PCD Starts from the Basal Cell of 32-Celled Embryos</title>
<p>We investigated the dynamics of suspensor PCD during a time-course of tobacco embryo development using an array of cell death markers. Following zygotic cell division, the basal cell undergoes two successive divisions, giving rise to a four-celled suspensor at the eight-celled embryo stage (stage 3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Deoxynucleotidyl transferase (TdT)-mediated dUTP nick-end labeling (TUNEL) and double staining with fluorescein diacetate (FDA) and propidium iodide (PI) showed that all cells in both apical and basal cell lineages at stages 1 to 3 maintained nuclear DNA and plasma membrane integrity (unpublished data). The first TUNEL signal was detected in the enlarged basal cell of the 32-celled embryo (stage 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). During embryo development through stages 4 to 8, TUNEL staining gradually progressed from the basal cell to the uppermost cell of the suspensor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g002">Figure 2B–2E, and 2L</xref>), Unlike TUNEL, in the most embryos analyzed PI staining was absent in the suspensor cells until stage 8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g002">Figure 2F–2K, and 2M</xref>). Consequently, DNA fragmentation precedes plasma membrane permeabilization in this PCD system.</p>

<p>We further investigated cytological features of the suspensor PCD using transmission electron microscopy (TEM). The nuclear envelope appeared intact until globular-to-heart transition (stage 7), when the nucleus became lobed and crenulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). These early nuclear envelope events were followed by its progressive disassembly until complete disintegration at stage 9 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>). Consistent with other examples of vacuolar cell death in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-vanDoorn1">[6]</xref>, gradual clearance of cell contents was correlated with increased vacuolization of the cytoplasm without discernible loss of cellular turgor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3A–3D</xref>).</p>

<p>Recent evidence suggests the involvement of proteases with caspase 1, 3, and 6-like activities in various types of PCD in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Bozhkov2">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Han1">[20]</xref>. To establish whether caspase-like activities are involved in tobacco suspensor PCD, we studied the localization of cell-permeable fluorescent inhibitors of caspases 1, 3, and 6 in the embryos at stages 3 to 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3E–3H</xref>). None of these activities were detected at stage 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). The first fluorescent signal was detected at stage 4 for caspase 3-like activity, which persisted until stage 6 or 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3F and 3H</xref>). Caspase 1- and 6-like activities were first detected at stage 5 and remained in most of the embryos until stage 7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3E, 3G, and 3H</xref>). Notably, the spatio-temporal pattern of all three proteolytic activities followed that of TUNEL, first appearing in the basal cell and then moving acropetally towards the uppermost suspensor cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g002">Figures 2A–2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">3E–3G</xref>). No caspase-like activity was detected in the embryo proper. Together, our data demonstrate that PCD in the tobacco embryo-suspensor is a highly ordered and stereotyped process, which starts in the basal cell of 32-celled embryo (stage 4) and then progresses acropetally towards the uppermost suspensor cell adjacent to the embryo proper. This PCD exhibits cytological hallmarks of vacuolar cell death, including cytoplasm vacuolization, nuclear envelope disassembly, DNA fragmentation, and the absence of protoplast shrinkage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-vanDoorn1">[6]</xref>, and is accompanied by the activation of proteases with caspase-like specificity.</p>

<title>Downregulation of <italic>NtCYS</italic> Induces Precocious Cell Death in the Basal Cell Lineage and Embryo Abortion</title>
<p>Since the onset of the suspensor PCD occurred concurrently with a steady decrease in <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression in the embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g002">2</xref>), we speculated that NtCYS could control this PCD. To address this possibility we silenced <italic>NtCYS</italic> using three independent RNA interference (RNAi) constructs expressed under the native promoter and selected six homozygous RNAi lines for detailed analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We observed that in contrast to wild type (WT), a substantial fraction of two-celled proembryos in these lines (18.4%–45.3% for different lines) had PI-positive and FDA-negative basal cells, indicating that they were already dead (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). However, the apical cells in these proembryos were still alive (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>

<p>To further investigate premature death of the basal cells triggered by NtCYS deficiency, we evaluated nuclear integrity in the two-celled proembryos in WT and three <italic>NtCYS</italic>-silenced lines using TUNEL and TEM. The frequency of TUNEL in the basal cells in all three lines increased dramatically compared to the WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4D and 4E</xref>). Furthermore, TEM revealed nuclear lobing and condensation in the basal cells but not in the apical cells of the proembryos from <italic>NtCYS</italic>-silenced lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4F–4K</xref>). As a substantial part of two-celled proembryos from RNAi lines developed further to four-celled proembryos (stage 2) and then to eight-celled embryos (stage 3), we assessed whether these more advanced stages were also associated with the appearance of TUNEL in the suspensor. In contrast to the WT, where most proembryos initiated DNA fragmentation in the suspensor when the embryo proper had 32 cells (stage 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g002">Figure 2</xref>), <italic>NtCYS</italic>-silenced lines revealed frequent occurrence of TUNEL in the suspensor at stages 2 and 3 (TUNEL frequencies 28.9% and 15.6%, respectively, <italic>n</italic> = 90). Precocious activation of PCD in the basal domain caused abortion of 20.7% to 40% of seeds in different NtCYS-deficient lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4L and 4N</xref>). Among the aborted seeds analyzed in the NtCYS-deficient line L2-6, 44% of embryos were arrested at the transition from stage 1 to stage 2 and 51.7% at the transition from stage 2 to stage 3 (1,283 seeds analyzed). Cessation of embryogenesis was correlated with aberrant patterns of cell division in the apical cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4M</xref>).</p>
<p>Collectively, these data demonstrate that NtCYS acts to suppress cell death in the basal cell lineage throughout the early stages embryogenesis until the eight-celled embryo (stage 3). Furthermore, this anti-cell death role of NtCYS is crucial for the formation of a functional suspensor and completion of embryogenesis.</p>

<title>Downregulation of <italic>NtCYS</italic> Activates Proteases with Cathepsin- and Caspase-Like Specificities</title>
<p>Since <italic>NtCYS</italic> encodes a cystatin, which inhibits papain and human cathepsin L <italic>in vitro</italic>, we investigated whether cathepsin-like activity correlates with <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression in tobacco proembryos. For this, we compared proteolytic activities of the total protein extracts prepared from two-celled proembryos in WT and <italic>NtCYS</italic> RNAi plants using the fluorescent peptides Z-FR-AMC (for cathepsin L-like proteases), Z-RR-AMC (for cathepsin B-like proteases), and Bz-FVR-AMC (for cathepsin H-like proteases). Silencing of <italic>NtCYS</italic> led to 1.4- and 2.6-fold increase in proteolytic activity towards Z-RR-AMC and Bz-FVR-AMC, respectively, but did not affect activity towards Z-FR-AMC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4O</xref>). This suggests that the anti-cell death effect of NtCYS in the basal cell lineage may be reliant on inhibition of cathepsin B- and/or cathepsin H-like proteases.</p>
<p>Normal progression of PCD in the tobacco embryo-suspensor is associated with increased caspase-like activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To determine whether NtCYS deficiency-induced death of the basal cells in the two-celled proembryos implicates activation of proteases with caspase-like specificity, we measured proteolytic activity in the extracts of two-celled proembryos from WT and <italic>NtCYS</italic> RNAi plants using caspase substrates. Silencing of <italic>NtCYS</italic> induced 1.6-, 2.0-, and 7.4-fold increase in the activities of proteases with caspase 1-, caspase 3-, and caspase 6-like substrate specificity, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4P</xref>). The specificity of the individual activities was confirmed by competition assays using aldehyde (CHO) caspase inhibitors specific for corresponding activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figure 4P</xref>). Our data corroborate that the NtCYS-inhibitable cell death pathway in the basal cell lineage involves activation of proteases with caspase-like substrate specificity.</p>

<title>Molecular Targets of NtCYS</title>
<p>We speculated that NtCYS could directly inhibit cysteine proteases in the basal cell lineage until the 32-celled embryo stage, thereby preventing precocious activation of cell death. To retrieve cysteine protease genes from the tobacco genome, about 320,000 EST sequences were analyzed. Twenty genes encoding cysteine proteases were found to be expressed in two-celled proembryos (unpublished data). Next, we used bimolecular fluorescence complementation (BiFC) analysis in the transiently co-transfected tobacco epidermal cells to study interaction between NtCYS and the cysteine proteases, which revealed interaction with six proteases, named NtCP3, NtCP6, NtCP8, NtCP14, NtCP15 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and NtCP23 (unpublished data).</p>

<p>Alignment of the predicted amino acid sequences showed that all six proteases contained a conserved non-contiguous ERFNIN motif (EX<sub>3</sub>RX<sub>3</sub>FX<sub>2</sub>NX<sub>3</sub>I/VX<sub>3</sub>N) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which is typical for cathepsin L- and H-like proteases, but not for cathepsin B-like proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Karrer1">[21]</xref>. Next, we assessed the substrate specificities of these proteases using recombinant proteins and a panel of peptidic substrates specific for cathepsins (with Arg at the P1 position), legumains (with Asn at P1), and caspases (with Asp at P1). None of the six recombinant proteases could cleave caspase and legumain substrates, but all readily cleaved cathepsin substrates, confirming their classification as cathepsins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g005">Figures 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s003">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Plant cysteine cathepsins are generally divided into four subtypes: B-, F-, H-, and L-like, which can be distinguished by their amino acid sequences and different specificities towards residues at the P2 position in their substrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Martinez1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Martinez2">[23]</xref>.

While five out of six proteases preferred the cathepsin L substrate Z-FR-AMC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), a single protease, NtCP14, displayed a preference for Bz-FVR-AMC, a substrate of cathepsin H-like proteases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g005">Figure 5B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Martinez2">[23]</xref>.

As expected, recombinant NtCYS could efficiently inhibit cathepsin H-like activity of recombinant NtCP14 (K<sub>i(app)</sub> = 0.74±0.18 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>
<p>To gain insight into intracellular localization of NtCYS and NtCP14, we transiently expressed fluorescent proteins in onion (<italic>Allium cepa</italic>) epidermal cells, and found that both proteins are cytoplasmic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g005">Figure 5E</xref>) and have strong co-localization with endoplasmic reticulum (ER) marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Haseloff1">[24]</xref>, but not with Golgi marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s004">Figure S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-SaintJore1">[25]</xref>. On the basis of the above results, we chose to work further with the NtCYS-inhibitable cathepsin NtCP14, which possessed an <italic>in vitro</italic> P2 substrate specificity similar to that found in protein extracts from the NtCYS-deficient two-celled proembryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figures 4O</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g005">5B</xref>).</p>
<p>The level of <italic>NtCP14</italic> expression was high at the early stages of embryogenesis, indicating significant overlap between <italic>NtCP14</italic> and <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figures 1B, 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s005">S5A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s005">S5B</xref>).

<title>Constitutive Overexpression of <italic>NtCP14</italic> Induces Embryonic Death at the Two-Celled Proembryo Stage</title>
<p>To genetically address the role of NtCYS-inhibitable cathepsin H-like protease NtCP14 in embryogenesis, we generated tobacco lines overexpressing <italic>NtCP14</italic>, as well as the selected cathepsin L-like genes <italic>NtCP6</italic>, <italic>NtCP8</italic>, and <italic>NtCP15</italic>, under the control of the constitutive promoter <italic>proZC1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">Figures 6A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s006">S6</xref>).

While embryogenesis progressed normally in the cathepsin L-like protease-overexpressing lines (unpublished data), overexpression of <italic>NtCP14</italic> induced massive embryonic death, resulting in the abortion of 23% to 54% of seeds in various lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Embryonic death occurred mostly at the two-celled proembryo stage, when both apical and basal cells displayed PI-positive nuclei and a lack of FDA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">Figure 6D and 6E</xref>).

<title>NtCP14 Activation Is Restricted to the Basal Cell Lineage during the Normal Course of Embryogenesis</title>
<p>So far we have shown that <italic>NtCP14</italic> is expressed in both apical and basal cell lineages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s005">Figure S5C</xref>) and that the increase in cathepsin H-like activity achieved through constitutive overexpression of <italic>NtCP14</italic> in both cell lineages induces cell death at the two-celled proembryo stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">Figure 6</xref>). A noteworthy point is that in contrast to the constitutive overexpression of <italic>NtCP14</italic>, its basal cell-specific overexpression using the <italic>NtCYS</italic> promoter did not reveal simultaneous loss of viability in apical and basal cells. Instead, we observed precocious cell death in the basal cell only, with subsequent developmental arrest and a high incidence of seed abortion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s007">Figure S7</xref>); i.e., a phenotype similar to that of <italic>NtCYS</italic> RNAi lines. These data suggest that during the normal course of embryogenesis, the proteolytic activity of NtCP14 must be tightly regulated to sustain apical-basal patterning and embryo survival. To further corroborate this point, we measured cathepsin H-like proteolytic activity in the microsurgically separated WT embryo propers and suspensors at developmental stages 3 and 4 using the substrate Bz-FVR-AMC. The proteolytic activity in the suspensor was at least 6-fold of that in the embryo proper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">Figure 6I</xref>). Next, we evaluated the temporal profile of cathepsin H-like activity in the basal cell lineage at successive stages of embryogenesis, beginning from the basal cell of the two-celled proembryo (stage 1) until the fully differentiated suspensor of the heart-stage embryo (stage 8). The activity in the basal cell lineage remained low in the proembryos and then increased dramatically once the embryos progressed through stages 3 (eight-celled embryo) and 4 (32-celled embryo), i.e., the stages when suspensor PCD began (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">Figure 6J</xref>). Importantly, the peak of the NtCP14-dependent proteolytic activity coincided with the steady decline in <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), providing additional evidence for the functional role of NtCYS-mediated inhibition of NtCP14 in the regulation of the timing of suspensor PCD. Collectively, these results indicate that activation of NtCP14 in the basal cell lineage of eight- to 32-celled embryos is required for the timely onset of suspensor PCD.</p>

<p>Because silencing of <italic>NtCYS</italic> or overexpression of <italic>NtCP14</italic> induced precocious cell death in the basal cell lineage, we argued that NtCYS-NtCP14 could act as a bipartite molecular module to control initiation of suspensor PCD.

<p>Similar phenotype with delayed suspensor PCD was observed in both <italic>NtCP14</italic> RNAi lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g007">Figures 7L</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s008">S8B–S8G</xref>) and lines expressing NtCYS-GFP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Taken together, our reverse genetic experiments demonstrate that artificial intervention in the balance between antagonistic actions of NtCYS and NtCP14 in tobacco embryos can upset (accelerate or delay) initiation of cell death in the basal cell lineage. This establishes NtCYS-NtCP14 as the bipartite molecular module that controls PCD in the embryo-suspensor.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Once the full-length suspensor is formed in a tobacco seed through a few rounds of transverse cell divisions, suspensor cells start dying, with the basal cell committed to death in the first place. Execution of suspensor PCD is a slow process that takes 4 to 5 d from the first signs of DNA fragmentation in the 32-celled embryo until the loss of plasma membrane integrity in the heart-stage embryo. The progression of suspensor PCD occurs in a gradient-like fashion, starting from the basal cell of the 32-celled embryo and then moving acropetally to the uppermost suspensor cell while at the same time the embryo proper undergoes rapid development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">3</xref>). Notably, the formation of the PCD gradient in the embryo-suspensor seems to be an evolutionarily conserved phenomenon in plants, occurring regardless of phylogenetic position and embryo morphology, as a similar gradient of suspensor PCD has been described in a gymnosperm, Norway spruce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Bozhkov1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Smertenko1">[26]</xref>.</p>
<p>In the present work we show that premature initiation of cell death in the basal cell lineage leads to embryo lethality. This implies that plant embryos must be equipped with a mechanism ensuring timely onset of suspensor PCD and preventing its precocious initiation. In tobacco embryos this mechanism is based on cystatin NtCYS-mediated inhibition of cathepsin H-like protease NtCP14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g008">Figure 8</xref>). <italic>NtCYS</italic> is a basal cell-specific gene asymmetrically expressed upon zygotic division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The expression level of <italic>NtCYS</italic> is high during transition from the eight-celled to the 32-celled embryo and then decreases dramatically, with simultaneous initiation of DNA fragmentation in the basal cell.</p>

<p>Identification of NtCP14 as an interacting protein of NtCYS explains the anti-cell death mechanism of NtCYS, which is essential for protecting the basal domain of tobacco embryos from precocious cell death. While <italic>NtCP14</italic> is expressed in all embryonic cells throughout the entire period of embryogenesis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001655.s005">Figure S5</xref>), high catalytic activity of the encoded protease is restricted to the suspensor cells of eight- and 32-celled embryos, thus correlating with the decreased <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression and the onset of PCD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">Figures 6J</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g008">8</xref>). We envisage NtCYS and its target protease NtCP14 as a bipartite molecular module that evolved to control PCD in the basal cell lineage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The balance between anti-death (NtCYS) and pro-death (NtCP14) components of the module ensures timely initiation of suspensor PCD and successful embryo development.</p>
<p>An intriguing question is what is the primary signal causing rapid downregulation of <italic>NtCYS</italic> expression and triggering suspensor PCD and where this signal comes from. Since PCD starts from the basal end of the suspensor, the signal might be derived from cells at micropyle. An alternative would be that the source of signal is the embryo proper, a scenario supported by the observations that suspensor PCD always starts when embryo proper has attained 32-celled stage. In either case, detailed investigations should be carried out to understand the nature of the signal.</p>
<p>Cathepsins is a collective term for a large number of structurally unrelated cysteine, serine and aspartic proteases, most of which can be found in the lysosomes or acidic vacuoles. There is a growing body of experimental evidence for the role of cathepsins B, D, and L in the execution of cell death and in the mediation of cross-talk between different types of cell death in animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Kroemer1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Chwieralski1">[28]</xref>. In contrast to animals, little is known about the role of cathepsins in plant PCD, except that cathepsin B proteases have been shown to act as pro-death components during hypersensitive response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Gilroy1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Hofius1">[30]</xref>. Apart from regulating neurotransmitters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Lu1">[31]</xref> and tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Jevnikar1">[32]</xref> in animals, the physiological role of cathepsin H-type proteases remained poorly understood. In the present work, we demonstrate that NtCP14 is a cathepsin H-type protease with a preference for substrate Bz-FVR-AMC and is a positive regulator of suspensor PCD. In contrast to a single cell-specific expression pattern of <italic>NtCYS</italic>, <italic>NtCP14</italic> is expressed in all embryonic cells, suggesting that the encoded protease may have other roles in embryogenesis besides regulating suspensor PCD.</p>
<p>While there are no close homologues of animal caspases in plants, and metacaspases (ancestral proteases found in protozoa, fungi, and plants) do not have aspartate cleavage specificity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Tsiatsiani1">[33]</xref>, at least three types of proteases with caspase-like activity exist in plants and mediate initiation and execution of PCD. These include vacuolar processing enzymes with a caspase 1-like substrate preference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Hatsugai1">[16]</xref>, the proteasome with caspase 3-like activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Hatsugai2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Han1">[20]</xref>, and a small subset of subtilisin-like serine proteases possessing caspase 6-like activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Vartapetian1">[34]</xref>. Apart from the observation that all three types of caspase-like activities correlate with the progression of suspensor PCD in WT tobacco embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g003">Figure 3</xref>), we found that increase of NtCP14 activity in the two-celled proembryos achieved through genetic intervention in the NtCYS-NtCP14 module is accompanied by a corresponding increase in caspase-like activities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g006">6</xref>). Therefore, the NtCYS-NtCP14 molecular module seems to occupy an apical position in the PCD signaling pathway, upstream to the proteases with caspase-like substrate specificity. Further studies are required to characterize and link together downstream components of the NtCYS-NtCP14 dependent PCD, in particular proteases with caspase-like specificity, metacaspases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Suarez1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Sundstrm1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Tsiatsiani1">[33]</xref> and kiss of death peptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Blanvillain1">[9]</xref>. Unraveling of the NtCP14 degradome will also advance our understanding of the PCD pathways operating in the plant embryo-suspensor.</p>
<p>The very narrow, basal cell-specific expression pattern of <italic>NtCYS</italic> in tobacco embryos poses an intriguing question regarding how the proteolytic activity of NtCP14 is controlled in the other suspensor cells, as well as in the cells of the apical cell lineage, which are destined to survive but devoid of NtCYS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001655-g008">Figure 8</xref>). As suggested recently by Cambra and co-authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001655-Cambra1">[35]</xref>, the activities of cathepsin proteases in vivo may be controlled by several mechanisms, including local zymogene concentration and the presence of specific repertoire of cystatin inhibitors. Regardless of the actual mechanism that prevents activation of NtCP14 in the living embryonic cells, we demonstrate here that it is its local interaction with NtCYS in the basal cell that determines the life-or-death fate of both basal and apical cell lineages in the plant embryo.</p>
