<p>Mechanical force plays an important role in the physiology of eukaryotic cells whose dominant structural constituent is the actin cytoskeleton composed mainly of actin and actin crosslinking proteins (ACPs). Thus, knowledge of rheological properties of actin networks is crucial for understanding the mechanics and processes of cells. We used Brownian dynamics simulations to study the viscoelasticity of crosslinked actin networks. Two methods were employed, bulk rheology and segment-tracking rheology, where the former measures the stress in response to an applied shear strain, and the latter analyzes thermal fluctuations of individual actin segments of the network. It was demonstrated that the storage shear modulus (<italic>G</italic>′) increases more by the addition of ACPs that form orthogonal crosslinks than by those that form parallel bundles. In networks with orthogonal crosslinks, as crosslink density increases, the power law exponent of <italic>G</italic>′ as a function of the oscillation frequency decreases from 0.75, which reflects the transverse thermal motion of actin filaments, to near zero at low frequency. Under increasing prestrain, the network becomes more elastic, and three regimes of behavior are observed, each dominated by different mechanisms: bending of actin filaments, bending of ACPs, and at the highest prestrain tested (55%), stretching of actin filaments and ACPs. In the last case, only a small portion of actin filaments connected via highly stressed ACPs support the strain. We thus introduce the concept of a ‘supportive framework,’ as a subset of the full network, which is responsible for high elasticity. Notably, entropic effects due to thermal fluctuations appear to be important only at relatively low prestrains and when the average crosslinking distance is comparable to or greater than the persistence length of the filament. Taken together, our results suggest that viscoelasticity of the actin network is attributable to different mechanisms depending on the amount of prestrain.</p>

<p>The actin cytoskeleton provides structural integrity to a cell, is highly dynamic, and plays a central role in a wide variety of phenomena such as migration and the sensation of external forces. For years, researchers have studied the mechanics of the cytoskeleton by creating actin gels in the laboratory in combination with proteins that bridge between and reinforce the actin gel found inside cells. These gels, however, failed to replicate many aspects of cell behavior. Recent studies have shown that tension within the cytoskeleton contributes to the observed stiffness of cells. Still, our understanding of cytoskeletal mechanics is incomplete, and many observed phenomena cannot be explained by existing models. Here, we simulate a three-dimensional network containing actin filaments linked together by other proteins. We studied the relative contributions of thermal fluctuations of the network and the stiffness of filaments and linking proteins. Under conditions that replicate those in a cell, properties of the linking proteins are surprisingly significant, as is the stiffness of the actin filament to stretching. Thermal fluctuations are relatively unimportant, but become more so at low levels of resting tension. At high tensions, a small fraction of filaments support a majority of the load.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Actin is the most abundant intracellular protein in eukaryotic cells and plays an important role in a wide range of biological and mechanical phenomena <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Lodish1">[1]</xref>. Monomeric actin (G-actin) self-assembles to a filamentous form, F-actin, which is crosslinked into the actin cytoskeleton by various actin crosslinking proteins (ACPs). It has been known that mechanical force plays a crucial role in the physiology of eukaryotic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Ingber1">[2]</xref>, and therefore appropriate functions of living cells are attributable to the rigorous control of their rheological properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Janmey1">[3]</xref>. Thus, investigating rheological properties of actin networks is indispensable for elucidating the mechanics of cells as well as for understanding a wide variety of cellular processes. Experiments have been conducted to probe viscoelastic properties of cells and reconstituted actin gels using a variety of techniques such as microbead rheology, magnetic bead cytometry, and bulk rheology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Hoffman1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Kasza1">[23]</xref>. In experiments, discrepancies have been observed among measurements using dissimilar methodologies, and many of the observed features are not well understood. For example, viscoelastic moduli measured by single-bead passive microbead rheology are much smaller than those determined by 2-point microrheology or bulk rheology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Hoffman1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Gardel1">[6]</xref>. Also, although distinct power law responses of the storage modulus have often been observed <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-VanCitters1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Alcaraz1">[11]</xref>, their origin is not yet clearly understood.</p>
<p>Concurrently, characteristics of semi-flexible polymer networks have been studied theoretically and computationally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Head1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Prasad1">[34]</xref>. Two- <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Head1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Onck1">[25]</xref> and 3-dimensional computational models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Huisman1">[26]</xref> studying affine and nonaffine deformations of semi-flexible networks responding to large shear strain revealed two regimes dominated by bending or stretching of filaments, respectively. Recently, using a microstructure-based continuum mechanics approach, Palmer and Boyce reproduced many of the rheological properties of actin networks observed in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Palmer1">[27]</xref>. The viscoelastic behavior of semi-flexible networks was also investigated using dissipative particle dynamics and the concept of microbead rheology, where scale-free behavior of the bead displacement was observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-TerOganessian1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-TerOganessian2">[29]</xref>. To date, however, most of these models neither explicitly take into account ACP mechanics nor systematically account for thermal fluctuations, nor have they been used to explore the effects of finite prestress on viscoelasticity, all of which are potentially important factors governing matrix viscoelasticity.</p>
<p>With the objective of extending these previous works and providing new insights into underlying mechanisms, we develop a Brownian dynamics (BD) model of the actin network that includes features such as steric interaction among filaments, the usage of explicit crosslinkers, a more realistic morphology, and the consideration of crosslinker stiffness. By measuring stress in response to applied oscillatory shear strain (“bulk rheology”) and thermal fluctuations of individual segments in the polymeric chain (“segment-tracking rheology”), we investigate viscoelastic properties of actin-like networks. Throughout this paper, for convenience, the term, “actin network” is used to refer to the network being simulated. It should be noted, however, that some of the properties employed in our model, especially for ACPs, were estimated since they are not well-known experimentally. Due to simplifications in the model and parameter uncertainty, the results should therefore be viewed as representative of a generic crosslinked network, but lack a quantitatively precise correspondence to actin networks.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, we found features that semi-quantitatively capture experimentally observed behaviors of actin networks. The storage and loss moduli, <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″, followed power laws as functions of the oscillation frequency. As the prestrain increased, the network became increasingly elastic. Bending and extensional stiffnesses of actin filaments and ACPs played an important role depending on the degree of prestrain. We found that the mechanical response of the network is dominated by a percolating ‘supportive framework,’ while other actin filaments contribute little to the viscoelastic moduli. Surprisingly, in typical physiological conditions where the distance between crosslinking points along F-actin is much shorter than the actin persistence length, we found that thermal fluctuation plays little role in viscoelasticity, so that the network consisting of crosslinked F-actins can be viewed essentially as a deterministic overdamped system in a viscous medium. In sum, our computational model elucidates how various mechanical responses (thermal forces and the bending and stretching of actin filaments and ACPs) govern viscoelastic properties of the network under different conditions.</p>

<title>Model overview</title>
<p>To create an actin network, we began with a uniform distribution of actin monomers with ACPs dispersed randomly, and allowed the network to polymerize until 99% of the monomers were incorporated into filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Kim1">[35]</xref>. Motion of the monomers, filaments, and ACPs followed Brownian dynamics, and bonding occurred according to a first order irreversible process. After polymerization, we applied a coarse-graining procedure explained in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> to cover a larger system size. In the resulting networks, the filament length distribution and the network morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Kim1">[35]</xref> bear a closer resemblance to reconstituted actin gels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g001">Figure 1</xref>) than those generated by the random placement of equal-length filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Head1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Huisman1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-TerOganessian2">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-DiDonna1">[32]</xref>. F-actins and ACPs in our model are characterized by introducing bending and extensional stiffnesses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000439-t001">Table 1</xref>). Two types of ACPs were used, depending on whether they form bundles (ACP<sup>B</sup>) or orthogonal networks (ACP<sup>C</sup>) during the polymerization process with equilibrium crosslinking angles of 0 and π/2, respectively, between the two crosslinked actin filaments.</p>

In (A), due to the small computational domain, ladder-like structures are predominant rather than long, thick bundles. The linear dimension of the simulation box is 2.8 µm. These two networks form the basis for all simulations; networks with low <italic>R</italic> were obtained from these by eliminating a portion of active ACPs.

<p>Viscoelasticity of the network was probed in two ways: 1) In <italic>segment-tracking rheology</italic>, we analyzed the random thermal motion of many individual actin segments in the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Mason1">[36]</xref>. 2) In <italic>bulk rheology</italic>, we applied an oscillatory shear strain on the top surface of the system while holding the bottom surface fixed. The measured viscoelastic moduli may depend on detailed geometry and the extent of percolation, especially if the network is small. Therefore, the use of a geometrically identical network for all simulations enables us to systematically control and isolate the effects of a given parameter. We thus used the two representative networks shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g001">Figure 1</xref> for our measurements. The filament length (<italic>L</italic><sub>f</sub>) was 1.5 µm±0.65 µm (average±standard deviation), and the actin concentration (<italic>C</italic><sub>A</sub>) was 12.1 µM. We randomly removed ACPs from the networks to change <italic>R</italic>, the ratio of ACP concentration to <italic>C</italic><sub>A</sub> (parameters are defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000439-t001">Table 1</xref>). Actin filaments longer than the width of the simulation domain (2.8 µm) were severed to reduce finite size effects.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Comparison to experiments</title>
<p>While recognizing the limitations of any direct quantitative comparisons between our model predictions and experiments, we conducted one set of experimental measurements under conditions similar to those of the simulation (mean filament length &lt;<italic>L</italic><sub>f</sub>&gt; = 1.5 µm<sub>.</sub>, <italic>R</italic> = 0.01, and <italic>C</italic><sub>A</sub> = 12.1 µM) and compared viscoelastic moduli. In order to match &lt;<italic>L</italic><sub>f</sub>&gt;, gelsolin was added to the sample; the length distribution was determined by fluorescence imaging. One difficulty in matching simulation and experimental conditions originates from the fact that <italic>R</italic> in the experiment corresponds to the total amount of ACPs in the sample, including both those in active and inactive (partially bound or free) states, whereas in our simulation, it indicates the net amount of active ACPs that crosslink or bundle two filaments. In addition, due to computational constraints, the oscillation frequency tested in the simulation overlaps that of the bulk rheology experiment only in a narrow range. Despite these difficulties, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g002">Figure 2</xref>, the values of <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″ computed using the model are in reasonable agreement with the experiment, both qualitatively and quantitatively, perhaps better than one might have expected given the range of uncertainty of some of the parameters.</p>

<title>Effects of the concentration and type of ACPs on <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″</title>
<p>We computed <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″ of structures crosslinked via ACP<sup>C</sup> (<italic>R</italic> = 0, 0.01, and 0.021) and those bundled via ACP<sup>B</sup> (<italic>R</italic> = 0, 0.01, 0.02, and 0.04) using both bulk rheology and segment-tracking rheology. Networks without ACPs exhibit a slope of <italic>G</italic>′ close to 0.75, as indicated by the black solid line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g004">4A</xref>. This value has been observed in various experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Deng1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Gittes2">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Palmer2">[39]</xref>, and it is known to originate from transverse thermal undulations of actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Gittes1">[30]</xref>. Interestingly, when repulsive forces between the filaments are eliminated, the slope of <italic>G</italic>′ estimated via segment-tracking rheology approaches unity (data not shown), implying that the volume exclusion effect of neighboring filaments creates a tube-shaped space that hampers free translation and rotation of the filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Isambert1">[31]</xref>. Although the filament confined in this way can perform reptation, it is operative on long time scales that are beyond those attainable in these simulations, so the mean square displacement (MSD) observed here primarily reflects transverse thermal motions, resulting in the 0.75 slope. On the other hand, the plateau in <italic>G</italic>′ often exhibited by experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Gardel1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Liu1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Xu2">[40]</xref> was not observed within the frequency range of these simulations. Note that the plateau modulus is induced by entanglement effects that become more pronounced at longer time scales. The combination in these simulations of relatively short filaments leading to longer entanglement time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Liu1">[12]</xref> and computational constraints precluding simulations for longer times limited our ability to observe a plateau.</p>

<p>Values of viscoelastic moduli attained using bulk rheology and segment-tracking rheology exhibit surprisingly good agreement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g003">Figure 3</xref>) even though segment-tracking rheology (Equation 11) was originally developed for a test particle much larger than the meshwork of filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Mason1">[36]</xref>. ACP<sup>C</sup> elevates the magnitude of <italic>G</italic>′ and reduces its slope (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), implying that the frequency dependence of <italic>G</italic>′ is reduced as networks incorporate more ACP<sup>C</sup>. <italic>G</italic>′ follows a power law, <italic>G</italic>′∼<italic>f<sub>s</sub></italic><sup>0.3</sup> (dashed line), for <italic>f</italic><sub>s</sub>&lt;100 Hz at the highest crosslink density, <italic>R</italic> = 0.021, which is within the range of powers observed in cells, 0.15–0.3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Stamenovic1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Alcaraz1">[11]</xref>. However, the magnitude of <italic>G</italic>′ from these simulations was much lower than <italic>in vivo</italic> values. This is likely due to many factors, notably the absence of prestrain. <italic>G</italic>″ increases slightly as the amount of ACP<sup>C</sup> is increased, but the slope remains similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In addition, a decrease in the phase delay, tan<sup>−1</sup>(<italic>G</italic>″/<italic>G</italic>′) (Equation 10), accompanies the increase in <italic>R</italic>, indicating that ACP<sup>C</sup> elevates the elasticity of the network. At <italic>f<sub>s</sub></italic>∼10<sup>3</sup> Hz, the phase delay depends only weakly on <italic>R</italic>, but as frequency decreases, it decreases more quickly with higher <italic>R</italic>, implying a greater effect by crosslinking at lower frequencies.</p>
<p>Networks bundled by ACP<sup>B</sup> exhibit a behavior distinctly different from that of ACP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Large differences in <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″ were observed between segment-tracking rheology and bulk rheology. This originates from the heterogeneity of the bundled network attributable to the small computational domain, for which viscoelastic moduli measured by bulk rheology depend strongly on whether or not there are bundles that percolate between the top and bottom boundaries. We thus discuss results of only segment-tracking rheology for networks formed by ACP<sup>B</sup>.</p>
<p>ACP<sup>B</sup> increases <italic>G</italic>′ but has little effect on its slope in contrast to ACP<sup>C</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), whereas the phase delay is only slightly influenced by <italic>R</italic>. ACP<sup>C</sup> is able to form a well-percolated network even at relatively low <italic>R</italic>, so that the network gels more efficiently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Gardel2">[14]</xref> and acts like a single-body elastic object in response to shear stress or strain. By contrast, ACP<sup>B</sup> bundles filaments together, resulting in the relatively low level of percolation for the same value of <italic>R</italic> as reflected by its low connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Kim1">[35]</xref>. Although the diffusivity of bundled filaments is lower, the lack of connectivity leads to the absence of elastic behavior at long time scales. In order for ACP<sup>B</sup> to increase network elasticity to a similar extent by ACP<sup>C</sup>, its concentration may have to be much higher.</p>

<title>Effects of prestrain on <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″</title>
<p>Only bulk rheology is employed here since the application of prestrain leads to a highly nonuniform distribution of the load, with a small fraction of highly tensed filaments and a larger number of filaments under little or no stress. Due to such heterogeneity, segment tracking rheology underestimates <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″ as it randomly traces <italic>N</italic><sub>MSD</sub> segments from the entire network. The effect of prestrain on <italic>G</italic>′ is analogous to that of ACP<sup>C</sup>. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, <italic>G</italic>′ increases and produces a weaker dependence on frequency at higher prestrain (<italic>γ</italic>); at <italic>γ</italic> = 0.55, <italic>G</italic>′ is virtually independent of frequency and is nearly 100-fold larger than that at <italic>γ</italic> = 0 for <italic>f</italic><sub>s</sub>&lt;10 Hz.

This suggests that at low frequencies, viscous effects play an important role. Tharmann and coworkers argued that this trend of <italic>G</italic>″ may be due to the unbinding of HMM.

To study their effects, we decreased both <italic>κ</italic><sub>b,ACP,1</sub> and <italic>κ</italic><sub>b,ACP,2</sub> 10 fold, 100 fold, and to zero.

Since this is accompanied by changes in the angle between crosslinked actin filaments, bending stiffness of ACPs becomes an important determinant of <italic>G</italic>′. As prestrain further increases (to 0.55), ACPs are maximally bent, and stretching of actin filaments is the dominant mechanism for resisting deformation since changing the extensional modulus has the greatest influence on <italic>G</italic>′.

<title>Significance of each parameter at various prestrains</title>
<p>Based on the effects of bending and extensional stiffnesses of actin filaments and ACPs as well as thermal fluctuations discussed above, we can estimate the relative importance of each factor over a wide range of prestrain and identify regimes where different phenomena dominate the viscoelastic behavior. For this purpose, each stiffness was decreased by 25-fold from the standard case, and the ratio of <italic>G</italic>′ with the decreased stiffness to that with the normal stiffness was computed at <italic>f</italic><sub>s</sub> = 10 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g009">Figure 9</xref>). A fall in extensional stiffness of both actin filaments (<italic>κ</italic><sub>s,A</sub>) and ACPs (<italic>κ</italic><sub>s,ACP</sub>) decreases <italic>G</italic>′ more as <italic>γ</italic> increases, implying that the stretch of filaments and ACPs plays an important role in strain-stiffening behavior at high <italic>γ</italic>, at least at the exaggerated levels of extensional compliance used in the simulations. Bending stiffness of ACPs, <italic>κ</italic><sub>b,ACP</sub>, is significant at all tested <italic>γ</italic>, but has the largest effect on <italic>G</italic>′ for <italic>γ</italic>∼0.3–0.4.

<title>The supportive framework governing viscoelastic moduli</title>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g006">Figure 6B</xref> shows that only a subset of the entire network supports the dominant portion of the stress in prestrained networks. While there could be many different criteria for identifying such a ‘supportive framework,’ we considered two, based either on the stretch of actin filaments or on the bending of ACPs. In the first case, we deleted filaments that were not highly stretched. The remaining network, however, when oscillated at the same strain amplitude, produced very low stress levels, suggesting that a significant fraction of the stress-supporting elements had been removed by this process. In the second case, we use bending force on ACPs as a selection criterion since the change in <italic>κ</italic><sub>b,ACP</sub> had a strong effect on viscoelastic moduli (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g008">Figure 8</xref>). First, the sum of magnitudes of all bending forces applied on each ACP in a prestrained state was calculated during 0.1 ms, the portion of ACPs with the highest bending forces were selected, and the remaining ACPs were deleted. All actin filaments not connecting between a pair of these highly strained and bent ACPs were removed. We compared stresses exerted on networks in which 25%, 50%, and 75% of ACPs remain under the same imposed prestrain. The network containing only 25% of initial ACPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g010">Figure 10A</xref>) consists of filaments oriented mostly in the diagonal direction on the x-z plane (<italic>cf</italic>., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Moreover, as the orientational distribution shows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g010">Figure 10B</xref>, inset), there are (less stretched) filaments oriented in other directions that also help to transmit the applied load, by bending of connecting ACPs, which are not selected when a criterion based on stretch of actin filaments is used. The mean stress and oscillation amplitude of the reduced network remain nearly at original levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g010">Figure 10B</xref>). For example, the network containing only ∼28% of the original actin filaments and ∼25% of ACPs produced ∼70% of the original mean and amplitude of oscillating stress at the same levels of strain. Thus, bending force on ACPs is a major determinant of the elasticity of prestrained networks. We also confirmed that at high prestrain, ACPs experiencing large bending forces tend to displace in a manner consistent with the deformations being affine, as measured by the <italic>S</italic> parameter used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Liu2">[43]</xref> (data not shown). This means that parts of the supportive framework that bear greater levels of force experience more affine deformation.</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Using Brownian dynamics simulations, we systematically investigated viscoelastic moduli of actin-like networks. First, viscoelastic moduli measured in our model compared favorably with those of experiments conducted using a bulk rheometer under similar conditions. Then, effects of the kind and concentration of ACPs on <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″ were investigated. With no ACP, <italic>G</italic>′ exhibited a power law slope of 0.75 against frequency, reflecting the transverse thermal motion of actin filamets. ACP<sup>C</sup> tended to produce networks that were more elastic with a weaker dependence of <italic>G</italic>′ on frequency and smaller phase delay than ACP<sup>B</sup>. The influence of prestrain on <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″ was also studied. High prestrain makes the network more elastic mainly via the stretch of a small fraction of aligned actin filaments. In addition, the effects of extensional and bending stiffnesses of actin filaments and ACPs on viscoelasticity were tested individually. We found that for viscoelastic moduli, three regimes are evident, each governed by different mechanisms depending on the amount of prestrain. At low prestrain, bending stiffness of ACPs and actin filaments plays an important role in determining viscoelasticity. At intermediate prestrain, bending stiffness of ACPs affects viscoelastic moduli the most. At high prestrain, the extensional stiffness of actin filaments and ACPs becomes dominant. We also found that entropic effects due to thermal fluctuations of filaments are important only when the prestrain is low and the average distance between active ACPs is comparable to the filament persistence length. Last, we identified the supportive framework that largely accounts for the high elasticity of prestrained networks, as that associated with strained ACPs rather than stretched actin filaments. Even after 75% of the network components are deleted, stress remains at 70% of the original value.</p>
<p>Our computational model using the discrete network of crosslinked F-actins provides insights into the microscopic origin of the viscoelastic behavior of the actin cytoskeleton. Importantly, our findings regarding the limited role of thermal fluctuation, as well as the different contributions to viscoelastic responses by the bending or stretching of F-actin or ACPs, require additional experiments for further investigation. The present computational framework can be further developed to study phenomena associated with ACP unbinding, such as stress relaxation, network reorganization, and plastic deformation by shear.</p>

<p>Our Brownian dynamics (BD) model extends our previous work in which we investigated the morphology of polymerized and crosslinked actin networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Kim1">[35]</xref>. In this simulation, actin monomers, filaments, and ACPs experience thermal motion and interact with each other with defined potentials and binding probabilities.

<title>Coarse-graining scheme using cylindrical segments</title>
<p>In our previous model, we treated a segment of F-actin as a spherical particle representing two G-actins. To simulate larger length and time scales, we introduced coarse-graining in which a cylindrical segment represents several monomers. We kept thermal forces on ACPs and actin segments in a form similar to our previous model, but incorporated a cylindrical geometry for calculating repulsive forces.</p>
<p>As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000439-g011">Figure 11</xref>, the points of two adjacent elements on a filament correspond to the ends of one cylindrical segment representing <italic>N</italic><sub>C</sub> actin monomers of the previous model. Accordingly, the diameter of the cylindrical segment, <italic>σ</italic><sub>C,A</sub>, is the same as the diameter of actin monomer of the previous model, <italic>σ</italic><sub>A</sub> = 7 nm, and its length, <italic>L</italic><sub>C,A</sub>, is <italic>N</italic><sub>C</sub>·<italic>σ</italic><sub>A</sub>. By letting each monomer of the polymerized network evolve into a cylindrical segment, a larger network is created, albeit with a lower concentration of ∼1–100 µM. In addition, one point on a filament axis and the other point representing the center of an ACP determine the two end points of each arm of the ACP, indicating that ACPs have a structure with two cylindrical arms whose length and diameter are <italic>L</italic><sub>C,ACP</sub> and <italic>σ</italic><sub>C,ACP</sub> respectively. In this study, <italic>N</italic><sub>C</sub> was set to 10; this degree of coarse-graining is appropriate since the length of one rigid cylindrical segment, <italic>L</italic><sub>C,A</sub> = 70 nm, is still much shorter than the persistence length of an actin filament, ∼10 µm.</p>

<p>One consequence of this coarse-graining technique is that it increases the arm length of ACPs. That is, since the redundant volume of the original monomers is neglected, the arm length of ACPs is extended by (<italic>L</italic><sub>C,A</sub>−<italic>σ</italic><sub>C,A</sub>)/2. This produces a network for which the shortest distance between two bundled filaments is (<italic>L</italic><sub>C,A</sub>−<italic>σ</italic><sub>C,A</sub>)/2 (63 nm in this case) that exceeds the typical spacing formed by many of the bundling ACPs (e.g. fascin, fimbrin, and α-actinin). However, it is not expected that this will significantly alter the qualitative behavior of bundled networks since the change in the ACP arm length is much shorter than the length of F-actin. Previous experiments where different bundling ACPs led to distinct macroscopic behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Tseng1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Xu1">[22]</xref> are more likely due to the different stiffness and dissimilar binding affinities of the ACPs rather than their physical size.</p>

<title>Bulk rheology – simulation</title>
<p>The concept of a strain-controlled bulk rheometer used in experiments was adopted in order to measure the viscoelastic moduli of the generated networks. First, all actin filaments were severed at the upper and lower boundaries, and the periodic boundary condition on those surfaces was deactivated. Cylindrical actin segments within 70 nm from the bottom surface were fixed, whereas those within the top 70 nm were forced to move following an imposed strain. For the application of prestrain, the top boundary was translated at a constant strain rate, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000439.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, up to the desired strain. To measure differential viscoelastic moduli as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000439-Gardel2">[14]</xref>, a small sinusoidal strain (5%) was superposed on top of the finite prestrain. The sum of forces on the ends of filaments attached to the top boundary was calculated, and divided by the area of the top surface to determine stress. Only the force component parallel to the surface was considered. In addition, due to the small dimension of the system, the time scale for water diffusion through the computational domain is of order 10 µs. Since this is smaller than the smallest period of oscillatory strain, we assumed that the imposed shear strain immediately induces a linear velocity profile within the fluid. Consequently, after calculating the stress due to filament forces, we added a shear stress expressed as:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000439.e040" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>τ<sub>zx</sub></italic> is the shear stress exerted in the x-direction on a plane perpendicular to the z-direction (pointing from the bottom to the top face), and <italic>γ<sub>x</sub></italic> is the shear strain applied in the x-direction. The induced velocity of medium affects the movement of elements via the <bold>v<sub>∞</sub></bold> term of Equation 2.</p>
<p>Finally, dividing the measured stress (<italic>τ<sub>zx</sub></italic>) by the differential strain (<italic>γ<sub>x</sub></italic>), viscoelastic moduli, <italic>G</italic>′ and <italic>G</italic>″, can be evaluated:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000439.e041" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000439.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is phase delay between strain and stress, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000439.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000439.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the amplitude of the differential stress and differential strain, respectively.

<title>Segment-tracking rheology</title>
<p>Many experiments have used microbead rheology to probe viscoelastic moduli of actin gels based on the concept that the thermal motion of the bead is reflective of the gel's viscoelastic properties. Here, we used a variation of this approach, and tracked thermal fluctuations of individual actin segments. First, the domain was divided into a cubic lattice comprised of <italic>N</italic><sub>MSD</sub> cells (<italic>N</italic><sub>MSD</sub> = 512) of equal volume. Then, one cylindrical element was randomly selected per cell, and MSDs of the center of these elements were recorded over time.

<title>Computational domain size and attainable time range</title>
<p>In spite of the coarse-graining using cylindrical segments, the length and time scales that our model can attain are still much smaller than those of usual experiments. For example, <italic>L</italic><sub>f</sub> in this computational model is a few microns at most, and the width of the 3-D domain is less than 5 µm. In such a small domain, it is difficult to investigate the effects of a wide range of <italic>L</italic><sub>f</sub> or <italic>C</italic><sub>A</sub> on viscoelastic moduli since <italic>L</italic><sub>f</sub> cannot be longer than the width of the domain to avoid artifacts associated with self-repulsion, and because an increase in <italic>C</italic><sub>A</sub> was achieved by a decrease in domain size with a constant number of molecules. If we increase the number of molecules, simulation time significantly increases. On the other hand, many <italic>in vitro</italic> studies have used quite long actin filaments (∼20 µm) with relatively large systems of size ∼O(1 mm). It takes about 16 days to reach 1 s in typical conditions using an Intel Xeon 2.66GHz CPU, but experimental results span up to 100–1000 s. Thus, an exhaustive comparison between computational and experimental results was not possible.</p>
