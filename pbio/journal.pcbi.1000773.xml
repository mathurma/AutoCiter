<p>Understanding the mechanistic basis of transcriptional regulation has been a central focus of molecular biology since its inception. New high-throughput chromatin immunoprecipitation experiments have revealed that most regulatory proteins bind thousands of sites in mammalian genomes. However, the functional significance of these binding sites remains unclear. We present a quantitative model of transcriptional regulation that suggests the contribution of each binding site to tissue-specific gene expression depends strongly on its position relative to the transcription start site. For three cell types, we show that, by considering binding position, it is possible to predict relative expression levels between cell types with an accuracy approaching the level of agreement between different <italic>experimental</italic> platforms. Our model suggests that, for the transcription factors profiled in these cell types, a regulatory site's influence on expression falls off almost linearly with distance from the transcription start site in a 10 kilobase range. Binding to both evolutionarily conserved and non-conserved sequences contributes significantly to transcriptional regulation. Our approach also reveals the quantitative, tissue-specific role of individual proteins in activating or repressing transcription. These results suggest that regulator binding position plays a previously unappreciated role in influencing expression and blurs the classical distinction between proximal promoter and distal binding events.</p>

<p>Gene expression is controlled, in large part, by regulatory proteins called transcription factors that bind specific sites in the genome. A major focus of molecular biology has been understanding how these transcription factors interact with the cell's transcriptional machinery, the genome, and with each other to turn genes' expression on and off in various physiological contexts. Previous approaches for modeling transcriptional regulation have focused on the complex combinatorial interactions between groups of transcription factors at regulatory sites, or on the specific activating or repressive functions of individual proteins. In this work, we present a new modeling framework and demonstrate that an equally important, and previously overlooked, consideration in predicting the effect that a regulatory site has on gene expression is simply its location relative to the transcription start site of nearby genes. Our results show that, in general, the closer a binding event is to a gene's transcription start site, the more it influences expression. We also show that considering the particular proteins bound at a regulatory site helps predict the expression of nearby genes. However, considering the sequence conservation level of these sites does not lead to more accurate predictions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Control of gene expression programs across diverse tissues and developmental stages is achieved through networks of proteins interacting with specific regulatory sites in the genome. Pioneering work on several individual promoters, including those of beta-interferon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Thanos1">[1]</xref> and <italic>endo16</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Yuh1">[2]</xref> have revealed that the relationship between binding events and transcriptional outcomes can be quite complex. The advent of chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) coupled with high throughput microarray (ChIP-chip) or sequencing (ChIP-seq) technology has highlighted the challenges of understanding transcriptional regulation. These technologies have been used to map binding sites on a genome-wide scale <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-An1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Chen1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Ferrari1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Odom1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Welboren1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Heintzman1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Visel1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Wederell1">[10]</xref>, and have shown that regulatory proteins typically bind thousands of genes. As might be expected, given the importance of combinatorial control in well-studied promoters, only a subset of the detected regulator binding sites are functional, while many binding events play no direct role in determining transcription levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Li1">[11]</xref>. A further complication arises from the observation that distal enhancers, which can be located many kilobases from transcription start sites, can be important drivers of expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Yeamans1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Nerenz1">[13]</xref> thereby vastly increasing the number of binding events that must be considered potentially functional for each gene. Moreover, it is usually unclear which binding events regulate which genes. In this study, we present a new model of transcriptional regulation that addresses these key challenges. We identify sites of combinatorial control by performing high throughput ChIP experiments on p300, CREB-binding protein (CBP), the deacetylase SIRT1 and on multiple DNA-binding transcription factors in three different tissues. We then develop a simple framework that predicts the quantitative effect of binding on gene expression and reveals the relative contributions of each protein to the combinatorial control of transcription. Remarkably, we find that the effect a regulatory site has on a gene's expression is, to a large extent, dependent on its proximity to the gene's transcription start site.The model predicts that both conserved and non-conserved sites have important roles in determining transcription outcomes. Further, we find that the data better support a model where individual regulatory sites affect the expression of multiple nearby genes than a model where these sites regulate only the most proximal gene.</p>

Immunoprecipitated DNA was sequenced, the 35bp reads were aligned to the reference mouse genome, and regions with significant levels of binding relative to a set of control reads were identified.

<p>The ChIP-seq analysis identified 22,191 and 7,821 sites bound by p300 or at least two other regulators (which we will refer to as putative regulatory regions) in liver and 3T3-L1 cells respectively (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The vast majority of these sites occur within 100kb of known genes but most are located outside of the proximal promoter (Figures 1 and 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>): 92% of regulatory sites in liver and 93% in 3T3-L1 cells occur outside the 500bp window centered on each transcript's transcription start site (TSS). The ChIP-chip promoter array experiments revealed 3,326 and 3,187 CBP-bound regions in liver and cerebellum; 70% of these sites in liver and 51% in cerebellum occur outside the proximal promoter. Several sites directly overlap previously characterized transcriptional enhancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Crissey1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Hanson1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Louet1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Maire1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Onuma1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-TravnickovaBendova1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Yamamoto1">[21]</xref> (Figure 3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Binding proximity predicts transcription</title>
<p>Understanding the relationship between regulator binding and transcription is a complicated task. We find that binding within 5 kilobases (kb) of a gene's transcription start site (TSS) is associated with higher transcript levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), however it provides limited information about the magnitude of tissue-specific transcription levels. Bound genes display a wide range of expression values (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This variation may be explained, in part, by the action of distal regulatory sites located further than 5kb from the gene. However, as we begin to consider binding events further from the TSS the situation becomes increasingly complicated as more, potentially non-functional, binding sites become associated with each gene. It is also difficult to associate binding events with the genes they regulate. For example, approximately 41% of regulatory sites identified in liver and 45% in 3T3-L1 cells are located within 50 kb of the TSS of two or more genes.</p>

<title>Characteristics of bound genes and bound regions.</title>
<p>Putative regulatory regions in liver and 3T3-L1 cells were identified from ChIP-seq experiments and are defined as sites bound by p300 and/or at least two other transcription factors. We performed a similar analysis in liver and cerebellum using ChIP-chip with promoter microarrays, where a regulatory region is defined as any site bound by CBP. (A) Genes with a regulatory region within 5kb of their transcription start site have a higher mean expression level than genes with no binding event. Error bars indicate +/− s.e.m. (B) Bound genes display large variation in levels of absolute gene expression. (C) Putative regulatory regions show great variation in their sequence conservation levels. Conservation level was calculated as the maximum 100bp moving average of Phastcons scores from alignments of placental mammal genomes.</p>

<p>Previous computational models of transcriptional regulation have frequently ignored the effect of distance between a binding site and a gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Gao1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Segal1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Ucar1">[26]</xref> or have considered location only for the purposes of detecting positional binding preferences of proteins in the proximal promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Suzuki1">[27]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Beer1">[28]</xref>. Previous approaches have also not accounted for the effect of very distal binding sites on expression. Interestingly, we find that transcription levels are correlated with the proximity between a gene's TSS and the closest bound region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), and that this statistical relationship persists over tens of kilobases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Surprisingly, this relationship is even observed at a distance resolution of hundreds of nucleotides within the proximal promoter (Figure 4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>). To further understand the relationship between expression and regulator binding location we developed a simple quantitative model that predicts transcription level as a function of transcription factor binding position. We assume that the mean expression level of a gene is determined by contributions from all individual regulatory sites in the vicinity of that gene, and that each regulatory site may regulate the expression of multiple genes. The functional relevance of a region depends on its position relative to the TSS; this relationship takes the form of an influence function that is fit to the data during model training. This approach allows proximal sites to be treated differently than distal sites, or upstream and downstream sites to be treated differently. We first used our model to predict the absolute expression levels of genes in liver and 3T3-L1 cells from the location of p300 and clustered transcription factor binding sites. We considered all binding events located within 100kb of each gene's TSS. The correlation between predicted and observed transcript abundance in held-out test data is highly statistically significant (Table 1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>). Notably, the predicted relationship between position and expression influence is nearly identical in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). The influence of an enhancer falls off approximately linearly as the position moves further away from the TSS. Sites located within approximately 10kb of the TSS are statistically associated with the highest transcription levels, and regulatory regions located upstream of the TSS are predicted to have a somewhat greater effect on transcription than downstream events. Although proximal sites have the greatest influence, binding sites located up to 50kb away from the TSS are predicted to have a significant effect on transcription, consistent with previous observations that enhancers may act at very long distances to affect expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Yeamans1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Nerenz1">[13]</xref>.</p>

<title>Predicting differential expression level</title>
<p>If the location of a regulatory site does, in fact, have a large effect on gene expression, then <italic>changes</italic> in gene expression between cell types should be associated with <italic>changes</italic> in the location of binding sites. To examine this question, we used all the liver and 3T3-L1 binding events identified in ChIP-seq experiments to predict relative expression of differentially expressed genes in these cell types. We find that regulatory sites located within 10kb of differentially expressed genes are more likely to be unique to a single tissue than those in the vicinity of non-differentially expressed genes (Table 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>). Genes that exhibit no difference in expression are also much less likely to be bound than differentially expressed genes: 7,628 of 15,568 non-changing genes had no putative regulatory site within 10kb of their TSS, compared to only 417 of 2,124 differentially expressed genes. In order to evaluate the importance of binding site position in predicting the functional relevance, we compared our model's performance to two competing models: one that weighted binding events equally regardless of position (as was done in all previously published studies), and a second that weighted the contributions of bound regions by sequence conservation, allowing highly conserved regulatory regions to be weighted differently than regions with low conservation. We fit each model using two-thirds of the bound, differentially expressed genes, and evaluated their ability to predict the magnitude of expression differences for the remaining third of the genes, repeating this process 100 times using randomly sampled test and training data.</p>
<p>The position-based model of transcription produces significantly more accurate predictions than the uniform weighting and the conservation-based approaches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g003">Figure 3</xref>). To evaluate the importance of distal binding events in predicting expression, we identified bound genes using several distance cutoffs, ranging from the 1kb proximal promoter to a distance of 100kb from the gene's TSS. The position-based model out-performs the other models across a wide range of distance windows. At the 100kb cutoff, 2,205 of the 2,309 differentially expressed genes identified are bound in at least one tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Even when including these very distal sites in the analysis, many of which are presumably non-functional, our predictions have a median correlation of 0.69 with observed expression levels of held-out test genes compared to 0.58 for the conservation-based model and 0.57 for the model that weights binding events uniformly. This value approaches the correlation level observed for relative expression measurements made using different experimental platforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Bammler1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Petersen1">[30]</xref> and indicates that regulatory site position has a substantial effect on transcription levels in these. As a further control, we performed an additional 100 bootstrap trials with randomly permuted expression values across differentially expressed genes. In these trials, our model's prediction accuracy was statistically no better than a strategy of predicting the mean expression value in the training set.</p>

<p>We compared three models relating regulator binding to relative transcription levels in liver and 3T3-L1 cells.

The third model (C) learns a binding site's expression influence based on its level of sequence conservation. We tested each model using several different distance cutoffs to identify bound genes. The bar graph shows how the number of genes included in the analysis increases as this cutoff is increased.

<p>Including binding events up to 50kb away from the TSS improves expression predictions, demonstrating the importance of these distal sites. However, weighting the influence of each regulatory region appropriately is crucial; the models that do not consider position both show a drastic deterioration in prediction accuracy as the distance cutoff increases. Interestingly, the simple uniform weighting model performs about as well as the model that weights sites by sequence conservation, indicating that conservation is of limited use in identifying functional binding events from ChIP data.</p>
<p>To address whether these data support the hypothesis that individual regulatory sites regulate multiple genes, we compared the prediction accuracy of our model to one where regulatory sites are assumed to regulate expression of only the closest transcript. We first associated binding events in liver and 3T3-L1 cells to transcripts, assuming they regulate only the nearest gene. We then trained our position-based transcriptional model and predicted the expression of held-out genes. These predictions were compared to those obtained, for the same set of genes, without the constraint that a site regulates a single gene. The difference in prediction accuracy is dramatic. The mean-squared prediction error over 100 bootstrapped trials was 0.73+/0.03 s.d. when we assume that binding events regulate only the closest gene. This improved by approximately 8 standard deviations to 0.48+/−0.02 s.d. for a model where binding events may regulate many genes.</p>

<title>Binding at regions with low sequence conservation is functional</title>
<p>To further explore the role of non-conserved regulatory sites we identified bound regions in each tissue that showed low sequence conservation levels, using the conservation threshold that best distinguished bound regulatory regions from randomly selected DNA sequences (Figure 5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>). At this threshold, approximately 59% of sites from ChIP-seq experiments in liver and 47% in 3T3-L1 cells are non-conserved. Similarly, 44% of CBP sites in liver and 28% of sites in cerebellum are non-conserved. Genes located within 5kb of these sites in our experiments were associated with high levels of gene expression (Figure 6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>). Next we identified 261 differentially expressed genes in liver and 3T3-L1 cells bound (within 50kb) at <italic>only</italic> non-conserved regions. In a similar fashion, we identified 884 differentially expressed genes bound only at non-conserved regions by CBP in liver and cerebellum. We performed the training and test procedure described above and determined whether the locations of these non-conserved sites predicted gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). In both liver/3T3-L1 cells and in liver/cerebellum the position of non-conserved binding is a strong predictor of relative expression level. Our predictions have a mean correlation of 0.56 with observed expression values in liver/3T3-L1, significant at p&lt;2.6e-9 by a right-tailed t-test. In liver/cerebellum the mean correlation is 0.57, significant at p&lt;5.4e-26. We then repeated the analysis using an even more stringent conservation threshold (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and found that non-conserved sites were still highly predictive of expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). We also examined genes bound at both conserved and non-conserved sites within 100kb of their TSS and asked whether the conserved sites alone were adequate to predict expression. We first predicted expression using only conserved sites and then repeated the analysis using all bound regions. Underlining the importance of non-conserved regulatory regions, we find that considering both the conserved and non-conserved sites results in significantly more accurate predictions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>

<title>Revealing the role of specific regulators</title>
<p>Although binding site position is very important in determining expression influence, the function of a regulatory region is also determined by the particular transcription factors that bind to it. We therefore extended our transcriptional model so that the relevance of any particular regulatory site was determined by both its location and the particular regulators that were bound. Each protein's effect on transcription was estimated by including a protein-specific weight that modulated the expression influence of the site. We tested this approach on ChIP-seq and expression data in liver and 3T3-L1 cells, including binding data for an additional regulator, E2F4, in each tissue. We estimated the influence of p300, C/EBPα, FOXA1/A2, and E2F4 in liver, and p300, C/EBPα, PPARγ/RXR, and E2F4 in 3T3-L1 cells. In total, 2,038 differentially expressed genes were analyzed. Our predictions have a median correlation of 0.74 with observed expression differences on held out test data, ranging between 0.72 and 0.76 in 11 separate trials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000773-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Our simple predictive framework remarkably accounts for over 50% of the variance in observed relative expression levels, and gives better predictions than a model that considers only binding site position. The influence learned for each protein provides evidence of its function in these cell types. For example, C/EBPα is associated with the strongest activation in both cell types, in agreement with its well-characterized role in these cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Roesler1">[31]</xref>. In contrast E2F4 is associated with the lowest levels of activation in both cell types; its influence weight of 0.52 in liver indicates that it actually attenuates an enhancer's effect on expression in this tissue, consistent with its previously described transcriptional repressor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Trimarchi1">[32]</xref>. We performed a similar analysis in liver and cerebellum by collecting ChIP-seq data for the histone deacetylase Sirt1 in cerebellum, and ChIP-chip data for the transcription factor pCREB in liver. Modeling the different transcriptional influences of CBP sites that are also bound by pCREB or Sirt1 resulted in more accurate expression predictions. The median correlation between observed and predicted expression difference in liver and cerebellum was 0.65, ranging between 0.62 and 0.68 over 11 separate trials. Sirt1 has the opposite enzymatic activity to CBP/p300, and is known to repress p300 activation of transcription in certain contexts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Motta1">[33]</xref>. As expected, sites in cerebellum that are bound by Sirt1 have only about half as much influence on expression levels as CBP sites that do not recruit Sirt1. In a separate analysis, we modeled the effect of CBP binding affinity on expression influence, up weighting sites with higher ChIP enrichment ratios (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s002">Text S2</xref>). Accounting for the effect of binding affinity results in a very significant 15.5+/−1.3% mean improvement in prediction accuracy over ten separate trials.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we address a central problem in the study of transcriptional regulation by developing a model that reveals the function of transcription factor binding sites in terms of their genomic position and the particular regulators they bind. Experimental approaches combining ChIP with microarray and sequencing technologies have led to tremendous progress in mapping transcriptional regulatory sites across the genome. However, progress in determining the function of these sites has been slower. In part this is because static maps of regulator binding give an incomplete picture of the complexity that arises from dynamic signaling and binding events, but progress has also been slowed by the absence of a simple framework that links regulatory network architecture (as defined by the location of regulatory regions in the genome) to transcription.</p>
<p>To understand the functional role of these regulatory sites, we developed a simple model that accurately predicts the expression difference between cell types based only on binding site positions. The correlation of the predictions with measured values approaches the correlation observed between different <italic>experimental</italic> platforms and can remarkably explain over half the variance in the relative transcription levels of differentially expressed genes.</p>
<p>Previous work has suggested that functional transcription factor binding sites tend to cluster near the transcription start site (TSS) of the genes they regulate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Tabach1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Koudritsky1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Megraw1">[36]</xref>. Our results agree with these observations; binding events that are very close to the transcription start site are predicted to have a disproportionately large effect on expression. However, many genes show large differences in tissue-specific expression that are apparently driven by much more remote events as evidenced by our ability to predict these differences even when no binding event is detected within 1kb of the TSS (Figure 7 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000773.s001">Text S1</xref>). For the proteins and tissues analyzed in this study, a regulatory site's position relative to a gene's transcription start site appears to be an extremely important determinant of its effect on that gene's expression. Although we are aware of an <italic>in vitro</italic> study where a falloff in transcription rate was observed as a regulatory site's location was moved further from the TATA box over a range of approximately 100bp in a series of reporter constructs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Ross1">[37]</xref>, to our knowledge the intriguing effect of position has not been previously reported as a general feature of transcriptional regulation in an <italic>in vivo</italic> system.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our analysis supports a model where binding events frequently regulate the expression of multiple genes over one where bound regulators affect the expression of only the most proximal gene. Based on our observation that binding sites located within 50kb of a gene significantly influence its expression level, we estimate that approximately 40–45% of regulatory sites may affect the expression of more than one transcript.</p>
<p>In contrast to the strong relationship between the location of binding and transcription, there is little relationship between sequence conservation and expression. Including binding to non-conserved sequences in our models improves their accuracy significantly over models built using only binding to conserved sequences. Previously we, and others, have shown that the sites targeted by individual DNA-binding proteins can vary across species even when tissue-specific gene expression is conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Birney1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Odom2">[39]</xref>. Taken together, these findings suggest that organisms can achieve similar gene expression patterns through diverse mechanisms. Because transcription integrates binding events that are distributed over great distances, there is a reasonable probability that the evolutionary gain or loss of regulatory regions at one locus can be compensated for by mutations at other sites. More work is needed to determine whether the quantitative relationship between binding and expression is similar across mammals.</p>
<p>Regulatory sites have been classically divided into promoter-proximal elements, which are within approximately 200 base pairs of the start site, and enhancer elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000773-Lodish1">[40]</xref>. Surprisingly, we find an almost linear decrease in the effect of a regulatory site over a region of many kilobases, encompassing both proximal promoters and distal enhancers. Our results suggest that a more critical distinction may be between those binding events within or beyond 50 kilobases and that the net transcription level of a gene is the result of integrating a potentially large number of binding events.</p>
<p>The results presented here represent a significant step towards a quantitative framework for understanding gene expression. The statistical relationship between enhancer position and transcription level is clear, and this observation should lead to more accurate models of transcriptional regulation. However, many other factors have a profound effect on enhancer function including which coregulators are recruited, the nuclear concentrations of transcription factors, binding of small molecules that modulate enzymatic activities and interaction surfaces, and any signaling events leading to post-translational modification of regulators. In addition, it is possible that different types of enhancers exist that vary in the relationship between enhancer position and transcription level. Enriching the modeling framework presented here by incorporating additional types of data that address these questions (e.g. CTCF enhancer binding sites) may lead to a greater understanding of regulatory networks and their relationship to developmental and disease processes.</p>

<title>Identification of nonconserved bound regions</title>
<p>We measured conservation levels in each bound region using Phastcons scores for 14-way alignments of placental mammals obtained from the UCSC Genome Browser.

<p>A transcript's expression rate is assumed to be a function of contributions from enhancers in the vicinity of the transcript's start site.

We also tested a similar model where, instead of fitting the influence function using binding position, we fit a curve using the conservation levels of binding events, allowing us to differentially weight regulatory regions with varying levels of sequence conservation. The model was further extended by allowing an enhancer's effect on expression to be modulated by the specific regulators bound through an influence weight, or by the affinity of a protein for the site (as measured by a ChIP enrichment ratio).
