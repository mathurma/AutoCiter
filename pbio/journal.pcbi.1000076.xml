Methionine used for AdoMet synthesis can be replenished via remethylation of homocysteine. Alternatively, homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. Aberrations in methionine metabolism are associated with a number of complex diseases, including cancer, anemia, and neurodegenerative diseases. The concentration of methionine in blood and in organs is tightly regulated. Liver plays a key role in buffering blood methionine levels, and an interesting feature of its metabolism is that parallel tracks exist for the synthesis and utilization of AdoMet. To elucidate the molecular mechanism that controls metabolic fluxes in liver methionine metabolism, we have studied the dependencies of AdoMet concentration and methionine consumption rate on methionine concentration in native murine hepatocytes at physiologically relevant concentrations (40–400 µM). We find that both [AdoMet] and methionine consumption rates do not change gradually with an increase in [Met] but rise sharply (∼10-fold) in the narrow Met interval from 50 to 100 µM. Analysis of our experimental data using a mathematical model reveals that the sharp increase in [AdoMet] and the methionine consumption rate observed within the trigger zone are associated with metabolic switching from methionine conservation to disposal, regulated allosterically by switching between parallel pathways. This regulatory switch is triggered by [Met] and provides a mechanism for stabilization of methionine levels in blood over wide variations in dietary methionine intake.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Methionine is an essential amino acid that is highly toxic at elevated levels, and the liver is primarily responsible for buffering its concentration in circulation. Intracellularly, methionine is needed for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), the major biological methylating agent. Methionine used for AdoMet synthesis can be replenished via remethylation of homocysteine. Alternatively, homocysteine can be converted to cysteine via the transsulfuration pathway. A specific feature of liver methionine metabolism is the existence of twin pathways for AdoMet synthesis and degradation. In this study, we analyzed the dependence of methionine metabolism on methionine concentration in liver cells using a combined experimental and theoretical approach. We find a sharp transition in rat hepatocyte metabolism from methionine conservation to a disposal mode with an increase in methionine concentration above its physiological range. Mathematical modeling reveals that this transition is afforded by an allosteric mechanism for switching between parallel metabolic pathways. This study demonstrates a novel mechanism of trigger behavior in biological systems by which the substrate for the metabolic network switches metabolic flux between parallel tracks for sustaining two different metabolic modes.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was supported in part by grant from the Russian Foundation for Basic Research (02-04-48053) to TKK, MVM, and VMV and by the National Institutes of Health (DK64959) to RB.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts></article-meta></front><body><sec id="s1"><title>Introduction</title><p>Methionine, an essential amino acid, plays a significant role in intracellular one-carbon and sulfur metabolism consequently linking antioxidant and methylation homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

Dashed arrows indicate the allosteric regulatory influence of metabolites to enzymes. Red and blue colors indicate activation and inhibition respectively. Besides its role in protein synthesis, methionine is a substrate for the synthesis of S-adenosylmethionine (AdoMet), which is a ubiquitous methyl donor for numerous methyltransferases and is a precursor for polyamine synthesis. A product of the methyltransferase reactions is S-adenosylhomocysteine (AdoHcy), which in turn, is cleaved to adenosine and homocysteine in a reaction catalyzed by S-adenosylhomocysteinase (AHC). Homocysteine can be remethylated to methionine using the methyl group of methyl tetrahydrofolate (MTHF), or betaine, in reactions catalyzed by methionine synthase (MS) and betaine homocysteine methyltransferase (BHMT), respectively. In many tissues, homocysteine is also metabolized via the transsulfuration pathway to generate cysteine, the limiting substrate for synthesis of glutathione (GSH), a major intracellular antioxidant.

The metabolism of methionine in liver is more complex than in other organs; it is characterized by a unique, liver-specific enzyme profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which includes the methionine adenosyltransferase I (MATI) and methionine adenosyltransferase III (MATIII) isoforms of methionine adenosyltransferase. Methionine adenosyltransferase II (MATII) is present only in extrahepatic tissues. The enzymatic reaction of the MATIII isoform exhibits a rate dependence on AdoMet concentration that is the converse of MATI and MATII. Thus, while MATI, like MATII, is inhibited by AdoMet, MATIII is activated at high concentrations of AdoMet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Sullivan1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Cabrero1">[7]</xref>.

Thus, an interesting feature of liver methionine metabolism is that there are parallel tracks for the synthesis and utilization of AdoMet, and at the homocysteine junction, methionine can either be recycled or committed to the synthesis of cysteine, which can then be either utilized biosynthetically or catabolized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p><p>Despite the large number of studies on methionine metabolism in liver <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Stipanuk1">[8]</xref> its regulation as well as the kinetics of the methionine disposal, are not well understood. Furthermore, the dependence of liver methionine metabolism on fluctuating methionine concentration ([Met]) within a physiologically relevant range has not been investigated. To elucidate the molecular mechanism that controls metabolic fluxes via parallel tracks in liver methionine metabolism, we had developed a simple mathematical model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Martinov1">[9]</xref>, which revealed the possibility of a threshold dependence of liver methionine metabolism on [Met]. This simple qualitative model predicted the existence of two modes in liver methionine metabolism characterized by low metabolic rates and metabolite levels at methionine concentrations equal to or below its normal physiological value and by high metabolic rates and metabolite concentrations at methionine concentrations above its physiological value. The model predicted that under a specific set of conditions, methionine metabolism switches sharply from one mode to another when [Met] slightly exceeds its physiological value. The switch from the “low” to “high” mode is associated with a sharp increase in steady-state AdoMet concentrations. It was presumed that this metabolic switch enables conservation at low methionine levels and disposal at high methionine levels, and is associated with a redistribution of metabolic flux between remethylation and transsulfuration. However, a detailed analysis of the metabolic switch could not be undertaken with the simple model because it did not include descriptions of remethylation and transsulfuration fluxes in an explicit form. Moreover, the simple model had significant limitations such as the loss of stability at methionine concentrations exceeding the normal physiological value by ∼10% and unrealistically slow kinetics for transitional processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Martinov1">[9]</xref>, raising questions about its utility for experimental verification at the high end of physiologically relevant methionine concentrations and on a real time scale.</p><p>In this study, we have analyzed the experimental dependencies of [AdoMet] and methionine consumption rate on [Met] in native murine hepatocytes within a physiologically relevant concentration range (40 to 400 µM). We have found that both [AdoMet] and methionine consumption rate do not respond gradually with increasing [Met] but rise sharply, increasing ∼10-fold within the narrow [Met] concentration interval from 50 to 100 µM in accordance with the predictions of our preliminary mathematical modeling of this pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Martinov1">[9]</xref>. We used our experimental results for construction and quantitative verification of the extended mathematical model of liver methionine metabolism, which included a detailed description of the kinetics of all the relevant enzymes, a simplified description of folate metabolism and a new rate equation for the MATIII reaction. The new rate equation for the MATIII reaction was developed to describe the experimental data at methionine concentrations above its normal physiological value. Analysis of the model reveals that the sharp increase in [AdoMet] and methionine consumption rate observed in hepatocytes at increasing [Met] are associated with a sharp transition in methionine metabolism from a conservation to a disposal mode (i.e. from remethylation to transsulfuration). The transition is controlled by allosteric regulation of enzymes that results in switching metabolic flux between parallel pathways for AdoMet synthesis and utilization. This metabolic switch is triggered by methionine and provides a mechanism for stabilization of methionine levels in blood over wide variations in dietary methionine intake.</p><p>Our study reveals an excellent correspondence between the experimental and predicted behavior of liver cells in response to variations in [Met] and demonstrates the existence of a novel allosteric mechanism for switching metabolic fluxes between parallel pathways.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Effect of Initial Concentration of Methionine on the Intracellular Concentrations of AdoMet, AdoHcy, and Methionine Consumption Rate in Murine Hepatocytes</title><p>In a suspension of murine hepatocytes incubated with 40 µM methionine, the intracellular concentration of AdoMet was quite stable over 3 h.

Due to the opposing influence of AdoMet on MATI and MATIII isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the rate of MATI decreases, while the rate of MATIII increases and the total rate of AdoMet production increases slightly. At a threshold value for methionine (∼70 µM in the model) the rate of the MATIII reaction exceeds the rate of the MATI reaction and the rate of AdoMet production exceeds the total activity of cellular methylases. This leads to a rapid and auto-accelerated accumulation of AdoMet and an increase in the rate of the MATIII reaction due to positive feedback regulation of MATIII by AdoMet, which cannot be compensated by a further decrease in the MATI reaction rate. Also, increased AdoMet levels inhibit methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase (MTHFR) that leads to a significant decrease in [MTHF]. Consequently, GNMT is strongly activated due to its sigmoidal dependence on [AdoMet] and decreased inhibition by MTHF under these conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The sharp activation of GNMT results in consumption of excess AdoMet produced by activated MATIII providing a new steady state of methionine metabolism characterized by high [AdoMet] and a high metabolic rate. This regulation provides the metabolic switch in methionine metabolism from the “low” to the “high” metabolic mode. Thus, above the threshold concentration for methionine, the rate of AdoMet synthesis increases several-fold, due mainly to the activity of MATIII. The contribution of MATI to total AdoMet synthesis decreases to &lt;10% and excess AdoMet is metabolized via GNMT. Below the threshold [Met], a large fraction of the methionine used in AdoMet synthesis is regenerated via transmethylation reactions catalyzed by MS and BHMT, and the net rate of methionine consumption is low (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, theoretical curve). Above the threshold, the net rate of methionine consumption increases dramatically (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, theoretical curve), and methionine is primarily catabolized via the transsulfuration pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). The increased AdoMet concentration inhibits MTHFR that leads to a sharp decrease in the MS substrate, MTHF. This in turn, leads to a decrease in the MS reaction rate despite the increased level of the other substrate, homocysteine (Hcy). Meanwhile, the committing enzyme in the transsulfuration pathway, CBS, is activated due to an increase in the concentration of its substrate, homocysteine and its allosteric activator, AdoMet. These results are in good agreement with the published experimental data demonstrating the decrease in the fraction of methionine produced via remethylation and activation of methionine catabolism via the transsulfuration pathway at high [Met] in liver or hepatocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Finkelstein2">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Mudd1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Rao1">[11]</xref>.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000076-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000076.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption><title>The dependence of (A, B) steady-state reaction rates and (C) metabolite concentrations in methionine metabolism on [Met] as calculated by the model.</title><p>The enzyme and metabolite abbreviations are denoted by the curves corresponding to their behavior.

Moreover, several genetic polymorphisms have been described in the pathway's enzymes that are correlated with risk for various complex diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Brown1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Hobbs1">[17]</xref>. An integrated understanding of the regulation of methionine metabolism is important because of its critical role in modulating the two major homeostatic systems governing methylation and antioxidant metabolism, which are often dysregulated in complex diseases. Attaining this understanding is, however, a challenge because methionine metabolism is complex; the pathway has branches and cycles in addition to parallel fluxes at several steps of intermediate transformation. Further, regulation of the pathway enzymes by intermediates increases the complexity of the system. Mathematical modeling is a powerful tool for studying the mechanisms of regulation in complex metabolic systems and for analyzing the behavior of a system under different natural and experimentally induced conditions. Previously, simple mathematical models of liver methionine metabolism have been developed and used to analyze and predict the response of the system to changes in [Met] and other variables <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Martinov1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Prudova1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Reed1">[19]</xref>.</p><p>The most striking prediction of our previously published simple mathematical model describing methionine metabolism is that a substrate (methionine) can induce the sharp transition between two modes in liver methionine metabolism characterized by low metabolic rates and metabolite levels at methionine concentrations equal to or below its normal physiological value and by high metabolic rates and metabolite concentrations at methionine concentrations above its physiological value <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Martinov1">[9]</xref>. The model predicted that this transition is triggered within a narrow methionine concentration range. In addition to the limitations of the simple model discussed in the introduction, we could not verify or adjust the model parameters to obtain a quantitative description of methionine metabolism because of the scant information available on the dependence of metabolic fluxes on [Met] in liver or in hepatocytes. Even the rate of methionine consumption under normal physiological conditions was unknown.</p><p>To address these gaps, we experimentally determined the responsiveness of methionine metabolism in murine hepatocytes to varying concentrations of methionine. Our study revealed a sharp dependence of [AdoMet] and the rate of methionine consumption in hepatocytes on [Met] within a narrow range of extracellular [Met] that lies just above the physiological concentration of circulating methionine (∼50 µM). These data supported the development of an extended quantitative model of liver methionine metabolism, which also includes rate equations for MS, BHMT and CBS, and a simplified treatment of folate metabolism. Importantly, without the link between methionine and folate metabolism the extended model failed to provide a realistic description of the GNMT reaction rate, confirming the experimentally established regulation of GNMT by the folate derivative, MTHF. Enzymatic reaction rates were described using mechanism-based equations and the kinetics parameters were adjusted from ranges reported in the literature and our own experimental data. In addition, a new equation had to be developed to describe the MATIII reaction, including both activation and inhibition of the enzyme at high [AdoMet], in order to describe the experimental data at [Met] above its normal physiological value. A significant attribute of the extended model is that it provides a good quantitative description of our experimental results, including steady-state values and transitional processes over a wide range of [Met].</p><p>The extended model was used to analyze two types of experiments. To assess the response of hepatocytes ex vivo, to the parameter, i.e., varying [Met], the behavior of pathway metabolites and reaction rates were analyzed. To describe in vivo conditions, [Met] was considered as a model variable and the rate of methionine intake was considered as an independent parameter. A good agreement was observed between the simulated and observed ex vivo experimental data. Our experimental results demonstrate that a sharp increase in [AdoMet] in hepatocytes is accompanied by a several-fold increase in the methionine consumption rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g003">Figure 3</xref>). This behavior is reversible and liver metabolism switches back to a conservation mode when the [Met] decreases below the threshold level. Our analysis of the in vivo response to varying intake of methionine reveals that the metabolic switch between methionine conservation and disposal provides a mechanism for stabilizing liver and blood methionine concentrations over a wide range of dietary methionine intake. This mechanism is associated with the regulation of the CBS reaction rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g006">Figure 6</xref>) in addition to regulation by MATI/III and GNMT. Homeostasis requires that the steady-state transsulfuration flux must be equal to or less than the net rate of methionine consumption. The normal rate of methionine consumption observed in murine hepatocytes, was ∼1 mmol/h·l cells, which represents ∼1.3% of murine liver CBS activity under maximal velocity conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Vitvitsky1">[20]</xref>. In the model, under physiological conditions, the rate of the CBS reaction is ∼0.6% of CBS activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g005">Figure 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000076.s006">Table S1</xref>). Thus, our experimental and theoretical data reveal that under normal physiological conditions, liver CBS works at a very small fraction of its maximal capacity, and that it can be activated several fold at high [Met] to increase the volume of sulfur flowing through the transsulfuration pathway.</p><p>Thus, liver methionine metabolism exhibits trigger behavior that results from allosterically regulated switching between two sets of enzymes that catalyze parallel metabolic fluxes. In the methionine conservation mode, the metabolic flux is determined by one set of enzymes, which includes MATI and functional methylases, while in the methionine disposal mode, the metabolic flux is determined by a second set of enzymes that includes MATIII and GNMT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g007">Figure 7</xref>). To our knowledge, such a mechanism of trigger behavior that causes metabolic flux to switch between parallel pathways has not been reported previously in other metabolic systems.</p><fig id="pcbi-1000076-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000076.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption><title>Scheme showing switching between parallel metabolic tracks triggered by the concentration of methionine.</title><p>The width of the solid arrows is qualitatively proportional to the metabolic flux through each step.

An ideal mechanism for trigger behavior is provided in a system that exhibits bistability, i.e., when an area of instability separates two stable steady states. In this case, the system can jump from one steady-state to the other, and stable intermediate states do not exist in the pathway. There are a number of theoretical and experimental reports of bistability in different biological processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Selkov1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Ataullakhanov1">[25]</xref>. In fact, within a fairly wide range of parameters, both the simple and extended models predict the existence of bistability in the system, leading to the trigger behavior in metabolite concentrations and metabolic fluxes, including [AdoMet] that jumps from its physiological concentration to significantly higher levels when the [Met] crosses a threshold value. This bistability results in a hypersensitivity of methionine metabolism to changes in methionine levels within a narrow concentration interval. The theoretical mechanism of bistability, which can be realized in liver methionine metabolism, is described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000076.s011">Text S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000076.s003">Figures S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000076.s004">S4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000076.s005">S5</xref>.</p><p>However, bistability is not absolutely essential for effective regulation of liver methionine metabolism. Our model shows that even sharp monotonic dependence of methionine metabolism on methionine in a narrow range of [Met] produces metabolic switching between methionine conservation and disposal modes, providing a mechanism for effective stabilization of methionine levels. The results demonstrate that both [AdoMet] and the rate of methionine consumption in hepatocytes increase slowly with an increase in methionine level at low [Met] (0–50 µM) and then increase sharply in a narrow concentration range of 50–100 µM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g003">Figure 3</xref>) in accordance with model predictions. While the experimental data cannot distinguish between a jump versus a monotonic increase in [AdoMet] and the rate of methionine consumption with an increase in [Met] they are not well described by a simple hyperbolic behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000076-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Formal approximations of the initial part of our experimental points at [Met] from 0 to 100 µM with the simple power function: Y = A+B*X<sup>n</sup>, provide the best fit at n = 2.30 for AdoMet and at n = 1.43 for methionine consumption rate. This is consistent with a sharp, non hyperbolic increase in [AdoMet] and methionine consumption rate in a narrow interval of [Met], confirming our model predictions.

In hepatocytes, methionine is transported via a Na<sup>+</sup>-dependent and a Na<sup>+</sup>-independent transporter, with the latter accounting for ∼90% of the transport at normal methionine concentrations, and the activity of transport is high enough to provide equilibration of extracellular and intracellular methionine within a few minutes (Table 2 in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Kilberg1">[32]</xref>), which confirms the data published in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Schreiber1">[33]</xref>.

The distribution of methionine between hepatocytes and the medium can be estimated using the data presented in Figure 3 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Aw1">[30]</xref> as follows: at 100 µM [Met] in the medium, the equilibrium [Met] inside hepatocytes was 600 pmol/10<sup>6</sup> cells. Based on the size of hepatocytes (see below in Metabolite Analysis), 10<sup>6</sup> cells are estimated to have a total volume of 10 µl. This yields an intracellular [Met] of 60 µmol/l cells. Recalculating per volume of intracellular water, the intracellular [Met] is estimated to be ∼80 µM yielding a ratio between intra- and extra-cellular [Met] of 0.8. Similar calculations for the data presented in Figure 5 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Schreiber1">[33]</xref> reveal that the amino acid remains equally distributed between the extracellular medium and inside cells at methionine concentrations ranging from 18 µM to 10 mM.

Cell concentration and viability were determined using a hemocytometer after staining with 0.4% trypan blue. Cell preparations with viability ≥85% were used in all experiments. Hepatocytes were resuspended in the washing solution to a concentration of 1·10<sup>6</sup> viable cells/ml, then 5 ml suspension aliquots were placed in 50 ml Ehrlenmeyer flasks and agitated at the rate of 100 RPM under an atmosphere of humidified 95% O<sub>2</sub> and 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. At the beginning of the incubation, methionine was added to flasks to a final concentration of 40–400 µM. Cells prepared from one animal were incubated simultaneously in several flasks at different initial methionine concentrations for ∼3 h for a single experiment. Typically, the initial methionine concentrations were 40 µM, 400 µM, and two intermediate values.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Metabolite Analysis</title><p>At the desired time intervals aliquots of cell suspension were collected from flasks and mixed with 0.2 volumes of 30% trichloroacetic acid.

The mobile phase contained 40 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, 6 mM heptanesulfonic acid sodium salt (Sigma), and 15% methanol, pH 4. AdoHcy and AdoMet eluted as single peaks with retention times of 7 and 13 min respectively. The concentrations of AdoMet and AdoHcy in the samples were determined using calibration curves generated for each compound and normalized to the cell count in the suspension (i.e., expressed as µmoles/l cells). Based on an estimated cell diameter of 25–30 µm, the calculated value for the cell volume is 1·10<sup>−11</sup> l.</p><p>To measure methionine concentration, the supernatant obtained after protein precipitation was derivatized with 2,4-dinitrofluorobenzene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Aw1">[30]</xref> and analyzed by HPLC using a 5 µm Diaspher-110 ODS column, 250×4 mm (BioChemMack, Russia) under isocratic conditions at a flow rate of 1 ml/min with monitoring at 355 nm. The mobile phase contained 45% acetonitrile in 1% acetic acid in water. The retention time of derivatized methionine was 12 min. The concentration of methionine in the samples was determined using a calibration curve and expressed as µmoles/l of suspension. The change in methionine concentration, due to intracellular metabolism in cell suspension over time was approximated by linear kinetics. The slope of the corresponding line and its deviation were determined using the Microcal Origin 6.0 software (Microcal Software, Inc.). To determine the rate of methionine consumption in hepatocytes, the slope was normalized to the total cell volume in suspension as described above.</p><p>As it was mentioned above, methionine transport in hepatocytes is passive, reversible and very fast over a wide range of [Met] (from 18 µM to 10 mM) and equilibrium between extracellular and intracellular methionine concentrations can be established within 1 min <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Aw1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Kilberg1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000076-Schreiber1">[33]</xref>.
