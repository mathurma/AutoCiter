<abstract>
<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) has great potential for elucidating transcriptional networks, by measuring genome-wide binding of transcription factors (TFs) at high resolution. Despite the precision of these experiments, identification of genes directly regulated by a TF (target genes) is not trivial. Numerous target gene scoring methods have been used in the past. However, their suitability for the task and their performance remain unclear, because a thorough comparative assessment of these methods is still lacking. Here we present a systematic evaluation of computational methods for defining TF targets based on ChIP-seq data. We validated predictions based on 68 ChIP-seq studies using a wide range of genomic expression data and functional information. We demonstrate that peak-to-gene assignment is the most crucial step for correct target gene prediction and propose a parameter-free method performing most consistently across the evaluation tests.</p>

<p>Transcription factors (TFs) are the main regulators of gene transcription. Thus, knowing the genes that are targeted by a specific TF is of utmost importance for understanding developmental processes, cellular stress response, or disease etiology. Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with deep sequencing (ChIP-seq) allows for measuring the genome-wide binding of TFs. Several computational methods have been used for inferring the genes that are targeted by TFs using this binding information, but a thorough evaluation of their performance has not been performed so far. Here we present an assessment of a range of TF-target-calling methods using 68 ChIP-seq datasets. It turns out that the first step of the scoring, the assignment of binding events to genes, is the most important for correctly calling target genes. Our evaluation revealed important performance differences between the target-calling methods, with some simplistic methods exhibiting a particularly poor performance compared to more elaborate scorings. One of the methods is particularly attractive, because it does not require the <italic>a priori</italic> definition of any parameter — all parameters are ‘learned’ from the data. This and other methods tested were implemented in a freely available software package for future testing and application to other ChIP-seq datasets.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Chromatin immunoprecipitation coupled with high-throughput DNA sequencing (ChIP-seq) is a powerful technique for the genome-wide profiling of protein-DNA interactions, histone modifications, and nucleosome positions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Park1">[1]</xref>. One of the most prominent applications of this technology is the genome-wide discovery of transcription factor (TF) binding sites. The procedure of identifying TF binding sites from ChIP-seq experiments is known as ‘peak calling’ and the identified genomic regions that potentially contain true TF binding sites are called ‘peaks’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Valouev1">[2]</xref>. Whereas a lot of effort has been put into development of peak-calling methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Pepke1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Chen1">[5]</xref>, prediction of TF targets from ChIP-seq data is still an unresolved problem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Horsman1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Cheng1">[8]</xref>. Yet, this last step is critical for the functional interpretation of the many TF ChIP-seq studies that are currently being conducted.</p>
<p>Published ChIP-seq studies often use ad-hoc approaches for calling target genes, such as defining as targets all genes with a peak within a certain distance from the transcription start site (TSS) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Loh1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Cheng2">[11]</xref>. However, different TFs display various geometries and frequencies of binding events around a TSS for triggering transcriptional changes of the respective target gene. For example, some TFs bind at enhancer elements, which can be far from the TSS, whereas others bind close to or at proximal promoters. Such TF-specific features need to be taken into account when calling targets based on ChIP-seq data. Hence, more sophisticated approaches have been developed, which summarize all peaks around a TSS and weight each peak based on its genomic distance and/or strength <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-MacIsaac1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Cheng1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Chen2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Ouyang1">[13]</xref>. These more recent methods compute a quantitative target score reflecting the confidence that a given gene is a target based on the pattern of binding events around the TSS. Generally, it is assumed that (1) genes with many peaks in proximity to their TSS are more likely to be targets and (2) peak proximity to the TSS increases the probability of the gene being a target. These assumptions are implicitly made in virtually all published scoring schemes although they may not always hold (especially in case of enhancer elements). Published methods differ with respect to how they assign peaks to genes, how they score the peaks, and how they summarize scores of peaks in the proximity of a given TSS. The suitability of these assumptions for the task and the performance of the various scoring schemes remain unclear, because a thorough comparative assessment of these methods is still lacking. For the same reason, the key aspects that need to be tuned to improve the accuracy of target predictions remain elusive.</p>
<p>In this study, we systematically compared different TF target prediction approaches. We focused on the genome-wide prediction of targets using ChIP-seq data alone, because it is often the case that only this data is available. ChIP-seq-based target scores can be later integrated with expression data or any other information that could enhance target identification, if such data is available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Beyer1">[14]</xref>. Many published methods differ with respect to implementation details such as window sizes used or how distributions of peaks around TSSs are computed. Instead of trying to compare all published implementations we decided to evaluate different strategies, like using windows versus ‘window-free’ approaches. This assessment is based on a representative selection of published methods and additional variants that allowed us to systematically evaluate the importance of individual steps. In order to facilitate such systematic analysis, we structured the target scoring into three major steps and discuss in this paper different ways of choosing the peaks to be scored, using different scoring criteria and different ways of integrating (combining) peak scores. We developed assessment procedures for evaluating TF-target prediction methods based on the consistency of the target predictions, expression data, and functional homogeneity of the predicted targets. We tested the target scorings using 68 ChIP-seq experiments conducted in mouse hematopoietic and embryonic stem (ES) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Chen2">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Hannah1">[15]</xref> comprising 42 different transcription factors (TFs), and we evaluated them across 23 expression datasets. We have implemented all the target scoring methods that we tested in a unified R-package, which can be downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.cellularnetworks.org" xlink:type="simple">www.cellularnetworks.org</ext-link>. This package greatly facilitates the parallel testing of the various methods on any given ChIP-seq dataset.</p>

<title>TF target prediction methods</title>
<p>We have structured the TF-target scoring based on ChIP-seq data into three main steps that are conducted on a gene-by-gene basis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g001">Figure 1</xref>): (1) peak-to-gene assignment (deciding on which peaks the score of a gene is based on); (2) peak scoring (giving quantitative weights to peaks, e.g. based on their distance from the TSS); and (3) summarizing peak scores of all peaks assigned to a given gene. Target prediction methods can be classified with respect to how they implement each of these three steps. We compared six different approaches, in most cases inspired by published algorithms or ideas (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>). These methods were chosen to represent different types of existing approaches and to facilitate the assessment of different parameters.</p>

<title>Overview of the scoring procedure.</title>
<p>Target gene scoring consists of three steps: (1) peak-to-gene assignment, (2) peak scoring and (3) integration of individual peak scores. Black arrow indicates transcription start site (TSS) of the gene that is to be scored. Grey arrow indicates a TSS of another gene (currently not scored). Red color indicates peaks that are assigned to the evaluated (black) gene; grey peaks are not assigned to this TSS by the given peak-to-gene assignment method. Blue and yellow peaks are peaks of other TFs that might be used to score the functionality of binding sites.

<title>Peak-to-gene assignment</title>
<p>We distinguish window-based and window-free peak-to-gene assignment methods. The simplest approach is to define a fixed window around each TSS and assign all peaks within this window to the corresponding gene (‘Window’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Cheng1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Cheng2">[11]</xref>. The main drawback of this method is the necessity of choosing the size of the window, which is often an arbitrary decision that does not account for binding specificities of individual TFs. Here we compare three alternatives that do not require the definition of a window: (1) assigning all peaks of the chromosome to a given gene (‘AllPeaks’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Chen2">[12]</xref>, (2) assigning each gene to its closest peak (‘ClosestPeak’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Ouyang1">[13]</xref>, (3) assigning each peak to its closest gene (‘ClosestGene’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g001">Figure 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Zhu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-YezCuna1">[17]</xref>. (Note the difference of the latter two.)</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>Peak scoring</title>
<p>In the simplest approach, which we refer to as <italic>Binary</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>), each gene with at least one peak within the window will get a score of 1, and all other genes will get a score of 0. Apart from the necessity of arbitrarily choosing the window size, this basic method has several caveats: it neither accounts for the number of peaks in the proximity of the TSS, nor their relative distances to the TSS or their intensities. More sophisticated methods use the distance of a peak from the TSS as a scoring criterion, which is based on the assumption that binding sites are more likely to influence the expression of proximal genes. A simple realization of this notion is to assign linearly decreasing weights to peaks, i.e. being ‘1’ at the TSS and ‘0’ at the far end of the window (<italic>Linear</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>), which is inspired by the study by MacIsaac <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-MacIsaac1">[7]</xref>, who found that the influence of binding sites on expression falls off almost linearly with distance from the TSS within a 10 kb range. In addition to the distance of the peak from the TSS, Ouyang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Ouyang1">[13]</xref> took into account peak intensity. They proposed a method (<italic>Ouyang</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>), scoring each peak based on its intensity and distance from the TSS. <italic>Ouyang</italic> uses AllPeaks assignment, i.e. assigns all peaks on a chromosome to a given gene, but using weights that are exponentially decaying with distance from the gene. Thus, peaks far from the TSS have negligible influence on the score. Cheng <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Cheng1">[8]</xref> proposed an approach that implicitly accounts for peak intensity and distance from the TSS (<italic>Cheng</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>). Contrary to previously described methods, <italic>Cheng</italic> uses an observed binding profile within a window surrounding the TSS, taking into account individual TF binding characteristics. Another related approach also using an observed binding profile to score peaks scores each gene based on the distance to its nearest peak (<italic>Chen</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Chen2">[12]</xref>. We compared these previously presented approaches to <italic>ClosestGene</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>), which is a novel combination of ClosestGene assignment and TF-specific distance-based peak scoring. This method summarizes the distances of peaks around all TSSs and uses the shape of the resulting distribution to assign distance-dependent scores to peaks. The underlying assumption is that the peak-to-gene distance distribution will be narrow for factors requiring binding close to the TSS, whereas it will be broader for factors that may bind further away and still affect the expression of their targets. <italic>ClosestGene</italic> uses the peak-to-gene distance distribution to compute the probability that a peak is found at the given distance by chance. Our implementation of this approach computes the distance distributions separately for peaks being upstream (5′) and downstream (3′) of the TSSs. Thereby it implicitly accounts for a potential bias for preferential upstream (or downstream) binding.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a3">
<title>Score integration</title>
<p>The last step consists of integrating the scores of all peaks that have been assigned to a given gene. The <italic>Binary</italic> and <italic>Chen</italic> methods do not require any integration; <italic>Binary</italic> does not depend on the number of peaks and <italic>Chen</italic> assigns only one peak to each gene. All other methods assume an additive influence of multiple binding events on the gene expression. Therefore, the total TF-gene association score is computed as the sum of the individual scores of the peaks assigned to that gene.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Evaluation of TF-target prediction methods</title>
<p>We have evaluated six target assignment methods that are representative for the different classes of methods being used in the recent literature (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003342-t001">Table 1</xref>). For the <italic>Binary</italic> and <italic>Linear</italic> methods we tested several window sizes and chose the optimal one for the comparison with other methods (Figures S1 and S2). TF-target calling was performed using two sets of ChIP-seq experiments: The first is the HemoChIP compendium consisting of 53 ChIP-seq studies performed in mouse hematopoietic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Hannah1">[15]</xref>, covering 30 hematopoiesis related transcription factors or transcriptional regulators. The second set consists of ChIP-seq studies performed in mouse embryonic stem (ES) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Chen2">[12]</xref>, covering 15 ES cell-related transcription factors and transcriptional regulators, which we will refer to as ESChIP. This large compendium of ChIP-seq studies covers a broad range of diverse types of transcriptional regulators and heterogeneous cell types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s019">Table S1</xref>). For the sake of simplicity, we refer to all factors commonly as ‘transcription factors’ (TFs) although not all of them are strictly classified as specific transcription factors. Whenever possible we have evaluated the target scoring methods independently for the two datasets (HemoChIP and ESChIP) in order to assess the robustness and generality of our findings.</p>
<p>An obvious way to compare the performance of target scoring methods would be to use known target genes as benchmarks. However, since relatively few target genes have been validated in small scale studies, we have chosen to conduct a range of unbiased tests employing different genome-wide expression datasets and using functional consistency of the predicted targets as a criterion.</p>

<title>Perturbation expression data</title>
<p>First, we used perturbation expression profiling data, i.e. measurements of differential expression after inhibiting a specific TF either through RNA interference (RNAi) or genetic modifications. Functional targets of a TF are expected to respond stronger to the perturbation of a TF than non-targets. Even though perturbation experiments have indirect effects on genes that are not direct targets of the TF, a bigger overlap with perturbation expression data is indicative of better target scoring <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Beyer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Ucar1">[18]</xref>. We collected genome-wide perturbation expression data for 13 factors in HemoChIP and 8 factors in ESChIP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s019">Table S1</xref>). In order to evaluate the target scorings, we compared the rankings of genes according to their target scores and according to the absolute expression fold change in response to the TF perturbation (assuming that a TF might serve as an activator or repressor for different sets of genes). Intuitively, one could compare the consistency of the whole rankings across all genes, for example calculating the Spearman rank correlation coefficient or the sum of rank products <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Breitling1">[19]</xref>. We demonstrated, however, that including all genes in the analysis leads to a subtle, but very important artifact. A large fraction of genes might not respond in any of the perturbation experiments that we used, either because they are housekeeping genes or because they were not expressed in the cell types or conditions tested. These genes would always rank low and thus any arbitrary expression dataset compared with any ChIP-seq experiment would result in better than random correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, we decided to take a simple, yet, robust approach and compute the overlap (number of shared genes) between the top 500 genes based on the target scorings and the top 500 genes based on the expression profiling. Results for other sets of top scoring genes are described in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s020">Text S1</xref>. In order to correct for TF specific biases we normalized the observed overlaps for the average performance of all methods (see Materials and Methods).</p>
<p>The first important observation was that all methods resulted in target scorings that are consistent with the perturbation expression data. We performed permutation tests that showed that the overlap is significantly reduced when randomly picking the same number (i.e. 500) of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s004">Figure S4</xref>). This gives credibility to the target scoring methods and confirms that perturbation expression data can be used for validating target predictions, even if sometimes different cell lines or cell types were used. However, we also observed important differences between the scoring methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g002">Figure 2 A, B</xref>). <italic>Binary</italic> and <italic>Chen</italic> performed worst suggesting that considering peak distances from the TSS (neglected by <italic>Binary</italic>) as well as proper peak-to-gene assignment are crucial aspects of target scoring. In addition, the <italic>Chen</italic> method suffers from the fact that the scoring is based on one peak only and thus is very sensitive to experimental variation in ChIP-seq data, such as miscalled peaks. The best performing method in this test was <italic>ClosestGene</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g002">Figure 2 A, B</xref>). Similar conclusions could be drawn when comparing other sets of target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

<title>Differential TF activity data</title>
<p>Perturbation expression experiments yield relatively specific, functional data on genes whose expression is directly or indirectly affected by the TF. However, they mostly do not reflect physiological conditions. We therefore performed a complementary analysis using expression data of different cell types, for which we expected (based on the function of the TF) that a given TF would change its activity. As an effect true targets of the TF should exhibit differential expression between these two conditions. This latter analysis rests on more physiological conditions than engineered TF activity changes, but it has the drawback that several TFs may change their activity between the two cell states. Thus, observed expression differences cannot exclusively be attributed to the TF of interest. This analysis was performed similarly as for perturbation expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g002">Figure 2 C, D</xref>). The results are mostly in agreement with the previous analysis, except that <italic>ClosestGene</italic> performs worse than <italic>Linear</italic>, <italic>Ouyang</italic> and <italic>Cheng</italic> on the HemoChIP data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g002">Figure 2 C, D</xref>).

<title>Functional homogeneity of targets</title>
<p>Genes being targeted by the same TF should be functionally related and a significant fraction of the target genes should be functionally related to the TF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Beyer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Bodn1">[20]</xref>. In particular, we expected that targets of HemoChIP-TFs should be relevant for hematopoiesis and targets of ESChIP-TFs should be annotated for processes related to ES cell biology. Thus, methods generating target lists that are functionally more homogeneous and whose functionality is of higher relevance to the given cell type should be preferable. To quantify this notion we performed GO enrichment analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Alexa1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Ashburner1">[22]</xref> on the different target scorings using the top 500 targets and compared the number of significantly enriched (p–value&lt;0.001<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003342.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, Fisher's exact test) cell-type specific GO terms of the ‘biological process’ category (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g003">Figure 3</xref>).

<title>Consistency and specificity of target predictions</title>
<p>In order to investigate the robustness of the TF-target prediction methods, we checked the consistency of the target predictions across different ChIP-seq experiments for the same TF, available for several TFs in the HemoChIP compendium. Although these datasets are not replicates, but independent experiments, performed in different cell types or different conditions, we reasoned that targets predicted for the same TF in different studies should be more similar than targets predicted for different TFs. We thus used the consistency of targets predicted based on different ChIP-seq experiments for the same TF compared to the overlap of predictions for different TFs as a criterion to quantify the quality of the target scorings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In order to also assess the specificity of the predictions we distinguished the overlap between ChIP-seq studies measuring (1) the same TF, (2) measuring different TFs but also in hematopoietic cell types, and (3) measuring different TFs in a different cellular system (i.e. ESChIP, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The overlap between ChIP-seq experiments performed on the same TF usually falls in the range of 150 to 250 out of 500 genes, which is statistically highly significant (expected number of overlapping genes if the ranking was random is on average 9.72). Perfect overlap is not expected, because the compared datasets are not replicates, but independent experiments, differing both in biological (different cell types or conditions) and technical (different labs, different antibodies, etc.) aspects. Importantly, the overlap between the ChIP-seq experiments of the same TF is significantly higher than the overlap between different factors from the HemoChIP compendium, which in turn is higher than the overlap with ChIP-seq experiments from ESChIP. Since the HemoChIP TFs are likely to share more targets between each other than with ESChIP TFs, higher overlap with HemoChIP TFs is expected. Although all TF-target prediction methods tested are robust and specific, meaning they can repeatedly identify targets of a given TF across different ChIP-seq experiments for the same TF, we observed important differences between the scoring methods. <italic>Binary</italic> and <italic>Chen</italic> performed worst in these tests, while <italic>Ouyang</italic> and <italic>ClosestGene</italic> were performing best (<italic>Ouyang</italic> had the highest specificity when comparing TF-specific ChIP-seq experiments <italic>versus</italic> other HemoChIP experiments. <italic>ClosestGene</italic> had the highest specificity when comparing HemoChIP experiments <italic>versus</italic> ESChIP experiments). The relatively weak performance of <italic>Binary</italic> and <italic>Chen</italic> correlates with the fact that they both ignore the number of peaks in the proximity of a gene. Similar conclusions could be drawn when comparing other sets of target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<title>Consistency of target gene predictions.</title>
<p>Independent ChIP-seq experiments are available for some of the factors measured in the hematopoietic system. Consistency of target predictions is quantified as the overlap between the top 500 target genes. Results are summarized based on intersecting targets from pairs of ChIP-seq experiments measuring the same transcription factor (‘same TF’), using ChIP-seq experiments from different factors, but the same system (hematopoietic cells, ‘HemoChIP’) and using ChIP-seq experiments from a different system (ES cells, ‘ESChIP’). Numbers on the right are rounded p-values, measuring the significance of the difference between the overlaps (t-test). P-values for the comparison ‘same TF’ versus ‘HemoChIP’ are generally less significant than ‘HemoChIP’ versus ‘ESChIP’, because the number of comparisons (observations) is smaller.</p>

<title>Inclusion of additional genomic data</title>
<p>We and many others have shown that the consideration of additional information, such as binding site conservation, expression data, or interactions among target genes, improves TF target gene identification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Beyer1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Ucar1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-BarJoseph1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-MaienscheinCline1">[26]</xref>. In this study we have exclusively used ChIP-seq data in order to specifically investigate the utility of different types of information that can directly be extracted from high-throughput DNA binding data. Other information can be included in subsequent steps. The scorings discussed so far rely on various aspects of TF binding, such as number of peaks in the proximity of the TSS, relative distances of the peaks from the TSSs or peak intensities. However, due to different implementations, it is difficult to directly compare the importance of these various aspects on target prediction. Therefore, we extended the <italic>ClosestGene</italic> method, which in its basic form uses distance between peaks and TSSs as the sole weighting criterion, and conducted additional analyses using also peak intensities and presence of co-factors as scoring criteria (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s020">Text S1</xref>). We observed that peaks closer to TSSs tend to be stronger and that they more often co-bind with other TFs than peaks binding further away (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s010">Figures S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s011">S11</xref>). Surprisingly, including these additional parameters did not improve the target gene prediction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s012">Figure S12</xref>). The scoring that we tested was based on the number of other TFs binding at a given site. However, the relationship between co-binding (which not always implies co-activity) and functionality of a binding site may be much more complex. Approaches explicitly modeling combinatorial interactions between TFs have proven to better explain expression changes than single-TF analyses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Ouyang1">[13]</xref>. Depending on the peak calling method, peak intensities are affected by numerous factors not related to the binding strength or functionality of the binding. For example, peak intensities and their significance are affected by the local background of DNA being purified, by the mapability of the specific region and by the presence or absence of co-factors in the protein-DNA complex, which may affect the efficiency of the immune purification. These factors might partially explain why in this case the inclusion of peak intensity did not improve target predictions.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Gene density around predicted targets</title>
<p>Another important aspect of peak-to-gene assignment not discussed so far is its sensitivity to gene density of genomic regions. Methods using a fixed window around the TSS are prone to miscall targets in gene-rich regions. The fact that density of peaks is higher in gene-dense regions (these regions are likely to contain more targets than gene-sparse regions) increases the likelihood of finding a peak close to any gene in such region. In order to test the relevance of this issue for target gene identification we compared the gene densities around the highest scoring targets for the different scoring methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003342-g005">Figure 5</xref>). The strongest gene density bias was observed for <italic>Linear</italic>, due to the relatively large window size (−50 kb to 50 kb) used in this method. Methods using smaller window sizes (<italic>Binary</italic>, <italic>Cheng</italic>) or relying on fewer proximal peaks (<italic>Chen</italic>) show a smaller bias in favor of gene-rich regions. Importantly, <italic>Ouyang</italic>, which assigns all peaks to each gene (but with decreasing weight) shows a stronger bias than methods considering only peaks in the proximity of the TSS. Compared to the other methods, <italic>ClosestGene</italic> shows a bias in favor of gene-poor regions, which can be explained by the fact that in a gene-poor region more peaks are likely to be assigned to a single gene. These gene density biases are persistent across different sets of targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s013">Figure S13</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study we have presented the first systematic comparison of ChIP-seq based TF-target prediction methods using a wide range of ChIP-seq studies from different biological systems. We have developed robust evaluation tests that account for several biases and potential pitfalls. Structuring the target scoring process into three phases helped systematizing the methods and it revealed the peak-to-gene assignment as the most important step. Although all methods resulted in TF-target predictions that are better than random, we observed important differences between the methods.</p>
<p>A common principle underlying all of these methods is the scoring of putative TF-targets by correlating the positions of TF binding sites with the positions of TSSs. Even though genomic distance is not a perfect predictor for TF-target interactions (especially in the case of enhancers and silencers) this approach yields statistically significant predictions. Individual targets would however have to be validated through functional assays. Out of six compared methods, <italic>Binary</italic> and <italic>Chen</italic> clearly performed the worst. In contrast, all other methods accounting for the number and distance of peaks around a TSS consistently performed better across all our tests. All of these methods (<italic>Linear</italic>, <italic>Ouyang</italic>, <italic>Cheng</italic>, <italic>ClosestGene</italic>) performed similarly, but we observed a small advantage of <italic>ClosestGene</italic> especially in the expression data tests and GO enrichment. Although the performance gain was small it was consistent when changing thresholds (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003342.s020">Text S1</xref>). This indicates that assigning each peak to its closest gene, a simple solution that has been used before to determine TF targets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Zhu1">[16]</xref>, yields specific and biologically relevant results. The <italic>ClosestGene</italic> approach presented in this study is a combination of three ideas that have not been used in this combination in the past: (1) assigning peaks to their closest gene, (2) scoring peaks based on the distribution of all peaks around the TSSs, and (3) considering (summing) all peaks assigned to a particular gene. Contrary to all other methods tested, <italic>ClosestGene</italic> does not require the definition of any parameters, giving it another advantage.</p>
<p>An obvious limitation of all methods tested herein is their inability to predict distal regulatory events. Matching long-range DNA interaction data obtained through methods such as 5C <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Dostie1">[27]</xref> or ChIA-PET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Fullwood1">[28]</xref> are currently not available in sufficient quantity to aid the interpretation of most ChIP-seq studies. We are convinced, however, that including complementary data, especially on long-range DNA interactions, and further improving the scoring by accounting for combinatorial interactions will yield even better target scorings in the future.</p>
<p>Another factor influencing the quality of the TF target prediction from ChIP-seq data is the quality of peak calling itself. Different peak calling algorithms result in different numbers of identified peaks and/or different peak intensities, which in turn influences the performance of target identification methods. All, but one (<italic>Cheng</italic>), methods assessed in this paper use the list of identified peaks as input. Since all target prediction methods were faced with the same set of peaks, the evaluation tests allow for a fair comparison of the predictions.</p>
<p>It should be emphasized that all of our analysis is based on mouse data. Whereas it is very plausible that the performance of the target prediction methods will be similar for other mammalian species, ChIP-seq data from non-mammalian species may have different requirements. Hence, similar assessments should be performed for other species.</p>

<p>Fifty three ChIP-seq studies covering 30 transcription factors and transcriptional regulators were taken from HemoChIP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Hannah1">[15]</xref>. We used the peaks as identified in the original HemoChIP publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Hannah1">[15]</xref>.

We also used, however, the remaining ChIP-seq studies to evaluate the consistency of the predictions.</p>
<p>The ChIP-seq studies of the 15 transcription factors and transcriptional regulators performed in mouse ES cells, which we refer to as ESChIP, were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Chen2">[12]</xref>, GSE11431.

In the selected studies the expression profile of the wild-type cells was compared to the expression profile after knock-out or knock-down of the respective TF.

<p>For the activity analysis of HemoChIP TFs, the normalized expression data were obtained from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003342-Gerrits1">[33]</xref>, where the expression measurements in four different hematopoietic cell types (stem cells, progenitors, erythroid and myeloid cells) across a number of BXD mouse strains are reported.

<p>In the first step, each peak was assigned to its closest gene. When a particular gene was scored, only the peaks assigned to that gene, i.e. peaks closer to that gene than to any other, were considered. The peak scoring was derived from the observed peak-to-gene distance distribution.</p>
<p>The peak-to-gene distance distribution was obtained by computing the distances between each TSS and all peaks within 1 Mb upstream and 1 Mb downstream of the TSS. Separate distributions for upstream and downstream binding were generated and the distances were pooled across all chromosomes. This distribution approximates the distribution of the distances of all peaks to all genes. The restriction of the distance to 1 Mb was applied in order to minimize artifacts for genes located close to the telomeres and due to different lengths of the chromosomes.</p>
<p>Subsequently, individual peaks were scored using the cumulative distance distributions by computing the fraction of peaks observed at the given distance from the TSS or closer (again separately for upstream and downstream binding). This fraction (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003342.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was interpreted as the probability of observing the peak at this position or closer to the TSS if the gene was not a target of the TF.

<p>For each TF, for which perturbation expression data were available, the overlap between the top 500 genes ranked according to the TF-gene association score and the top 500 genes ranked according to the fold change between perturbation and control conditions was calculated. In case of the activity analysis respective fold changes from different conditions were used. Bindings were handled in the same way as for the consistency analysis. The overlap between the target scorings and expression data not only depends on the performance of the scoring methods but also on the compatibility between the ChIP-seq data and the expression data (e.g. depending on the cell types measured). In order to correct for this effect the average overlap achieved by all methods for a particular ChIP-seq - expression data pair was subtracted. Hence, this measures how much better (or worse) than average each method performed on a given dataset.</p>
