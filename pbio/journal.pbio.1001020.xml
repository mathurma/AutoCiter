        <p>The initiation, execution, and completion of complex locomotor behaviors are depending on precisely integrated neural circuitries consisting of motor pathways that activate muscles in the extremities and sensory afferents that deliver feedback to motoneurons. These projections form in tight temporal and spatial vicinities during development, yet the molecular mechanisms and cues coordinating these processes are not well understood. Using cell-type specific ablation of the axon guidance receptor Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) in spinal motoneurons or in sensory neurons in the dorsal root ganglia (DRG), we have explored the contribution of this signaling pathway to correct innervation of the limb. We show that Npn-1 controls the fasciculation of both projections and mediates inter-axonal communication. Removal of Npn-1 from sensory neurons results in defasciculation of sensory axons and, surprisingly, also of motor axons. In addition, the tight coupling between these two heterotypic axonal populations is lifted with sensory fibers now leading the spinal nerve projection. These findings are corroborated by partial genetic elimination of sensory neurons, which causes defasciculation of motor projections to the limb. Deletion of Npn-1 from motoneurons leads to severe defasciculation of motor axons in the distal limb and dorsal-ventral pathfinding errors, while outgrowth and fasciculation of sensory trajectories into the limb remain unaffected. Genetic elimination of motoneurons, however, revealed that sensory axons need only minimal scaffolding by motor axons to establish their projections in the distal limb. Thus, motor and sensory axons are mutually dependent on each other for the generation of their trajectories and interact in part through Npn-1-mediated fasciculation before and within the plexus region of the limbs.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>During embryonic development, growing axons establish intricate neural networks with their peripheral targets, a process that builds the basis for complex behaviors. While wiring up the proper circuits in peripheral limbs, for example, motor axons from the spinal cord and sensory axons from the dorsal root ganglia converge in the spinal nerve. Here, they intermingle and are subsequently sorted before reaching the plexus region, the pivotal dorsal-ventral choice point on their path to the limb. In this study, we analyzed the contribution of the axon guidance receptor Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) to determine how axons choose their path, how well they are able to maintain their correct path, and how it influences the interactions between spinal sensory axons and motor axons. We find that when Npn-1 is eliminated from sensory neurons, both sensory and motor axons are “derailed” from their correct nerve bundles, and there is a break in the tight coupling between these axonal populations. Loss of Npn-1 in motoneurons, however, leads to impairments in axon bundling and pathfinding errors only in motor axons, while sensory axons remain unaffected. Genetic ablation studies of either sensory or motor neurons corroborate the results on the mutual dependency and specificity of the outgrowing spinal projections. These results reveal a role for Npn-1 in controlling specific axon-axon interactions that lead to formation of proper spinal sensory-motor trajectories to the limb. Furthermore, they suggest that the presence of minimal numbers of sensory or motor axons is sufficient for the formation of correct spinal projections.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The establishment of concerted locomotor behaviors in vertebrates relies on the formation of integrated motor and sensory circuits that form between defined populations of neurons and their appropriate targets in the periphery. During the development of the spinal neuromuscular circuitry, motoneurons and sensory neurons of the dorsal root ganglia (DRG) align their axons to form spinal nerves that extend together over long distances towards their respective peripheral targets in the developing limb. The molecular mechanisms underlying the early organization of these projections, from diverse origins into tight fascicles, and subsequent sorting into target-specific bundles are crucial to their pathfinding success, but are not well understood. Several families of complementary receptor-ligand pairs that are expressed on projecting neurons and their targets and serve as axon guidance cues have been identified over the last two decades <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-TessierLavigne1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Tran1">[3]</xref>. The expression of these secreted and membrane-bound factors, and their neuronal receptors, is tightly regulated, both spatially and temporally.</p>
      <p>However, growing axons recognize and respond to cues presented not only in intermediary and final target tissues but also on neighboring axons. In the fly olfactory system, axon-axon interactions mediated by Sema1A expressed on early-arriving axons to the antenna constrain the choice of late-arriving axons from the maxillary palp, likely through repulsive interactions with PlexinA, a receptor for Sema1A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Sweeney1">[4]</xref>. Recently, the same family of axon guidance molecules has been implicated in pre-target segregation of axons that project to different regions of the mouse olfactory bulb. Genetic experiments revealed that these pre-target axon-axon interactions are mediated by expression of complementary amounts of Neuropilin-1 (Npn-1) and Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) on olfactory sensory neurons and result in axonal segregation en route to their target destinations, specific and unique glomeruli in the olfactory bulb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Imai1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During the development of the vertebrate limb, axon-environment interactions mediated by molecules of several axon guidance cue families play crucial roles in the establishment of precise connectivity in sensory-motor circuitry. Motoneurons that innervate limb muscles reside at brachial and lumbar levels in the ventral spinal cord and form the lateral motor columns (LMC). Lateral LMC neurons (LMCl) express EphA4 and are guided to the dorsal limb through repulsive interactions with ephrinA ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Helmbacher1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Kramer1">[9]</xref> while repulsive Sema3F-Npn-2 as well as ephrinB-EphB signaling directs axons from the medial LMC (LMCm) to ventral limb muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Huber1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Luria1">[11]</xref>. Selective fasciculation and de-fasciculation of sensory and motor nerves within specific decision areas, e.g. the plexus region, are also controlled by axon-environment interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Huber1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Tang1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Tang2">[13]</xref>. Only recently inter-axonal signals between co-extending sensory and motor axons have been proposed to organize these projections within nerves innervating axial muscles of the trunk. Indeed, repulsive interactions mediated through ephrinA ligands expressed on sensory axons and EphA3/A4 receptors present on motoneurons of the medial aspect of the medial motor column (MMCm) result in a sharp pre-target segregation of motor and sensory pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Gallarda1">[14]</xref>. However, the role of axon-axon interactions in the formation of non-axial projections, for example in the trajectories to the limb, remains unclear. Deletion of motoneurons through surgical removal of several segments of neural tube in the developing chick suggested that motor axons influence the patterning of sensory trajectories either by axons providing environmental and/or selective fasciculation cues to guide sensory axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Landmesser1">[15]</xref>. Subsequent studies showed that sensory axons retain the capability of finding their correct targets if motoneurons are removed after the developmental stage when neural crest cells coalesce into the DRG. This suggests that the sensory neuron identity or axon extension is plastic with regard to pathway and target choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Wang1">[16]</xref>. While these data show a dependence on correct motor axon growth for correct sensory axon outgrowth and guidance, they do not rule out the converse.</p>
      <p>Class 3 semaphorin mediated signals govern several distinct aspects of the formation of spinal sensory-motor connectivity: in contrast to repulsive Sema3F-Npn-2 interactions, which guide a subset of medial LMC axons into the ventral forelimb, Sema3A-Npn-1 signaling directs the fasciculation, timing, and fidelity of motor axon growth into the forelimb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Huber1">[10]</xref>. Interestingly, Npn-1 is expressed not only at early time points in all LMC neurons projecting to the limb, but also in sensory neurons of the DRG, and is therefore in a position to mediate axon-axon interactions between sensory and motor fibers during development.</p>
      <p>In this study, using genetic tools, we re-examined the reciprocal interactions of sensory and motor axons as they navigate their trajectories and explored the role of Npn-1 signaling in the communication between these two peripheral nerve components. We show that Npn-1 is required in sensory axons to maintain proper fasciculation and organization of both sensory and motor axons. DRG-specific removal of Npn-1 leads to defasciculation of motor projections even though Npn-1 is still present in motoneurons. In line with these findings, peripheral motor projections can still form if sensory neurons are partially eliminated by activation of diphteria toxin fragment A (DT-A), however motor trajectories become defasciculated. Elimination of Npn-1 from motoneurons, however, leads to defasciculation of motor projections beyond the plexus without influencing the correct formation of sensory trajectories. This defasciculation of motor axons also resulted in dorsal-ventral guidance errors within the limb. Partial elimination of motoneurons resulted in markedly thinned, or even absent, sensory projections depending on the degree of motoneuron reduction. Our results underscore the crucial role of Npn-1 signaling for the sorting and selective fasciculation of sensory and motor axons of the vertebrate limb prior to these projections arriving at the important early choice point, the plexus region. Our data show that correct fasciculation and the presence of either motor or sensory axons proximal to the plexus region play a key role in the development of both classes of projections.</p>

        <title>Fasciculation of Motor Axons Is Controlled by Npn-1 Expressed in Motoneurons</title>
        <p>Absence of Sema3-Neuropilin signaling in all cells, as occurs in the <italic>Npn-1<sup>Sema</sup></italic><sup>−</sup> mouse line where Sema3A-Npn-1 signaling is abrogated, results in defasciculation of peripheral sensory and motor projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Huber1">[10]</xref>. To determine whether Npn-1 is required cell-autonomously in motoneurons for motor axon fasciculation, we utilized a conditional approach (<italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic>, GeneID:18186, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Gu1">[17]</xref>) to selectively remove Npn-1 from this cell type using an <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic> line (GeneID:50913, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Dessaud1">[18]</xref>). In <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> animals Npn-1 mRNA and protein were strongly reduced in motoneuron cell bodies and axons, respectively, while sensory neurons and axons still expressed unchanged levels of Npn-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g001">Figure 1A–E</xref>). Motor axons were visualized by also crossing to an <italic>Hb9::eGFP</italic> transgenic mouse line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Wichterle1">[19]</xref>. The formation of peripheral motor and sensory projections was observed in wholemount embryo preparations by GFP fluorescence (motor axons) or expression of neurofilament in absence of GFP (sensory trajectories), respectively. At E12.5, when motor and sensory axons have traversed the plexus region and formed individual nerve branches in the distal limb in the wildtype, motor axons were found to be strongly defasciculated in homozygous <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic> mice heterozygous for <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s001">S1A</xref>,B). These findings were also corroborated when an alternative <italic>Cre</italic> line was used, <italic>Hb9-Cre</italic> (GeneID:15285, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Arber1">[20]</xref>), to eliminate Npn-1 from motoneurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s002">Figure S2</xref>). After exiting the spinal cord motor axons converged to form the plexus, however, in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants the defasciculation was so severe that hardly any motor fibers reached the distal forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g002">Figure 2B,F</xref>, arrowhead). To visualize the degree of defasciculation we measured the pixel intensity along a line perpendicularly crossing the four major motor nerves visible at this developmental time point in the forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). In <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> animals all nerves are heavily defasciculated and only the radial nerve (number 2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3C,D</xref>) could still be identified in the plot profile. This also revealed a pronounced defasciculation of motor nerves in the <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> animals, albeit less severe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3E,F</xref>). To quantify the defasciculation of motor fibers, we measured the thickness of the four major motor nerves in the forelimbs and found significantly increased values in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants when compared to wildtype littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Since the distal advancement of motor axons in the forelimb appeared to be reduced in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants, we quantified the ingrowth of motor axons into the forelimb by measuring the length of the distal-most motor fiber relative to the length of the forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3H</xref>). We found that the advancement of motor axons was significantly reduced in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> embryos (0.42±0.03 SEM) compared to wildtype littermates (0.63±0.02, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) while the distal advancement was normal in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). Surprisingly, the formation of sensory trajectories was unaffected by defasciculation or stunted growth of motor nerves in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g002">Figure 2B</xref>',D'). This was particularly obvious with the sensory part of the ulnar nerve that was formed normally even though the motor nerve did not extend as far as in control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g002">Figure 2E</xref>',F', arrow). We quantified the defasciculation of sensory projections by counting the number of neurofilament positive pixels in a defined region of interest and found no difference in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> or <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants when compared to wildtype littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3J–M</xref>). Npn-1 is also expressed in a large majority of LMC neurons at lumbar level and indeed we observed a very similar phenotype in the hindlimb where, after removal of Npn-1 from motoneurons, motor projections were significantly defasciculated while the sensory branching pattern was established normally (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s003">Figure S3</xref>, quantification in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Interestingly, not only LMC projections to the limbs were affected by selective removal of Npn-1 in motoneurons, but also other motor projections, as exemplified by the innervation of intercostal musculature originating from neurons of the lateral aspect of the medial motor column (MMCl, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In contrast to wildtype intercostal nerves, which are tightly bundled (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s005">Figure S5A</xref>,B), these nerves are strongly defasciculated in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant mice with many axon fascicles crossing between major nerve branches (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s005">Figure S5D</xref>, arrowheads). The mean number of such crossings in mutant embryos was almost 30-fold higher than in control littermates (14.17±4.1 versus 0.5±0.5 crossings per embryo, respectively, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s005">Figure S5E</xref>). Interestingly, defasciculated intercostal axons were also observed later in embryonic development at E15.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s006">Figure S6</xref>). These data indicate that Npn-1 is required cell-type autonomously in motoneurons for proper fasciculation of motor trajectories. They further suggest that peripheral sensory projections are established correctly, even if the motor projections are severely defasciculated in the distal fore- and hindlimb due to loss of Npn-1 function.</p>

            <p>Defasciculation of motor nerves was assessed by calculating a plot profile of Hb9::eGFP positive motor projections crossing a virtual line. In control embryos (A and B) four major projections can be seen (1  =  branch of n. radialis, 2 = n. radialis, 3 = n. medianus, 4 = n. ulnaris, arrowhead  =  n. musculocutaneous). In <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant embryos (C and D) only the remainders of the radial nerve (2) can be assigned to the plot profile, whereas all other motor projections are heavily defasciculated, leading to many peaks along the virtual line. In <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant embryos defasciculation of motor projections is not as severe as defasciculation caused by <italic>Olig2-Cre</italic>. Therefore, it is possible to assign the small branch of the radial nerve (1), the radial nerve, even though it is defasciculated more distally (2), and the ulnar nerve (4) to the peaks in the plot profile, whereas the median nerve is heavily defasciculated. To quantify the defasciculation of motor fibers, we measured the thickness of the four major motor nerves in wildtype forelimbs (G, 27.8±1.4 SEM) and found significantly increased values in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> and <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants (G, 97.4±5.0 SEM <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.00001 and 79.7±13.4 SEM <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, respectively). To quantify the ingrowth of motor axons into the forelimb, the length of the distal-most motor fiber was measured starting from the reference point, and normalized with the length of the forelimb (H). The distal advancement of motor fibers was significantly reduced in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant embryos (I, 0.42±0.03, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) compared to control embryos (0.63±0.02), while it was unchanged when <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mice were crossed to the <italic>Hb9-Cre</italic> line (0.61±0.03).

        <title>Npn-1 Is Required in Motoneurons Cell-Autonomously for Accurate Dorsal-Ventral Guidance of LMC Axons</title>
        <p>Defasciculation of motor projections as caused by removal of Npn-1 from motoneurons could affect the stereotypical dorsal-ventral choices made by LMC axons. We therefore examined whether cell-type-specific removal of Npn-1 affected this guidance decision. We retrogradely labeled motoneuron cell bodies by injecting rhodamin-coupled dextran into either ventral or dorsal forelimb muscles of E12.5 embryos and then assessed the presence of retrogradely transported dextran in the cell bodies of Lim1-positive LMCl motoneurons projecting to dorsal musculature or Isl1-positive LMCm motoneurons projecting to ventral limb muscles, respectively. In wildtype embryos, only very few motoneurons that were retrogradely labeled from ventral fore- or hindlimb muscle injections expressed Lim1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g004">Figure 4A,C</xref>). In contrast, significantly more ventrally labeled rhodamin-positive motoneurons expressed Lim1 in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref>, arrowheads). Thus, removal of Npn-1 from motoneurons leads to misrouting of LMCl axons to the ventral half in both fore- and hindlimb. Analysis of the fidelity of LMCm projections by retrograde labeling from dorsal limb muscles revealed that 11.25%±1.66% of lumbar LMCm axons aberrantly projected to the dorsal limb when Npn-1 was removed from motoneurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g004">Figure 4E,F</xref>). Due to the shortened ingrowth of motor axons in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants none of the dorsal backfills at brachial levels resulted in any retrogradely traced neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). We therefore assessed the fidelity of the brachial dorsal-ventral choice also in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants where motor axons, though defasciculated, are found at comparable distal positions in the forelimb as in control littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). Retrograde tracing from dorsal forelimb musculature revealed a significant number of misguided Isl1 positive LMCm neurons in these mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). Together, these data show that decreased fasciculation caused by motoneuron-specific loss of Npn-1 leads to pathfinding errors at the dorsal-ventral choice point.</p>

At E12.5, we found a pronounced defasciculation of sensory projections innervating both the fore- and hindlimbs and aberrant, exuberant growth when compared to wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g005">Figure 5A,C and B,D</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s003">Figure S3G</xref>',H').

Surprisingly, this incorrect pattern of sensory projections was accompanied by defasciculation of motor axons: several major motor branches, particularly the radial and median nerves to the forelimb, were defasciculated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g005">Figure 5B</xref>',D', arrowheads). To visualize this phenotype we generated a plot profile by measuring the pixel intensity of the Hb9::eGFP staining along a line perpendicularly crossing the four major nerves in the E12.5 forelimb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g006">Figure 6D–G</xref>).

Interestingly, these motor branches, while defasciculated, still developed in roughly appropriate relative positions to each other and the distal advancement of motor axons was normal (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s004">Figure S4</xref>). At higher magnification, we noted that defasciculated motor projections were always accompanied by sensory axons that preceded motor axons (e.g. in the radial nerve, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g005">Figure 5G,H</xref>, arrowheads). At the same time, many defasciculated sensory axons were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g005">Figure 5F–H</xref>). When we distinguished proprioceptive from nociceptive sensory projections by TrkC or TrkA immunohistochemistry, respectively, we found that in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Ht-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants, defasciculated motor axons follow either TrkC- or TrkA-positive fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, arrowhead and open arrowhead, respectively). At this stage, Npn-1 is expressed in the majority of TrkA-positive DRG neurons, but also in a significant number of TrkC-positive sensory neurons and is therefore in a position to mediate fasciculation of nociceptive and proprioceptive axons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

        <p>To address whether the less severe defasciculation of motor projections caused by absence of Npn-1 from sensory neurons also affects the dorsal-ventral guidance decision of motor axons at the base of the limb, we retrogradely traced motor projections to the dorsal and ventral mesenchyme in fore- and hindlimb of <italic>Ht-PA-Cre</italic> mutants. Our data show that medial and lateral LMC neurons at brachial and lumbar levels project correctly to the ventral or dorsal limb mesenchyme, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s008">Figure S8</xref>). We thus conclude that the defasciculation of motor axons induced by removal of Npn-1 from sensory neurons does not lead to guidance errors at the dorsal-ventral choice point at the base of the limb.</p>

        <p>These data suggest that the state of sensory axon fasciculation before entering the plexus region influences motor axon fasciculation before, within, and after the plexus. We therefore analyzed the sensory-motor projections at E10.0, when motor axons have left the spinal cord and joined the sensory fibers but have not yet reached the plexus region. We found that the sensory projection is defasciculated already at this early timepoint in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup>;<italic>Ht-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants and that sensory axons are frequently further advanced than motor fibers, a behavior that was never observed in wildtype littermate controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g009">Figure 9D–F</xref>).

        <p>Together, these data support the notion that motor axons are required at an early stage in sensory trajectory development, when sensory axons need to find their way to the plexus. At later stages, after having navigated the plexus, sensory fibers become independent of motor axons for their projection to the distal limb, hence defasciculation or even complete absence of motor axons has a lesser influence on the patterning of sensory trajectories.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Investigations into how growing axons navigate the environment to reach their targets during development have yielded a growing list of molecular cues and corresponding receptors that determine guidance decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-ODonnell1">[24]</xref>. A strong focus of these studies has been to understand growth cone behavior at defined positions, so called choice points, where growth cones of nerve fibers pause, explore their environment, and, subsequently, in response to local cues, resume their growth in the appropriate direction. The concept of pioneering axons that lay down the landscape for later following fibers has been described for many vertebrate systems from retinotectal to callosal projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Fekete1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Pittman1">[28]</xref>. During development, however, only a small number of pioneer axons grow into “uncharted” territories, the vast majority of fibers orient their growth patterns along axon tracts already laid out by preceding fibers. Nevertheless, in order to establish correct trajectories these fibers cannot simply follow existing trajectories but need to make appropriate decisions about which branch to follow, and when to form new rami. These interactions with existing fiber bundles clearly require strictly regulated events of selective fasciculation and de-fasciculation, the molecular basis of which are in most cases not well understood. In this study we have explored the coordinated growth and fasciculation of sensory and motor fibers during the establishment of limb innervation and in particular the role of a well-characterized guidance receptor, Npn-1, in the interaction of these axonal populations.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Fasciculation of Motor Axons and Its Role in Establishing Peripheral Sensory Trajectories</title>
        <p>In the spinal nerve, sensory axons from the DRG and motor axons from the ventral horn of the spinal cord converge to establish conjoined trajectories to their respective peripheral targets. Whether and to what degree sensory axons depend on motor projections in the formation of their peripheral projection patterns has been controversial. Early surgical removal of motoneurons in the embryonic chick resulted in abnormal patterning of sensory trajectories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Landmesser1">[15]</xref>, while eliminating motoneurons after neural crest cells have coalesced into DRG had no obvious impact on the formation of sensory projections to muscles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Wang1">[16]</xref>. We used a genetic approach to partially eliminate motoneurons. Our findings indicate that sensory axons depend on a minimal scaffolding of motor fibers to correctly establish their trajectory, however very few fibers suffice to allow for sensory projections to form. The guidance receptor Npn-1 is expressed in LMC neurons at brachial and lumbar levels as well as in sensory neurons of the DRG and therefore presents itself as a plausible candidate to mediate these inter-axonal interactions. When we removed Npn-1 specifically from motoneurons, we found a dramatic defasciculation of motor axons in the plexus region and in the distal limb accompanied by a reduced extension into the distal limbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g003">3</xref>). The formation of the sensory trajectories, however, was unaffected with respect to fasciculation and localization of individual nerve branches. One possible explanation for this normal development is that the sensory neurons correctly present Npn-1 on the cell surface and Sema3A expressed in adjacent tissues efficiently promotes sensory axon fasciculation through a surround repulsion mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-TessierLavigne1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Huber1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Wright1">[29]</xref>. In addition, even though defasciculated, motor axons are still present in the proximal limb and might nonetheless facilitate sensory fiber growth through the plexus region by providing an aligned substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Landmesser1">[15]</xref>. Interestingly, while removal of Npn-1 from motoneurons leads to dramatic defasciculation of motor axons in the plexus and distal limb, motor fibers remain normally fasciculated in the segment of their trajectory preceding the plexus. Recently, it was shown that Drosophila axons in culture are intrinsically divided into two compartments and that the guidance receptors Derailed and ROBO2/3 are differentially localized to proximal and distal compartments, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Katsuki1">[30]</xref>. Diffusion barriers preventing the exchange of specifically localized membrane proteins have also been described in cultured mammalian neurons, prohibiting the exchange of membrane proteins between the somatodendritic and axonal compartments at the axon initial segment, and between the proximal and distal segments of the axon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Winckler1">[31]</xref>. The concept of diffusion barriers regulating the presence and/or concentration of cell surface molecules within defined segments of axonal trajectories is an attractive model to explain differential sensitivities to guidance cues of growing axons for various stages of development. It will be interesting to determine whether such diffusion barriers exist at specific choice points of the spinal motor projection, such as the base of the limb, and regulate Npn-1 localization preferentially to the distal motor axon shaft, hence controlling motor axon fasciculation within and beyond the plexus region.</p>
        <p>The defasciculation caused by removal of Npn-1 from motoneurons is also accompanied by defects in the selection of the dorsal-ventral trajectory after the plexus. Interestingly, this phenotype is less severe compared to dorsal-ventral pathfinding errors that were observed after complete interruption of Sema3-Npn-1 signaling by transgenic replacement of a mutated Npn-1 receptor that is incapable of Sema3 binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Imai1">[5]</xref>. A residual function might be maintained by non-quantitative Cre-mediated recombination at the <italic>Npn-1</italic> locus and a subset of motoneurons still expressing Npn-1. The wide scattering of motor axons in the plexus area likely interferes with the required interaction and disrupts the assembly of correct bundles of axons traveling to the same peripheral targets. Hence, pre-target axon sorting is hampered and the establishment of the topographic projections of lateral LMC axons to the dorsal limb and medial LMC axons to the ventral limb is impaired <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Imai1">[5]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Most of our analysis was done at early embryonic stages and thus raises the question of whether the defects in fasciculation that were induced by the removal of Npn-1 are transient or maintained into later developmental or even adult stages. While a previous study reported the correction of aberrant projections in embryonic <italic>Sema3A</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-White1">[32]</xref>, we found persistent defasciculation of intercostal nerves after removal of Npn-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s006">Figure S6</xref>) and in mice with non-functional binding of Sema3 to Npn-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Haupt1">[33]</xref> at least through E15.5. Unfortunately, due to poor reagent penetration and increasingly higher GFP background staining of the Hb9::eGFP line, an analysis of the deeper motor axons of the forelimb is not feasible at these late embryonic stages. However, anatomical, electrophysiological data and behavioral analysis of locomotor skills of adult <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants demonstrate that defects in motor connectivity persist (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Haupt1">[33]</xref>, Soellner and Huber, unpublished), suggesting that indeed mutant phenotypes are maintained at least to some degree.</p>

We found no obvious alterations in vasculature and DRG segmentation after <italic>Ht-PA-Cre</italic>-induced removal of Npn-1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s009">Figure S9</xref>). Also, both Schwann cell progenitors and boundary cap cells were clearly present and Schwann cells were found to migrate along defasciculated and normal fiber tracts in similar patterns in mutants and wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001020.s009">Figure S9</xref>). The total loss of Schwann cells, such as is the case in <italic>erbB2</italic> deficient mice, has been shown to cause defasciculation of the phrenic nerve in the diaphragm, suggesting that glial cells play a role in axon fasciculation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Lin1">[34]</xref>. The largely normal appearance of Schwann cells in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Ht-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants makes an effect of Schwann cells appear unlikely, although it cannot be completely excluded at this point. Our data on the defasciculation of motor axons after sensory-specific deletion of Npn-1 were corroborated by genetic elimination of sensory neurons through diphtheria toxin expression, which caused a similar defasciculation of motor fibers prior to the plexus. Particularly interesting is the observation that sensory axons lacking Npn-1 expression are leading motor fibers in their trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g008">Figures 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g009">9</xref>). This is a surprising result in light of elegant studies showing that in wildtype embryos, at least in the hindlimb later-born sensory axons lag behind motor fibers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Imai1">[5]</xref>. A possible explanation may be that Npn-1 presented on sensory fibers produces a tight coupling of sensory to leading motor axons. If Npn-1 is removed from sensory neurons, this “brake” is lifted, sensory axons can overtake motor fibers, and serve as pioneer axons for motor axons to follow. This is in agreement with our observation that sensory axons enter the limb slightly prematurely if Npn-1 is removed from sensory neurons. Complete abolishment of Sema3 binding to Npn-1 in all cells (<italic>Npn-1<sup>Sema</sup></italic><sup>−</sup>) or elimination of <italic>Sema3A</italic> leads to a qualitatively similar though considerably more intense phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Huber1">[10]</xref>, which might be explained by the residual expression of Npn-1 in sensory neurons in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Ht-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

(B) If <italic>Npn-1</italic> is ablated from motoneurons (<italic>Olig2-</italic> or <italic>Hb9-Cre</italic>), motor and sensory axons approach the plexus in normally fasciculated spinal nerves, however motor axons are defasciculated within the plexus. (C) If motoneurons are ablated by tissue-specific activation of the <italic>diphtheria toxin-A</italic> (<italic>DT-A</italic>) gene, only very few, very thin motor projections form at all, while sensory axons grow fasciculated, even though a bit delayed into the plexus region. (D) If Npn-1 is removed from sensory neurons (<italic>Ht-PA-Cre</italic>), sensory and motor axons fail to form properly fasciculated spinal nerves and are therefore defasciculated already before as well as within the plexus region. In addition, sensory neurons lead the spinal nerve projection. (E) If sensory neurons are ablated by tissue-specific DT-A expression, only very thin sensory projections are observed, while motor nerves that grow to the distal limb are defasciculated already before the plexus. (F) Schematic view of forelimb innervation after motor and sensory axons have navigated the plexus region (E11.5–E12.5). (G) If Npn-1 is removed from motoneurons (<italic>Olig2-</italic> or <italic>Hb9-Cre</italic>), motor nerves enter the limb heavily defasciculated, while sensory nerves grow fasciculated to appropriate distal positions. (H) If motor neurons are ablated by tissue-specific activation of <italic>DT-A</italic> (<italic>Olig2-Cre</italic>), sensory axons navigate the decision region of the plexus and show slight alterations in the patterning of their peripheral projections. (I) If Npn-1 is removed from sensory neurons (<italic>Ht-PA-Cre</italic>), both motor and sensory nerves arrive at the plexus in a defasciculated manner, and sensory nerves are heavily defasciculated in the distal limb, while motor projections show a milder defasciculation and grow in slightly inappropriate positions to each other. (J) If sensory neurons are ablated, motor nerves are disorganized and defasciculated before the plexus region as well as in the distal limb, thus showing a similar phenotype to <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;HT-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant embryos.

        </fig>
        <p>Alternatively, the inter-axonal, possibly ligand-independent adhesion emanating from sensory fibers together with Sema3A-mediated surround repulsion may be strong enough to force fasciculation of motor axons with sensory fibers. Upon loss of Npn-1 from sensory fibers, surround repulsion caused by Sema3A may no longer be sufficient to force motor axons into tightly coordinated bundles resulting in defasciculated motor trajectories in spite of Npn-1 still being present in motoneurons. The observation that the motor axon defasciculation phenotype observed upon the removal of Npn-1 from sensory axons is less pronounced than when Npn-1 is ablated from motoneurons supports this explanation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001020-g012">Figure 12</xref>). A third explanation might be provided by the neuronal co-expression of Sema3A and Npn-1. It has been shown that Sema3A in motoneurons regulates the level of sensitivity of their growth cones to exogenous Sema3A exposure in the distal limb of the developing chick embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Moret1">[35]</xref>. This fine-tuning of responsiveness is associated with a local control of the availability of the receptor at the growth cone surface. As Sema3A is also expressed in DRG neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Wright1">[29]</xref>, and sensory and motor axons grow in tight spatial vicinity, it is conceivable that Sema3A secreted from sensory growth cones is not only taken up by sensory but also by motor axons. If Npn-1 is removed from sensory neurons, motor growth cones should be confronted with an excess of Sema3A and in consequence will defasciculate, very similar to the phenotype observed when Sema3A is overexpressed in motoneurons by in ovo electroporation in chick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Moret1">[35]</xref>. Aside from class 3 semaphorins, additional, structurally diverse extracellular binding partners have been reported for Npn-1, for example different isoforms of vascular endothelial growth factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Geretti1">[36]</xref> or the cell adhesion molecule L1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Castellani1">[37]</xref>, which may also contribute to the formation of the sensory-motor circuitry.</p>
        <p>Intriguingly, the absence of Npn-1 from sensory axons is associated with defasciculation of both motor and sensory axons before, in, and beyond the plexus region in the distal limb. When the cell adhesion molecule L1 was neutralized by injection of function-blocking antibodies into the chick hindlimb at a stage where motor axons have already re-sorted into target-specific bundles, sensory axons chose slightly inappropriate pathways and decreased adhesion was detected ultrastructurally. The pathfinding of motor axons, however, was not affected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Honig1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Honig2">[39]</xref>. From this we conclude that sensory axons affect the fasciculation of motor axons <italic>before</italic> reaching the plexus and experimental defasciculation of sensory projections <italic>after</italic> motor axons have left this decision region has little or no effect on motor axon patterning. Most likely, a concerted effort of both axon-environmental and axon-axonal interactions is required to achieve the remarkable accuracy of limb innervation. While Sema3 ligands constitute the most probable environmental cues to interact with axonally expressed Npn-1, communication between axons might be mediated by Npn-1 homophilic, Npn-1-L1 complexes or even by Sema3A-Npn-1 interactions. A complex combination of molecular mechanisms of axon pathfinding has been reported in other systems including the zebrafish retinotectal projection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Pittman1">[28]</xref> and MMC motor axon projections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001020-Gallarda1">[14]</xref> and might reflect a general principle in the development of intricate neuronal circuits.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, the defasciculation of motor axons that we observed after deletion of Npn-1 in sensory neurons has no effect on the dorsal-ventral pathfinding decision to the limb mesenchyme. This might be due to the less severe degree of defasciculation when compared to the fasciculation defects induced by removal of Npn-1 from motoneurons. In the absence of any markers for dorsally or ventrally projecting sensory neurons, it can currently not be assessed whether sensory axons are still able to correctly navigate this choice point.</p>
        <p>Our findings reveal that inter-axonal communication has a pronounced influence on the layout of growth and fasciculation patterns of specific neuronal projections, whereby the spatial region of interaction in relation to important choice points seems to be of critical significance.</p>

The quantification of the defasciculation by summarizing the thicknesses of tibial and peroneal nerves (I) revealed increased defasciculation in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> (62.3±5.5 SEM, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> (100.1±9.7 SEM, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), and <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Ht-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> (41.1±4.9 SEM, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005) mutants when compared to wildtype littermates (17.7±0.8 SEM). Note that the higher thickness of hindlimb nerves in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> does not indicate a more severe degree of fasciculation, but rather a wider spread of defasciculated nerve branches. The distal advancement in the hindlimb was quantified by measuring the length of the most distal axon and normalizing this to the length of the hindlimb and was found unaltered if Npn-1 is removed from sensory or motor neurons (J). Also the distal advancement of motor innervation in forelimbs of <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Ht-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant embryos was unaffected (J). Quantification of sensory defasciculation in the hindlimb does not show differences in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Olig2-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> (L) and <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hb9-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> (M) mutant embryos when compared to littermate controls (K). The quantification in (O) shows a significant increase of defasciculated sensory innervation in <italic>Npn-1<sup>cond</sup></italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Ht-PA-Cre<sup>+</sup></italic> mutant embryos (N). <italic>n</italic> = 3 for all genotypes; both limbs were quantified.
