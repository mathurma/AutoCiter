Using a set of 11 yeast genomes we show that combining comparative genomics and secondary structure information greatly increases consensus-based prediction of SH3 targets. Benchmarking of our method against positive and negative standards gave 83% accuracy with 26% coverage. The concept of an optimal divergence time for effective comparative genomics studies was analyzed, demonstrating that genomes of species that diverged very recently from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> <italic>(S. mikatae, S. bayanus,</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus),</italic> or a long time ago <italic>(Neurospora crassa</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe),</italic> contain less information for accurate prediction of SH3 targets than species within the optimal divergence time proposed. We also show here that intrinsically disordered SH3 domain targets are more probable sites of interaction than equivalent sites within ordered regions. Our findings highlight several novel <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SH3 protein interactions, the value of selection of optimal divergence times in comparative genomics studies, and the importance of intrinsic disorder for protein interactions. Based on our results we propose novel roles for the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins Abp1p in endocytosis and Hse1p in endosome protein sorting.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>How can we tackle the complexity of a living cell? It is commonly said that living organisms are complex and display “emergent” properties. Emergence is perceived in this context as behaviors that appear at the system level but are not observable at the level of the system's components. In the cell this would be equivalent to saying that the cellular complexity could be explained if we could understand the interplay between the cellular components: that is, not just describe the “parts” that make up a cell but understand how they interact with each other to perform the necessary tasks.</p><p>A big step on the road to understanding cellular complexity will be a complete list of all relevant interactions between the cellular components. Although a lot of progress as been made in this direction, we are often dependent on experimental methods that are costly and time consuming. It's a big challenge for computational biology to process the current available knowledge and to propose new ways of predicting the interactions between cellular components.</p><p>Here the researchers studied protein interactions that are mediated by small linear peptide motifs,specifically interactions between a protein's SH3 domain and its targets, usually small peptide stretches containing a PXXP motif (where P is proline and X is any amino acid). The results showed that the putative target motifs that are conserved in ortholog proteins and are within regions that do not have a defined secondary structure are more likely to be relevant binding sites. Besides proposing a way to combine secondary structure information with comparative genomics to predict protein–protein interactions, the researchers highlight a possible role of intrinsically disordered proteins in SH3 protein interactions. The results also show that when looking for conservation of these motifs, it is important to carefully select the species used in the study: comparisons between species that have diverged to a certain extent—not too little and not too much—are the most informative.</p></sec></abstract><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>Citation:</meta-name><meta-value>Beltrao P, Serrano L (2005) Comparative genomics and disorder prediction identify biologically relevant SH3 protein interactions.

It as also been shown that it is possible to combine different experimental and functional data to predict protein interactions, especially when weighted using Bayesian networks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b12">12</xref>]. The accumulation of validated interactions can also be mined by interlog mapping in order to transfer protein interaction annotations across species [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b13">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b14">14</xref>].</p><p>The work described here deals with the prediction of protein interactions mediated by recognition modules that target small linear motifs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b16">16</xref>] and more specifically interactions involving SH3 domains. This type of asymmetric binding between globular domains and linear peptides was first reported in the work on Src kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b17">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b20">20</xref>], and many other domains have now been shown to have similar properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b15">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b16">16</xref>]. In a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b21">21</xref>], knowledge from phage display experiments was used to derive a position-specific scoring matrix (PSSM) for particular SH3 domains, which was then used to predict putative target ligands. Later, Tong et al. devised a strategy where two-hybrid screening and PSSM were combined to derive a high-confidence network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b22">22</xref>]. It was reasoned that an interaction identified by two-hybrid screening was more likely to be biologically relevant if the target protein had a high-scoring linear peptide according to the PSSM of the bait SH3 domain.</p><p>In this work we set out to obtain a high-confidence, biologically relevant protein interaction network, starting from the consensus information and using computational methods. The study showed that it is possible to greatly increase the accuracy of consensus-based predictions of protein–linear sequence interactions by taking into consideration the fact that biologically relevant target ligands of SH3 domains are more likely to be within disordered regions and conserved in orthologs. The method's performance was improved by selection of species within an optimal divergence time from the species of interest.</p><p>It has been proposed that intrinsic disorder may play a role in protein interactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b26">26</xref>], and there are documented cases where binding is coupled to folding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b27">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b28">28</xref>] (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b29">29</xref>]). It has also been observed that small linear motifs tend to accumulate in protein regions predicted to be intrinsically disordered [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b30">30</xref>] and that proline-rich regions are usually devoid of secondary structure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b31">31</xref>]. In most structures that we are aware of, the SH3 domain is in complex only with short target peptides, and not with full proteins. In all cases the ligands adopt a nonregular secondary structure, but there is little information one can take from these, in respect to the order/disorder of target sites in the context of the whole target protein. Although there is currently no experimental evidence to support that the SH3 domains preferentially bind to intrinsically disordered regions, the results presented here show that binding motifs within disordered protein regions are more likely to be biologically relevant binding sites than equivalent sites within ordered regions. We use the method developed to suggest novel SH3 interactions for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> and provide information about the binding sites within the target proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results/Discussion</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Identification and Conservation of SH3 Domains and Selection of Genomes</title><p>Using profile hidden Markov models (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010026-g001">Figure 1</xref>), all putative SH3 domains, and their key binding positions (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) were determined in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and in a set of thirteen yeast species: <italic>Candida glabrata, Debaryomyces hansenii, Kluyveromyces lactis, Yarrowia lipolytica</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b32">32</xref>], <italic>C. albicans</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b33">33</xref>], <italic>S. paradoxus, S. bayanus, S. mikatae</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b34">34</xref>], <italic>S. castellii, S. kudriavzevii,</italic> <italic>S. kluyveri</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b35">35</xref>], <italic>Neurospora crassa</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b36">36</xref>], and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b37">37</xref>].</p><fig id="pcbi-0010026-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010026.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Conservation Study of the SH3 Domains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> in Ten Other Yeast Genomes</title><p>CD, conserved domain (the SH3-containing protein has an ortholog and the ortholog SH3 domain is possibly conserved, i.e., less than three conservative changes and no nonconservative changes in the binding positions); DD, divergent domain (SH3-containing protein has an ortholog in this genome but the domain is not on the same branch of the phylogenetic tree); NO, no ortholog (no ortholog found for SH3-containing protein in a particular genome); PD, possibly divergent (SH3-containing protein has an ortholog in this genome but the ortholog SH3 domain has at least one nonconservative change in the binding positions or more than two conservative changes in the binding positions).</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0010026.g001" xlink:type="simple"/></fig><p>In <italic>S. castellii,</italic> <italic>S. kluyveri,</italic> and <italic>S. kudriavzevii,</italic> no orthologs for the majority of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SH3 domains could be identified (results not shown).

As a result of this, these three genomes were not included in our work.</p><p>The ortholog SH3 domains were split into three groups: conserved domain, possibly divergent (if the putative ortholog SH3 domain was in the same branch of the phylogenetic tree and had more than two conservative changes in the binding positions; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>), or divergent domain (if the putative ortholog SH3 domain was not in the same branch of the phylogenetic tree) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010026-g001">Figure 1</xref>). As expected, the percentage of conserved domains was higher in genomes of species that had diverged recently from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p><p>Intuitively we can expect that there will be an optimal divergence time for the species used in a particular comparative genomic study. In recently diverged species, most protein sequence is conserved and the statistical power for comparative genomics of biological features is therefore smaller. Interspecies conservation becomes less meaningful in a background of low evolutionary divergence. On the other hand, finding a conserved consensus in a very divergent genome might be more significant but only if there was no major change in the specificity of the domain. This change will be more probable the more divergent the species is from the species of interest.</p><p>To test the improvement of consensus-based predictions with a comparative genomics approach, an initial set of genomes was chosen based on the conservation analysis of the SH3 domains across the different yeast species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010026-g001">Figure 1</xref>). <italic>N. crassa</italic> and <italic>Sch. pombe</italic> were excluded because the SH3 domains in these two species might be too divergent to observe conservation of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> motifs. Very close relatives <italic>(S. paradoxus, S. bayanus,</italic> and <italic>S. mikatae)</italic> were excluded as these species would have lower statistical power. Therefore, the first group analyzed consisted of five yeast genomes that broadly covered the hemiascomycete phylum, containing the four recently reported genomes of <italic>C. glabrata, D. hansenii, K. lactis,</italic> and <italic>Y. lipolytica</italic> that we grouped with the <italic>C. albicans</italic> genome.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Evaluation of the “Conservation” Approach</title><p>To evaluate the predictive power of our method, two positive datasets, containing experimentally verified SH3–linear peptide interactions, and one negative dataset, containing noninteracting protein pairs were defined (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). The binding motifs of the SH3 domains of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> included in the two sets of positive standards (15 SH3 domains in the gold set and ten in the platinum set) were taken from the data published by Tong et al.

This alignment was then used to determine the level of conservation of putative target ligand sites by searching for sequences matching the same consensus sequence in the orthologs. We did not search for conservation of putative target motifs in genomes without an ortholog for the domain under consideration. If there is no ortholog SH3 domain in the comparing species then the conservation of the motif in the ortholog of the putative target is not biologically relevant and should not be counted to increase our confidence in the putative interaction. Having said this, it should be noted that there could be several technical reasons why the ortholog of an SH3 domain could be missed in a genome. There might be errors in the genome assembly, genome annotations, domain annotation, or ortholog assignment. Thus, we also tried to calculate conservation scores without disregarding genomes with no ortholog for the domain under consideration. While this did not change the results significantly (data not shown), we felt that the first approach was more stringent.</p><p>In the orthologs, the search was restricted to a window surrounding the putative target ligand in the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> sequence, and we called this the probing region. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010026-g002">Figure 2</xref>, accuracy versus coverage for increasing probing regions is plotted, and it can be seen that by searching in a wider region of the alignment both coverage and accuracy are increased, especially for higher conservation scores (the complete analysis with the number of hits and false and true positives for each positive set is given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010026-st001">Table S1</xref>). Optimal results were obtained using a probing region of 210 alignment positions. It is important to emphasize that these were not necessarily amino acids, but 100 gaps or amino acids on each side of a motif of ten amino acids. This result could be due to poor alignment of some proteins, especially those rich in proline sequences. In fact most of the gain in coverage was due to interactions with proline-rich proteins that were difficult to align and had multiple gaps (i.e., Las17p, App1p, and Vrp1p). Also, these data may suggest that these small target ligands may be easily moved in primary sequence space during evolution, owing to compensatory mutations in proteins that are already proline-rich in nature. For both sets of positives a big improvement in accuracy was observed when we selected for consensus sequence conserved in the five genomes used (3.8-fold increase with the gold positives and 3.3-fold increase with the platinum positives). There was, however, a similar fold reduction in the coverage, 3-fold for the gold and 4.3-fold for the platinum set.</p><p>Since most known target proteins in the SH3 interaction network are proline-rich and a large probing window was used, it is possible that the hits found in orthologs were due to chance and lacked biological meaning. To eliminate this possibility two “decoy” proline-rich patterns were analyzed: PXXXPXXXP and EXXPXXP (where X is any amino acid), different from the consensus sequences. Both patterns were found with high frequency (&gt;400 hits) on <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> proteins. Using these two patterns, a loss in accuracy and coverage was observed (an average of 1.4 times less accuracy and 1.2 times less coverage for the PXXXPXXXP motif and an average of 3.4 times less accuracy and 2.5 times less coverage for the EXXPXXP motif). Thus, we can rule out the possibility that the results were generated by chance and can confirm that the observed phenomenon was the conservation of specific SH3 binding motifs and not of proline-rich tracks.</p><p>However, the accuracy obtained with conservation alone was still poor (using the gold set, accuracy = 46% and coverage = 31%, and using the platinum set, accuracy = 30% and coverage = 16%). A hypergeometric test allowed us to say that that the improvement in both positive sets and for all conservation scores was significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) and not due to random sampling.</p></sec><sec id="s2c"><title>Combining Comparative Genomics and Disorder Prediction</title><p>Since SH3 domains generally bind linear amino acid stretches, we tried to improve the accuracy of our consensus-based method by extracting secondary structure information about the sequences containing the target motifs. It has been argued that there might be biological advantages in presenting binding sites within unstructured regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b23">23</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b26">26</xref>].

To our knowledge there is no clear experimental evidence to support that SH3 domain target sites are generally unstructured before binding, but since SH3 domains bind small linear peptide motifs that are proline-rich, we hypothesized that SH3 domain targets might be mainly found in unstructured regions of the polypeptide chain. Therefore we used GlobPlot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b30">30</xref>] in combination with coil-region predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b40">40</xref>] to identify and study all consensus sequences found within disordered protein regions.</p><p>Combining disorder prediction with comparative genomics resulted in a significant (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.01, using a hypergeometric test) increase in the accuracy of protein target prediction (there was a 2-fold average increase in both sets) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0010026-g003">Figure 3</xref>). The decrease in coverage was 1.4-fold for the gold and 1.1-fold for the platinum set. For consensus sequence conserved in five or more genomes, we obtained 94% accuracy with 28% coverage for the gold set.

[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b22">22</xref>], the method was able to predict 20 interactions when restricting for consensus sequences within disorder and found in four of the five genomes used. We tried to look for distinguishing features within these 20 interactions, compared to the remaining 39 that the method did not predict. There were no statistical differences in the average size of protein targets (<italic>p =</italic> 0.32 with a <italic>t</italic>-test), average proline content of protein targets (<italic>p =</italic> 0.12 with a <italic>t</italic>-test), usage of Class II motif (<italic>p =</italic> 0.21 with a hypergeometric distribution test), or conservation of SH3 domain (<italic>p =</italic> 0.82 with a <italic>t-</italic>test). There was a statistically significant difference in the average conservation of the target proteins (<italic>p =</italic> 0.03 with a <italic>t</italic>-test). The protein targets the method was able to predict were on average conserved in 8.7 of the ten species, while the targets not recovered were conserved in 7.6 species. This small but significant difference highlights the bias this method has for conserved interactions. A higher level of confidence can be placed in any putative target motif found conserved in most yeast species analyzed, but this level of conservation will only happen for essential interactions. It is important to note that for this reason this method will always miss species-specific protein interactions. However, adding more genomes of species within an appropriate divergence time should alleviate this problem, a concept discussed in more detail below. Another possible cause of loss in coverage could be interactions that are mediated by currently uncharacterized motifs or through noncanonical SH3 binding (i.e., through globular regions of the target protein).</p><p>As shown by other authors (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b41">41</xref>]), it should be possible to further improve the reliably of a protein interaction network, and therefore our method, by adding information from other sources of data (i.e., RNA expression, and essentiality and function information). This is especially true if the information is efficiently combined, e.g., employing a Bayesian network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b12">12</xref>]. It was our intention to develop a method that could be used in species where these sources of information were not available, but in the future we will try to develop weighting schemes to include such sources for prediction of interactions mediated by small linear motifs.</p></sec><sec id="s2d"><title>Determining an Optimal Divergence Time for the Genomes Used When Searching for Conservation of Target Ligands of SH3 Domains</title><p>Included in our initial hypothesis was the notion that there might be an optimal time of divergence to efficiently use the comparative genomics approach.

The model showed that, at close evolutionary distances, the number of comparative genomes needed to obtain the same statistical power increases. The model also suggests that the decline in statistical power for divergence times above optimal is smaller than for divergence times below optimal. In general our results support some of the proposals made by this model. According to the model it should be possible to obtain a high accuracy with closely divergent species but it would be necessary to use considerably more genomes at that distance. The author suggests that, for example, for human/baboon distances it would be necessary to use about seven times more genomes than at human/mouse distance to obtain the same statistical strength. For future work, we are therefore considering extending our method to include a weighing scheme based on the evolutionary distance between the comparing species and the target species. We think this could be achieved using an adaptation of the theoretical model proposed by Eddy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b44">44</xref>].</p><p>It would be also interesting to study how many genomes would suffice to accurately predict an SH3 target interaction. Since the decrease in statistical power for <italic>Sch. pombe</italic> and <italic>N. crassa</italic> is small compared to species closely related to <italic>S. cerevisiae,</italic> we calculated the accuracy and coverage after addition of one or two of these species, to the five species selected previously, for different conservation scores. In general, an increase in coverage with little or no decrease in accuracy was observed (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0010026-st003">Table S3</xref>). Addition of any of the closely related species, instead of <italic>N. crassa</italic> or <italic>Sch. pombe,</italic> resulted in a large loss of accuracy with moderate gain in coverage (results not shown). We believe that the improvement gained by adding species within the optimal divergence time would be better than that observed with <italic>N. crassa</italic> and <italic>Sch. pombe</italic>. The result generated with the latter two species suggests only that a sufficient number of genomes was not reached, since addition of more genomes still improved our scores. However, at present there are not enough genomes available to empirically tackle this question of a sufficient number of genomes for SH3 target prediction.</p><p>We believe the main factor determining the optimum divergence time is the conservation level of the biological feature. A biological feature that has higher conservation will require genomes of more divergent species to be accurately identified. Interaction types that are equally conserved should be accurately predicted with genomes of species at the same divergence times. This might mean that the same genomes could be used to predict interactions for other protein domains that bind small linear peptides (i.e., PDZ, WW, SH2, 14–3–3). Other interaction types that are mediated by larger interaction surfaces are probably more conserved and therefore might require genomes from more divergent species.</p><p>Although some results [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b34">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b35">35</xref>] have shown the importance of having genomes of recently divergent species in the study of DNA regulatory regions, recent findings [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b45">45</xref>] have shown that regulatory systems can be conserved over hundreds of millions of years.

Of the 32 remaining predictions, eight might not be possible since the putative interaction partners are annotated as having different cellular compartments, although in some cases a link between the two compartments could be possible (see below for some examples). Benchmarking with the gold positive and negative sets resulted in an accuracy of 73% and coverage of 37%.

An interesting example is the proposed interaction between Abp1p with the P-type ATPases Dnf1p and Dnf2p. These proteins are required for phospholipid translocation and they mainly localize to the plasma membrane and intercellular compartments. The regulation of the lipid bilayer arrangement by Dnf1p and Dnf2p was demonstrated to be critical for budding endocytic vesicles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b47">47</xref>]. It is also known that Abp1p is one of the activators of the Arp2/3 complex and is important in coupling the actin and membrane dynamics during endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b48">48</xref>]. Following from the proposed interaction seen using our method, we suggest that Abp1p might target Dnf1p and Dnf2p to sites of endocytosis to play a role in endocytic vesicle formation or maintenance.</p><p>In order to calculate accuracy and coverage scores, we initially considered as “negative” interactions between proteins that did not share the same cellular compartment. After having obtained our list of predicted interactions, we decided to investigate them without disregarding these “negative” interactions. This decision was made because the negative set is based in part on high-throughput measurements that do not take into account the dynamics of cellular localization. Two proteins might not share a compartment in a given cellular condition, but this might change in different cellular states (examples in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> include cell cycle, pheromone response, and filamentous growth). This reasoning actually leads us to think that the localization data on proteins are underevaluated and, if anything, will result in an underestimation of our accuracy scores.</p><p>Within our set of final predictions, Hse1p-mediated interactions are examples of those occurring between proteins marked as belonging to different compartments. According to our results the SH3 domain of Hse1p has a high probability of binding to proline-rich regions of Ste20p, Bck1p, and Las17p. Hse1p was recently reported to be part of a complex that binds ubiquitin and is important in sorting proteins in the endosome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b49">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b50">50</xref>]. Knowing that both Ste20p and Bck1p are involved in the response to mating and that Hse1p is involved in the trafficking/sorting of the alpha-factor pheromone receptor, these SH3 domain interactions might be part of the sorting mechanism of the alpha receptor in the multivesicular bodies. Activated alpha-factor pheromone receptors recruit Ste20p by the dissociation of Gβγ subunits (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b51">51</xref>]). There is some evidence that Ste20p activation can lead to the phosphorylation of Bck1p in the mating response [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b52">52</xref>]. Activated mating receptors are internalized after phosphorylation and ubiquitination of their carboxy-terminal tails and are targeted to the vacuole for degradation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0010026-b53">53</xref>]. We propose that these internalized vesicles are decorated with complexes containing Ste20p, Bck1p, and Las17p and that the interaction of the SH3 domains of Hse1p with these proteins might be important in the sorting of internalized mating receptors.</p></sec><sec id="s2f"><title>Conclusion</title><p>We present here a method to predict biologically relevant protein interactions mediated by peptide recognition modules. Conservation of target linear peptides and analysis of protein disorder can be effectively combined to screen for biologically relevant interactions that are predicted from binding matrixes obtained from experimental data.
