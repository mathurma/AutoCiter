<abstract>
<p>Sexual dimorphisms in body size are widespread throughout the animal kingdom but their underlying mechanisms are not well characterized. Most models for how sex chromosome genes specify size dimorphism have emphasized the importance of gonadal hormones and cell-autonomous influences in mammals versus strictly cell-autonomous mechanisms in <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>. Here, we use tissue-specific genetics to investigate how sexual size dimorphism (SSD) is established in <italic>Drosophila</italic>. We find that the larger body size characteristic of <italic>Drosophila</italic> females is established very early in larval development via an increase in the growth rate per unit of body mass. We demonstrate that the female sex determination gene, <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> (<italic>Sxl</italic>), functions in central nervous system (CNS) neurons as part of a relay that specifies the early sex-specific growth trajectories of larval but not imaginal tissues. Neuronal Sxl acts additively in 2 neuronal subpopulations, one of which corresponds to 7 median neurosecretory cells: the insulin-producing cells (IPCs). Surprisingly, however, male-female differences in the production of insulin-like peptides (Ilps) from the IPCs do not appear to be involved in establishing SSD in early larvae, although they may play a later role. These findings support a relay model in which Sxl in neurons and Sxl in local tissues act together to specify the female-specific growth of the larval body. They also reveal that, even though the sex determination pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals are different, they both modulate body growth via a combination of tissue-autonomous and nonautonomous inputs.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Males and females differ in size in many animal species. This reflects differences in body growth during development that are under the control of sex chromosome genes. In mammals, sex chromosome genes act in the gonads to instruct them to produce secreted hormones that regulate male-female differences in body growth. In contrast, in the fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, it has long been thought that the larger body size of females does not involve secreted hormones but instead depends upon the local action of the sex determination gene <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> in every cell of the body. We now show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> females grow faster than males during the early phase of larval development. Surprisingly, the early increased growth of the female body depends upon <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> expression in 2 groups of neurons in the brain, one of which is known to be neurosecretory. These findings indicate that <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> not only functions locally to regulate the growth of the cells in which it is expressed but that it also acts more globally via secreted factors that remotely control the growth of many different tissues. <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian sex chromosome genes, although different, may therefore regulate body growth in a more similar way than was previously thought.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The sex of an organism has profound effects on its morphology, physiology, and behaviour. It also influences the risk of developing diseases of growth and metabolism such as obesity, metabolic syndrome, cardiovascular disease, and cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref002">2</xref>]. One important feature of sexual dimorphism is the difference in body size between males and females, called sexual size dimorphism (SSD). SSD is widespread and rapidly evolving across the animal kingdom such that, depending upon the species, the larger sex can either be male or female [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref003">3</xref>]. It is not yet clear, however, which mechanisms link the chromosomal sex of an organism to specific male and female patterns of growth during development and thus ultimately to adult SSD.</p>
<p>In mammals, the presence or absence of a single gene on the male Y chromosome (<italic>Sry</italic>) determines gonad differentiation into male testis or female ovary, respectively. The gonads then establish a sex-specific hormonal milieu that controls male and female differentiation, patterns of growth, and metabolism [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref005">5</xref>]. However, recent studies in mice now demonstrate that the cellular (i.e., chromosomal) sex of nongonadal tissues can also influence growth and metabolism, an effect that is thought to be modified by the action of gonadal hormones [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref006">6</xref>]. Hence, although many details remain to be explored, it is likely in mammals that patterns of growth relevant to SSD are controlled via both hormonal and cell-autonomous mechanisms.</p>
<p>The fruit fly <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> has provided insights into many aspects of sexual dimorphism. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, sex determination is based on X chromosome dosage, with XX individuals developing as females and XY individuals as males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref008">8</xref>]. At the early embryonic stage, the presence of 2 X chromosomes in females activates the expression of sex determination gene <italic>Sex-lethal</italic> (<italic>Sxl</italic>), which is thereafter maintained via positive autoregulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref011">11</xref>]. <italic>Sxl</italic> controls the splicing of multiple downstream targets regulating sexual differentiation as well as X chromosome dosage compensation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref012">12</xref>]. A commonly held view is that <italic>Drosophila</italic>, unlike mammals, deploys sex determination genes in a strictly cell-autonomous manner such that they are required in every somatic cell that is sexually dimorphic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref014">14</xref>]. Nevertheless, there are hints that non-cell-autonomous mechanisms regulate at least some aspects of sexual dimorphism. For example, in adult flies, ecdysone and juvenile hormone can act like sex hormones to regulate reproduction and sexual identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>SSD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is present at larval, pupal, and adult stages, with females approximately 30% larger than males [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref018">18</xref>]. <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae are composed of 2 types of tissues: polyploid larval-specific organs that are histolysed during pupation and diploid imaginal tissues, which are the precursors of adult structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref019">19</xref>]. Polyploid tissues comprise the bulk of the larva such that body SSD measured at larval stages reflects their growth rather than that of imaginal tissues. In contrast, body SSD measured at the adult stage reflects the larval/pupal growth of imaginal tissues. SSD appears to be present in most tissues and may be a result of differences in both cell size and number [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref022">22</xref>, and this study]. Signalling pathways important for body growth, such as the insulin/insulin-like growth factor (IGF) and target of rapamycin (Tor) network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref023">23</xref>], are likely to be relevant for SSD but precisely how sex modulates them remains unclear. In terms of sex determination genes, SSD was long thought to be dependent upon <italic>Sxl</italic> but not on one of its key downstream target genes, <italic>transformer</italic> (<italic>tra</italic>), which specifies other aspects of sexual dimorphism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref024">24</xref>]. This was challenged recently by a report that <italic>tra</italic> contributes to SSD, although there is also likely to be a <italic>tra</italic>-independent mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>]. The same study also reported that <italic>tra</italic> not only exerts autonomous effects on cell size but also acts in the female fat body to stimulate the secretion of insulin-like peptides (Ilps) from the brain, which in turn promotes larger body size in females.</p>
<p>Here, we investigate the link between sex determination genes and SSD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> using cell type–specific genetic manipulations and size measurements of both larval and imaginal tissues. We find, surprisingly, that <italic>Sxl</italic> controls SSD by acting in specific subsets of female neurons to increase body growth during larval development. At this stage, neuronal Sxl functions selectively to increase the growth rate of larval but not imaginal tissues. This study reveals that the sex of specific neurons regulates SSD in a non-cell-autonomous manner.</p>

<title>SSD is established in L2 without sex-specific systemic Ilp signalling or food intake</title>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo hatches into a larva that develops through 3 instars (L1 to L3), feeding voraciously and increasing its body mass by 2 orders of magnitude. It then enters a long nonfeeding pupal phase, which ends with eclosion of the adult fly. Final body size in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and in other animals is determined by the initial larval size, the growth rate, and the growth period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref026">26</xref>]. To understand when SSD first arises during development and which of the 3 parameters contribute to it, we compared the growth curves of male and female larvae. Weighing larvae individually or in small groups at precise times after hatching revealed that the initial sizes of L1 males and females are similar and that SSD only first becomes detectable during L2, thereafter increasing until the female-to-male mass ratio of L3 larvae approaches approximately 1.3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g001">Fig 1A–1E</xref>). Plots of larval mass or of absolute growth rate against time show that the total periods of larval growth in males and females are very similar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g001">Fig 1A and 1F</xref>). In contrast, both the absolute growth rate and the mass-specific growth rate (fold growth rate, i.e., growth rate per unit mass) are higher in females than in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g001">Fig 1F and 1G</xref>). Interestingly, sex differences in mass-specific growth rate are greatest during L2, suggesting that mechanisms operating at this stage may make a large contribution towards driving apart the body sizes of males and females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Together, these results indicate that SSD is established during L2 and involves a higher growth rate in females than in males.</p>

<p>The insulin/IGF family of hormones are known to play a key role in regulating the growth rate in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and other animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref028">28</xref>]. Insulin/IGF signalling has also been implicated in SSD in both mammals and <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref029">29</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, systemic Ilps are secreted by 7 median neurosecretory cells of the pars intercerebralis, known as insulin-producing cells (IPCs), which are functionally analogous to mammalian pancreatic β cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref030">30</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref032">32</xref>]. It has been reported that the retention of insulin-like peptide 2 (Ilp2) in IPCs, which is thought to inversely correlate with insulin secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref033">33</xref>], is lower in females than in males, and this difference has been suggested to enable increased female growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>]. However, the Ilp2 measurements in this previous study were made at the late L3 stage, long after we have found that SSD is established. We therefore measured Ilp2 retention in IPCs at the earlier stages of mid-L2 and early L3 but were unable to detect any significant difference between males and females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). At these early larval stages, we were also unable to detect any significant female increase in 2 key readouts of insulin/IGF-1-like signalling: phosphorylated Akt levels in whole larvae and nuclear exclusion of forkhead box, sub-group O (FoxO) protein in fat body cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). Hence, it is unlikely that larval SSD is established by sex-specific differences in the levels of systemic Ilp signalling (at the level of Akt phosphorylation or FoxO nuclear localisation).</p>
<p>We next examined whether the observed sex differences in larval growth rate were associated with food intake. We focused on measuring larval food intake at the early L2 and early L3 stages, when sex differences in growth rate are maximal. We found that the absolute food intake was higher for females than males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). If higher food intake in females drives their increased growth rate, then females would be predicted to have a higher food intake than males per unit of body mass. However, we were unable to detect any significant male-female difference in food intake per unit of body mass (mass-specific food intake) at either early L2 or early L3 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). We cannot rule out that very small differences in mass-specific food intake do exist between males and females but are hard to detect. Nevertheless, these results suggest that sex differences in absolute food intake are a consequence of preexisting body size differences rather than the driving force that establishes SSD.</p>

<p>To understand in which tissues Sxl acts to control SSD, we switched the sex of individual organs from female to male by expressing <italic>upstream activation sequence (UAS)-Sxl RNAi</italic> with tissue-specific Gal4 drivers. Previous work implicated the sex of the fat body in SSD, mediated via the <italic>transformer (tra)</italic> branch of the sex determination pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>]. Surprisingly, we observed that fat body–specific RNAi knockdowns of <italic>tra</italic> or its partner <italic>transformer 2</italic> (<italic>tra2</italic>) or even <italic>Sxl</italic> only led at best to minor reductions in female body size and SSD, quantified by the female/male body mass ratio (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). We next knocked down <italic>Sxl</italic> in 2 larval cell types whose adult counterparts are known to have sexually dimorphic functions, the midgut enterocytes and the oenocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref036">36</xref>], but this gave no significant alterations in larval SSD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Strikingly, however, using a pan-neuronal Gal4 driver (<italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>-Gal4</italic>) to knock down <italic>Sxl</italic> with either of 2 UAS-RNAi lines (<italic>UAS-Sxl RNAi 1</italic> or <italic>UAS-Sxl RNAi 2</italic>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>) led to a strong and specific decrease in the body size of females, completely abrogating SSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). In the reciprocal experiment, nervous system–specific expression of a <italic>UAS-Sxl</italic> mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref024">24</xref>] (driven by <italic>Insc-Gal4</italic>) was sufficient to rescue significantly the larval body size of <italic>Sxl</italic> mutant females, although not as efficiently as with <italic>Sxl</italic><sup><italic>+tCa</italic></sup>, a complete copy of the <italic>Sxl</italic> gene containing its own regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Together, these experiments indicate that neural <italic>Sxl</italic> activity is both necessary and, at least in part, sufficient for larval SSD. Tracking the growth of <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> (elavc155-Gal4; UAS-Sxl RNAi) female larvae throughout L2 revealed that they grow at the same rate as males (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Thus, neuronal Sxl is required for the establishment of larval body SSD as well as for its subsequent maintenance. Interestingly, <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>-Gal4</italic> driven RNAi for <italic>tra</italic> or overexpression of <italic>TraF</italic>, the female-specific <italic>tra</italic> splice variant, had little or no significant effect upon larval SSD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Furthermore, although the body mass of <italic>Sxl</italic> mutant females was rescued significantly by <italic>Insc-Gal4</italic>–mediated expression of Sxl, this was not the case for TraF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). This provides evidence that neural Sxl regulates larval SSD largely independently of its characterised downstream target, <italic>tra</italic>.</p>

<p>An important function of Sxl is to repress at the translational level the expression of <italic>msl-2</italic>. <italic>msl-2</italic> is required in males for X chromosome dosage compensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). This raises the possibility that inappropriate dosage compensation due to neural up-regulation of Msl-2 in <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> females might produce “sickness” effects that inhibit larval growth. However, 3 lines of evidence rule out this possibility. First, we showed that the growth trajectory of <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> females precisely matches that of control males, making it unlikely that this is due to a nonspecific sickness effect on growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Second, we find that neural <italic>msl-2</italic> knockdown in <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi + msl-2 RNAi</italic> females does not decrease the strength of the <italic>Sxl</italic> knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In this context, <italic>msl-2</italic> knockdown efficiently blocks up-regulation of Msl-2 and a marker of X chromosome dosage compensation (histone H4 lys16 [H4K16] acetylation) but, importantly, it does not rescue body mass (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g003">3E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g004">4A and 4B</xref>). And third, neural misexpression of Msl-2 (<italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;msl-2</italic>::<italic>HA</italic>) in females does not decrease body mass, yet it does induce neuronal H4K16 acetylation to a level at least as high as that observed in <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> females (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g003">3F</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g004">4B</xref>). Hence, inappropriate neural expression of the Msl-2 dosage compensation pathway does not account for the masculinization of body growth observed in <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> females. Together, the results thus far demonstrate that Sxl acts in the female nervous system to regulate larval body SSD in a non-cell-autonomous manner.</p>

<title>Larval SSD requires Sxl in IPCs and in Gad1-Gal4 neurons</title>

<p>Given that we did not find sex differences in insulin signalling during larval SSD establishment, it is intriguing that our Gal4 screen for SSD neurons identified <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic>, which is expressed in IPCs. However, <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic> is also weakly expressed in some neurons of the ventral nerve cord (VNC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref038">38</xref>]. To pinpoint whether IPC or VNC neurons are relevant for SSD, the Gal4 activity of <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic> was inhibited specifically in IPCs by driving the expression of <italic>LexAop-Gal80</italic> using <italic>Ilp2-lexA</italic>, which is not expressed in VNC neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s010">S10 Fig</xref>). This combined Gal4/LexA manipulation restored Sxl expression specifically in IPCs and also rescued the SSD of <italic>Ilp2&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> larvae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s011">S11 Fig</xref>). We also carried out a reciprocal experiment, restoring Sxl in VNC neurons but not in IPCs using <italic>tsh-Gal80</italic>, which efficiently suppresses Gal4 driver activity in the VNC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s012">S12A Fig</xref>). However, this did not rescue the SSD of larvae expressing <italic>Sxl RNAi</italic> under the control of <italic>Ilp215-1-Gal4</italic>, a driver expressed in both IPCs and VNC neurons (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s010">S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s012">S12B</xref> Figs). Together, these 2 experiments provide important controls demonstrating that Sxl acts in IPCs to promote SSD.</p>
<p>We next investigated the surprising finding that, despite a clear role for the IPCs, insulin signalling itself does not seem to be involved in larval body SSD. To override any potential sex differences in the transcription of endogenous Ilps that might not have been detected, Ilp2 or Ilp5 were specifically overexpressed within IPCs but neither manipulation affected SSD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s013">S13A Fig</xref>). In addition, PI3-kinase activity was blocked specifically in IPCs (<italic>Ilp2+Ilp5&gt;p60</italic>), which decreases larval body size probably via down-regulation of Ilp production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref040">40</xref>], but this also failed to decrease SSD significantly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s013">S13B Fig</xref>). Furthermore, there is little or no change in larval SSD following loss of Ilp2 activity (<italic>Ilp2</italic><sup><italic>1</italic></sup> mutants) or deletion of all Ilps normally expressed in IPCs (<italic>Df(Ilp1-5)</italic> mutants), even though the body size of both sexes is strongly decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s013">S13D Fig</xref>). Surprisingly, therefore, the role of IPCs in larval body SSD is dependent upon the activity of <italic>Sxl</italic> but apparently not Ilps.</p>
<p>Unlike <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic>, the other Gal4 drivers that gave a hit in our SSD screen are each expressed in large subpopulations of neurons. The effects of <italic>dimm</italic><sup><italic>c929</italic></sup><italic>-Gal4</italic>, <italic>amon</italic><sup><italic>386Y</italic></sup><italic>-Gal4</italic>, and <italic>VGAT-Gal4</italic> are all likely to involve their expression overlapping in IPCs ([<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref041">41</xref>] and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s014">S14A and S14B Fig</xref>). Consistent with but not proving this, blockade of Gal4 activity throughout a large neural domain that does not contain the IPCs, the VNC (using <italic>tsh-Gal80</italic>), does not suppress the ability of <italic>VGAT-Gal4</italic> or <italic>amon</italic><sup><italic>386Y</italic></sup><italic>-Gal4</italic> to decrease SSD when driving Sxl RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s012">S12B Fig</xref>). Another driver hit in our SSD screen is <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic> and this is not expressed in IPCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s014">S14B Fig</xref>). This finding and the observation that neither <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic> nor IPC drivers decrease female-specific body size as completely as pan-neuronal drivers suggested that Sxl could be required additively in 2 distinct subpopulations of neurons. To test this, <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic> and <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic> drivers were combined to knock down Sxl in both subsets of neurons, and this gave a stronger decrease in female body size than was observed with either driver alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). The combination of <italic>Ilp2-Gal4</italic> and <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic> decreases SSD strongly to a value approaching that obtained with pan-neuronal drivers (<italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>-Gal4</italic> or <italic>Insc-Gal4</italic>). We therefore conclude that Sxl acts additively in at least 2 distinct neural subsets, IPCs and <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic> neurons, to control larval SSD via a novel mechanism that does not require Ilp regulation.</p>

<title>Different mechanisms regulate SSD in larval and imaginal tissues</title>
<p>The finding that neuronal Sxl regulates female larval body size appears to be at odds with the widely held view that somatic sex determination in <italic>Drosophila</italic> is a cell-autonomous process. Early evidence for the cell autonomy of sexual dimorphism, including SSD, came from studies of gynandromorphs, mostly XX/XO mosaic adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref042">42</xref>]. However, the external adult structures that were the focus of the gynandromorph study are derived from diploid imaginal cells, not the polyploid cells that constitute the bulk of the larval body mass measured in our experiments. We therefore compared the cell-autonomous requirements of sex determination genes for SSD of the wing disc versus the fat body, i.e., a diploid imaginal versus a polyploid larval tissue, respectively. In a control genetic background, both the wing disc and the fat body are clearly larger in females than males by the end of larval development (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g006">Fig 6B and 6C</xref>). Manipulating sex determination genes in the pouch region of the imaginal wing disc (using <italic>nubbin-Gal4</italic>), we observed sex-biased changes in the size of the pouch relative to the whole wing disc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s015">S15A Fig</xref>). Measuring the female to male ratio of this parameter revealed modest reductions in wing pouch SSD with <italic>Sxl RNAi</italic>, <italic>tra RNAi</italic>, or TraF overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s015">S15B Fig</xref>). Similarly, expressing <italic>Sxl RNAi</italic> or <italic>tra RNAi</italic> in larval fat body cells (using Flp-out clones, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>), gave small reductions in the nuclear diameter of female but not male fat body cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s015">S15C Fig</xref>). These findings are broadly similar to those in a published study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>] and together indicate that sex determination genes make a cell-autonomous contribution to the SSD of both larval and imaginal tissues. However, for the larval fat body, we note that Sxl/tra cannot significantly increase cell size in an autonomous manner in 2 different contexts lacking neuronal Sxl function: males misexpressing TraF in fat body clones and <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> females (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s015">S15C Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g006">Fig 6B</xref>).</p>

<p>We next compared the non-cell-autonomous requirement of neuronal Sxl for SSD in imaginal versus larval tissues. Remarkably, the larger size of the female wing imaginal disc remains unaffected in <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> larvae, despite the decreased body mass and fat body nuclear size typical of males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g006">Fig 6A–6C</xref>). Thus, neuronal <italic>Sxl</italic> activity is not required for the SSD of a developing imaginal tissue, in contrast to that of a developing larval tissue. However, examination of adult <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155&gt;</italic></sup><italic>Sxl RNAi</italic> flies revealed a significant strong decrease but not a complete loss of SSD for body mass and for wing area (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g006">Fig 6D–6F</xref>). Together with our previous results, this shows that neuronal <italic>Sxl</italic> activity is not required for the SSD of developing imaginal tissues during larval stages but, during subsequent pupal stages, it does contribute to the final SSD of adult body structures. Interestingly, we also noticed differences in the role of insulin signalling for the SSD of larval versus imaginal tissues. Hence, a genetic manipulation that decreases Ilp production from IPCs (<italic>Ilp2+Ilp215-3&gt;p60</italic>) reduces absolute body size in both sexes without altering larval body SSD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s013">S13B Fig</xref>). In contrast, the same manipulation reduces the size of the wing imaginal disc from female but not male larvae and, strikingly, this completely abolishes wing disc SSD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s013">S13C Fig</xref>). Furthermore, knockdown of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> insulin receptor (InR) in the wing disc pouch (<italic>nubbin&gt;InR RNAi</italic>) not only reduced wing pouch size relative to the whole wing disc in both male and female larvae but it also decreased wing pouch SSD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s015">S15A and S15B Fig</xref>). These results together raise the possibility that Sxl may boost female-specific imaginal but not larval tissue growth, at least in part by increasing its sensitivity to systemic Ilps.</p>
<p>Overall, we conclude that, during larval development, different mechanisms control the sex-specific growth of larval versus imaginal tissues. In the final adult, SSD is a collective function of neuronal <italic>Sxl</italic> that has acted in a non-cell-autonomous manner on larval tissues as well as <italic>Sxl</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> functioning in a cell-autonomous fashion in both larval and imaginal tissues.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>This study uncovers the existence of a new physiological mode of action for sex determination genes in the specification of <italic>Drosophila</italic> body size. It demonstrates that the female sex determination gene <italic>Sxl</italic> acts in specific groups of neurons as a remote stimulator of body growth. It also shows that the sex determination machinery utilizes different mechanisms for regulating the size of the larval versus the adult body morphs. A key conclusion here is that Sxl acts in neurons to control primarily the growth of the larval morph. We now discuss the implications of these findings, how they support a new neuronal relay model for SSD, and how they reveal that mechanisms of sexual differentiation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals may be more similar than previously thought.</p>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Larval SSD is established early and without sex-specific insulin signalling</title>
<p>We found that sex-specific body sizes are established after embryogenesis but early during larval development. SSD is manifested as a higher growth rate in female than male larvae, with a maximal difference occurring during L2 and early L3. Previous SSD studies focused later in development, after critical weight (CW), a key checkpoint in L3 that can influence final body size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>]. The study by Testa et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref018">18</xref>] showed that females are larger as they attain a higher CW and then a higher absolute growth rate during subsequent larval development (the terminal growth period). Our data are consistent with this but also reveal that the establishment of different growth patterns in females and males involves an early divergence of mass-specific growth rates (mass gain per h per mg of body mass) in L2, well before CW. After SSD has been established in L2/early L3, it is subsequently maintained as larger female larvae gain more absolute mass per hour than smaller males, although both sexes now have very similar mass-specific growth rates.</p>
<p>The insulin signalling pathway is a major stimulator of larval growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and it has been reported that IPC secretion of Ilp2 and InR signalling are both higher in females than in males at the L3 stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>]. However, at earlier stages relevant for the establishment of SSD, we were unable to detect any male-female differences in Ilp2 secretion or in insulin signalling. Furthermore, larvae with decreased Ilp production from IPCs or larvae lacking all 3 of the Ilp genes normally expressed in the IPCs are smaller but still retain larval body SSD. Thus, insulin signalling is required for maximal larval growth in both males and females but it does not appear to be a sex-specific regulator of larval SSD. Interestingly, however, SSD of the developing wing disc is decreased by InR knockdown or decreased insulin production from IPCs. Thus, although insulin signalling may not contribute to the SSD of larval tissues, it does regulate that of imaginal tissues. Higher insulin signalling in female imaginal tissues could be driven by local Sxl/tra dependent modulation of insulin sensitivity and perhaps from mid/late L3 stages by increased Ilp production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>]. Very recently, it was reported that another key growth regulator, Myc, is more highly expressed in female than in male larvae and so may contribute to SSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref043">43</xref>]. Sex differences in <italic>myc</italic> transcript expression may be the result of this X-linked gene escaping complete dosage compensation rather than via direct Sxl regulation. Interestingly, we find that the higher expression of <italic>myc</italic> characteristic of females is fully maintained in <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi</italic> larvae, even though they are masculinised in terms of larval growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002252.s015">S15 Fig</xref>). This indicates that a sex difference in global <italic>myc</italic> levels is not sufficient to confer SSD. It remains possible, however, that <italic>myc</italic> in neurons or in another tissue has a role in SSD, potentially downstream of neuronal Sxl.</p>

<title>Sxl acts in IPCs and Gad1-Gal4 neurons to control larval SSD</title>
<p>A central finding of this study is that Sxl is required in the CNS to direct the female-specific growth trajectory of the larval body. By mapping the site of action of Sxl in the CNS using a panel of Gal4 drivers, we were able show that it functions additively in 2 nonoverlapping populations of neurons within the CNS: <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic> neurons and IPCs. For the <italic>Gad1-Gal4</italic> neurons, it remains to be determined whether GABA<sup>+</sup> or GABA<sup>-</sup> subsets are relevant for SSD and whether or not they functionally interconnect with IPCs in the larval CNS. Nevertheless, it has been reported for the adult CNS that some GABAergic neurons converge on IPCs, which express the metabotropic GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor and may respond to GABA by decreasing Ilp secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref045">45</xref>]. Importantly, our study also mapped another critical site of action for Sxl to the IPCs, a cluster of only 7 peptidergic neurons. This finding, together with the evidence that sex-specific IPC secretion of Ilps is unlikely to establish SSD, suggests that 1 or more of the numerous other neuropeptides/secreted factors expressed in larval IPCs may be relevant [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref046">46</xref>].</p>
<p>We found that neuronal Sxl appears to regulate SSD largely independently of its best-characterised downstream targets, <italic>tra</italic> and <italic>msl-2</italic>. The lack of a major neuronal <italic>tra</italic> input in SSD makes it unlikely that there is a role for its neuronal target <italic>fruitless</italic>, which regulates many aspects of sex-specific behaviour in adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref048">48</xref>]. In addition, sex-specific isoforms of Fruitless have not been detected until the late L3 stage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref049">49</xref>], long after SSD has been established. New direct Sxl targets have been identified in recent years in several biological contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref050">50</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref054">54</xref>] and future approaches targeting the early larval nervous system may reveal how neuronal Sxl controls SSD. Importantly, whatever the Sxl targets in neurons relevant for SSD turn out to be, our results clearly demonstrate that Sxl acts in a remote manner to regulate peripheral tissue growth and overall body size. Identification of the complete remote-control pathway is beyond the scope of our study but, in principle, it could involve the neural secretion of a hormone-like signal and/or innervation of peripheral organ(s) that regulate growth.</p>

<title>A neuronal relay model for the control of sex-specific growth in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
<p>A previous report implicated the Sxl target <italic>tra</italic> acting in the fat body as an important non-cell-autonomous regulator of female body size [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>]. Our study, however, finds that the genetic requirement for <italic>Sxl</italic> in body size is stronger in neurons (likely acting without <italic>tra</italic>) than it is in the fat body (acting with <italic>tra</italic>). Not all of the conclusions made in the 2 studies are easily reconcilable, but we note that the previous report used body size readouts that were adult mass or estimated pupal volume, whereas we measured larval body mass during L2 and L3. It nevertheless remains possible that Sxl can act in both neurons and fat body to regulate overall body SSD in a non-tissue-autonomous manner. Perhaps the relative contributions of each site of Sxl expression depend upon diet or other factors that varied between the 2 studies. Either way, our finding that restoration of Sxl expression specifically in neurons is sufficient to increase the body size of <italic>Sxl</italic> mutant females demonstrates that the neuronal relay mechanism is functional without Sxl in the fat body.</p>
<p>We now discuss the evidence supporting a neuronal relay model for SSD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g007">Fig 7</xref>). Central to this model is the finding that Sxl in neurons is required to relay a signal for female body size to peripheral larval tissues. Thus, loss of Sxl in neurons abolishes SSD by decreasing the larval body mass of females to that of males. Conversely, neuronal Sxl expression is sufficient for substantial rescue of female body size in <italic>Sxl</italic> mutant larvae. Neuronal <italic>Sxl</italic> knockdown decreases SSD in larvae at the level of individual polyploid larval tissues such as the fat body, but, surprisingly, this does not appear to be the case for the diploid wing imaginal disc. Nevertheless, after completion of pupal development, neuronal <italic>Sxl</italic> depletion does eventually lead to decreased SSD of the adult wings as well as the adult body. So, how can we account for why the neuronal Sxl input affects imaginal tissue SSD at adult but not larval stages? One possible explanation is that neuronal Sxl functions during pupal stages to nonautonomously regulate imaginal tissue growth. Alternative explanations involve neuronal Sxl acting during larval stages to specify pupal resources/signals that themselves regulate the SSD of adult body structures. For example, nutrient resources laid down in larval tissues can be mobilized by the process of histolysis during the pupal period [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref055">55</xref>]. Hence, the greater mass of the female larva may be needed to sustain the greater final size of the female adult. An important feature of our relay model for SSD is that the Sxl-dependant signal from neurons is integrated with local <italic>Sxl/tra</italic> inputs in both larval and imaginal tissues. Evidence for these tissue-autonomous <italic>Sxl/tra</italic> growth inputs comes from previous studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref042">42</xref>] as well as our own finding that <italic>Sxl</italic> and <italic>tra</italic> activities in the larval fat body and wing imaginal disc contribute towards the increased size characteristic of these female tissues. We also found that Sxl and Tra were unable to increase fat body cell size in a cell-autonomous manner significantly in males or in females lacking neuronal Sxl. Hence, larval tissue-autonomous <italic>Sxl/TraF</italic> activity may only be able to boost growth efficiently in the presence of the Sxl-dependent signal from neurons. We therefore propose in our model that <italic>Sxl</italic> activity in neurons and in local tissues acts together to maximize female tissue growth.</p>

<title>Parallels between the control of SSD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals</title>
<p>A widely held textbook view is that somatic sexual dimorphism is regulated very differently in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals: the former in a cell-autonomous manner, the latter by gonad-derived hormones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref014">14</xref>]. However, our discovery that the brain remotely regulates SSD in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may have its counterpart in mammals. Thus, mammalian gonadal sex steroids are thought to act on neurons in the hypothalamus to regulate growth hormone secretion from the anterior pituitary gland [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref029">29</xref>]. Male-female differences in the levels and patterns of circulating growth hormone are thought to induce sex-specific insulin-like growth factor 1 (IGF-1) profiles, in turn conferring dimorphic growth patterns [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref056">56</xref>]. Growth hormone itself does not appear to be conserved in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, but it is interesting that the pars intercerebralis of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> brain, harbouring the IPCs, has been likened to the mammalian hypothalamus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref057">57</xref>]. Furthermore, IPCs send projections to the ring gland, which has been likened to the pituitary gland in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref057">57</xref>]. In a second parallel, our findings together with several studies in mammals [reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref058">58</xref>] suggest that primary sex determination signals act via a combination of cell-autonomous and non-cell-autonomous mechanisms to control overall SSD. For example, in human and other mammalian embryos, sex differences in body size are noticeable before gonad differentiation, suggesting the existence of gonadal sex hormone–independent mechanisms of SSD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref060">60</xref>]. Moreover, an XX rather than an XY chromosome complement in mice can increase adult body mass by approximately 7%, independently of gonadal sex, and this difference can be strongly enhanced by gonadectomy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref061">61</xref>]. In conclusion, the upstream sex determination pathways in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals are very different but the regulatory logic of how they regulate body growth via both cell-autonomous and remote mechanisms appears to be more similar than previously thought.</p>

<title>Body mass measurements</title>
<p>Embryos were collected on grape juice-agar plates supplemented with yeast paste at 25°C. Larvae were then synchronised at L1 hatching and transferred onto 2× yeast food at fixed density. For all Gal4/UAS experiments, larvae were grown at 29°C until wL3 stage, washed in PBS, and weighed individually or in groups on a Satorious MSE3.6P microbalance. Ilp mutants were grown at 25°C until wL3. For the time course of larval growth, larvae were synchronised over 1–2 h at L1 hatching in batches at several intervals. All larvae were grown at 25°C and larvae were floated in 30% glycerol/PBS to measure body mass at relevant stages. For L1 larvae, males and females were transferred by pipetting onto droplets of PBS on grape juice-agar plates, and the liquid was then taken off and evaporated. Dry larvae were accumulated on the tip of a forceps, and the group of larvae was dropped into a weighing boat containing olive oil and resting on the tared microbalance. To promote adult survival of <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi 1</italic> females for experiments in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002252.g006">Fig 6</xref>, experimental and control animals were reared at 18°C during pupal stages, resulting in approximately 20% survival for <italic>elav</italic><sup><italic>c155</italic></sup><italic>&gt;Sxl RNAi 1</italic> females at 1–2 d posteclosion.

<title>Food intake measurements</title>
<p>Larvae were synchronised at the L1/L2 or L2/L3 molt. To begin the food intake assay, groups of larvae were transferred by forceps directly from 2× yeast into 2× yeast + 1.5% erioglaucine disodium salt (SIGMA) within 3 minutes. After 20 minutes (L2 assay) or 25 minutes (L3 assay) from the first larva being transferred, larvae were floated in 30% glycerol, transferred into PBS, sorted into males and females, and weighed in groups before being ground up in PBS (20uL/mg of larval mass) using a tissue grinder and stored at -20C until quantification. As a blank control, larvae feeding on 2× yeast were processed in the same way. To generate a standard curve, 2× yeast + 1.5% erioglaucine disodium salt was dissolved in PBS at a known concentration (w/v) and a serial dilution was created. For quantification, all samples were centrifuged 1 minute at 12,000 g. Absorbance at 625 nm was measured in triplicate from the soluble fraction (avoiding top layer of lipid) using a NanoDrop 2000. Mean absorbance in the blank samples was subtracted from all experimental samples.</p>

<title>Immunostaining and confocal microscopy</title>
<p>Larvae were inverted and fixed in 2% PFA in PBL (75 mM lysine, 37 mM sodium phosphate buffer [pH 7.4]) for 45 minutes at RT. For immunostainings against Ilp2 and dFoxo, larvae were removed from food one at a time, dissected, and transferred to PFA solution immediately. For anti-Ac-H4K16 stainings, larvae were fixed for 20 minutes in 4% PFA in PBS. After fixation, samples were washed in PBS and dissected further, if necessary. Samples were blocked in 10% normal goat serum (NGS) in PBS + 0.2% Triton (PBT). Primary antibodies and secondary antibodies were diluted in 10% NGS in PBT; washes were carried out in PBT. DAPI was added during primary or secondary antibody incubations. For FB stainings, the final wash was carried out overnight at 4°C to reduce DAPI cytoplasmic background staining. Primary antibodies used: rabbit anti-Ilp2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref033">33</xref>] at 1:800, rabbit anti-dFoxo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002252.ref077">77</xref>] at 1:500, mouse anti-Sxl (M18 supernatant, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 1:100, mouse anti-Elav (9F8A9 supernatant, Developmental Studies Hybridoma Bank) at 1:100, rabbit anti-Histone Ac-H4K16 (Active motif #39167) at 1:300, rabbit anti-Msl-2 (d-300) (Santa Cruz sc66969) at 1:50, rabbit anti-GABA (Sigma #A2052) at 1:1,000. All samples were mounted in Vectashield. For volume measurements, samples were mounted in a well generated by 1 or 2 layers of magic tape (Scotch) or a reinforcement ring (Avery) to avoid compression. All samples were imaged on a Leica SP5 upright microscope in oil. Samples for direct quantitative comparison were imaged on the same day using the same settings. Volume measurements were carried out using Volocity v6 software. Fat body nuclear diameters were measured manually using Fiji software, measuring mean diameter value of up to 10 nuclei per fat body. Ilp2 fluorescence intensity in IPCs was quantified on sum intensity projections of IPC clusters in Fiji software as the product of mean intensity x area of a manually selected region comprising the IPC cell bodies. Values for both IPC clusters were averaged for each brain. Quantification of Foxo nuclear and cytoplasmic localisation in the fat body was performed on Z-stacks of confocal images in Volocity v6 software. Nuclei were segmented using the DAPI channel followed by measurement of mean Foxo signal intensity in nuclei. Cytoplasm was segmented based on Foxo signal followed by subtraction of the nuclei, and mean Foxo signal intensity in the cytoplasm was determined. Ratio of mean nuclear to mean cytoplasmic Foxo signal was calculated for each fat body. A control experiment in which female larvae were starved for 4 h prior to fixation resulted in a 2.9-fold increase in the Foxo nuclear:cytoplasmic ratio, demonstrating the validity of our protocol.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>To prepare whole body lysates, groups of larvae were homogenised in cold lysis buffer (50 mM Tris pH 7.5, 250 mM NaCl, 5 mM EDTA, 0.5% NP-40, 50 mM NaF) + protease/phosphatase inhibitor tablet (Pierce #88669) at a ratio of 20 μL per mg of larval material. Homogenates were centrifuged for 15 minutes at 4°C to pellet insoluble material. The supernatant was resuspended in Laemmli sample buffer and boiled for 3 min at 95°C. Proteins were separated on 4%–15% NuPage gels (Invitron) in MOPS under reducing conditions and transferred onto nitrocellulose using standard procedures. Primary antibodies (mouse anti-tubulin [abcam ab44928]), rabbit anti-Akt (Cell Signalling #4691S), and rabbit anti-pAkt (Cell Signalling #4054S) were detected with fluorescent secondary antibodies (LI-COR) on a LI-COR Odyssey scanner.

<title>Restoration of Sxl in IPCs rescues the SSD phenotype of Ilp2&gt;Sxl RNAi larvae.</title>
<p>(A-C) Single confocal sections through clusters of IPCs from female larvae, immunostained for Sxl and Ilp2 (to mark IPCs), with DNA stained by DAPI (blue). Sxl in the nuclei of IPCs is strongly expressed in control females (A) but absent in those of Ilp2-Gal4&gt;UAS-Sxl RNAi 1 larvae (B). Driving Gal80 (which blocks Gal4 activity) specifically in the IPCs of Ilp2-Gal4&gt;Sxl RNAi 1 female larvae using the LexAOP system (Ilp2-lexA::VP16&gt;lexAOP-Gal80) restores Sxl expression in the IPCs either fully (C) or partially (C’). Scale bar: 10mm. (D) Sxl expression is restored in all seven IPCs of ~80% of the female larvae carrying Ilp2-Gal4&gt;UAS-Sxl RNAi + Ilp2-lexA::VP16&gt;lexAOP-Gal80 (same genotype as C). (E) Restoration of Sxl expression in the IPCs of Ilp2&gt;Sxl RNAi larvae (same genotype as in C and D) rescues the female to male (F:M) body mass ratio (SSD) of wandering L3 larvae.

<p>(A) IPC overexpression of UAS-Ilp2 or UAS-Ilp5 using a combination of Ilp2-GAL4 + Ilp215-3-Gal4 has no effect on body size or SSD. (B) IPC inhibition of PI3K signalling (UAS-p60 driven by Ilp2-GAL4 + Ilp215-3-Gal4) reduces body size in both males and females but it does not decrease larval body SSD.

<title>Cell-autonomous SSD contributions of Sxl and tra in the wing imaginal disc and larval fat body.</title>
<p>(A-B) nubbin-Gal4 driving expression of UAS-Sxl RNAi 1, UAS-tra RNAi 1, UAS-TraF or UAS-InR RNAi decreases the SSD of the wing pouch. Gal4-expressing cells in the wing pouch were marked by UAS-RFP. To measure cell-autonomous effects, the mean ratios and SEMs of the volumes of the wing pouch (expressing nubbin-Gal4) were normalised to the volumes of the whole wing disc (A), although normalization to only the non-pouch region of the disc gives similar results. Note that Sxl and Tra depletion specifically reduce female wing pouch volume, whereas TraF overexpression specifically increases male wing pouch volume. Insulin receptor (InR) knockdown reduces wing pouch sizes in both males and females but the effect is stronger in females. The corresponding mean and SEMs for female to male (F:M) ratios of wing pouch volumes normalised to whole wing disc volumes are also shown (B). Note that for this type of F:M ratio, control genotypes have a value of ~1.0 and that the values of less than 1.0 seen with all three genetic manipulations indicate decreased wing pouch SSD. (C) Decreased nuclear diameter of fat body cells expressing UAS-Sxl RNAi 1 or UAS-tra RNAi 1 but not UAS-TraF. Fat body clones were generated with hsFlp; actin5C&gt;CD2&gt;Gal4 and marked with UAS-nls::GFP. Graph plots the mean ratios of the nuclear diameter (a proxy for cell size) of GFP+/GFP- fat body cells. Each data point shows the mean ratio from one clone and error bars indicate the SD. Sxl and Tra knockdown decrease nuclear diameter in the fat body of females, whereas TraF overexpression has no effect on nuclear diameter in the fat body of either sex.
