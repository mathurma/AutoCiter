        <p>Reciprocal chromosomal translocations (RCTs) leading to the formation of fusion genes are important drivers of hematological cancers. Although the general requirements for breakage and fusion are fairly well understood, quantitative support for a general mechanism of RCT formation is still lacking. The aim of this paper is to analyze available high-throughput datasets with computational and robust statistical methods, in order to identify genomic hallmarks of translocation partner genes (TPGs). Our results show that fusion genes are generally overexpressed due to increased promoter activity of 5′ TPGs and to more stable 3′-UTR regions of 3′ TPGs. Furthermore, expression profiling of 5′ TPGs and of interaction partners of 3′ TPGs indicates that these features can help to explain tissue specificity of hematological translocations. Analysis of protein domains retained in fusion proteins shows that the co-occurrence of specific domain combinations is non-random and that distinct functional classes of fusion proteins tend to be associated with different components of the gene fusion network. This indicates that the configuration of fusion proteins plays an important role in determining which 5′ and 3′ TPGs will combine in specific fusion genes. It is generally accepted that chromosomal proximity in the nucleus can explain the specific pairing of 5′ and 3′ TPGS and the recurrence of hematological translocations. Using recently available data for chromosomal contact probabilities (Hi-C) we show that TPGs are preferentially located in early replicated regions and occupy distinct clusters in the nucleus. However, our data suggest that, in general, nuclear position of TPGs in hematological cancers explains neither TPG pairing nor clinical frequency. Taken together, our results support a model in which genomic features related to regulation of expression and replication timing determine the set of candidate genes more likely to be translocated in hematological tissues, with functional constraints being responsible for specific gene combinations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A common genetic lesion leading to hematological cancer is the creation of fusion genes as a result of reciprocal translocations between chromosomes. Such translocations are non-random, in the sense that certain genes are more likely to be fused than others, and they appear to be tissue-specific. Current models tend to explain the non-random nature of chromosomal translocations suggesting that chromosome breaks are favored at certain sites and that the distance between genes in the nucleus determines the probability of their being fused together. In this work we have analyzed several genomic features in a large collection of genes involved in chromosomal translocations in hematological cancers, using robust computational methods. Our findings suggest that nuclear distance is a general pre-requisite but does not determine the specific combinations of genes fused together. We find that genomic features related to transcription and replication, together with constraints derived from the functional domains present in the proteins encoded by fusion genes, better explain which genes participate in specific chromosomal translocations and the tissue types in which they are found. The association of such genomic features with the position occupied by genes in the nucleus explains the apparent causal role attributed to spatial position.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Chromosomal translocations are genomic rearrangements in which reciprocal exchange of genetic material between two non-homologous chromosomes results in the formation of novel fusion genes. Some of these fusion genes display oncogenic properties and have a strong impact on cancer progression and prognosis, particularly in hematological malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Mitelman1">[1]</xref>. Therefore, several hundred translocations have been described in hematological cancers, although recent reports support their emerging role also in solid tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Nambiar1">[2]</xref>. However, whether the fusion gene resulting from a reciprocal chromosomal translocation (RCT) is a driver of tumor progression or just a passenger event is not yet fully understood in all cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Rowley1">[3]</xref>. Common and important features of RCTs were reviewed recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Rabbitts1">[4]</xref>, but to the best of our knowledge a thorough and extensive data-mining study has not yet been performed.</p>
      <p>A fairly comprehensive catalog of genes involved in RCTs is available in public manually-curated databases. Mitelman Database of Chromosome Aberrations and Gene Fusions in Cancer provides extensive documentation of clinical cases, making possible the estimation of clinical frequencies of translocations. TICdb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Novo1">[5]</xref>, on the other hand, provides manually curated mapped translocation breakpoints, allowing analysis of the sequences flanking those breakpoints. Several such analyses have been performed over the last years, highlighting the association of various sequence motifs with the presence of double-strand breaks (DSB) in some types of translocations. Current consensus about the general requirements for breakage and fusion is that an increased frequency of DSBs at particular genomic locations, together with close spatial proximity of certain loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Parada1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Roix1">[7]</xref>, determine the probability of some RCTs and why some combinations of translocation partner genes (TPGs) are more likely to occur (for a review, see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Lin1">[8]</xref>). However, quantitative support for this as a general mechanism applicable to oncogenic RCTs in general is still lacking.</p>
      <p>The aim of this paper is to characterize the genomic hallmarks of TPGs using computational and statistical analyses of available clinical and high-throughput datasets. We focus on hematological malignancies, as they constitute the largest set of well-documented RCTs described to date. In this study we have made use of a large collection of data sources. We have used gene expression data for various tissues obtained from publicly available datasets, as well as multiple genomic features from the human genome assembly, to analyze TPG expression and regulation. For the analysis of fusion protein functions we have used InterPro domain features, gene ontology annotations and a recently available protein-protein interaction dataset. We have also used recent high-throughput data on spatial and temporal architecture of the nucleus to search for potential characteristic features of TPGs.</p>
      <p>While the mechanisms that could potentially lead to RCT formation are well-studied, it is now emerging that oncogene selection during tumorigenesis could be the decisive factor for RCT appearance in tumors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Gostissa1">[9]</xref>. Thus the logic of this study is to try to explain RCT occurrence from the point of view of functional selection.</p>
      <p>First, we compare various features of TPGs with non-translocated genes and find statistical support for some characteristic properties of TPGs related to expression levels and regulation of transcription. We also address the issue of non-random TPG pairing in RCTs, examining issues like nuclear distance, the types of protein domains retained in fusion proteins or replication time. We try to explain some open questions in the field, such as why RCTs are tissue-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Mitelman2">[10]</xref> and why they drive oncogenesis in specific lineages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Forster1">[11]</xref>. Finally we address the recurrence of RTCs and their clinical frequencies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Mitelman1">[1]</xref>. Taken together, our data, robustly supported by quantitative methods, provide new insights into the global features shared by TPGs and afford a unified explanation of the mechanisms responsible for the specificity and recurrence of RCTs.</p>

        <title>Expression and regulation of expression of 5′ and 3′ TPGs</title>
        <p>Most hematological 5′ and 3′ TPGs are specifically involved in hematological translocations, with only a few of them translocated in other tissue types (10% and 4% for 5′ and 3′ TPGs respectively, according to TICdb). In an attempt to explain this fact, we first analyzed the expression of all TPGs in normal tissues. Expression of both 5′ and 3′ TPGs is significantly higher than average gene expression (all RefSeq genes), but only 5′TPGs (not 3′ TPGs) are more highly expressed than hematopoietic-specific genes in hematological tissues (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Analysis of gene expression in other tissue types revealed that 5′ TPGs, but not 3′ TPGs, are more highly expressed in tissues of hematopoietic origin than in tissues of epithelial or mesenchymal origin (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This is true for around 65% of 5′ TPGs. Likewise, when we compared the expression of 5′ TPGs with their corresponding 3′ TPGs we found that 5′ TPGs generally have higher expression levels (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This was robustly replicated in data from various tissues of hematopoietic lineage and in different microarray datasets for almost 70% of translocations checked. Moreover, we studied lineage-specificity by analyzing expression of 5′ TPGs involved in translocations reported in lymphoid (HEM-L, 177 translocations) and in myeloid (HEM-M, 201 translocations) malignancies. Their expression levels in two cell lines of lymphoid and myeloid origin (GM128 and K562, respectively) confirmed a lineage-specific pattern (only 5′ TPGs in HEM-L show higher expression in GM128 compared to K562), as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g001">Figure 1D</xref>.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In order to reveal possible mechanisms for such expression differences we analyzed a number of genomic features of TPGs using available tracks from UCSC Genome Browser. Analysis of promoter features in several cell lines suggests that the difference in expression of 5′ and 3′ TPGs could be explained by promoter activity. First, trimethylation of H3K4, which is a marker of active promoters, is higher for 5′ TPGs than for 3′ TPGs in cell lines of hematopoietic origin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Likewise, we calculated the probability of observing Polymerase II (Pol2) binding in the promoter region of TPGs (−3 kb/+3 kb) as the ratio of cell lines in which a Pol2 peak is found. Normalized Pol2 frequency (ratios were normalized to zero mean and unit standard deviation for all RefSeq genes) was significantly higher in cell lines of hematopoietic origin than in non-hematopoietic for 5′ TPGs, but not for 3′ TPGs. Moreover, Pol2 binding probability was higher in promoters of 5′ TPGs than in 3′ TPGs in hematopoietic cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These findings suggest that tissue-specific expression of 5′ TPGs could be explained by more active transcription in hematopoietic cells, regardless of other issues such as mRNA stability.</p>

        <p>Since 3′ TPGs contribute their 3′-UTR to fusion transcripts, they could also have an impact on expression levels of fusion genes because 3′-UTRs are known to have a regulatory role in mRNA stability and half-life. For instance, it has been shown that genes more tightly regulated have longer 3′-UTRs with more regulatory elements in them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Berezikov1">[12]</xref>. We explored this by comparing several features of 3′-UTRs of TPGs. We observed that 3′ TPGs have significantly shorter 3′-UTRs than 5′ TPGs. Moreover, there were fewer conserved elements and microRNA target sites in 3′-UTRs of 3′ TPGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g003">Figure 3</xref>). MicroRNAs are known to be major players in post-transcriptional regulation, frequently playing the role of tumor-suppressors by inhibiting expression of proto-oncogenes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Vasilatou1">[13]</xref>. All this indicates that 3′ TPGs might also play a role in changing the regulation of expression of oncogenic fusion genes.</p>

        <p>We have previously shown that the complex network of TPGs involved in RCTs can be decomposed into a simpler network of protein domain combinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-OrtizdeMendbil1">[14]</xref>, indicating that selection for certain domain combinations is a powerful mechanism driving preferential pairing of TPGs. To further explore this issue, we analyzed the number of domains and protein interaction interfaces (PIIs) that are retained or lost in fusion proteins upon translocation (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details about extraction of domains and PIIs). While proteins encoded by 3′ TPGs retain significantly more domains and PIIs than they lose, the opposite is true for proteins encoded by 5′ TPGs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g004">Figure 4</xref>, panels A and B). In fact, quite a few proteins encoded by 5′ TPGs contained no domains at all, or contained domains that were difficult to associate with oncogenic functions, suggesting that the major role of 5′ TPGs is transcriptional up-regulation of fusion genes rather than contributing specific protein domains to fusion proteins.</p>

        <p>In order to define this more strictly, we classified protein domains according to their functional ontologies. The details of this manually curated classification procedure are described in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and the lists of annotated domains and their classes are given in supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s009">Table S1</xref>. Type 1 domain classes include DNA-binding (<bold><italic>D</italic></bold>), protein interaction (<bold><italic>P</italic></bold>), kinase (<bold><italic>K</italic></bold>) and histone modification domains (<bold><italic>H</italic></bold>), whereas type 2 domains comprise other types of domains not involved in oncogenesis and domains with unknown function (<bold><italic>O</italic></bold>), as well as protein parts without recognizable domains (<bold><italic>N</italic></bold>). Total numbers of retained domains of each class are presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g004">Figure 4C</xref>, which shows that <bold><italic>K</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>H</italic></bold> domains are almost absent in 5′ TPGs, whereas <bold><italic>D</italic></bold> and <bold><italic>P</italic></bold> domains are the most frequent in both 5′ and 3′ TPGs. Likewise, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g005">Figure 5</xref> shows that the occurrence of type 1 and 2 domains in 5′ TPGs and 3′ TPGs from the same translocation are strongly dependent, with significant under-representation of type 2-type 2 domain co-occurrences (in agreement with their limited oncogenic potential). Using permutations with a Benjamini-Hochberg FDR cutoff of 10% we discovered 13 over- and 8 under-represented domain class pairs in hematological translocations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Most over-represented pairs of domain classes are in agreement with known mechanisms of oncogenicity of fusion proteins described in the literature (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further explore the non-randomness of domain co-occurrence in translocations for more complex sets than domain pairs, we performed clusterization of fusion protein functional profiles, defined as binary strings where each bit indicates whether a TPG retained at least one domain of a certain class. Clusterization using an expectation-maximization algorithm with cross-validation yielded an estimate of n = 6 clusters, with four clusters (C0, C2, C3 and C4) containing fusions with “regulation of transcription” signature and the other two (C1 and C5) having a “kinase” signature. Notably, small clusters C2 and C5 include only true chimeric proteins in which both TPGs have similar functions. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g006">Figure 6A</xref> shows the resulting cluster profiles and counts. We then overlaid these clusters onto the network of fusion genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; for each translocation, edge color indicates the cluster to which it belongs). This shows that clusters tend to be restricted to non-overlapping sets of hubs and that events where the same gene belongs to translocations of both “regulation of transcription” and “kinase” clusters are extremely rare.</p>

        <p>To investigate the role of TPGs containing only type 2 domains we analyzed their predicted impact on the expression of their corresponding fusion genes. As shown above, 5′ TPGS are characterized by higher expression levels whereas 3′ TPGs are characterized by shorter 3′-UTRs. Thus, we computed the relative difference of expression between 5′ TPGs and 3′ TPGs from different translocations based on the presence of type 1 or type 2 domains in 5′ TPGs. Similarly, we calculated the decrease in length of the 3′-UTR of fusion proteins in translocations with 3′ TPGs containing or lacking type 1 domains. In both cases, we found evidence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g007">Figure 7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s002">Figure S2</xref>) that TPGs without type 1 domains can lead to overexpression of the fusion gene (in the case of 5′ TPGS) or improved stability of its mRNA (for 3′ TPGs).</p>

        <p>As mentioned above, expression levels of 3′ TPGs could not explain why most of them are translocated exclusively in hematological tissues. To explore other possible ways in which 3′ TPGs could contribute to tissue-specificity, we identified all protein interaction interfaces (PII) in proteins encoded by 3′ TPGs, and extracted data about the proteins that interact with those PIIs. With this information we built a network of interactions between PIIs in 3′ TPGs and their interaction partners, shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g008">Figure 8A</xref> (the network for 5′ TPGs is shown in supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This network has a complex structure with many self-interactions and overlaps between interaction partners of different TPGs, many of which comprise large hubs. We then calculated the expression of these interaction partners in several tissues in the same expression datasets that we had used before. Interestingly, expression levels of interaction partners of 3′ TPGs were, on average, significantly higher in hematopoietic than in epithelial or mesenchymal tissues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g008">Figure 8B</xref> and supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Likewise, 84% of 3′ TPG interaction partners are highly expressed in hematopoietic stem cells from bone marrow and 70% to 80% of them are highly expressed in various peripheral blood cells, according to annotations in DAVID database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Huang1">[15]</xref> (GNF_U133A_QUARTILE used, these percentages are significant with Benjamini-corrected P-values less than 0.05). Taken together, these results suggest that 3′ TPGs might influence tissue-specificity of translocations indirectly, via tissue-specific expression of the proteins interacting with them.</p>

        <title>Spatial position in nucleus</title>
        <p>Preferential fusion of certain 5′ and 3′ TPGs in hematological cancers is generally attributed to the spatial proximity of those loci within the nuclear space. This has been demonstrated for a few recurrent translocations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Lin1">[8]</xref>, but the relevance of spatial proximity as a general feature capable of driving specific translocations in hematological malignancies has not been assessed on a large scale. We therefore used high-throughput spatial proximity data (represented as interchromosomal contact frequencies) available for human lymphoblastoid cell line GM06990 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-LiebermanAiden1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Yaffe1">[17]</xref>, in order to check whether known 5′-3′ TPG pairs are closer in the nucleus, on average, than random genes. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g009">Figure 9A</xref>, mean contact frequency calculated for 239 TPG pairs (black line) is significantly higher than for randomly selected Refseq genes (light green), indicating a preferential position in a contact-enriched zone of the nucleus. However, neither replacing a 5′ or a 3′ TPG with a random Refseq gene (red and dark green lines) nor, more importantly, randomly permuting 5′-3′ TPG pairs (blue line), significantly decreased the average distance between paired genes. This suggests that spatial proximity, in itself, does not have a major role in determining the preferential pairing of specific TPGs in hematological neoplasms.</p>

        <p>A more refined way to test the relevance of spatial proximity for lineage-specificity of translocations is to select translocations reported only in lymphoid or in myeloid malignancies (HEM-L and HEM-M subsets mentioned above) and to measure the distance between those loci in cell lines of lymphoid and myeloid lineage. Therefore, we compared distances between TPG pairs in GM06990 cells (lymphoblastoid origin) and in K562 cells (myeloid origin), for which Hi-C data were also available. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g009">Figure 9B</xref>, we found no lineage-specific trends: TPG pairs from HEM-L and HEM-M translocations were at similar distances in GM06990 and K562 cells. Moreover, we observed very significant correlation of distances between cell lines (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g009">Figure 9B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To gain further insights into the relative positions of TPGs in the nucleus, we performed clusterization of Hi-C distances to obtain clusters corresponding to central and peripheral locations (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s005">Figure S5</xref>). We found that 5′ TPGs are significantly over-represented in the central (proximal) cluster of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g009">Figure 9C</xref>, supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Likewise, 5′ TPGs are, on average, closer to all other nuclear loci (excluding loci on the same chromosome) than RefSeq genes, according to their higher mean contact frequency (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s005">Figure S5E</xref>). This, in contrast, was not observed for 3′ TPGs, indicating that 5′ TPGs occupy a more central position in the nuclear space whereas 3′ TPGs are more evenly distributed. The overall association of TPGs with regions in the central cluster is shown in supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s005">Figure S5D</xref>.</p>
        <p>Replication timing (RT) is highly correlated, at the chromosomal level, with the organization of chromosomal domains within territories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Ryba1">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, the RT of a chromosomal region is associated with mutation rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Stamatoyannopoulos1">[19]</xref> and somatic copy number alterations are often bounded by early replicating regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-De1">[20]</xref>. We grouped smoothed RT data for GM06990 cell line into early and late replicating regions based on distribution of all RefSeq genes (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s006">Figure S6</xref>) and analyzed RT values of TPG-containing regions. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g009">Figure 9C</xref> and supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s006">Figure S6B</xref>, both 5′ TPGs and 3′ TPGs are significantly over-represented in early-replicating regions. Likewise, TPGs are replicated significantly earlier than all RefSeq genes based on raw RT values for their genomic regions (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s006">Figure S6D</xref>), with 5′ and 3′ TPGs having similar timing. To further strengthen this observation, we repeated our analysis on more samples from the ReplicationDomain database. The results obtained for hematological samples were in good agreement with GM06990 cell line, while non-hematological samples only show slight trends (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s006">Figure S6C</xref>).</p>

        <title>Translocation features related to clinical frequency</title>
        <p>Another relevant question about the forces that drive specific combinations of TPGs in hematological malignancies is why some translocations are more frequently found in clinical samples whereas other translocations are never, or rarely, recurrent. It has been previously argued <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Roix1">[7]</xref> that clinical frequency (estimated from the number of reported cases in Mitelman database) is correlated with spatial proximity for rearranged loci, leading the authors to suggest that high-order spatial genome organization, with non-random localization of these loci in relation to the center of nucleus, might increase their spatial proximity. Therefore, we extracted data for all translocations reported in hematological malignancies in Mitelman database and computed the contact frequency of various combinations of genes. First, we found that the average distance between TPGs in rare translocations (reported only once) is the same as the distance between TPGs in frequent translocations (reported more than once) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002797-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). Furthermore, when we compared RT and contact frequency across the whole genome (excluding their own chromosome) for TPGs in rare and frequent translocations we did not observe any significant difference, as shown in supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s007">Figure S7</xref> (which shows separately 5′ TPGs and 3′ TPGs). Again, this observation suggests that spatial proximity is not sufficient to account for the recurrence of specific translocations, and that additional factors must be considered.</p>

Similarly, we explored whether the number of known PIIs in 3′ TPGs might be associated with the frequency of their involvement in translocations.

        <title>TPG features that drive oncogenic translocations</title>
        <p>Chromosomal translocations frequently lead to cancer development via promoter substitution and loss of transcriptional control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Rabbitts2">[21]</xref>. In agreement with this, we find that TPGs display significantly increased expression levels. In the case of 5′ TPGs, this seems to be the result of increased promoter activity, as shown by the presence of significantly more H3K4me3 marks and pol2 peaks near the TSS and evidence early replication timing. As regards 3′ TPGs, we found that they have shorter 3′-UTRs with less regulatory elements than corresponding 5′ TPGs, thus facilitating the escape of fusion genes from post-transcriptional control. In this regard, it has been previously reported that some chromosomal translocations lead to oncogenic transformation by disrupting microRNA-mediated gene repression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Mayr1">[22]</xref> and that replacing the 3′-UTR of <italic>MLL</italic> with 3′-UTRs of its TPGs removes post-transcriptional inhibition of its expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-GomezBenito1">[23]</xref>. Such loss of post-transcriptional control could contribute to the oncogenicity of <italic>MLL</italic> translocations. We propose that a similar mechanism could be important, more generally, to determine the oncogenic potential of translocations in hematological neoplasms. This confirms that genes involved in fusions are generally selected because they cause overexpression of oncogenes, as seen for many mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Rabbitts1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Rabbitts2">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It has also been shown that co-transcriptional processes can influence genome stability due to transcription-induced R-loops in which activation-induced-deaminases (AID) introduce DNA breaks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Ruiz1">[24]</xref>. Indeed, such a mechanism has been invoked to explain the presence of RCTs in B-cell malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Chiarle1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Klein1">[26]</xref>. More recently, analysis of the genomes of 21 breast cancer samples has revealed that regions of somatic hypermutation tend to associate with breakpoints of somatic rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-NikZainal1">[27]</xref>, again suggesting that AID enzymes might play a role in co-transcriptional generation of DNA breaks. Thus, transcription might establish a link between gene involvement in RCTs and DSB frequency across the genome. This, however, would not explain why 3′ TPGs with moderate expression levels are preferred over other hematological tissue-specific genes. This could be explained by other mechanisms leading to the generation of DNA breaks which are not directly related to high transcription rates, such as replication. It is now clear that DNA breaks leading to some forms of chromosomal rearrangement can be induced during replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Hastings1">[28]</xref>. However, recent studies in yeast show that error-prone DNA due to template switching is associated with late-replicating regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Lang1">[29]</xref>, while we observe that TPGs are over-represented in early-replicating regions. Given that early-replicating regions contain active genes with important cellular functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Aran1">[30]</xref>, this is reminiscent of the master gene hypothesis according to which genes involved in RCTs are chosen because of their functional attributes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Rabbitts3">[31]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In this regard, we have previously suggested that the need to combine certain protein domains imposes selective constraints on fusion proteins, so that those combinations with greater oncogenic potential are more frequently found in tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-OrtizdeMendbil1">[14]</xref>. Similarly, other authors have found that features such as intrinsic structural disorder of fusion proteins are important for their oncogenic properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Hegyi1">[32]</xref>. However, the role played by functional selection is usually overlooked in models that try to explain specific combinations of TPGs in oncogenic translocations. Here, we have found that oncogenic translocations retain a significant percentage of domains and protein interaction interfaces of 3′ TPGs. We further used InterPro annotations to classify all protein domains into five broad classes, assuming that an oncogenic fusion protein should contain at least one domain with oncogenic properties. Such classification scheme is supported by the fact that fusion proteins in which both TPGs contain “type 2” domains (that is, domains not belonging to any of the four major functional categories with oncogenic potential) are significantly under-represented. Among over-represented domain combinations are the co-ocurrence of protein interaction domains (many of which are capable of protein oligomerization) with DNA-binding and kinase domains, as well as co-occurence of two kinase domains, which result in aberrant cellular signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Pawson1">[33]</xref>. Likewise, our data show that co-occurrence of histone modification and protein interaction domains is non-random, which is consistent with the important role played by aberrant chromatin modification in cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Fllgrabe1">[34]</xref>, and in particular in translocations involving <italic>MLL</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Slany1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Tenney1">[36]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, most over-represented domain co-occurrences involve one type 1 and one type 2 domain, indicating that in most fusion genes one of the TPGs is simply promoting overexpression of the fusion protein. A 5′-TPG with type 2 domains could contribute a strong promoter, whereas a 3′-TPG with a type 2 domain might stabilize the fusion mRNA by contributing its 3′-UTR. Our analysis of expression gain of 5′ TPGs, as well as potential mRNA stability gain of 3′ TPGs, suggests that both mechanisms are generally operative.</p>
        <p>Finally, to obtain a global view of the relative contributions of the various domain features on non-random fusion partner selection, we performed an unsupervised classification of fusion proteins based on the functional signatures of their 5′ and 3′ TPGs. The superimposition of these functional clusters onto the fusion network reveals that functional profiles of fusion proteins robustly capture the basic structure of the network.</p>
        <p>Our data also suggest that tissue-specificity of translocations might be explained, at least in part, by tissue-specific expression of TPGs. First, we found that 5′ TPGs involved exclusively in hematological neoplasms are significantly more expressed in hematopoietic tissue compared to epithelial and mesenchymal tissues, which is somehow expected because the oncogenic potential of fusion genes relies on their expression levels in the tissue where the translocation takes place. But when we analyzed 5′ TPGs involved in translocations reported only in lymphoid or in myeloid neoplasms, comparing their expression levels in two cell lines of lymphoid and myeloid origin (GM128 and K562, respectively), our results confirmed that expression of 5′ TPGs is an important contributor to tissue specificity of RCTs. As for 3′ TPGs, we found that their contribution to tissue specificity is dependent on the expression levels of their interaction partners, which are significantly higher in hematopoietic than in non-hematopoietic tissues according to all gene expression datasets analyzed.</p>

        <title>Spatial proximity of TPGs in the formation of specific chromosomal translocations</title>
        <p>It is interesting that some of the genomic features of TPGs that we have found correlated with tissue-specificity of translocations are known to be related to the spatial organization of the genome. Transcriptional activity, for instance, clearly affects the position of genes: inactive genes inside a chromosome territory are constrained in their mobility and thus in their potential to interact with distant loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Dostie1">[37]</xref>, so that the ability of actively transcribed regions to interact <italic>in trans</italic> requires that those regions loop outside of their respective territories <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Kalhor1">[38]</xref>. Likewise, replication timing is highly correlated with nuclear position and chromosome architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Ryba2">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-deLaat1">[41]</xref>. It is well documented that chromosomes occupy spatially defined territories in the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Cremer1">[42]</xref> so that intra-chromosomal contacts are more frequent than inter-chromosomal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-LiebermanAiden1">[16]</xref>. This organization is tissue specific with some intra-chromosomal contacts being more frequent in some tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Parada1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Kress1">[43]</xref>. Thus it has been speculated that the recurrence and tissue-specificity of translocations could be explained by the spatial proximity and physical contact frequency of translocated loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Parada1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Roix1">[7]</xref>. Our observation that 5′ TPGs are preferentially found in transcriptionally active domains in the center of the nucleus could provide a link between high-order genome organization and the potential occurrence of translocations, because a central position within the nuclear space (which is known to be tightly linked with transcriptional activity) increases average contact frequency with other loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Sexton1">[44]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Gruenbaum1">[45]</xref>.</p>
        <p>However, our results suggest that spatial proximity <italic>per se</italic> is not a decisive factor in determining specific combinations of TPGs and their clinical recurrence. Although it has long been speculated that spatial proximity determines the specific pairing of TPGs in translocations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Lin1">[8]</xref>, data supporting this contention as a general mechanisms for all types of translocations is lacking. For instance, Parada et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Parada1">[6]</xref> used mouse chr5:chr6 and chr12:chr15 chromosome pairs to show that the frequency of translocations is correlated with the frequency of chromosomal contacts. These chromosome pairs provide a useful model, as chromosomes 5 and 6 are known to be translocated in hepatocytes but not in lymphocytes, while the opposite is true for chromosomes 12 and 15. These authors showed that contacts between chr5:chr6 are significantly more frequent in hepatocytes, while chr12:chr15 contacts are significantly more frequent in lymphocytes. But recent Hi-C data provides a more global and accurate measure of contact frequencies between chromosomal loci in a human lymphoblastoid cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-LiebermanAiden1">[16]</xref>. Using the distribution of interchromosomal contact frequencies for all pairs of loci between two chromosomes as a measure of their closeness, we found that chr12:chr15 (which are known to be translocated in human hematological malignancies) are closer than chr5:chr6 (not reported to be translocated). However, we also observed that chromosomes 5 and 2, frequently rearranged in translocations involving the <italic>ALK</italic> gene in anaplastic large cell lymphoma cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Chiarle2">[46]</xref>, were even farther apart in the nucleus than chromosomes 5 and 6 (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). When this analysis was extended to all translocations and all loci, we found no difference between the average distances for chromosome pairs that are rearranged in hematological malignancies versus non-rearranged pairs (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). Thus, while TPGs are non-randomly distributed relative to the center of the nucleus, we propose that their pairing in specific combinations is mainly driven by other factors such as gene activity, which (through their association with high-order genomic organization) lead indirectly to their nuclear closeness (supplementary <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002797.s008">Figure S8C</xref>).</p>
        <p>In this view, spatial proximity is a necessary pre-requisite for the appearance of a translocation, but it is unlikely to be the only (or even the most important) factor to explain the specificity and recurrence of oncogenic translocations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Wijchers1">[47]</xref>. In fact, our data show that the specificity of TPG pairing and the recurrence of specific gene pairs are not directly dependent on spatial proximity. Recent findings in the budding yeast have shown that broken chromosomal ends created by DSBs are able to travel relatively long distances within the nuclear space to search for homologous templates. Miné-Hattab and Rothstein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-MinHattab1">[48]</xref> have demonstrated that after induction of a DSB the broken chromosome explores up to 30% of the nuclear volume in diploid cells, about 10-fold larger than the volume to which chromosomes are constrained in the absence of breaks. A similar observation was made by Dion et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Dion1">[49]</xref> in haploid cells, where DSBs stayed for hours searching for a homologous template. These results show that it is possible to join regions which are relatively distant in the nucleus, and are consistent with our contention that spatial proximity is not a strong determinant of translocation frequency or specificity in hematological neoplasms on a global scale. Therefore, the specificity of TPG pairing could be better explained by the preferential positioning of 5′ TPGs in the central zone of the nucleus, which in turn is related to functional features such as gene expression and replication timing. This central location might put these genes within the nuclear distance required to undergo a translocation with several potential 3′ TPGs. Then, selection for fusion proteins with oncogenic potential will dictate which specific gene pairs are eventually found in a particular tissue, and their relative frequency in patient samples.</p>
        <p>The issues discussed here also have important practical implications. Several studies published over the last few years have demonstrated the ability of next generation sequencing (NGS) to identify novel fusion transcripts in cell lines and in samples from patients with hematological and solid cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Grossmann1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Asmann1">[52]</xref>. However, the functional significance of newly identified fusions is not always clear because it is possible that many of these novel RCTs are the result of an increased background of genomic instability, rather than being driver oncogenic events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Wijchers1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Sakarya1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Dlken1">[53]</xref>. Thus, there is a need for methods that identify which of these tumor specific RCTs are required for establishment and maintenance of the transformed phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Asmann1">[52]</xref>. The genomic features of 5′ and 3′ TPGs that we have identified in this work might help to develop computational approaches for the prediction of fusion genes that are more likely to have a causal role in the initiation or progression of hematological neoplasms.</p>

        <title>Selection of translocations and partner genes</title>
        <p>Data from translocations, including the Ensembl transcript ID of translocation partner genes and the nucleotide position of breakpoints, were extracted from TICdb v3.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.unav.es/genetica/TICdb/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.unav.es/genetica/TICdb/</ext-link>). There are some translocations involving the same gene pair with different breakpoint positions, which is redundant for some types of analysis. Therefore in some cases we have used unique TPG instances for expression studies, and unique TPG pairs for analysis of genome organization features. For analysis of the functions of fusion proteins we have used TPG pairs that were unique in terms of InterPro domain composition. We successfully extracted from TICdb data for 770 hematopoietic translocation entries involving 1175 TPGs, comprising 245 TPG pairs with unique gene names (117 unique 5′TPG and 161 unique 3′TPGs). Translocations and TPGs for which certain data were not available (e.g. expression or genomic organization) were not included in the corresponding analysis. For lineage-specific analysis, translocations reported in malignancies of lymphoid (HEM-L, 177 translocations) and myeloid (HEM-M, 201 translocation) origin were selected.</p>

        <p>Human gene expression data (dataset #1) for three tissue lineages, epithelial (EPI), hematopoietic (HEM), or mesenchymal (MES), was extracted from Gene Expression Omnibus (GEO, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/" xlink:type="simple">www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/geo/</ext-link>) as follows. For each tissue lineage we manually selected four tissues as samples: colon mucosa (GSE8671), lung epithelium (GSE30660), mammary epithelium (GSE25487) and pancreatic duct epithelium (GSE19650) for EPI; bone marrow (GSE32057), peripheral blood mononuclear cells (GSE11281), spleen (GSE25550) and CD3+ T-cells (GSE6088) for HEM; omental adipose tissue (GSE3526), meniscal cartilage (GSE19060), skin fibroblasts (GSE20538) and aortic vascular smooth muscle cells (GSE11367) for MES. Gene expression levels for each of four tissue samples were calculated as the average of up to three randomly selected donor samples available in microarray data, using only data for non-malignant tissues. All microarray data were first downloaded as .CEL files and then jointly normalized by RMA express (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/" xlink:type="simple">http://rmaexpress.bmbolstad.com/</ext-link>).

For that purpose the whole dataset was downloaded as a normalized matrix file from GEO and then manually grouped by tissue type. Overall microarray data from both the manual dataset and gene atlas were in good agreement and yielded similar results. Thus we present here only graphs generated using dataset #1, providing graphs for dataset #2 as supplementary information.

Polymerase II (Pol2) peak frequency was computed as the proportion of cell lines having a Pol2 peak in the promoter region. To perform an unbiased comparison, Pol2 peak frequency of all genes was normalized to zero mean and unit standard deviation, separately for hematopoietic and non-hematopoietic cell lines.

The list of interaction partners for a given TPG is comprised of all proteins that interact with those PIIs present in the corresponding part of the fusion protein. Annotation and gene ontology (GO) terms (if available) were extracted from InterPro using BioMart and from data provided in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002797-Burge1">[56]</xref>, respectively.

As some InterPro domain features are small and are present in multiple copies in some proteins, this could cause biases when trying to analyze domain composition of fusion proteins.
