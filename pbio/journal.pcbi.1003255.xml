<abstract>
<p>One of the outstanding challenges in comparative genomics is to interpret the evolutionary importance of regulatory variation between species. Rigorous molecular evolution-based methods to infer evidence for natural selection from expression data are at a premium in the field, and to date, phylogenetic approaches have not been well-suited to address the question in the small sets of taxa profiled in standard surveys of gene expression. We have developed a strategy to infer evolutionary histories from expression profiles by analyzing suites of genes of common function. In a manner conceptually similar to molecular evolution models in which the evolutionary rates of DNA sequence at multiple loci follow a gamma distribution, we modeled expression of the genes of an <italic>a priori</italic>-defined pathway with rates drawn from an inverse gamma distribution. We then developed a fitting strategy to infer the parameters of this distribution from expression measurements, and to identify gene groups whose expression patterns were consistent with evolutionary constraint or rapid evolution in particular species. Simulations confirmed the power and accuracy of our inference method. As an experimental testbed for our approach, we generated and analyzed transcriptional profiles of four <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts. The results revealed pathways with signatures of constrained and accelerated regulatory evolution in individual yeasts and across the phylogeny, highlighting the prevalence of pathway-level expression change during the divergence of yeast species. We anticipate that our pathway-based phylogenetic approach will be of broad utility in the search to understand the evolutionary relevance of regulatory change.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Comparative transcriptomic studies routinely identify thousands of genes differentially expressed between species. The central question in the field is whether and how such regulatory changes have been the product of natural selection. Can the signal of evolutionarily relevant expression divergence be detected amid the noise of changes resulting from genetic drift? Our work develops a theory of gene expression variation among a suite of genes that function together. We derive a formalism that relates empirical observations of expression of pathway genes in divergent species to the underlying strength of natural selection on expression output. We show that fitting this type of model to simulated data accurately recapitulates the parameters used to generate the simulation. We then make experimental measurements of gene expression in a panel of single-celled eukaryotic yeast species. To these data we apply our inference method, and identify pathways with striking evidence for accelerated or constrained regulatory evolution, in particular species and across the phylogeny. Our method provides a key advance over previous approaches in that it maximizes the power of rigorous molecular-evolution analysis of regulatory variation even when data are relatively sparse. As such, the theory and tools we have developed will likely find broad application in the field of comparative genomics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Comparative studies of gene expression across species routinely detect regulatory variation at thousands of loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Romero1">[1]</xref>. Whether and how these expression changes are of evolutionary relevance has become a central question in the field. In landmark cases, experimental dissection of model phenotypes has revealed evidence for adaptive regulatory change at individual genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Rebeiz1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Ishii1">[5]</xref>. These findings have motivated hypothesis-generating, genome-scale searches for signatures of natural selection on gene regulation. In addition to molecular-evolution analyses of regulatory sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Torgerson1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Gronau1">[9]</xref>, phylogenetic methods have been developed to infer evidence for non-neutral evolutionary change from measurements of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Chaix1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Brawand1">[12]</xref>. Two classic models of continuous character evolution have been used for the latter purpose: Brownian motion models, which can specify lineage-specific rates of evolution on a phylogenetic tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Lande1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Eastman1">[16]</xref> and have been used to model the neutral evolution of gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Bedford1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Oakley1">[17]</xref>, and the Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model, which by describing lineage-specific forces of drift and stabilizing selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Lande1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Hansen1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Butler1">[19]</xref> can be used to test for evolutionary constraint on gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Bedford1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Brawand1">[12]</xref>. To date, phylogenetic approaches have had relatively modest power to infer lineage-specific rates or selective optima of gene expression levels. This limitation is due in part to the sparse species coverage typical of transcriptomic surveys, in contrast to studies of organismal traits where observations in hundreds of species can be made to maximize the power of phylogenetic inference <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-An1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Boettiger1">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>As a complement to model-based phylogenetic methods, more empirical approaches have also been proposed that detect expression patterns suggestive of non-neutral evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Blekhman1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Fraser1">[25]</xref>. We previously developed a paradigm to detect species changes in selective pressure on the regulation of a pathway, or suite of genes of common function, in the case where multiple independent variants drive expression of pathway genes in the same direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Bullard1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Martin1">[26]</xref>. Broadly, pathway-level analyses have the potential to uncover evidence for changes in selective pressure on a gene group in the aggregate, when the signal at any one gene may be too weak to emerge from genome-scale scans. However, the currently available tests for directional regulatory evolution are not well suited to cases in which some components of a pathway are activated, and others are down-regulated, in response to selection.</p>
<p>In this work, we set out to combine the rigor of phylogenetic methods to reconstruct histories of continuous-character evolution with the power of pathway-level analyses of regulatory change. We reasoned that an integration of these two families of methods could be used to detect cases of pathway regulatory evolution from gene expression data, without assuming a directional model. To this end, we aimed to develop a phylogenetic model of pathway regulatory change that accounted for differences in evolutionary rate between the individual genes of a pathway. We sought to use this model to uncover gene groups whose regulation has undergone accelerated evolution or been subject to evolutionary constraint, over and above the degree expected by drift during species divergence as estimated from genome sequence. As an experimental testbed for our inference strategy, we used the <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeasts. These microbial eukaryotes span an estimated 20 million years of divergence and have available well-established orthologous gene calls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Scannell1">[27]</xref>, and yeast pathways are well-annotated based on decades of characterization of the model organism <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. We generated a comparative transcriptomic data set across Saccharomycetes by RNA-seq, and we used the data to search for cases of pathway regulatory change.</p>

<title>Modeling the rates of regulatory evolution across the genes of a pathway</title>
<p>The Brownian-motion model of expression of a gene predicts a multivariate normal distribution of observed expression levels in the species at the tips of a phylogenetic tree. The variance-covariance matrix of this multivariate normal distribution reflects both the relatedness of the species and the rate of regulatory evolution along each branch of the tree. We sought to apply this model to interpret expression changes in a pre-defined set of genes of common function, which we term a pathway. Our goal was to test for accelerated or constrained regulatory variation in a pathway relative to the expectation from DNA sequence divergence, as specified by a genome tree. To avoid the potential for over-parameterization if the rate of each gene in a pathway were fit separately, we instead developed a formalism, detailed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, to model regulatory evolution in the pathway using a parametric distribution of evolutionary rates across the genes. This strategy parallels well-established models of the rate of DNA sequence evolution across different sites in a locus or genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Yang1">[28]</xref>. Briefly, we assumed that each gene in the pathway draws its rate of evolution from an inverse gamma distribution, and we derived the relationship between the parameters of this distribution and the likelihood of expression observations at the tips of the tree. For each gene, we modeled the contrasts of the expression level in each species relative to an arbitrary species used as a reference, to eliminate the need to estimate the ancestral expression level. A further normalization step, recentering the distribution of expression across pathway genes in each species to a mean of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, corrected for the effects of coherent regulatory divergence due to drift. This formalism enabled a maximum-likelihood fit of the parameters describing the pathway expression distribution, given empirical expression data, and could accommodate models of lineage-specific regulatory evolution, in which a particular subtree was described by distinct evolutionary rate parameters relative to the rest of the phylogeny. As a point of comparison, we additionally made use of an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Butler1">[19]</xref>: here the rate of regulatory evolution of each gene in a pathway, across the entire phylogeny, was drawn from an inverse-gamma distribution, and all genes of the pathway were subject to the same degree of stabilizing selection, again across the entire tree.</p>
<p>Our ultimate application of the method given a set of expression data was to enumerate all possible Brownian motion models in which pathway expression evolved at a distinct rate along the lineages of a subtree relative to the rest of the phylogeny, and for each such model, apply our fitting strategy and tabulate the likelihood of the data under the best-fit parameter set. To compare these likelihoods and the analogous likelihood from the best-fit OU model of universal constraint, we applied a standard Akaike information criterion (AIC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Harmon1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Gong1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Slater1">[30]</xref> to identify strongly supported models.</p>

<title>Simulation testing of inference of pathway regulatory evolution</title>
<p>As an initial test of our approach, we sought to assess the performance of our phylogenetic inference scheme in the ideal case in which rates of regulatory evolution of the genes of a pathway were simulated from, and thus conformed to, the models of our theoretical treatment. In keeping with our experimental application below which used a comparison of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> yeast species as a testbed, we developed a simulation scheme using a molecular clock-calibrated <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> phylogeny <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Scannell1">[27]</xref> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g001">Figure 1a</xref> inset). We simulated the expression of a multi-gene pathway in which rates of evolution of the member genes were drawn from an inverse gamma distribution. With the simulated expression data in hand from a given generating model, we fit an OU model, an equal-rates model, and models of evolutionary rate shifts in each subtree in turn.</p>

By contrast, for pathways of ten genes or more, we observed strong AIC support for the true generating model in cases of lineage-specific regulatory evolution, approaching AIC weights of 100% for the correct model if a pathway contained more than 50 genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g001">Figure 1a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s001">Figure S1</xref> and panel a of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s002">Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s005">S5</xref>). In these simulations our method also inferred the correct magnitudes of lineage-specific shifts with high confidence, for all but the smallest pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g001">Figure 1b</xref> and panel b of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s002">Figures S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s005">S5</xref>). Likewise, when applied to simulated expression data generated under models of phylogeny-wide constraint, our method successfully identified OU as the correct model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g002">Figure 2a</xref>), though with biased estimates of the magnitude of the constraint parameter when the latter was large (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g002">Figure 2b</xref>), likely due to a lack of identifiability with the inverse-gamma rate parameter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<p>We also sought to evaluate the robustness of our method to violations of the underlying model. To explore the effect of our assumption of independence between genes, we simulated a pathway in which expression of the individual genes was coupled to one another and evolving under an equal-rates Brownian motion model, and we inferred evolutionary histories either including or eliminating the mean-centering normalization step of our analysis pipeline. With the latter step in place, our method correctly yielded little support for shifts in evolutionary rates in the simulated data except in the case of extremely tight correlation between genes, a regime unlikely to be biologically relevant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Additionally, to test the impact of our assumption that the genes of a pathway were all subject to similar evolutionary pressures, we simulated a heterogeneous pathway in which expression of only a fraction of the gene members was subject to a lineage-specific shift in evolutionary rate. Inferring parameters from these data revealed accurate detection of rate shifts even when a large proportion of the genes in the pathway deviated from the rate shift model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Taken together, our results make clear that the pathway-based phylogenetic approach is highly powered to infer evolutionary histories of gene expression change, particularly lineage-specific evolutionary rate shifts. As a contrast to the poor performance of phylogenetic inference when applied to one or a few genes, our findings underscore the utility of the multi-gene paradigm in identifying candidate cases of evolutionarily relevant expression divergence.</p>

<title>Phylogenetic inference of regulatory evolution from experimental measurements of <italic>Saccharomyces</italic> expression</title>
<p>We next set out to apply our method for evolutionary reconstruction of regulatory change to experimental measurements of gene expression. The total difference in gene expression between any two species is a consequence of heritable differences that act in <italic>cis</italic> on the DNA strand of a gene whose expression is measured, and of variants that act in <italic>trans</italic>, through a soluble factor, to impact gene expression of distal targets. Effects of <italic>cis</italic>-acting variation can be surveyed on a genomic scale using our previously reported strategy of mapping of RNA-seq reads to the individual alleles of a given gene in a diploid inter-specific hybrid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Bullard1">[24]</xref>, whereas the joint effects of <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic>-acting factors can be assessed with standard transcriptional profiling approaches in cultures of purebred species. To apply these experimental paradigms we chose a system of <italic>Saccharomyces sensu stricto</italic> yeasts. We cultured two biological replicates for each of a series of hybrids formed by the mating of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>, <italic>S. mikatae</italic>, and <italic>S. bayanus</italic> in turn, as well as homozygotes of each species. We measured total expression in the species homozygotes, and allele-specific expression in the hybrids, of each gene by RNA-seq, using established mapping and normalization procedures, including a variance-stabilizing full-quantile normalization (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). In each set of expression data, we made use of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a reference: we normalized expression in the homozygote of a given species, and expression of the allele of a given species in a diploid hybrid, relative to the analogous measurement from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>.</p>
<p>To search for evidence of evolutionary constraint and lineage-specific shifts in evolutionary rate in our yeast expression data, we considered as pathways the pre-defined sets of genes of common function from the Gene Ontology (GO) process categories. For the genes of each GO term, we used normalized expression measurements in yeast species and, separately, measurements of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation from interspecific hybrids, as input into our phylogenetic analysis pipeline. Thus, for each of the two classes of expression measurements, for a given GO term we fit models of a lineage-specific rate shift in regulatory evolution incorporating inverse-gamma-distributed rates across genes; an analogous model with no lineage-specific rate shift; and an OU model of universal constraint. The results revealed a range of inferred evolutionary models and AIC support across GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003255-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003255-t002">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s011">Tables S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003255.s012">S4</xref>), and this complete data set served as the basis for manual inspection of biologically interesting features.</p>

<title>Inference of regulatory evolution in yeast pathways from experimental expression measurements.</title>
<p>Each panel reports results of phylogenetic inference of evolutionary histories of gene expression change from one set of experimental transcriptional profiling data. In a given panel, each vertical bar reports results of maximum-likelihood fits of Brownian-motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck models to expression of the genes of one Gene Ontology process term; the total proportion of a bar corresponding to a particular color indicates the Akaike weight of the corresponding model (legend at right, with labels as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g001">Figure 1</xref>).

<p>Among the inferences of pathway regulatory evolution from our method, we observed many cases of evolutionary interest whose best-fitting model had strong AIC support (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For each of 15 GO terms, <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory expression variation measurements yielded inference of an evolutionary model with &gt;80% AIC weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g003">Figure 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003255-t001">Table 1</xref>). Many such GO terms represented candidate cases of polygenic regulatory evolution, in which multiple independent variants, at the unlinked genes that make up a pathway, have been maintained in some yeast species in response to a lineage-specific shift in selective pressure on expression of the pathway components. For example, in replicative cell aging genes (GO term 0001302), <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation measured in interspecific hybrids supported a model of polygenic, accelerated evolution in <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g004">Figure 4a</xref>), with some pathway components upregulated and some downregulated in the latter species relative to other yeasts. The total expression levels of cell aging genes in species homozygotes were also consistent with rapid evolution in <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g004">Figure 4a</xref>), arguing against a model of compensation between <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory variation, and highlighting this pathway as a particularly compelling potential case of a lineage-specific change in selective pressure.</p>

<title>Lineage-specific regulatory evolution and constraint in yeast pathways, inferred from experimental expression measurements.</title>
<p>Each panel shows kernel density estimates of the distributions of experimental gene expression measurements among the genes of one yeast Gene Ontology process term, whose evolutionary history was inferred with strong support. In a given panel, each trace reports the expression levels of the genes of the indicated pathway, from the allele of the indicated yeast species in a hybrid or in the purebred homozygote of a species, normalized with respect to the analogous measurement in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and with respect to branch length. Inset cartoons represent the model inferred with AIC weight &gt;80% for the indicated pathway (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003255-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003255-t002">2</xref>). (a) Allele-specific expression from measurements in diploid hybrids (left) and total expression measurements in species homozygotes (right) for the 38 genes of GO:0001302, replicative cell aging, supporting a model of accelerated evolution in <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>; in the inset, the number above the bolded branch reports the inferred shift in the rate of regulatory evolution along that lineage. (b) Allele-specific expression from measurements in diploid hybrids for the 462 genes of GO:0006351, transport, supporting a model of constraint in <italic>S. bayanus</italic>; in the inset, the number above the bolded branch reports the inferred shift in the rate of regulatory evolution along that lineage. (c) Total expression measured in species homozygotes for the 175 genes of GO:0006281, transcription, supporting an Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model of universal constraint; in the inset, the number above the tree reports the inferred value of the constraint parameter. Note that in (c), the width of the distribution of expression differences between a given species and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> correlates inversely with the sequence divergence of that species, as expected if selective constraint on expression renders the estimate of evolutionary distance from genome sequence an increasing over-estimate of expression change.</p>

<p>In other instances, expression measurements in species homozygotes alone supported models of lineage-specific evolution, with each such pathway representing a candidate case of accelerated or constrained evolution at <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory factors. For a total of 41 GO terms, our method inferred models with &gt;80% AIC weight from homozygote species expression data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g003">Figure 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003255-t002">Table 2</xref>). These top-scoring pathways included a set of components of the transcription machinery (GO term 0006351), whose expression levels in <italic>S. bayanus</italic> were less volatile than those of other yeasts and thus supported a model of lineage-specific constraint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g004">Figure 4b</xref>). Additionally, expression of a number of pathways in species homozygotes conformed to the OU model of universal constraint, such as a set of genes annotated in transport (GO term 0006281), whose expression varied less across all species than would be expected from the genome tree (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g004">Figure 4c</xref>). Taken together, our findings indicate that evolutionary histories can be inferred with high confidence from experimental measurements of pathway gene expression. In our yeast data, many pathways exhibit expression signatures consistent with non-neutral regulatory evolution, in particular lineages and across the phylogeny.</p>
<p>Another emergent trend was the prevalence, across many GO terms, of models of distinct regulatory evolution in the lineage to <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> as the best fit to expression measurements in species homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). We noted no such recurrent model in analyses of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g003">Figure 3a</xref>), implicating <italic>trans</italic>-acting variants as the likely source of the regulatory divergence in <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>. To validate these patterns, we applied our phylogenetic inference method to expression measurements from all genes in the genome analyzed as a single group, rather than to each GO term in turn. When we used expression data from species homozygotes as input for this genome-scale analysis, our method assigned complete AIC support to a model in which the rate of evolution was <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> times faster on the branch leading to <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> (AIC weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), consistent with results from individual GO terms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g003">Figure 3b</xref>). An analogous inference calculation using measurements of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory variation, for all genes in the genome, yielded essentially complete support for an OU model of universal constraint (AIC weight <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). We conclude that constraint on the <italic>cis</italic>-acting determinants of gene expression, of roughly the same degree in all yeasts, is the general rule from which changes in selective pressure on particular functions may drive deviations in individual pathways. However, for many genes, expression in the <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> homozygote is distinct from that of other yeasts out of proportion to its sequence divergence, suggestive of derived, <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory variants with pleotropic effects.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The effort to infer evolutionary histories of gene expression change has been a central focus of modern comparative genomics. Against a backdrop of a few landmark successes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Bedford1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Brawand1">[12]</xref>, progress in the field has been limited by the relatively weak power of phylogenetic methods when applied, on a gene-by-gene basis, to measurements from small sets of species. In this work, we have met this challenge with a method to infer evolutionary rates of any suite of independently measured continuous characters that can be analyzed together across species. We have derived the mathematical formalism for this model, and we have illustrated the power and accuracy of our approach in simulations. We have generated yeast transcriptional profiles that complement available data sets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Busby1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Goodman1">[32]</xref> by measuring <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory contributions to species expression differences as well as the total variation between species. With these data, we have demonstrated that our phylogenetic inference method yields robust, interpretable candidate cases of pathway regulatory evolution from experimental measurements.</p>
<p>The defining feature of our phylogenetic inference method is that it gains power by jointly leveraging expression measurements of a group of genes, while avoiding a high-dimensional evolutionary model. Rather than requiring an estimate of the evolutionary rate at each gene, our strategy estimates the parameters of a distribution of evolutionary rates across genes. We thus apply the assumption of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Chaix1">[10]</xref> and model expression of the individual genes of a pathway as independent draws from the same distribution, mirroring the standard assumption of independence across sites in phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Felsenstein2">[33]</xref>. Any observation of lineage-specific <italic>cis</italic>-acting regulatory variation from our approach is of immediate evolutionary interest: a species-specific excess of variants at unlinked loci of common function would be unlikely under neutrality, and would represent a potential signature of positive selection if fixed across individuals of the species. In the study of <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulatory variation, <italic>a priori</italic> a case of apparent accelerated evolution of a pathway could be driven by a single mutation of large effect maintained by drift in a species, as in any phenomenological analysis of trait evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Lande1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Barton1">[34]</xref>. Our results indicate that for correlated gene groups, the latter issue can be largely resolved by a simple transformation in which expression of each gene is normalized against the mean of all genes in the pathway. Additional corrections could be required under more complex models of correlation among pathway genes, potentially to be incorporated with matrix-regularization techniques that highlight patterns of correlation in transcriptome data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Dunn1">[35]</xref>. Similarly, although the assumption of independence across genes could upwardly bias the likelihoods of best-fit models in our inferences, model choice and parameter estimates will still be correct on average even with the scheme implemented here <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Varin1">[36]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our strategy also assumes that the genes of a pre-defined pathway are subject to similar evolutionary pressures. Simulation results indicate that this assumption does not compromise the performance of our method, as we observed robust inference to be the rule rather than the exception even in a quite heterogeneous pathway, if a proportion of the genes evolved under a rate shift model. Although we have used pathways defined by Gene Ontology in this study, our method can easily be applied to gene modules defined on the basis of protein or genetic interactions or coexpression. Any such module is likely to contain both activators and repressors, or other classes of gene function whose expression may be quantitatively tuned in response to selection by alleles with effects of opposite sign <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Maughan1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Howden1">[38]</xref>. The phylogenetic approach we have developed here is well-suited to detect these non-directional regulatory patterns, rather than relying on the coherence of up- or down-regulation of pathway genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Bullard1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Martin1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Fraser2">[39]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Fraser4">[41]</xref>. Ultimately, a given case of strong signal in our pathway evolution paradigm, when the best-fit model is one of lineage-specific accelerated regulatory evolution, can be explained either as a product of relaxed purifying selection or positive selection on pathway output. Our approach thus serves as a powerful strategy to identify candidates for population-genetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Martin1">[26]</xref> and empirical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Fraser3">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Booth1">[42]</xref> tests of the adaptive importance of pathway regulatory change. We have developed an R package, PIGShift (Polygenic Inverse Gamma rateShift), to facilitate the usage of our method. The pathway-level approach is not contingent on the Gaussian models of regulatory evolution we have used here, and future work will evaluate the advantages of compound Poisson process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Chaix1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Khaitovich1">[43]</xref> or more general Lévy process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Landis1">[44]</xref> models of gene expression, as well as models that account explicitly for sampling error in expression data.</p>
<p>The advent of RNA-seq has enabled expression surveys across non-model species in many taxa. Maximizing the biological value of these data requires methods that evaluate expression variation in the context of sequence divergence between species. As rigorous phylogenetic interpretation of expression data becomes possible, these measurements will take their place beside genome sequences as a rich source of hypotheses, in the search for the molecular basis of evolutionary novelty.</p>

<title>Basic model</title>
<p>Our basic assumption, following <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Chaix1">[10]</xref>, is that the average expression levels of genes in a pathway evolve as independent replicates of the same Brownian motion or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck process. However, instead of assuming that each gene in the pathway has the same rate of evolution, we allow the different genes in a pathway to draw their rate of evolution from a parametric distribution.</p>
<p>As a point of departure, we begin by considering the likelihood of a group of genes whose expression evolves independently, each with its own rate of evolution. Throughout, we use uppercase letters to represent random variables and matrices and lowercase letters to represent nonrandom variables. Assume that we have measured expression of the genes of a pathway in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> species, and that we have a fixed, time-calibrated phylogeny from genome sequence data describing the relationships between those species. We let <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> be the observations of the expression level of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>th gene of the pathway, in each of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> species. Both the Brownian- motion and Ornstein-Uhlenbeck (OU) models predict that the vector <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a draw from a multivariate normal distribution with variance-covariance matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a scalar—the rate of evolution—and the elements of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depend on whether evolution follows the Brownian or Ornstein-Uhlenbeck model; see below). Hence, the likelihood of the data is<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003255.e027"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e027" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a vector representing the mean expression value at the tips of the phylogenetic tree for gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<p>If we assume that there is no branch-specific directionality to evolution, we can avoid the need to estimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in either the Brownian motion model or the OU model by a renormalization of the data.

The inverse-gamma distribution has density<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003255.e050"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e050" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the gamma function and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are shape and scale parameters. The moments of this distribution are<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003255.e054"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003255.e055"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>from which it follows that the inverse-gamma distribution has no mean if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and no variance if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These properties allow for the distribution of rates of gene expression evolution in a pathway to be relatively broad; in addition, the inverse gamma density has no mass at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which prevents any gene in a pathway from not evolving at all. Also, as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> stays fixed, the distribution converges to a point mass at <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003255.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

To simulate under models in which each gene in a pathway evolves independently, we generated expression data for one gene at a time as follows. We first drew the rate of evolution from the appropriately parameterized inverse-gamma distribution.

<p>Bioinformatic analyses were conducted in Python and R. RNA-seq reads were stripped of their putative poly-A tails by removing stretches of consecutive Ts flanking the sequenced fragment; reads without at least two such Ts were discarded, as were reads with Ts at both ends. To ensure that expression data from hybrid diploids and purebred species could be compared, for each class of expression measurement for a given pair of species we mapped reads to both species genomes from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.saccharomycessensustricto.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.saccharomycessensustricto.org</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Scannell1">[27]</xref> using Bowtie <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003255-Langmead1">[49]</xref> with default settings and flags -m1 -×1000. These settings allowed us to retain only those reads that were unambiguously assigned to one of the two species in each pairwise comparison. A mapped read was inferred to have originated from the plus strand of the genome if its poly-A tail corresponded to a stretch of As at the 3′ end of the fragment, and a read was assigned to the minus strand if its poly-A tail corresponded to a stretch of Ts at the 5′ end of the fragment relative to the reference genome. To filter out cases in which inferred poly-A tails originated from stretches of As or Ts encoded endogenously in the genome, we eliminated from analysis all reads whose stretch of As or Ts contained more than 50% matches to the reference genome. In order to filter out cases of potential oligo-dT mispriming during cDNA synthesis, we also eliminated from analysis all reads that contained 10 or more As in the 20 nucleotides upstream of their transcription termination site.

For tandem gene pairs, the 3′ boundary of the upstream gene sense feature was set to 500 bp past the coding stop or the coding start of the downstream gene sense feature, whichever was closer; the 5′ boundary of the downstream gene sense feature was set to 50 bp upstream of its coding start or the 3′ end of the upstream gene sense feature, whichever was closer.</p>

In the case of lineage-specific shifts in evolutionary rate or universal selective constraint, one or more taxa will exhibit distinct densities of the normalized expression divergence measure. Thus, we generated each distribution in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g004">Figure 4</xref> by tabulating the log fold-change in expression between the indicated species and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, and then dividing this quantity by the divergence time between the indicated species and <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> according to the genome tree. After this normalization, if a pathway has been subject to accelerated regulatory evolution in one lineage, the distribution of expression log fold-changes corresponding to the species at the tip of that lineage will be wider than expected based on the length of the branch from DNA sequence, and hence it will stand out against the other distributions when plotted as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g004">Figure 4</xref>; likewise, constraint on expression evolution of a pathway in a particular species will manifest as a narrower distribution for that species. In the case of a pathway subject to the same degree of regulatory constraint on all branches of the yeast phylogeny, branch lengths ascertained from genome sequence will be large relative to the modest expression divergence, with the most dramatic disparity manifesting when divergent species are compared, yielding the narrowest distribution of normalized expression levels. When visualized as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003255-g004">Figure 4</xref>, the width of the distribution of log fold-changes across genes of the pathway in a given species will thus be inversely proportional to the species distance from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, with the narrowest distribution for <italic>S. bayanus</italic> and the widest for <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>.</p>
