<abstract>
<p>New promising avenues for the pharmacological treatment of skeletal and heart muscle diseases rely on direct sarcomeric modulators, which are molecules that can directly bind to sarcomeric proteins and either inhibit or enhance their activity. A recent breakthrough has been the discovery of the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil (OM), which has been shown to increase the power output of the cardiac muscle and is currently in clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure. While the overall effect of OM on the mechano-chemical cycle of myosin is to increase the fraction of myosin molecules in the sarcomere that are strongly bound to actin, the molecular basis of its action is still not completely clear. We present here a Molecular Dynamics study of the motor domain of human cardiac myosin bound to OM, where the effects of the drug on the dynamical properties of the protein are investigated for the first time with atomistic resolution. We found that OM has a double effect on myosin dynamics, inducing a) an increased coupling of the motions of the converter and lever arm subdomains to the rest of the protein and b) a rewiring of the network of dynamic correlations, which produces preferential communication pathways between the OM binding site and distant functional regions. The location of the residues responsible for these effects suggests possible strategies for the future development of improved drugs and the targeting of specific cardiomyopathy-related mutations.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cardiac myosin is a motor protein responsible for the contraction of the heart muscle. New strategies for the cure of heart diseases are currently being developed by using myosin modulators, which are small molecules that can interact with myosin and modify its activity. The advantage of this approach over traditional drugs is that by directly targeting cardiac myosin it is possible to have drugs with reduced side effects. Moreover, the availability of a spectrum of molecules to finely tune myosin to a desired level of activity opens the possibility to develop more precise and personalised drug therapies. In this work, we study a recently discovered activator of cardiac myosin, omecamtiv mecarbil, in order to understand its mechanism of action. In particular, we use Molecular Dynamics simulations to unravel the effects of the drug on myosin motions, which are closely related to its function. We find that omecamtiv has a strong effect on myosin dynamics and it changes the way regions of the protein that are critical for its function interact with each other. We use these data to identify genetic mutations associated with heart diseases that could be targeted by the drug and to suggest a possible route to design drugs with different therapeutic properties.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sarcomeric modulators are small molecules that can modify the function of proteins in the sarcomere, the fundamental repeating unit of skeletal and cardiac muscle cells. New promising avenues for the pharmacological treatment of different muscle and heart diseases rely on direct sarcomeric modulators, which are molecules that can directly bind to sarcomeric proteins and either inhibit or enhance their activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref001">1</xref>]. Part of the current research is focusing on modulators of myosin II, the motor protein responsible for muscle contraction, with different drugs either in preclinical development or in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref003">3</xref>]. The possibility to modulate myosin function by either up or down-regulating it is particularly appealing for the treatment of inherited cardiac diseases. Indeed, myosin mutations are associated with cardiomyopathies with different phenotypes, including hypertrophic (HCM) and dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM), and myosin modulators could be potentially used to counteract their damaging effect, with specific drugs tailored for specific mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref005">5</xref>].</p>
<p>The action of myosin modulators is closely related to the allosteric nature of the protein and in particular of its motor domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), which is the domain responsible for the hydrolysis of ATP and the conversion of the resulting chemical energy into mechanical work. The motor domain is composed of four main subdomains, namely the N-terminal (N-term, green), the upper 50-K (U50K, red), the lower 50-K (L50K, grey) and the converter (blue) subdomains, connected by linkers (cyan and yellow). The motor domain is then connected to the rest of the myosin molecule through the lever arm helix (blue), which is strongly coupled to the converter. According to most of the current models of the molecular mechanisms at the basis of myosin function, the relative orientation of the subdomains is controlled by the conformation of the linkers, which is in turn regulated by the biochemical state of myosin. In particular, Switch 2 (SW2), the relay helix and the SH1 helix adopt different conformations in the different stages of the acto-myosin cycle, where myosin switches from actin-bound to actin-unbound states according to the nature of the nucleotide bound to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The conformational changes occurring in the linkers are propagated and amplified by the reorientation of the subdomains connected to them, so that small changes in the ATP-binding site in the U50K subdomain can ultimately lead to the powerstroke, a large swinging motion of the lever arm that is caused by the rotation of the converter subdomain and is responsible for the production of mechanical work when myosin is bound to actin. The powerstroke conformational changes are reversed upon ATP binding and actin unbinding in the recovery stroke, which is the transition from the post-rigor to the pre-powerstroke state that restores the up position of the lever arm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref007">7</xref>].</p>

</fig>
<p>In addition to actin and ATP binding sites, the motor domain of myosins has different pockets that can be bound by small molecules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref009">9</xref>]. Allosteric modulators binding to these sites have been shown to affect myosin function in different ways and using different mechanisms. In particular, myosin II can be targeted by both inhibitors and activators. Most of the myosin II inhibitors discovered so far have been found to decrease the release of inorganic phosphate (Pi) after ATP hydrolysis, the rate limiting step of the acto-myosin cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref003">3</xref>]. While many of these molecules have been used only as research tools because of their toxicity, the recently developed MYK-461 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref005">5</xref>] and MYK-491 have passed the preclinical development stage and are currently in clinical trials [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref010">10</xref>]. In particular, MYK-461 has been tested in mouse models of HCM, where it is has been shown to slow down the progression of the disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref005">5</xref>]. Structural information on the binding site is available only for some of these inhibitors. Blebbistatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref011">11</xref>] binds to the 50-K cleft between the U50K and L50K subdomains, while the smooth muscle myosin inhibitor CK-571 has been recently shown to bind to a pocket between the relay and SH1 helices [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref012">12</xref>]. Interestingly, CK-571 uses a unique inhibition mechanism where the drug stabilises a previously unknown intermediate step along the recovery stroke and prevents myosin to reach the pre-powerstroke state, thus hindering the ATP hydrolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Myosin activators, namely compounds that enhance myosin activity instead of inhibiting it, have been relatively less studied [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref003">3</xref>]. A recent breakthrough in the pharmacological treatment of cardiac disease has been the discovery of the myosin activator omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref013">13</xref>]. The overall effect of OM on the acto-myosin cycle is to increase the duty ratio, which is the fraction of myosin molecules in the sarcomere that are strongly bound to actin. This effect is considered to result from an increase in the rate of transition from weakly to strongly bound states that leads to the faster release of Pi measured in the presence of actin[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref013">13</xref>]. The larger duty ratio causes an increase in the force produced by the sarcomere (ensemble force) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref004">4</xref>], so that the overall effect of OM binding is an increased heart contractility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref013">13</xref>]. At the same time, OM has been shown to have an inhibitory effect on the velocity of actin filaments in <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assays [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref015">15</xref>] and on the powerstroke rate in time resolved FRET experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref016">16</xref>], while contrasting results have been found when studying its effect on the actin-activated ATP hydrolysis rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>The increased force generation induced by OM makes it suitable for the treatment of heart conditions that are characterised by a decreased cardiac contractility. Indeed, OM is currently due to start phase III clinical trials for the treatment of heart failure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref017">17</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref018">18</xref>], after previous investigations showed that it was well tolerated and it had beneficial pharmacological effects such as an increased systolic function, a reduced left ventricular wall stress and a beneficial left ventricular remodelling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref024">24</xref>]. The trials did not show any evidence of the adverse effects observed with the administration of the drugs currently used to treat heart failure, such as increased heart rate, arrhythmias or hypotension, while the presence of other dose-dependent side effects (increased troponin levels and reduced diastolic filling times) will be further investigated in larger patient cohorts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref018">18</xref>].</p>
<p>Understanding the molecular basis of OM action is essential to design strategies for the development of new modulators and their tailoring to specific diseases. The opposing effects of OM on the kinetics of the acto-myosin cycle suggest that its binding has a complex effect on myosin at the atomistic level. Recent structural studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref008">8</xref>] showed that OM binds to a deeply buried pocket between the L50K and N-terminal subdomains, close to the SH1 helix and the converter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Since these regions are critical for the allosteric communication between the lever arm and the nucleotide binding site, it was suggested that OM can affect the coupling between the lever arm motion and the nucleotide state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref008">8</xref>]. Moreover, small differences were found between Apo and OM-bound structures of the central β-sheet. Modifications in this part of the protein were suggested to be related to the increase of strongly actin-bound states induced by OM since the central β-sheet is part of the transducer, the element of the motor domain that mediates the communication between the nucleotide and actin binding sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref025">25</xref>].</p>
<p>The lack of atomistic information on the OM-mediated modulation of myosin dynamics prompted us to perform Molecular Dynamics simulations on the cardiac motor domain bound to OM, where the effects of the drug on the dynamical properties of the protein are investigated for the first time with atomistic resolution. We find that OM has a double effect on myosin dynamics, inducing a) an increased coupling of the motions of the converter and lever arm subdomains to the rest of the protein, which produces a strong reduction in the amplitude of their motions and b) a rewiring of the network of dynamic correlations, which produces preferential communication pathways between the OM binding site and functional regions in the U50K subdomain. The residues and interactions mostly responsible for these effects are also identified and we discuss the possible use of these findings for the future development of improved drugs and the targeting of specific pathogenic mutations.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>Molecular Dynamics (MD) simulations were performed on the motor domain of human cardiac myosin (cMotorD) starting from the X-ray structures of the Apo and OM-bound state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref008">8</xref>]. Both structures were nucleotide-free. In addition to the motor domain, the simulated system also contained part of the lever arm helix (residues 769 to 783). In order to extend the exploration of the accessible conformational space and check for result reproducibility, four 300-ns simulations were run for each of the two binding states (Apo and OM-bound) using different initial coordinates for each simulation (A1, A2, B1 and B2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s001">S1 Table</xref>). These were generated by combining 1. two alternative conformations for the overall protein found in the X-ray structure (chains A and B), which represent the same myosin state in the actomyosin cycle (near-rigor state), but with subtle structural differences in the converter and lever arm region (Apo and OM-bound state) and in the transducer (OM-bound state only) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref008">8</xref>] and 2. two alternative models for the loops with missing experimental coordinates (loop models 1 and 2, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s028">S1 Text</xref>). Differences between the Apo and OM-bound state were considered as reproducible if they were consistent across the different replicas, indicating that they were independent from the initial starting structure. The total simulated time amounted to 2.4 μs (2 X 4 X 300 ns).</p>
<p>In the following, we will first analyse the intrinsic dynamics of cMotorD in the Apo state, focusing on the behaviour of the converter and lever arm domains (collectively referred to in the following as CLD). We will then discuss the effect of OM binding on CLD dynamics, together with long-range effects on the rest of cMotorD.</p>

<title>Uncoupled dynamics of the CLD in the unbound state of cMotorD</title>
<p>The overall dynamics of cMotorD during the Apo trajectories was first analysed in terms of the Root Mean Square Fluctuation (RMSF) of its C<sup>α</sup> atoms. A high flexibility was found for the long loops in the U50K (loop1 and cardiomyopathy loop) and L50K (loop2) subdomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g002">Fig 2</xref>), as expected on the basis of their length and of the disordered nature of loops 1 and 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref026">26</xref>]. Interestingly, large RMSF values were observed for the CLD and, to a less extent, the nearby SH3 domain and relay helix. These large amplitude motions of the CLD domain were found in all the Apo trajectories, albeit with a reduced extent for ApoB2, indicating that they are independent from either the overall initial conformation of the domain (chain A or B) or the loop model used (1 or 2).</p>

<p>The cMotorD dynamics was further investigated by identifying the collective motions with a Principal Component Analysis (PCA). PCA was performed on the C<sup>α</sup> atoms only and by excluding the modelled loops to reduce the noise from these disordered regions (Methods). The first two principal components (PC1 and PC2) of each trajectory, describing the most important collective motions observed during the simulation, accounted together for a significant portion of the overall variance (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s002">S2 Table</xref>), ranging from 33% (ApoB2) to 65% (ApoB1). Two recurring types of motions were found, involving mainly quasi-rigid rotations of the CLD around two different hinge axes, with hinge regions located in the SH1 helix and the relay helix/loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). These CLD motions were the main contributions to the PCs in almost all the cases, even if in different proportions, so that each type of rotation was found either in PC1 or in PC2 according to the specific simulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s011">S1 Fig</xref>). The exceptions were PC2 from ApoA2 and PC1 from ApoB2, where rotational motions of the upper 50K domain were found to be of comparable or larger amplitude than the CLD ones.</p>

<p>It is interesting to note that the CLD rotation described by PC1 (ApoA1) has similarities with the conformational changes occurring in the same region during the acto-myosin cycle. In particular, the transition from the post-rigor to pre-powerstroke state (‘recovery stroke’) as described by X-ray structures involves a rotation of the CLD around an axis with similar direction as PC1 and similar hinge regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), but with an amplitude much larger than the one observed here (~70° instead of ~ 30° in ApoA1). The CLD rotation in the recovery stroke is also known to be associated with the formation of a kink in the relay helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref006">6</xref>]. Remarkably, a significant bending of the relay helix was found during the ApoA1 and B1 simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g004">Fig 4</xref>). In particular, at the end of the ApoB1 simulation the helix formed a kink similar in amplitude and position to that found in the X-ray structures of the pre-powerstroke state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g004">Fig 4</xref>, left inset). The bent part of the helix was found to adopt different orientations in addition to those observed in the experimental structures. Overall, these data suggest that the motor domain can partially sample motions similar to those involved in the recovery stroke even in the absence of ATP.</p>

<p>To summarise this section, we found that the intrinsic dynamics of cMotorD in the Apo state is dominated by the CLD, which is relatively free to move as a quasi-rigid domain. These types of CLD motions, namely rigid rotations around hinges located in the SH1 and relay helices, are consistent with the changes associated with the actomyosin cycle, even if of smaller amplitude. Moreover, in two of the simulations the CLD motions were associated with a significant bending of the relay helix.</p>

<p>As mentioned above, OM binds to a critical region of cMotorD where it can interact with multiple subdomains at the same time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Indeed, the X-ray structures show that in both chain A and chain B conformations OM is in contact with residues of the N-terminal domain (A91, M92, L96, S118, G119, F121), the relay helix (M493, E497), the SH1 helix in the L50K subdomain (V698, G701, I702, C705) and the CLD (P710, N711, R712, L770)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref008">8</xref>].</p>

<p>OM was stably bound to the protein during the simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s012">S2A Fig</xref>). Its interactions with M90, A91, M92, L96, S118, M493, I702, C705, P710 and R712 were found to be particularly stable, since the OM-residue distance was below 4 Å for at least 50% of the frames in all the OM-bound trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s003">S3 Table</xref>). Chain A and chain B simulations produced similar contact fingerprints. Residues A91, S118, L120, C705, N711, R712 and K762 formed transient hydrogen bonding interactions with OM, which were dependent on the specific conformation adopted by OM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s014">S4 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s013">S3 Fig</xref>), while strong hydrophobic interactions with M90, A91, M92, L96, M493 and I702 were observed in all the simulations (side chains of non-polar residues within 4 Å from OM for at least 50% frames, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s003">S3 Table</xref>). The molecule was relatively flexible (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s012">S2B Fig</xref>), as expected from the fact that it adopts different conformations in the X-ray structures of chain A and chain B (blue and light blue sticks in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s012">S2C Fig</xref>). A cluster analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s028">S1 Text</xref>) performed on the concatenated trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s015">S5 Table</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s012">S2C Fig</xref>) showed that the most populated cluster (82%) was sampled almost equally in all the simulations (except for OMA1, where it contributes with a smaller proportion), with the representative structure having an RMSD from the X-ray structures of 2.2 (chain A) and 2.1 (chain B) Å (red sticks in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s012">S2C Fig</xref>, left panel). A significantly different conformation (cluster 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s005">S5 Table</xref>) was sampled for a short amount of time (2%) at the end of the OMA1 simulation, where the methyl-pyridinyl ring was shifted upwards toward the β1-β2 loop (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s012">S2C Fig</xref>, right panel). This conformation might be related to the restructuring of the OM binding pocket recently observed in the pre-powerstroke state, where the pocket is shifted upwards as a result of the lever arm motion during the recovery stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>The behaviour of the OM-binding site was further analysed by monitoring the inter-residue contacts in proximity of OM and comparing their stability with that found in the Apo trajectories (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s014">S4 Fig</xref>). OM-bound simulations in general presented a larger number of stable inter-residue contacts (inter-residue distance &lt; 4 Å for at least 70% of the simulation). OM-stabilised contacts were found between the N-terminal domain and the converter (T94-N711 for OMA simulations and T94-G771 for OMB), and the relay helix and the converter (Y501-R712 for OMA and E497-R712 and E500-K762 for OMB). Moreover, OMA trajectories showed additional hydrophobic contacts between the central β-sheet and the SH1 helix (F121-V698 and F121-G697) and the β-sheet and the relay helix (L120-F489), while stronger intra-CLD contacts (F709-R712 and N711-G768) were found in OMB trajectories. The reduced number of CLD OM-stabilised contacts found in chain A simulations is probably due to the small re-organisation of CLD observed in these trajectories. Indeed, chain A and B initial structures have small differences in the orientation of the CLD, with the chain B CLD slightly rotated in the direction of the recovery stroke (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s015">S5 Fig</xref>). During the OM-bound simulations, chain A relaxed towards the chain B conformation, while the chain B conformation was stable throughout the whole trajectory (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s016">S6 Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>The overall effect of OM on cMotorD interactions was then to enhance the contacts between the different subdomains that compose its binding site, both by directly interacting with them and by stabilising the inter-residue contacts around it. This had a dramatic effect on the overall flexibility of the protein, as shown by the RMSF profiles (lower panels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g002">Fig 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s017">S7 Fig</xref>). Indeed, a significant reduction in mobility was found for the CLD, together with the neighbouring SH3 domain and the SH1 and relay helices. Correspondingly, the first two collective motions (PC1 and 2), while showing a higher diversity across the OM-bound replicas compared to the Apo simulations, were consistently found to have higher contributions from the other subdomains (the upper domain for chain A simulations and either the N-terminal domain or the lower domain for chain B) rather than the CLD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g003">Fig 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s018">S8 Fig</xref>). Moreover, when the CLD contributed significantly to the PCs, its motion was correlated with the neighbouring subdomains rather than anti-correlated (insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). The overall amplitude of the global motions was also significantly reduced compared to the Apo simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s019">S9 Fig</xref>). The results obtained comparing the single simulations were confirmed by a PCA performed on the combined Apo and OM-bound trajectories (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s020">S10 Fig</xref>). The directions in the conformational space that best discriminate between the two binding states (43% of the overall variance) are represented by the two types of CLD hinged rotations observed in the single Apo simulations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s020">S10A Fig</xref>). A projection onto PC1 and 2 shows a clear separation of the Apo and OM simulations, since the Apo trajectories span a much larger range of values along both components while the OM trajectories are located in the same region of the space (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s020">S10B Fig</xref>). Finally, no significant bending was found for the relay helix in the presence of OM (blue hues and right inset in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g004">Fig 4</xref>). A comparison of representative structures from Apo and OM-bound trajectories is presented in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s021">S11 Fig</xref>, where it is possible to see the different arrangement adopted by the CLD and the relay helix at the end of the simulations.</p>
<p>The previous analysis indicates that the CLD motions found in the Apo simulations are significantly decreased in the presence of OM and that CLD moves in a concerted way with other subdomains rather than freely rotating around the SH1 hinge as was instead observed in the unbound state. In agreement with this, the comparison of the dynamical cross-correlation matrices (DCCM) showed that OM binding induces in all the simulations an increase of the correlations between the CLD and the rest of the protein (red lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g007">Fig 7</xref> and red dots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s022">S12 Fig</xref>), in particular the N-terminal domain, while at the same time decreasing the CLD intra-domain correlations (green lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g007">Fig 7</xref> and green dots in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s022">S12 Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>OM rewires the network of local correlations within cMotorD</title>
<p>The OM-induced changes in the dynamical correlation within cMotorD were further analysed by reconstructing the network of local correlated motions using the M32K25 Structural Alphabet (SA) (Methods). This type of analysis highlights correlations between changes in the conformational state of 4-residue fragments of the protein backbone during an MD simulation. While the PCs and the DCCM networks presented in the previous sections are usually dominated by hinge motions of quasi-rigid dynamical domains, local correlations represent more subtle effects involving correlated changes in the local shape of the protein backbone.</p>
<p>Local correlation networks were calculated for each simulation of the Apo and OM-bound state. A consensus network was then generated for each binding state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s028">S1 Text</xref>), resulting in two networks to be compared (Apo and OM). The networks were first analysed by calculating a preferential connection score ζ between each 4-residue fragment in the OM binding site and the rest of the cMotorD domain (Methods). Fragments with negative ζ values have a network distance from OM-binding fragments that is smaller than the average, so that they can be considered as preferentially connected to the OM-binding site. The scores obtained from the OM-bound simulations were then compared with the Apo ones and Δζ differences were calculated by subtracting the Apo from the OM-bound profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g008">Fig 8</xref>).

</fig>
<p>The ζ values in most of the functional regions show either no change or a decrease upon OM binding (Δζ &lt; 0), while increased values (Δζ &gt; 0) were usually observed outside these regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). This indicates that the OM-binding site tends to have a stronger preferential connection to the functional regions in OM-bound simulations compared to the Apo ones. Indeed, the Apo simulations showed either a reduced (smaller |ζ| values compared to the OM ones) or no preferential connection (ζ = 0) to these regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s024">S14 Fig</xref>). The most pronounced increases in preferential connection were observed for the G helix, the β5 strand and Switch 2 in the ATP binding site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), which consistently showed negative Δζ values for all the OM-binding site fragments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s023">S13 Fig</xref>). Increased preferential connections were also observed for the β3 and β4 strands and part of Loop 1 in most of the cases. Interestingly, mapping the mutations known to be associated with dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref028">28</xref>] onto the Δζ profiles (yellow points in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g008">Fig 8</xref>), shows that some of them are in regions preferentially connected to OM. In particular, I201T (Loop 1) and A223T (G helix) are found in functional regions with consistently negative Δζ values. This would suggest that their effect could potentially be counteracted by OM binding.</p>
<p>The ζ score changes induced by OM in regions related to myosin function suggest the presence of significant differences in the local correlation network of OM-bound and Apo states. To investigate this further, the shortest paths were determined between fragment V698 and the preferentially connected functional regions identified above (Methods). The comparison of the OM-bound and Apo results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g009">Fig 9A</xref>) shows that the endpoints are more directly connected in the OM-bound network (bottom panels) than the Apo one (top panels). As expected, the paths connecting the OM-binding site (V698, magenta) on one side and the functional regions (coloured cartoon) on the other involve a smaller number of edges (purple lines) and are thus shorter in terms of distance in the network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g009">Fig 9B</xref>) in the OM-bound simulations. The network representation also shows that the paths in the Apo networks involve more nodes that are distant in space from the end points compared to the OM-bound one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). Moreover, both networks contain a hub node with a large number of connections (fragment T177 for the OM-bound network and fragment C705 for the Apo one), but while T177 is directly connected to most of the functional regions, C705 needs to go through other nodes to reach the endpoints.</p>

<p>In order to identify the residues and interactions mostly involved in this reorganisation of the local correlation network, we analysed the modifications in inter-residue contacts induced by OM binding (i.e. contacts stabilised or destabilised by OM) in the region between the OM-binding site and the G-helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g010">Fig 10</xref>). Contact matrices were first determined for each Apo and OM-bound simulation by calculating the fraction of the trajectory for which each residue pair was found in contact. A consensus contact matrix was then derived for each binding state and the OM-Apo difference was used to obtain a matrix representing a network of contact changes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s028">S1 Text</xref>). Calculating the paths connecting V698 (magenta sphere) and the G-helix residues (red cartoon) in the network (yellow edges) shows chains of contact changes going through the two sides of the central β sheet. The side closer to Switch 2 contains the nodes with the largest number of paths going through them (larger spheres), suggesting that the corresponding residues (namely F121, N696, L693, T177, G178, I462, K246, Y266, L277 and A223) are important in mediating the effects on the local correlation network induced by OM binding. Interestingly, residues T177 and G178, which are part of the hub fragment T177 in the OM-bound local correlation network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g009">Fig 9A</xref>), are involved in most of the paths (83% of the paths contain either T177 or G178, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s006">S6 Table</xref>) and they participate in contacts that have among the largest changes in frequency upon OM binding (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s007">S7 Table</xref>).</p>

The edge thickness is proportional to the difference between OM and Apo contact frequency. For each pair of endpoints, the top 5 shortest paths are represented.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we used MD simulations to investigate the effect of the sarcomeric modulator omecamtiv mecarbil (OM) on cardiac myosin dynamics with atomistic resolution. Simulations were performed to reconstruct the sub-microsecond dynamics of the motor domain of cardiac myosin (cMotorD) in the absence and presence of OM, starting from the recently solved structures of the Apo and OM-bound cMotorD in the near-rigor state[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref008">8</xref>]. The light-chain containing regulatory domain (RD) was not considered here since no experimental structure is currently available for the cardiac isoform, however the simulated system included a small fragment of the lever arm helix. The regulatory role of the RD in cardiac myosin is mediated by the phosphorylation of a disordered portion of the regulatory light chain (RLC), which is thought to be involved in the regulation of the transition from an inactive (off) to an active (on) form of the two-headed myosin molecule in the thick filament [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref030">30</xref>]. OM has been shown to leave the RLC phosphorylation levels unchanged [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref031">31</xref>], suggesting that the molecular mechanisms mediated by OM are independent from those mediated by the RD.</p>
<p>To the best of our knowledge, the present simulations represent the first fully atomistic simulations of cardiac myosin bound to a small molecule modulator. Previous computational works have focused so far on the effect of nucleotide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref032">32</xref>] or actin binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref033">33</xref>] on myosin dynamics, the interactions between actin and myosin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref034">34</xref>], the release of Pi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref035">35</xref>], the modelling of the recovery stroke [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref036">36</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref039">39</xref>] or in general of the coupling between the actin binding site, the nucleotide binding site and the converter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref043">43</xref>]. A significant part of these studies used enhanced sampling techniques to accelerate the transitions between the different states in the actomyosin cycle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref044">44</xref>], while unbiased simulations with length &gt; = 50 ns have been performed only recently [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref045">45</xref>] thanks to the increase of the available computational power.</p>
<p>The simulations presented here show that, in the absence of OM, the dynamics of cMotorD is dominated by the hinge motions of the converter+lever arm helix subdomain (CLD). These have some resemblance to the CLD rotation observed during the transition from the experimental near-rigor to pre-powerstroke structure (recovery stroke) in that a) they involve similar hinge regions and b) they are associated with the bending of the relay helix. However, the CLD motions in the simulations seem to be more heterogeneous since, in addition to recovery stroke-like rotations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), the domain can perform rotations in other directions (e.g. Apo PC2 in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). Moreover, the amplitude of the rotations is much smaller than in the recovery stroke, which is expected on the basis of the length of the simulation and the absence of ATP. The motions observed here, while not representing an actual transition to the pre-powerstroke state and while they might have been enhanced by the absence of the Regulatory Domain, suggest a conformational selection scenario for the recovery stroke, where the type of motions involved in the stroke are already partially sampled by the CLD before the binding of ATP. This finding is in agreement with the emerging model that CLD rotation is stabilised by the closure of Switch 2 upon ATP binding rather than being induced by it, so that it can occur at least partially before the changes in the nucleotide binding site take place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref046">46</xref>]. This would also explain the recent observation that myosin can be trapped by inhibitors in intermediate states of the recovery stroke without closure of Switch 2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref012">12</xref>]. Moreover, a decoupling between Switch 2 and lever arm motions is consistent with the recent observation of a new structural state of Myosin VI where a large conformational change of Switch 2 does not produce a corresponding change in the lever arm position [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>OM is shown by the simulations to have a double effect on myosin dynamics. The first is to dramatically reduce the CLD motions observed in the Apo state and couple them to the rest of cMotorD, as indicated by the large decrease in CLD motions and the increase of positive correlation between the CLD and the other regions, in particular the SH3 subdomain in the N-terminal region. A possible role of this subdomain in myosin activation is also suggested by the recent observation that one of the few other myosin activators currently known might bind to SH3[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref048">48</xref>]. Our results indicate that OM acts as a “glue” between the different subdomains that compose its binding site, both by directly interacting with them and by stabilising pre-existing inter-domain interactions. This effect was observed albeit with different extent in all the simulations, indicating that it is independent from the specific starting conformation.</p>
<p>The second OM-induced effect emerging from the simulations is a reorganisation of the network of correlated local motions, which results in a more efficient and direct connection between the OM-binding site and functional regions compared to the Apo state. In particular, the networks show the formation of preferential pathways between the OM binding site and distant U50K regions close to ATP binding site, namely the G helix and Switch 2. The communication between sites is mediated by a chain of OM-induced contact changes involving residues in the central β-sheet. Preferential connections in the dynamic correlation networks have been previously observed to be involved in allosteric communication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref049">49</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results thus indicate that OM can modulate the cMotorD dynamics through at least two different molecular mechanisms, which would explain its complex and apparently contradictory effects on the kinetic parameters of the actomyosin cycle[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref016">16</xref>]. In particular, assuming that OM can induce similar effects on the pre-powerstroke state, the reduction of CLD rotational motions upon OM binding might explain the strong reduction in the powerstroke rotation rate measured with FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref016">16</xref>] and the overall decrease of the actin sliding velocity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref015">15</xref>]. This inhibitory effect on the lever arm motions is considered to be consistent with the overall increase in muscle contractility produced by OM binding, since it increases the fraction of time spent by myosin in the force generating state where it is strongly bound to actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref016">16</xref>]. On the other hand, the enhanced correlation with the G helix and Switch 2 might be related to the change in the number of myosin molecules strongly bound to actin. Indeed, the G helix has been shown to move concertedly with Switch 1 during the opening of the actin binding site when myosin dissociates from actin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref040">40</xref>]. Changes in the conformation and/or dynamics of the G helix could affect the energetics of the reverse process, where strongly bound myosin states are produced upon closure of the actin binding site. Moreover, a Pi release mechanism involving mainly Switch 2 rather than Switch 1 motions has been recently suggested on the basis of a newly found structural state of Myosin VI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>During the revision process of this paper, a new OM-bound structure has become available, where OM is bound to the pre-power stroke state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref027">27</xref>]. Simulations using the same protocol will confirm whether OM has similar effects on the dynamics of this state, which is further down the actomyosin cycle. Moreover, simulating the transition between the near-rigor state studied in this work and the pre-power stroke state will allow the quantification of possible effects on the energy landscape of the recovery stroke, in particular on the relative stability of the two states and the energy barrier between them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref050">50</xref>].</p>
<p>Our findings suggest that the future development of OM-based drugs could act on two different sets of molecular features to produce novel compounds with improved action. In particular, changes in the interactions with the central β-sheet could modify the strength of the preferential connection to regions close to the ATP binding site and ultimately the transition to strongly bound states. On the other hand, modifications in the interactions with the N-terminal domain or the CLD could change the degree of coupling between the CLD and the rest of cMotorD and thus its rate of rotation during the powerstroke. Obtaining an optimal balance between these two effects could be essential to produce drugs with reduced side effects or specific therapeutic properties.</p>
<p>The present results can also be used to identify specific pathogenic mutations to be targeted by OM. Indeed, small molecule activators of myosin have been previously proposed as possible drugs to counteract the effect of dilated cardiomyopathy (DCM) mutations, since these are usually associated with a decrease of the power output of the cardiac muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref004">4</xref>]. Comparing the distribution of the currently known DCM mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref028">28</xref>] with the regions preferentially connected to the OM-binding site can give information on the mutants that are most likely to be directly affected by OM binding (yellow dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005826.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Mutations I201T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref051">51</xref>] (Loop1) and A223T [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref052">52</xref>] (G helix) are particularly interesting since a) they are located in regions with high preferential connection and b) they are far from the OM binding site, so they are less likely to directly interfere with the drug binding. Further investigations on OM-bound mutants will be able to highlight if OM has a rescuing effect on them, namely if it can reverse any effect induced by these mutations on the structural and dynamical properties of myosin.</p>

<p>The initial structure of the motor domain of the human β-cardiac myosin (residues 1 to 783 of UniProt sequence P12883) was extracted from the Protein Data Bank (PDB) for the OM-bound (PDB ID: 4PA0) and Apo (PDB ID: 4P7H) state[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref008">8</xref>]. Both structures are nucleotide-free. Two chains (A and B) were found in both PDB files, which show structural differences in the converter, lever arm and central β-sheet. Simulations were started from both chains and labelled accordingly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s001">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>Homology modelling was used to model unsolved parts of the protein in the X-ray structure, which included loops localised either in the actin-binding region or in the converter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s008">S8 Table</xref>). MODELLER 9.15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref053">53</xref>] was used to model the missing loops by keeping the rest of the structure unchanged, using as templates structures from chicken skeletal (PDB ID: 1M8Q) and smooth (PDB ID: 1BR1) muscle myosin. Since these loops were expected to be highly flexible, to make sure that the results obtained from the simulations were not dependent on their specific initial structure, two different initial loop conformations were generated. These were then used as starting points to run two different replicas for each system (<italic>x</italic> = 1 or 2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s001">S1 Table</xref>), resulting in a total number of eight different MD simulations (further details on loop modelling can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s028">S1 Text</xref>).</p>

<title>MD simulation setup and protocol</title>
<p>The protein was described using the Amber99SB*-ILDN force field, which has been extensively tested for its ability to reproduce the correct relative stability of secondary structure elements and side-chain conformations in proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref054">54</xref>]. For compatibility with the force field used for the protein, the OM ligand was described using parameters from the General Amber Force Field (GAFF) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref055">55</xref>]. PyMOL (version 1.8.2.0) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref056">56</xref>] was used to add the hydrogen atoms to the OM structure and generate the connectivity table. The Antechamber and tLeap tools from the AmberTools 15 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref057">57</xref>] suite were used to generate the files with the OM topology and force field parameters, together with the initial coordinates.

<p>All MD simulations were performed using GROMACS 4.6.7 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref060">60</xref>]. Each system was solvated using a truncated octahedral box of TIP3P water molecules. Periodic boundary conditions were applied, using the Particle Mesh Ewald (PME) method for electrostatic interactions, a 9-Å cutoff for the direct space sums and for van der Waals interactions, and long-range corrections to the dispersion energy. Energy minimisation of each system was followed by equilibration first in NVT (T = 300 K) and then in NPT conditions (T = 300 K, p = 1 bar) for a total 6.5 ns. Production NPT runs were then performed for 300 ns, saving the coordinates every 1 ps. The stability of the simulations was checked by monitoring the Root Mean Square Deviation (RMSD) from the initial structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s026">S16 Fig</xref>) and the time evolution of the DSSP secondary structure annotation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s027">S17 Fig</xref>).

<title>Analysis of MD trajectories</title>
<p>The Principal Component Analysis (PCA) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref061">61</xref>] was performed with GROMACS using C<sup>α</sup> atoms coordinates of snapshots extracted from the production trajectory every 100 ps. The trajectories were then projected onto the PCs associated with the two largest eigenvalues (PC1 and PC2). PCs were analysed using the DynDom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref062">62</xref>] software, which can be used to identify dynamic domains in the protein and their relative motion. DynDom also determines hinge regions at the interface between the domains and rotational axes. A PCA was performed also on a pseudo-trajectory obtained by combining the last 100 ns of all the Apo and OM-bound trajectories.</p>
<p>The correlation networks were generated by calculating the dynamical cross-correlation (DCC) matrices with Wordom [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref063">63</xref>] using C<sup>α</sup> atoms coordinates of snapshots extracted from the production trajectory every 100 ps. Multiple matrices were first generated by calculating time averages over 5 ns. Averaging over these matrices produced the final DCC matrix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref064">64</xref>].</p>
<p>The calculation and analysis of local correlation networks was performed as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref049">49</xref>]. In brief, local conformational changes and their correlation were described using the M32K25 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref065">65</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref066">66</xref>] Structural Alphabet (SA), namely a collection of fragments of 4 consecutive C<sup>α</sup> atoms representing prototypical backbone conformations. The correlation of conformational changes in a pair of protein fragments is calculated as normalized Mutual Information (MI) between the two sequences of SA letters representing the different conformations explored by the fragments during the simulation. As previously shown, MI networks can be used to describe allosteric transmission pathways in proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref049">49</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref067">67</xref>]. In particular, transmission pathways between two regions can be identified by calculating the set of shortest paths connecting them in the MI network. If a source site is selected (e.g. an allosteric site), it is possible to detect the regions in the protein that have a preferential connection with it by identifying the fragments that are closer to the source site than the average [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref049">49</xref>]. The SA analysis was performed on C<sup>α</sup> atoms coordinates extracted every 1 ps. The statistical significance of the MI values was determined by generating a random background distribution of 1000 samples as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref049">49</xref>]. Fragments are labelled in the text using the first residue of the fragment.</p>
<p>The matrix of OM-Apo contact changes was derived by first calculating the frequency of inter-residue contacts for each Apo and OM-bound simulation. Two residues were considered to be in contact if the minimum distance calculated over all the pairs of non-hydrogen atoms was &lt; 4 Å. A consensus contact matrix was then calculated from the four simulations of each binding state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s028">S1 Text</xref>). The final matrix of OM-Apo contact changes was derived by subtracting the Apo consensus matrix from the OM one and calculating the absolute value, so that elements different from 0 indicate contacts that are either stabilised or destabilised upon OM binding.</p>
<p>In order to remove the noise from the modelled loops, most of which showed a high flexibility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s017">S7 Fig</xref>), the PCs and DDC, MI and contact change matrices were calculated considering only the residues solved in the starting X-ray structures (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005826.s008">S8 Table</xref> for a list of the excluded residues). All the residues in the protein were used for the RMSD, RMSF and secondary structure analyses.</p>
<p>The analyses were performed using GROMACS and GSATools [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref068">68</xref>], together with in-house R scripts using the Bio3D [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005826.ref069">69</xref>] library.
