        <p>Mosquito host-seeking behavior and heterogeneity in host distribution are important factors in predicting the transmission dynamics of mosquito-borne infections such as dengue fever, malaria, chikungunya, and West Nile virus. We develop and analyze a new mathematical model to describe the effect of spatial heterogeneity on the contact rate between mosquito vectors and hosts. The model includes odor plumes generated by spatially distributed hosts, wind velocity, and mosquito behavior based on both the prevailing wind and the odor plume. On a spatial scale of meters and a time scale of minutes, we compare the effectiveness of different plume-finding and plume-tracking strategies that mosquitoes could use to locate a host. The results show that two different models of chemotaxis are capable of producing comparable results given appropriate parameter choices and that host finding is optimized by a strategy of flying across the wind until the odor plume is intercepted. We also assess the impact of changing the level of host aggregation on mosquito host-finding success near the end of the host-seeking flight. When clusters of hosts are more tightly associated on smaller patches, the odor plume is narrower and the biting rate per host is decreased. For two host groups of unequal number but equal spatial density, the biting rate per host is lower in the group with more individuals, indicative of an attack abatement effect of host aggregation. We discuss how this approach could assist parameter choices in compartmental models that do not explicitly model the spatial arrangement of individuals and how the model could address larger spatial scales and other probability models for mosquito behavior, such as Lévy distributions.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mosquito-borne diseases can spread when a mosquito bites a vertebrate host to obtain a blood meal for egg-laying. The first step in the transmission process consists of the mosquitoes seeking and finding a host. Mosquitoes use the wind direction and odors, such as carbon dioxide, emitted by the hosts in order to locate a host to bite. We present a spatial computational model of the host-seeking process in a region where hosts are heterogeneously distributed in clusters. The model is used to analyze the success in finding hosts once the mosquitoes are close to the host. We show that the number of mosquito-host contacts increases as hosts become more widely spaced within their clusters; that mosquito flight perpendicular to the wind leads to greater success in locating a host; and that the number of bites per host decreases when hosts aggregate into larger clusters.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The transmission of infectious agents is heterogeneous in the sense that the risk for infection and infectiousness are unevenly distributed over the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Woolhouse1">[1]</xref>. This heterogeneity is an important factor in predicting the spread of an infection; ignoring it may result in misleading inference about transmission dynamics by underestimating the probability that an infectious agent will persist <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Hasibeder1">[2]</xref>. Sources of heterogeneity in mosquito-borne disease transmission include uneven distribution of hosts and breeding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Smith1">[3]</xref>, differences in host susceptibility to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Smith2">[4]</xref>, and the nonuniform distribution of mosquito bites among spatially distributed hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dye1">[5]</xref> (per-capita biting rates). The number of mosquitoes that bite a host depends, among other things, on the number that find it. Host finding by mosquitoes is largely driven by olfactory cues that are given off by individual hosts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Lehane1">[6]</xref>. The spatial arrangement of hosts is likely to affect the spatial distribution of the odor plume and thus the mosquitoes' ability to locate and feed on them. For example, it may be easier for a mosquito to find a large roost of birds than to find an single bird. Unless the probability of finding a host is exactly proportional to the density of hosts, unevenly distributed contact rates on individual hosts, and thus heterogeneous disease transmission, will result. Understanding the dynamics of odor-driven mosquito-host interaction is fundamental to a detailed mechanistic understanding of mosquito-borne transmission.</p>
      <p>Despite its important epidemiological implications, experimental data on the relationship between host aggregation and mosquito-host contact rates are sparse, and thus, little is known definitively about mosquito strategies for finding hosts. The goal of this work is to propose a modeling framework that can provide preliminary insights into the relative effectiveness of different host-seeking strategies used by mosquitoes. In this paper, we develop, assess, and utilize a mathematical model to simulate both the odor plume in the presence of wind and the host-seeking behavior of mosquitoes in response to that odor plume. Mosquitoes are modeled as discrete <italic>agents</italic> that fly continuously in search of discrete hosts (birds). The flight direction and speed of individual mosquitoes is influenced by wind and odors emitted by the hosts. The wind is composed of a deterministic, large-scale component plus a stochastic component to represent small-scale eddies and fluctuations. In this study we focus on mosquito host-seeking behavior within meters of a host, motivated by indoor experiments involving mosquito-bird interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Foppa1">[7]</xref>. The <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Discussion</xref> section describes the potential for larger scale simulations that incorporate more of the host-seeking process. We hope that the model may serve as a virtual laboratory for testing different hypotheses for how mosquitoes use odor plumes to locate potential hosts and may offer guidance both to the planning of experimental studies and to the interpretation of experimental data.</p>
      <p>This contribution joins a group of other important mathematical models for simulating the host-seeking dynamics of mosquitoes. Commonly, models are based on parameters such as contact rates and probabilities (of feeding, diversion, dying, etc.). Often these models assume homogeneous mixing and do not include space explicitly, so that the probabilities and contact rates are independent of location. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Killeen1">[8]</xref>, the authors describe a kinetic, non-spatially explicit model to determine how much coverage is enough to protect individuals who do not use insecticide-treated nets (ITNs) in the context of malaria transmission. The model has also been modified to explore the effects of bed nets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Killeen2">[9]</xref> and to introduce ‘bloodless’ hosts such as baited traps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Okumu1">[10]</xref>. The latter also modeled the host-seeking process as a non-host oriented kinesis followed by a host-oriented taxis once the mosquito has encountered an odor cue. A related model for the mosquito feeding cycle addressing the effect of ITNs on malaria transmission is found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-LeMenach1">[11]</xref>. One model that does include space explicitly is that in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Pasternak1">[12]</xref> for plume finding in the context of an underwater substrate. The authors use a model in which the probability of detecting the plume depends on the seeker's movements, on the fluid motion, and on the plume shape in space and time. They report that as plume-detection success increases, the efficiency decreases (the process is slow). Our results are consistent with this observation.</p>

        <title>Mosquito host-seeking behavior</title>
        <p>We provide a review of the biological literature that influenced our modeling choices. The scenario that we consider is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, where hosts are distributed in groups, or patches, and they emit an odor (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) that gets carried by and diffused in the wind in the same way that a puff of smoke dissipates in time. Uniform, laminar wind extends host odor into a long, thin plume with sharp transverse gradients and shallow longitudinal gradients. If the wind is turbulent, the odor plume is highly intermittent, but still retains relatively shallow average longitudinal gradients compared to the transverse gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Vickers1">[13]</xref>. We class mosquito host-seeking behavior as either <italic>plume finding</italic>, which is flight in search of an odor plume, or <italic>plume tracking</italic>, which is flight within the odor plume (these terms are adopted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Pasternak1">[12]</xref>).</p>

          <title>Plume finding: Absence of odor cues</title>
          <p>There is little consensus in the literature about mosquito host-seeking behavior in the absence of odor cues. If wind is absent, orientation may be determined by large visual features in the environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Bidlingmayer1">[14]</xref> or may be characterized as a directionally unbiased random walk, also called <italic>kinesis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Okumu1">[10]</xref>. If wind is present, then mosquitoes may deliberately choose to fly upwind, downwind, or crosswind in search of a host, which are types of directional searching referred to as <italic>anemotaxis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Clements1">[15]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Each of the three anemotactic behaviors has been described as plausible based on either experimental or theoretical work. Mosquitoes typically fly upwind in laboratory wind tunnels even when there is no odor present <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dekker1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gibson1">[17]</xref>. In wind tunnel experiments, a low velocity artificial wind is blown across an odor source down an enclosure toward a mosquito entrance. Mosquitoes are released into the tunnel and their flight path is videotaped. In control experiments where no odor is added to the wind, many mosquitoes fly upwind and some even locate the “source” – the wind entrance into the tunnel. However, a set of field experiments reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gillies1">[18]</xref> provided evidence for downwind flights in host-seeking <italic>Mansonia</italic> spp. In these experiments, a human subject was surrounded on the downwind side by a tall, hemispherical fence of radius 18 m, to exclude mosquitoes using an upwind search strategy. By comparison with controls, the authors concluded that some mosquitoes employ a downwind plume-finding strategy. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dusenbery1">[19]</xref> it is argued using geometry that crosswind searching is the most effective when the odor plumes are long and thin. If the variability of the wind direction is greater than 30 degrees, then a mathematical argument shows that upwind or downwind searching is optimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Sabelis1">[20]</xref>.</p>
          <p>Mosquito response to wind depends on the strength of the wind. A typical mosquito flight speed is 1 m/s <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Clements1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gibson1">[17]</xref>. As reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Service1">[21]</xref>, mosquitoes fly faster than the wind speed when they are in the low velocity boundary layer that forms adjacent to the ground. If they ascend too far (especially during the daytime when turbulence is greater), they are swept up and transported passively for long distances. Some mosquitoes may have adapted to use this as a deliberate migration mechanism. However, most of the flights that mosquitoes make are short-range, appetitive flights seeking a blood meal or oviposition site near the mosquito's home territory. Appetitive flights are disrupted by sufficiently high wind speeds, although the wind speeds at which this happens vary by species and geographic region. Wind speeds as low as 0.8 m/s (3 km/h) have been reported to drastically reduce the number of mosquito host-seeking flights, but no reduction in mosquito flight was documented in other situations for speeds as high as 3–8 m/s (11–29 km/h).</p>

          <title>Plume tracking: Presence of odor cues</title>
          <p>When a mosquito encounters an odor plume, it uses the odor plume and the wind to guide its flight to locate the host. Odor cues are complex olfactory signals released from a host's skin and breath. Many compounds are known to excite the chemoreceptors of mosquitoes. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for example, is an important component in the odor plume that activates and helps maintain plume tracking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gibson1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Bowen1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gillies2">[23]</xref>. Laboratory wind tunnel experiments indicate that sustained flight only occurs in the presence of an intermittent <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> signal and not in uniform concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gillies2">[23]</xref>. Other wind tunnel experiments suggested that broad, well-mixed <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> plumes may inhibit upwind flight while turbulent plumes of the same concentration induce upwind flight <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dekker1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dekker2">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dekker3">[25]</xref>. The importance of lactic acid, various aldehydes, and whole host odors for the location of hosts by mosquitoes has also been demonstrated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dekker1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Bowen1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dekker3">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Syed1">[26]</xref>. Dekker et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Dekker3">[25]</xref> note that there is not a single model that fits mosquito flight response to all relevant host odors, even within a single species.</p>
          <p>Mosquitoes exhibit different behavior in windy and windless conditions. In the absence of wind within the odor plume, mosquitoes must rely solely on odor cues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Vickers1">[13]</xref> or on large features in the visual environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Bidlingmayer1">[14]</xref>. Mosquitoes probably estimate the direction of odor increase (the gradient) by the mechanism of <italic>klinotaxis</italic>, as is conjectured for tsetse flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Card1">[27]</xref>. During klinotaxis, an organism samples the host odor at one location, then moves and samples it again, using its memory of the concentration to choose the next direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Vickers1">[13]</xref>.

        <p>In most of the simulations in this paper, we consider length scales and time frames consistent with the mosquitoes being in close proximity to the hosts.

The hosts are situated in the middle of the domain, 5 m from the top and bottom domain edges (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g002">Fig. 2</xref>). Initially, the domain is bare of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and it takes about 45 seconds for the plume to reach the domain edge. At that point, the mosquitoes are released into the domain, with starting positions dependent on their particular flight behavior. For upwind plume-finding behavior, the mosquitoes are all released downwind of the hosts; for downwind and crosswind behaviors, the entry is along the upwind side of the domain.</p>

          <p>One might expect that perfect knowledge of the gradient would result in better performance than perfect knowledge of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> concentration. However, the model includes a window around the gradient direction from which the direction of motion is chosen randomly; in other words, the knowledge of the gradient is imperfect. We find that sufficiently imperfect knowledge of the gradient direction can result in overall behavior that is comparable to the sampling method (with different parameter values). This is an important observation since many existing models use the popular Keller-Segel approach that assumes knowledge of the concentration gradient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Keller1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Horstmann1">[32]</xref>.</p>
          <p>We placed nine hosts in a regular square grid at 1 ft (0.3 m) intervals in the center of the simulation region in the presence of a meandering velocity field. We examined upwind, downwind, and crosswind plume-finding behaviors, each in combination with the gradient and sampling methods for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sensing. For the gradient method, we used the parameters <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (40 ppm/meter), and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (7900 ppm/meter). The last two parameters are analogous to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the sampling method. See Eq. (2) for the formula governing the wind and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002500-t001">Table 1</xref> for all other simulation parameters. For convenience, all numerical simulations were computed using dimensionless variables, but we report parameters in dimensional units.</p>
          <p>We also simulated a random walk strategy (with equal probability of stepping in all directions) in which the odor plume is not sensed at all and the wind has no effect. This mimics mosquito dispersal (mathematical diffusion) independent of the chemical concentration and wind. The comparison of the chemotactic rules to this random walk provides a baseline for determining how different two rules are. The random walk mosquitoes started at the same location as the downwind strategy, but chose a direction at every time step from a uniform distribution on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Their speed was constantly <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the same speed as the plume-finding behavior of the host-seeking mosquitoes. There are many other possible choices for random walks; see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Pasternak1">[12]</xref>.</p>
          <p>The proportion (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of mosquitoes that found a host after 150 s is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g004">Fig. 4</xref> for all the mosquito heuristics discussed above. The values shown in the bar graph are averages over 15 simulations in which the time series of random velocity fields is fixed, but the mosquito behavior stochastically varies. The thin error bars represent <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> standard deviations. The random walk (black bars) had by far the fewest contacts, while the gradient and sampling methods have overlapping error bars. After 500 s, there was almost no change in either of the host-seeking methods, but the proportion of mosquitoes that found a host during the random walk increased to 0.25.</p>

          <p>For these particular parameter choices, the gradient method and sampling method show similar results and both are substantially different than a random walk. There are enough free parameters in our model of host-seeking so that behavioral heuristics based on either spatial gradient sensing or temporal sampling can deliver approximately the same results. Since mosquitoes almost certainly navigate using klinotaxis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Card1">[27]</xref>, we will use the sampling method in the remainder of this work. However, we emphasize that our observations support the use of the Keller-Segel model of gradient sensing as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Keller1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Horstmann1">[32]</xref>.</p>

          <p>The goal of this paper is to characterize the effect of host aggregation and mosquito plume-finding behavior on the mosquito-host contact rate for the parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002500-t001">Table 1</xref>. In this section, we consider a single host distribution and locally vary a subset of our model parameters independently to assess the robustness of the model with respect to our target parameter set. We find (with a few exceptions) that the parameter set we use with our model is robust to small changes in input parameters.</p>
          <p>We simulated crosswind, downwind, and upwind plume-finding behaviors in the presence of a straight odor plume produced by an arrangement of nine hosts spaced 1 ft (0.3 m) in a square patch in the center of the domain. For each plume-finding behavior, we varied each of the ten starred parameters in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002500-t001">Table 1</xref> by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> while holding all other parameters constant. To capture the average mosquito behavior, the simulations were repeated 15–20 times for each plume-finding behavior (upwind, downwind, and crosswind), until a mild convergence criterion was satisfied. In each set of simulations, we used the same sequence of random velocity fields and the same set of random numbers for mosquito behavior, so that the differences between sets were due solely to the parameter perturbations and not to the stochastic nature of the agents or wind. We analyzed two output variables:</p>

          <p>A local sensitivity index, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is a partial derivative of an output variable with respect to an input parameter that is scaled to allow comparisons across variables. High sensitivities are synonymous with large rates of change, while low sensitivities (and model robustness) are associated with small derivatives. The sign of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> indicates if the change is in the same direction (positive) or the opposite direction (negative) as the perturbation.

      <p>We use the model introduced in the previous section to address several questions pertaining to space-dependent small-scale plume encounter and host localization.</p>

        </list-item>
      </list>
      <p>In the following subsections, we describe the simulations addressing these questions and we summarize our findings. We find that the most contacts occur when the mosquitoes use a crosswind strategy and are allowed sufficient time to either find a host or leave the domain permanently. We conclude that the larger of two unequally-sized groups has a smaller per capita number of contacts. Finally, we find that the number of contacts increases as hosts occupy a larger subregion within the computational domain.</p>

        <title>Assessing plume-finding behavior</title>
        <p>Intuitively, a crosswind flight strategy should result in a larger number of contacts than upwind or downwind behavior if the plume is straight. This is because mosquitoes close to the plume are more likely to intercept it if their motion is primarily crosswind. But for a meandering plume, it is not obvious if a crosswind flight strategy is more effective than an upwind or downwind strategy. We simulated mosquito behavior in both straight and meandering plumes and recorded the proportion of mosquitoes that found a host and the average time that it took a mosquito to locate a host. We estimated the effectiveness of each plume-finding behavior using these results and found that a crosswind strategy is superior to upwind and downwind strategies, but is less efficient.</p>
        <p>The odor plumes were produced by a regular arrangement of nine hosts with a density of 1 host per 1 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e218" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (0.09 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e219" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) located in a single small patch in the center of the square simulation domain. The time series of random velocity fields superposed over the large-scale flow was the same for all simulations. See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002500-t001">Table 1</xref> for parameter choices and Eq. (2) for the formula for the meandering plume. An example of the general form of the meandering plume is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g005">Fig. 5</xref>, alongside a straight plume for comparison. The meandering plume covers more area and achieves a greater width than the straight plume. The outermost contour in both plots is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e220" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e221" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sensing threshold of the mosquito. The other contours are equally divided between <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e222" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the maximum concentration within each plume. The meandering plume has a maximum concentration that is approximately three times higher than that of the straight plume. Since the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e223" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sources are the same in both simulations, the concentration difference is due solely to the differing velocity fields.</p>

        <title>Assessing host distribution</title>
        <p>We explored the number of contacts that occur in two host groups of equal density but unequal number. An equal per capita contact rate across both host groups would indicate that distributing the hosts into two separate patches has no effect. However we found unequal per capita rates between groups, indicating that a mosquito is less likely to detect a large group of hosts than it is to detect the same number of hosts distributed in smaller groups or as individuals. We also found unequal numbers of contacts between two unequally-sized groups, indicating that one group was easier to find than the other.</p>
        <p>We performed a set of simulations in which we held the total number of hosts constant in the domain (10 birds), but split them between two groups in pairs of 9 and 1, 8 and 2, etc., down to 5 and 5 hosts per group. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g002">Fig. 2</xref> shows an example of the 7-3 distribution. All other parameters were the same as in the previous section for the straight plume. The two straight plumes from the host groups were well separated from each other and from the left and right domain edges. The exact positions of the hosts were allowed to vary from one simulation to the next, and this affected the plume shape and the internal distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e235" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> over the plume.</p>
        <p>To compare results between groups we plotted the ratio of the mosquito-host contacts in the smaller group divided by the mosquito-host contacts in the larger group (S/L) against the ratio of the number of hosts in the smaller group over the larger group (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). Each point in the error bar plot shows the mean and standard deviation over 150 simulations for each S/L ratio. The diagonal line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g006">Fig. 6</xref> denotes the case when the per capita contact rates are the same between groups. A value of 1 on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e236" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the case when the number of contacts was the same between both groups. When there are 5 hosts in both groups the number of contacts is the same, confirming that there is no left-right bias in the velocity field. When the group sizes are unequal, the per capita contact rates are higher in the small group, but the total number of contacts is higher in the large group (except for the nearly equal 6-4 distribution). This occurs in the region between the lines <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e237" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e238" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <title>Assessing changing host density</title>
        <p>In this section, we consider the effect of varying host density given a constant number of hosts. Intuitively, the size of the region where the hosts are congregated will affect the number of mosquito-host contacts for two reasons. First, a larger host area is more likely to be found by mosquitoes; second, the spatial arrangement of the hosts affects the size and shape of the odor plume they generate. We performed a set of simulations in which 10 hosts were distributed in a single patch in the center of the domain. Patch area was varied from 10–80 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e241" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (1–7.4 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e242" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) with a corresponding host density varying from 1–8 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e243" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> per host (0.1–0.74 <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e244" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>).

        <title>Assessing plume-finding behavior</title>
        <p>Our results generally show that crosswind plume finding most reliably led mosquitoes to a blood meal source. The effectiveness of the crosswind strategy over periods of minutes is compatible with the conclusions of the mark-release-recapture studies of <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic> Giles in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gillies3">[34]</xref>, where the dispersion of recaptured mosquitoes was related primarily to the distribution of human settlements (over time scales of days). We find that this effectiveness was accompanied by a high cost in time, as also seen in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Pasternak1">[12]</xref>. If the success of host location was restricted to occur within 35 s of mosquito release, then crosswind flight was the superior strategy only in a straight odor plume. In a meandering plume under the time limit, up- and downwind searching were better than crosswind flight. These results are similar to the conclusions drawn by Sabelis and Schippers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Sabelis1">[20]</xref>, who used a geometric argument to show that crosswind plume finding is less effective when wind direction is highly variable.</p>

      <sec id="s4b">
        <title>Assessing host distribution</title>
        <p>When hosts were arranged in two groups of different size, the larger group consistently attracted more mosquitoes regardless of the plume-finding strategy, although the difference was less pronounced for crosswind flight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g006">Fig. 6</xref>). At the same time, the smaller group experienced a higher per capita contact rate. These results are consistent with Foppa et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Foppa1">[7]</xref>, which reports on indoor experiments of <italic>Cx. quinquefasciatus</italic> feeding on roosting chickens. They found that the per capita feeding rate on a single chicken was about 4.27 times higher than that on a chicken in a group of nine. We find similar mean per capita ratios (4.3 and 4.4) for the upwind and downwind plume-finding behaviors when ten hosts are split into a group of nine and a singleton. The close match is surprising since our simulations included wind, whereas the experiments were conducted indoors. However, the uncertainty in the simulations and experiments is high.</p>
        <p>The results indicate that it is advantageous for birds to roost together in larger groups on this spatial scale, because on average they will receive fewer bites. This phenomenon of attack abatement is well-known in the literature on predator-prey interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Turner1">[35]</xref>, and likely has two causes in the situation considered here. First, the odor plume exuded by a group does not grow linearly with the number of hosts, because the hosts are clustered together. This leads to fewer mosquitoes locating the group than would find the same number of well-spaced individuals (an avoidance effect). Secondly, mosquitoes only need a fixed amount of blood, and so they will not attack additional individuals even if they are available. This is a dilution effect, also seen in the reduction of groups at risk for malaria resulting from urbanization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Hay1">[36]</xref>. The resulting contact heterogeneity arising from attack abatement could have important implications for transmission dynamics.</p>

      <sec id="s4c">
        <title>Assessing changing host density</title>
        <p>Standard models of mosquito-borne transmission assume that the mosquito contact rate on one host is inversely proportional to the numbers of hosts (reviewed, e.g. by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Wonham1">[37]</xref>). This is likely true when hosts are so abundant that a mosquito will always be able to locate one. Our simulations indicate that the probability that a mosquito will locate a host is largely determined by the shape of the odor plume (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002500-t003">Table 3</xref>). However, the shape of an odor plume is difficult to predict, since it depends on local wind velocity and turbulence due to landscape features. We therefore propose an approximation that does not depend on plume shape, and is instead based on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e270" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which can be viewed as a patchiness parameter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g007">Fig. 7</xref>). This allows us to model contact rates when hosts are variably distributed over patches within a larger domain more realistically even if exact features of the relevant odor plumes are unknown.</p>
        <p>We derive a patchiness-driven contact rate model by starting with the contact rate for malaria transmission from Chitnis et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Chitnis1">[38]</xref> which applies specifically in the case of homogeneous mixing in a fixed area without considering host-seeking mechanisms. They propose a vector-host contact rate of<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e271" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e272" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of contacts each mosquito wants per unit time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e273" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the maximum number of contacts a host can receive per unit time, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e274" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of vectors and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e275" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of hosts. This implies that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e276" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the approximate contact rate when the mosquito population is small since every mosquito in a small population is expected to locate a host when the populations are homogeneously mixed.</p>
        <p>We seek to modify this expression to account for host patch area, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g001">Fig. 1</xref>, and mosquito behavior. When the hosts are limited to a small patch of area within a larger region, we make two modifications to the formula above. First, not every mosquito in a small population can be expected to find a host, since not all of the mosquitoes will come into contact with the odor plume. For this reason, we replace the contact rate with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e277" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e278" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the ratio of the diameter of the patch where the hosts are located to the diameter of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e279" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> simulation region. The second modification comes from the fact that even when the patch size becomes small (and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e280" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), the number of contacts must be nonzero since even a tiny area produces a plume that mosquitoes can follow to a host. We want our modified contact rate function to be consistent with the original function in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Chitnis1">[38]</xref> when <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e281" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is the case where the host patch is equal to the entire <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e282" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> simulation region. Based on these observations we propose the modified contact function<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e283" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e284" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> represents the proportion of mosquitoes that find a host as the patch of area containing the hosts becomes infinitesimally small.</p>
        <p>We note that when the host patches are small (i.e. small <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e285" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), Eq. (8) can be linearized to read <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e286" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where the factor in brackets, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e287" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is interpreted as the proportion of mosquitoes that find a host for a given patch-to-region length ratio <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e288" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This proportion can be computed from the simulations, as shown by the lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g007">Fig. 7</xref>. Therefore, reasonable assumptions about the patchy distribution of hosts in the domain allow us to devise a quantitatively reasonable estimate of the host-finding probability of mosquitoes for the space and time scales considered here.</p>

        <title>Limitations</title>
        <p>The length and time scales in the simulations presented here were motivated by the indoor experiments in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Foppa1">[7]</xref> and a desire to quantify mosquito success near the end of a host-seeking flight. Our conclusions must be validated for spatial domains or time periods that are significantly larger. Furthermore, there are other probability distributions that can be used for mosquito navigational choices (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Pasternak1">[12]</xref>) and a variety of initial mosquito spatial arrangements that may affect our conclusions.</p>
        <p>Such parameter choices are within the capabilities of the model, and to demonstrate we briefly present a simulation of a growing odor plume in a large domain. Mosquitoes engaging in all three types of plume finding (2000 mosquitoes each) were initially uniformly distributed over a disk of radius 100 m centered on four clusters of ten roosting birds each. The wind meandered according to an incompressible flow appropriate for the large domain size and the crosswind mosquitoes flew in the same direction for a number of decisions chosen from a Lévy distribution having a power law in the tail of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e289" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Reynolds1">[39]</xref>. The Lévy distribution was centered at 0.7 s, the mean value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e290" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002500-t001">Table 1</xref>, and only positive values were sampled. The mosquitoes were placed in the domain after 150 seconds when the odor plume was approximately 35 meters long. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g008">Fig. 8</xref> shows the state of the odor plume after 250 s and 500 s, along with the positions of all nearby mosquitoes. The simulation was run for 1500 s, at which point the odor plume was about 180 m in length and 4.2%, 6.4%, and 26.6% of the upwind, downwind, and crosswind mosquitoes had located a host respectively. The success rate was lower compared to the smaller domain, particularly for the upwind and downwind mosquitoes that rapidly left the plume behind (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002500-g008">Fig. 8</xref>, right). The crosswind mosquitoes moved downwind at the same rate the plume did, and therefore had many more opportunities to intercept it. There were still a substantial number of crosswind mosquitoes interacting with the plume when the simulation ceased.</p>

        <p>We hope to expand our careful analysis of the smaller domain to a larger domain in the future. In larger domains, it would be interesting to include the effect of mosquito breeding sites and how their locations affect the biting rate of hosts near them in comparison to hosts living farther away. Significant differences in the biting rates in spatial relation to breeding sites have been reported for malaria in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Thompson1">[40]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Future directions</title>
        <p>There are other potential model extensions that are equally interesting. Disease transmission via mosquito bite, host movement, infection, and demographic processes in both vertebrate hosts and mosquitoes and the dependence of these processes on biotic and abiotic factors could be integrated with the existing model for explicit small-scale modeling of disease spread. This modeling framework is capable of accommodating many further levels of complexity, such as gusting wind, moving hosts, multiple host types, odor-baited traps, variable breathing rate, compound odors, repellents, etc. The challenge will be to identify the components that most strongly affect the behavior of the model system and the underlying reality on which it is based. For example, in the simulations presented here the spread of the host odor is dominated by turbulent convection and diffusion plays a very minor role. It is therefore reasonable to hypothesize that the particular odor cue used by the mosquitoes will have little effect, and that substituting lactic acid for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e294" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (for example) will not impact the resultant contact rates. See <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Vickers1">[13]</xref> for a discussion of turbulent mixing versus molecular diffusion in the context of chemotaxis.</p>
        <p>Additional factors could be included in the model in order to capture subtle differences between mosquito species, lighting effects, and other elements not included in the current work. Hosts tend to attract mosquitoes in unequal ways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Knols1">[41]</xref>. Differential attractiveness, the emission of different levels of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e295" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by different hosts as well as multiple odor cues can also be introduced into the model to study situations like those presented in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Haddow1">[42]</xref>, where mosquitoes of many species finding humans distributed in huts, or in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Killeen3">[43]</xref>, where mosquitoes were collected inside village houses in Tanzania. These studies report an approximate direct relationship between the number of inhabitants per house and the number of mosquitoes collected. Our model could be used to study which factors influence more strongly this relationship.</p>
        <p>From the point of view of controlling the vector population, the model presented here may offer some insights into how the spatial distribution of mosquito traps may affect the overall control. This can be accomplished by replacing the hosts in the model with odor-baited mosquito traps and adjusting appropriate parameters. This was addressed in a non-spatial model by Okumu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Okumu1">[10]</xref>, where homogeneous mixing of hosts was assumed. They discuss the importance of space in the vector-host contact process and indicate that the rate at which an individual host is discovered by an individual vector depends on the distance between hosts and vectors as well as on the size of the odor plumes generated by the hosts. Further, spatial characteristics such as the topography and wind direction are known to be influential in the rates at which individual hosts are found. Our model can explicitly include spatial features to compare strategies of where to place mosquito traps relative to blood-source hosts. According to the studies in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002500-Gillies4">[44]</xref> the distances at which various species of mosquitoes responded to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002500.e296" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> baits by initiating orientation toward the them was 30 meters or less. Therefore, the small model length scales presented here are appropriate for such simulations.</p>
