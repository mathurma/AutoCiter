<abstract>
<p>Large-scale analyses of protein-protein interactions based on coarse-grain molecular docking simulations and binding site predictions resulting from evolutionary sequence analysis, are possible and realizable on hundreds of proteins with variate structures and interfaces. We demonstrated this on the 168 proteins of the Mintseris Benchmark 2.0. On the one hand, we evaluated the quality of the interaction signal and the contribution of docking information compared to evolutionary information showing that the combination of the two improves partner identification. On the other hand, since protein interactions usually occur in crowded environments with several competing partners, we realized a thorough analysis of the interactions of proteins with true partners but also with non-partners to evaluate whether proteins in the environment, competing with the true partner, affect its identification. We found three populations of proteins: strongly competing, never competing, and interacting with different levels of strength. Populations and levels of strength are numerically characterized and provide a signature for the behavior of a protein in the crowded environment. We showed that partner identification, to some extent, does not depend on the competing partners present in the environment, that certain biochemical classes of proteins are intrinsically easier to analyze than others, and that small proteins are not more promiscuous than large ones. Our approach brings to light that the knowledge of the binding site can be used to reduce the high computational cost of docking simulations with no consequence in the quality of the results, demonstrating the possibility to apply coarse-grain docking to datasets made of thousands of proteins. Comparison with all available large-scale analyses aimed to partner predictions is realized. We release the complete decoys set issued by coarse-grain docking simulations of both true and false interacting partners, and their evolutionary sequence analysis leading to binding site predictions.

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Protein-protein interactions (PPI) are at the heart of the molecular processes governing life and constitute an increasingly important target for drug design <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Hartwell1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Hakes1">[4]</xref>. Given their importance, it is clearly vital to characterize PPIs and notably to determine which protein interactions are likely to be stable enough to have functional relevance. Computational methods such as molecular docking have rendered possible to successfully predict the conformation of protein-protein complexes when no major conformational rearrangement occurs during the assembly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Comeau1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Zacharias1">[11]</xref>. However, we <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref> and others <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Kastritis1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Kastritis2">[14]</xref> have demonstrated that docking algorithms are unable to predict binding affinities and thus, presently, cannot distinguish which proteins will actually interact. This leads to ask whether this failure comes from the fact that scoring functions, used to sort the docking solutions, are inefficient for partner identification or whether the difficulty comes from binding promiscuity between proteins in the cell that blurs the interaction signal of the functional partners. In the crowded cell, proteins experience non-specific and unintended interactions with the intracellular environment leading to a severe competition between functional and non-functional partners <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Ando1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Levy1">[19]</xref>. This brings to light the importance of characterizing weak, potentially non-functional, interactions in order to predict functional ones and understand how proteins behave within a crowded environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-McGuffee1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Elcock1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Kim1">[21]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this work, we tackle two distinct but related questions: (i) can a combination of coarse-grain docking and evolutionary information identify true interacting partners among a set of potential ones? (ii) what is the effect of binding promiscuity on a large and variate dataset of protein structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Schreiber1">[22]</xref>?</p>
<p>Previously, we have shown that knowing the experimental binding site of a protein can help to retrieve its native interacting partner within a set of decoys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, recent studies reveal that arbitrary docked partners bind in a non-random mode on protein surfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-FernandezRecio1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Martin1">[24]</xref> suggesting that docking true but also false partners can help to identify protein binding sites. We developed a novel score based on arbitrary docking and evolutionary information to predict protein binding sites. The different docking conformations of a given protein pair are scored according to their associated energy and the agreement between the docked interface and the predicted binding sites. An interaction index is defined, and normalized according to the whole set of proteins tested, in order to discriminate the interacting partners from the set of tested interactions.</p>
<p>We evaluate our method with a complete cross-docking (CC-D) calculation on a set of 168 proteins belonging to the 84 known complexes described in the Mintseris Benchmark 2.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Mintseris1">[25]</xref> and covering a large spectrum of different protein interfaces. Enzymes, inhibitors, antibodies, antigens, signaling proteins and others have been considered as well as interfaces that do or do not undergo conformational adjustments during interaction. Docking calculations are made with no knowledge of the experimental complex structure: unbound structures are used. We use a coarse-grain docking algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>, whose energy function relies on both van der Waals and Coulomb potentials. We show that the combination of a coarse-grain docking algorithm with binding sites prediction can significantly contribute to the identification of a reasonably sized set of potentially interacting proteins, that can be further investigated by more precise docking algorithms or laboratory experiments.</p>
<p>The large computational effort necessary to accomplish this work was realized with the help of World Community Grid (WCG), that coordinated thousands of internautes providing their computer time to dock about 300000 conformations per protein pair for the set of 28224 possible pairs in the Mintseris Benchmark 2.0. For each pair, we selected about 2000 decoys. For non-partners, we find weak as well as strong interactions. The decoy set is released and it provides an important reference set of structures that can serve as a proxy for the non-specific protein-protein complexes that occur transiently in the cell or that are avoided by spatial-temporal constraints. These latter are hard to characterize experimentally but they are of biochemical relevance, as highlighted by other studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Mintseris2">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Liu1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>To simulate the variability of crowded environments for a protein in the cell, we study how easily a protein finds its true partner with respect to many random subsets of proteins supposedly competing with it. We realize a thorough analysis of these interactions and we address the question of whether a successful prediction of a protein partner depends on the environment composition or not. We quantify the effect of competing partners in predictions, and we characterize in a quantitative manner three distinguished populations of proteins interacting with a protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: those that strongly compete with the true partner of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, those that never compete with it, and those that interact with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with variable levels of strength. For each protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we propose a numerical index that provides the strength of the interaction with all other proteins in the environment, and that gives a signature for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To our knowledge, this is the first study performing a large-scale CC-D calculation, proposing an analysis of the binding promiscuity of the protein set, and providing to the scientific community the associated dataset of decoys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Chen1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Smialowski1">[31]</xref> at the same time. Previous large-scale analyses used docking by shape complementarity that quickly scans through several thousands proteins in a matter of seconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Yoshikawa1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref> but ignore the electrostatic contribution playing however an important role in protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Jones1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Ubbink1">[37]</xref>. We compared our method to two previously done studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Yoshikawa1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>. Both of them do not perform a CC-D experiment, but a large-scale analysis of selected protein pairs.</p>
<p>Finally, we checked whether evolutionary information can be used to considerably restrict the number of docking interfaces to be examined and to render molecular computation feasible for a larger scale investigation of PPIs, based on thousands of proteins instead of hundreds. This result makes the protocol proposed here feasible for scaling up the analysis.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>The 168 proteins of the Mintseris Benchmark 2.0 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Mintseris1">[25]</xref> form 84 binary complexes known to interact in the cell. They cover three broad biochemical categories and three difficulty categories related to the degree of conformational change at the protein-protein interface. They are classified as Enzyme-Inhibitors (46 proteins), Antibody-Antigen (20), Antigen-Bound Antibody (24), Others (78), and also as Rigid Body (126), Medium (26), Difficult (16). The set is constituted by 51 multimeric proteins and by 117 monomeric ones forming 41 complexes where at least one of the protein is multimeric.</p>
<p>CC-D was realized on the full dataset from unbound structures, leading to 28224 docking simulations. Each calculation explored about 300000 ligand-receptor orientations, corresponding to ligand and receptor complete surfaces, and asked for more than 7 months computational time on WCG. This CC-D scaled up the one introduced in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>, carried out on 6 enzyme-inhibitor complexes.</p>
<p>The docking algorithm simulates the actual docking process in which ligand-receptor pairwise interaction energies are calculated. The energy function we used takes into account van der Waals (modeled by a Lennard-Jones potential) and electrostatic (modeled by a Coulomb potential) terms (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Predictions of protein partners</title>
<p>For each protein in the dataset, the problem of partner identification is tackled with two main experiments. The first experiment assumes to know the residues belonging to the experimental interface of the proteins. This means that the residues lying at the interface of two proteins in a native complex are supposed to be known while no knowledge of the complex conformation is assumed. The second experiment replaces experimental interfaces by predictions of binding sites based on docking and evolutionary information. The evaluation of the quality of the interaction signal in this PPI large-scale study is of major importance. In particular, the contribution of docking information compared to evolutionary information in partner identification needs to be quantified. To do so, the analysis based on experimental interfaces allows us to evaluate in a precise manner how much a good prediction of the interaction sites improves partners identification, experimental interfaces playing the role of perfect predictions. In the sequel, we also use it to decipher whether a property of protein interactions that has been observed from computational predictions has a biological origin or whether it is a consequence of the noise of the prediction.</p>
<sec id="s2a1">
<title>Knowing experimental interfaces</title>
<p>As pointed out in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>, the combination of the energy score produced by docking and the knowledge of the experimental interface should help to retrieve the true interacting partners. For this, we define a predictive PPI index (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) in order to estimate the probability of two proteins to interact. As in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>, we determine what fraction of the docking interface is composed of residues belonging to the experimentally identified interface (named FIR, for Fraction of Interface Residues) for the receptor (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and for the ligand (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), and we define the overall fraction of the complex as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Then, we describe each receptor-ligand orientation by the product of its corresponding FIR and energy. Here, contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>, for each pair of proteins <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we compute an interaction index (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>)<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003369.e012"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e012" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where the minimum is defined over all orientations tested for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the interaction energy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the corresponding conformation.</p>
<p>To compare interaction indexes computed over different pairs, a normalized interaction index, called <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is introduced. In <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>, a NII formula is also proposed but it uses a different definition (1) and it does not model the symmetric role played by ligand and receptor (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>The results of the analysis are resumed in the squared matrix reporting the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values of each pair of proteins in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g001">Figure 1</xref>, where one clearly distinguishes the diagonal that indicates a successful prediction for many native complexes (see the third column of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t001">Table 1</xref> also, and Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). The performance of the prediction has been evaluated using a receiver operating characteristic (ROC) curve and its area under the curve (AUC) is 0.84. At a NII score threshold of 0.5, one observes a very high specificity (92) and a good sensitivity (52). See <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t002">Table 2</xref> and Table S8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref> (for other thresholds and performance measures). The large spectrum of interfaces, the large number of partners in competition, and the usage of unbound structures (compared to the bound ones used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Bonvin1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>) render this successful result not a forgone conclusion. At the contrary, the results provide a very encouraging insight and confirm search for protein partners by docking simulations, starting from unbound structures, to be a feasible task.</p>

<title>Analysis of different classes of interaction based on experimental interfaces</title>
<p>We systematically analyzed complexes in terms of their biochemical classes and difficulty categories (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t002">Table 2</xref> and Table S8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>) to verify whether partner identification, based on experimental interfaces, is easier within certain classes than within others. Partners prediction improves to an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Enzyme-Inhibitors, 0.89 for Antibody-Antigen, 0.91 for Antigen-Bound Antibody, 0.84 for Others (Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). Similarly, we obtain an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for Rigid Body, 0.85 for Medium and 0.77 for Difficult structures (Figures S3–S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). Therefore, when the binding sites are known, interactions within classes are clearly easier to predict. To understand these results, it is important to observe that Enzyme-Enzyme, Antigen-Antigen and Bound Antibody-Bound Antibody interactions are well discriminated by docking. This is highlighted by a large amount of extremely weak interactions, if any at all, detected within these sub-classes and illustrated by the corresponding sub-matrices in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g002">Figure 2</xref>. In conclusion, the good behavior of partner prediction within functional classes might be due either to the size effect of the environment on the prediction or to the composition of the protein subset used for predicting. This question is explored in “Native interactions and competing partners”.</p>

<title>Using predictions of interaction sites</title>
<p>Here, we drop the information on the location of the experimental interface of true partners and use predicted binding sites instead in order to evaluate our ability to retrieve the true partner in a totally blind experiment.

For this, they observed an accumulation of the docking solutions around the experimental location of the true partner. Following this approach, given a protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we used the information extracted from CC-D calculations involving all proteins in the database, to propose a set of residues that is highly likely to belong to the binding site of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>The protocol.</title>
<p>The protocol is based on docking calculations and JET predictions and produces an interaction matrix for the proteins in a database. Here, two protein structures, the receptor 1AY7 and the ligand 2MTA, are analyzed. The first step consists in cross-docking 1AY7 and 2MTA respectively, against all structures in the database (see cyan box for 1AY7 and blue box for 2MTA). A structure will be crossed dock against another in several conformations (from 100000 up to 450000, depending on the size of the proteins). In the schema, 1AY7 and 2MTA are also docked one against the other (see intersection between blue and cyan boxes). As a result of the cross-docking, a NIP score is associated to each protein leading to the prediction of an interaction site (color range from light blue to dark blue, corresponding to weak and strong signals respectively). In parallel, each protein is analyzed with JET, a JET score is associated to it and leads to the prediction of an interaction site based on evolutionary information (color range from yellow to red, corresponding to weak and strong signals respectively). JET and NIP scores are finally combined to obtain a JET+NIP score for each protein structure (color range from light pink to deep purple, corresponding to weak and strong signals respectively). Then, for each docked conformation, the JET+NIP score is combined to the corresponding energy value (to compute the FIR) to discriminate the best conformation of 1AY7 and 2MTA among all possible conformations computed by cross-docking (grey box, corresponding to the intersection of cyan and blue boxes - notice that the orientation of 1AY7 is the same in all conformations represented in the box). For the full dataset, the FIR values of the best conformation computed for each pair of proteins are recorded in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrix. Notice that the schema describing the computation for 1AY7 and 2MTA leads to one entry of the matrix. Finally, a normalization step produces the NII matrix used to discriminate potential partners.</p>

<p>We analyzed partner prediction performances obtained by using NIP, JET or the combination JET+NIP (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t002">Table 2</xref> and Table S9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>; see also Figure S7–S8 and Table S10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). When using only NIP, about half of the dataset (Enzyme-Inhibitors, Antibody-Antigens and Antigen-Bound Antibody) reaches an AUC of about 0.60, while the other half (Others) shows a random behavior. The use of JET highly improves the performance of three quarters of the dataset (Enzyme-Inhibitors and Others) with an AUC increase of more than 10% (for each class), while for the remaining quarter, involving antibodies and antigens, the AUC drops to 0.52.</p>
<p>To take advantage of the different behavior of NIP and JET on different biochemical classes, we combined the two approaches. We obtained a global improvement for three quarters of the database (Enzyme-Inhibitors and Others) compared to the results of NIP alone (0.77 and 0.61, respectively), while increasing the performance for Antibody-Antigens (0.58) and Antigen-Bound Antibody (0.56) compared to JET alone.</p>
<p>The poor performance obtained on Antibody-Antigens and Antigen-Bound Antibody possibly results from (i) a faster sequence evolution that blurs conservation signals leading to bad binding site predictions and (ii) from a large number of JET patches (corresponding to potential binding sites), compared to Enzyme-Inhibitors and Others, generating a large number of potential interactions that render more difficult partners discrimination. By excluding Antibody-Antigen and Antigen-Bound Antibody from the dataset (see “Enzyme-Inhibitors &amp; Others” in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t002">Table 2</xref>), the AUC reaches 0.66 on the 124 remaining proteins. This is an encouraging outcome considering the absence of experimental information and the important number of competing proteins. Notice that on Enzyme-Inhibitors, the combination JET+NIP improves the already good JET performance to an AUC of 0.77. In particular, JET+NIP obtains a decrease of less than <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> compared to predictions based on experimental data.

Finally, very weak interactions among Enzyme-Enzyme and Bound Antibody-Bound Antibody proteins are observable, as already noticed for docking based on experimental interfaces. This is highlighted by the sub-matrices in Figure S8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref> and constitutes another encouraging outcome for exploring interacting networks with docking based on interface predictions.</p>

<title>Analysis on difficulty categories based on interface predictions</title>
<p>When using JET+NIP scores, the partitioning of the Mintseris dataset on Rigid, Medium and Difficult structures leads to 0.60, 0.68 and 0.65 AUC values respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t001">Table 1</xref> and Table S9 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). Unexpectedly, Difficult and Medium perform similarly, and better than Rigid. This suggests that the interface prediction based on JET+NIP is robust to conformational changes that could occur upon complex formation, probably due to the fact that 1. JET is based on sequence information, and 2. JET is designed to predict surface residues that are possibly highly buried <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Engelen1">[38]</xref>, and that can pass from a buried to an exposed state (and conversely) during the assembly.</p>
<p>The Rigid class shows the worst performance, possibly due to the presence of Antibody-Antigen and Antigen-Bound Antibody in this subset. The comparison of Rigid with the Enzyme-Inhibitors &amp; Others subset, displaying a similar size but an AUC of 0.66, shows that the AUC is independent of the size of the evaluated subset and suggests that the subset composition might play an important role in the prediction reflecting the partners competition occurring in the cell. This leads to ask whether the prediction of a given complex is dependent on the proteins composing the environment or whether it is dependent on intrinsic properties of the complex itself. This idea is explored in the next section.</p>

<title>Native interactions and competing partners</title>
<p>We performed a series of tests to check whether the composition of a set of competing partners for a given protein influences partnership prediction. The analysis is performed on both JET+NIP predictions and experimental interfaces (see Figures S10–S16, S17–S23 and Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

<title>Are predictions dependent on environment composition?</title>
<p>We investigated the robustness of the prediction of a given complex among different random sets of proteins, these sets containing potential competitors for the proteins forming the complex. To do so, we defined the interaction rank (IR) of a complex within an environment to be the position of the NII value of the complex in the ordered list of NII values associated to the complexes involving at least one of the two partners. For each of the 84 native complexes, we generated 100 protein sets containing the desired complex and 19 other randomly chosen complexes (40 proteins). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g004">Figure 4</xref> illustrates the average and standard deviation of the distribution of IRs for the native complexes, ordered by increasing average rank. We can see that about the half of the native complexes are predicted in the top 10 (41 complexes over the 84), and 62% (52 over 84) are predicted on the top 15. This finding strongly suggests that these well-behaved complexes display some intrinsic properties leading to the correct prediction whatever the associated random set of potential partners is.</p>

<title>Robustness of the native complex predictions with respect to the environment composition.</title>
<p>Partner predictions are based on predicted interfaces. Average Interaction Rank (IR) of the true partners is computed over 100 random sets made of 40 proteins each (with error bars in red). The 84 complexes are ordered with respect to their increasing average IR value. For three of the 84 complexes (1BVN, 1BUH, 1N2C), detailed plots show the IR of the complex within each of the 100 random sets and the corresponding AUC value (black dots); green dots correspond to the IR of the complex computed over the Mintseris dataset; orange dots correspond to the IR of the complex computed over complexes in the same functional class. Note that the absence of the green dot on the 1N2C plot corresponds to a too large IR (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) of the complex. See Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref> for the names of complexes ranked on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-axis.

<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g004">Figure 4</xref>, one can also observe an increase in the variability of the IR (see the size of red bars) for those complexes whose average IR is greater than 10, and a strong decrease for a few complexes having a very large average IR value, that is complexes that are hard to predict (see right of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Receptor and ligand forming these latter complexes may interact with many proteins in the cell thus displaying some binding promiscuity. In particular, these bad-behaved complexes are proteases, kinases, cell adhesion molecules and MHC (major histocompatibility complex) class II molecules. The first two kinds of proteins are known to interact with many partners, while the last two are normally located on cell surfaces and display conserved interfaces, usually buried within the cell wall. On the contrary, these conserved interfaces are exposed in our experiments, possibly diverting the JET signal. Notice that the observation remains true when using experimental interfaces, showing that this behavior is not due to noise coming from the prediction (see Figure S55 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
<p>For a given complex, we also plot the detailed values of AUC and IR of the associated 100 random sets (see the three detailed plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g004">Figure 4</xref> and Figures S17–S23 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref> for the complete analysis of the 84 complexes). Intuitively, a high AUC value corresponds to a random set of complexes for which the large majority of the predictions is correct, while low AUC values (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) correspond to a majority of bad predictions. Two groups of proteins with distinct behavior emerge. The first one is constituted by complexes whose IR is independent on the random set composition. They display a small variability of the IR and a large variability of the corresponding AUC (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g004">Figure 4</xref>, 1BVN). This group is constituted by 24 complexes over 84 and it corresponds to complexes possibly displaying intrinsic physico-chemical properties always leading to the same IR (average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), whatever the associated random set is. The second group corresponds to complexes displaying a correlation between IR and AUC values. It reveals that the composition of the different random sets might influence the ranking of the reference complex (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g004">Figure 4</xref>, 1N2C) that might vary from set to set, thus mimicking, to some extent, the competition that occurs in the cell. With the exception of a few complexes, IRs range within at most 10 positions reflecting some stability of the complex ranks, whatever the subset is. Notice that when experimental interfaces are known, these two behaviors hold true, supporting the idea that they are not a consequence of a loss of interaction signal due to unsuccessful predictions. See Figures S10–S23 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>
<p>Overall, many complexes display a very good average IR (Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). Among the 84 complexes, 41 show an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and 52 an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Here, the good performance of Enzyme-Inhibitors observed before, is confirmed with 11 over 23 complexes showing an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. For Antibody-Antigen and Others, a bit more than a third of the complexes show an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which is an encouraging result taking into account the absence of any experimental information. If we suppose to know experimental interfaces, there are 15 complexes with average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, indicating a set of complexes for which coarse-grain docking does not provide sufficient information to discriminate partnership.

<p>A. Each partner of the 1BUH complex is coupled with one of the 168 proteins (including the monomer itself) of the dataset forming either a false (167 cases) or the native complex. For each complex, we computed the corresponding average IR and average AUC over 100 random sets of 40 proteins, obtained by using the experimental interfaces and the full exploration of the conformational space. These values are reported as a point in a plot. Each plot contains 168 points. The red circle in each plot corresponds to the values of the native complex.

<title>Average IR of true partners</title>
<p>In many cases (41 complexes over 84), true partners display an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and on a predictive perspective, one of the major difficulties is to discriminate the true partners from the wrong ones displaying good average IR (black and cyan dots at the bottom of the plots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Also, the stability of the average IR gradually decreases with the incrementation of the IR values until rank 20, and then gradually increases (see variation of the colors from black to yellow and from yellow to black in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This is a pattern observed for all proteins and reveals that extreme IR values are very stable.

<p>For Enzyme-Inhibitors, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows that for each protein, the number of potential partners (showing an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with the protein) is relatively limited.

The predicted interacting site covers only the 5% of the true binding site of the receptor. 1AVX: the predicted receptor binding site shares no residue with the real interaction site, leading to a bad prediction. 1BVN and 1KKL: despite the important size of the receptors 1BVN (496 residues) and 1KKL (3 chains of 205 residues each), corresponding binding sites are well predicted and true partners are identified with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively.</p>

<title>Average IR of small versus large proteins</title>
<p>We can distinguish ligands from receptors with respect to the distribution of their average IR values.

This is probably due to the smaller size of the ligand and its possibility to bind to a larger number of partners. For instance, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, a large fraction of the surface of the small partners 1BUH_l, 1PPE_l and 1BVN_l is prone to interact (see pink regions corresponding to a high JET+NIP score) enabling multiple types of potential interactions and rendering the interaction with the true partner difficult to discriminate. At the contrary, large partners as 1N2C_r display very localized interaction sites. This observation is validated by the whole set of proteins as illustrated in Figures S38–S51 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>. It should be noticed that the same observation does not hold anymore when experimental interfaces are known. This means that specific interfaces in small proteins do not glue everywhere, and therefore, that small proteins are not more promiscuous than large ones but simply that their behavior is harder to predict because of the several potential interaction sites that they might display. See Figure S54 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref> for a comparative analysis of partners of small proteins when predictions and experimental interfaces are considered.</p>

<p>To go further in the analysis, we mapped this information on the IR plots in Figures S38–S51 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref> (see Figures S60–S73 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>) in order to verify whether there was a particular behavior of the proteins towards partners coming from the same species. No tendency has been observed and the uniform distribution of orange dots across the IR interval in Figures S60–S73 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref> supports our hypothesis of the existence of three populations of proteins in cells (see “A protein signature based on the variability of its interaction ranks”). As an example, the enzyme 1MAH_r, coming from <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, shows an homogeneous repartition of the orange dots versus the blue ones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g007">Figure 7</xref>). This holds true for all mammalian proteins (see Tables S3–S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>) which are highly represented in the dataset. Notice that a number of proteins in the dataset are poorly represented such as the inhibitor 1MAH_l in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g007">Figure 7</xref>, a toxin protein coming from the venomous snake <italic>Dendroaspis angusticeps</italic>, for which all partners in the dataset come from remote species (see blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In conclusion, despite the fact that the Mintseris dataset does not represent an actual crowded environment, the large number of shared species between proteins in the dataset and the conservation of the interaction modes between close homologs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Aloy1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Faure1">[41]</xref> support the approach for exploring both protein interactions within a real environment and functional annotation.</p>

<title>Comparison with other docking large-scale studies</title>
<p>A few large-scale studies that wish to identify true interacting partners among a set of potential ones, have been recently proposed. They are computationally demanding and they remain, for this reason, rare. All large-scale studies we compared to have been based on shape complementarity to quickly scan through several thousand ligands in a matter of seconds. These approaches do not include any electrostatic component in their energy model, while electrostatic forces are known to play an important role in PPI.</p>
<p>Notice that, given a protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, no other docking studies besides this one tries to quantify the effect of binding promiscuity of a large and variate dataset of protein structures interacting with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e089" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

<title>Comparison with Wass et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref></title>
<p>Docking by shape complementarity between 56 monomers (carefully) chosen from the Docking Benchmark 2.0 and a background of 922 potential interactors (excluding all partners in the Mintseris dataset) has been analyzed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>. A precise quantitative comparison of this computational experiment with our has been impossible because the set of protein partners of the Mintseris dataset considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref> is smaller and constituted only by a selected subset of receptors (with no ligand), ligands (with no receptor) and complexes (receptor and ligand) extracted from the classes Enzyme-Inhibitors and Others.</p>
<p>A qualitative comparison with our predictions based on JET+NIP scores could have been made on the set of 10 complexes discussed in the SI of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>, but these results are not reproducible with more recent versions of HEX <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Ritchie1">[42]</xref> (see Figure S58 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>), the docking program used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>. Therefore, we decided to realize a CC-D with a more recent version of HEX (v6.3) on the Mintseris' Enzyme-Inhibitors dataset and to analyze HEX behavior either by assuming knowledge of the experimental interfaces or by considering predicted binding sites based on JET+NIP scores. In this latter case, NIP scores come from docking calculations using HEX. The distribution of interaction ranks for both our docking algorithm MAXDo (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) and HEX are shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t003">Table 3</xref>, where we report how many proteins among the 46 enzymes and inhibitors are identified by each method within increasing sets of best partners, with respect to an environment of 46 proteins. From <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t003">Table 3</xref>, MAXDo and HEX behave similarly on experimental interfaces while on predicted binding sites, MAXDo performance is definitely superior to the one of HEX. This shows that as the binding site prediction is not perfect, HEX is less suitable for partner identification. HEX performance has been further evaluated using ROC analysis and the AUC of the associated curve. On experimental interfaces, HEX reached an AUC of 0.81 against the AUC of 0.85 obtained with MAXDo. On predicted interfaces, HEX reached AUC values of 0.60, 0.61 and 0.60 when combined with JET+NIP, NIP and JET scores respectively, while MAXDo reached AUC values of 0.77, 0.60 and 0.72. The fact that the use of interface predictions (JET+NIP vs NIP) does not improve the AUC when using HEX, pinpoints that the conformational space of best energy solutions proposed by HEX and MAXDo are not the same. This asked for a precise analysis of the correlations between FIRs (computed on experimental interfaces and thus reflecting the overlap with experimental binding sites) and docking scores (that is, NII scores based on JET+NIP) on native complexes. We considered the conformational space of MAXDo and of HEX, each made of 11500 (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e090" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) best energy conformations associated to the 23 native complexes. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g008">Figure 8</xref>, we show the distribution of conformations for MAXDo and HEX. Two main observations can be made: first, the total number of conformations with highest FIR (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e091" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is much larger for MAXDo than for HEX, and second, among these conformations, the number of those with highest rank (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e092" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is much larger for MAXDo than for HEX. This means that the MAXDo conformational space of best energy conformations is enriched with interfaces that are close to the experimental interface, contrary to HEX.</p>

<p>This analysis shows that shape complementarity docking is not yet ready for PPI identification, due to a currently insufficient performance of binding sites prediction methods. In fact, perfect predictions of interaction sites would strongly support the usage of docking algorithms such as HEX (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t003">Table 3</xref>), because of their computational efficiency. At the moment though, the usage of coarse-grain docking algorithms such as MAXDo, based on interaction energy scores including both Lennard-Jones and electrostatic contributions, increases manifestly the accuracy of binding partner identification compared to shape complementarity docking.</p>
<p>The analysis points out two more general observations. First, large environments of the order of a thousand proteins, as the one of 922 proteins considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>, are not useful for protein identification. To see this, we computed how many monomers among the 56 were identified by our method within increasing sets of best partners, with respect to an environment of 168 proteins. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t001">Table 1</xref> shows that by looking at 17 best partners out of 168, we are able to identify the true partner for a fourth of the proteins in the full Mintseris dataset and for a third in the 56 proteins dataset of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>. In contrast, in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>, it was highlighted that a third of the 56 proteins were identified by looking at 46 best partners out of 922. In practice, these results suggest that it is feasible to work with sufficiently small environments of a few hundred proteins (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e103" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) to be able to propose to the biologist a reasonable (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) subset of proteins to test, but that large datasets, as the one considered in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>, will not be useful for protein identification unless current predictive methods improve at the point to identify most native complexes within the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of top predictions. Possibilities for improvement exist as shown by the results based on experimental interfaces in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t001">Table 1</xref>. Notice that a perfect binding sites identification allows for the detection of native complexes for 36 out of 56 proteins within the top 17 predictions. Notice that true partners for 36 proteins are obtained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref> by considering 184 best predictions out of 922, a set that is far too large to be experimentally tested.</p>
<p>The second observation concerns the composition of the set of proteins analyzed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>. Antibody-Antigens complexes are absent from the CC-D experiment in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>, are intrinsically difficult for interface prediction and they could constitute good test cases where both methods might highlight their respective weaknesses. Also, all 922 proteins (except 3) coming from the Mintseris or the background dataset in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref> are monomeric with two third of the background dataset having only one domain. The use of monomeric structures (especially when they are constituted by a single domain) renders the prediction easier as it is generally associated with a decrease of the number of potential interactions. Notice that our experiment is run on the full Mintseris database for which about a half of the complexes (41 over 84) involve a multimeric structure (spanning from 2 up to 4 chains), hence enhancing the difficulty of the prediction. We observe an <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for monomeric complex predictions based on experimental interfaces, that decreases to 81 for multimeric complexes, as detailed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t002">Table 2</xref> and in Table S8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>. This performance on multimeric complexes is affected even more when interface predictions are considered, since sensitivity and precision of interface predictions decrease for multimeric proteins as shown in Table S11 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>

<p>We compared our predictions with those obtained in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Yoshikawa1">[32]</xref>, who also studied interactions within the complete Docking Benchmark 2.0. This method, called Affinity Evaluation and Prediction (AEP), is based on shape complementarity. Contrary to our approach, (i) it indirectly uses information coming from the experimental complex, that is the bound protein structure which is expected to improve predictions, and (ii) it does not perform CC-D calculations but it only crosses the 84 receptors against the 84 ligands, by reducing in a non naive manner by the half the number of competing partners for a given protein. The complexity of the problem is, then, reduced because of the splitting between receptors and ligands that is usually not obvious to make. Even though they consider 7056 bound protein pairs while we deal with 28224 unbound ones, we obtain an AUC of 0.61 while they reach an AUC of 0.58.</p>

This is done by predicting binding sites for the receptor protein by using JET <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Engelen1">[38]</xref> and by defining an appropriate cone around the predicted interface (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> and Figures S5, S6 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). When restricting the docking conformational space with JET, we observe a slight decrease of the AUC. By using experimental data, the AUC goes from 0.84 to 0.80 while using predictions, it goes from 0.61 to 0.59 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t004">Table 4</xref>), revealing a reduced loss in precision. This shows that using evolutionary information from sequences is a very promising approach to reduce docking computational time.</p>

<p>To evaluate the impact of our restriction on MAXDo execution time, we computed how many docked conformations between protein pairs were dropped. When the 168 proteins are considered together, the average portion of the conformational space that is explored after reduction is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the original space. This value should be understood at the light of protein sizes, as illustrated in Figure S59 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>. In fact, small proteins require to explore about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of their original conformational space, while for large ones, the space is reduced to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the initial one. This is because small proteins are rather conserved and JET predicts large patches as their interaction sites, covering a large portion of their protein surface. Notice that this calculation takes into account a reduced number of conformations for the receptor, independently on whether the conformational space of the ligand is completely explored or not. Clearly, the actual computational time depends on the number of conformations that are tested, and if both the conformational spaces of the receptor and of the ligand are reduced, the effect will be quadratic. The small difference in AUC obtained by exploring the reduced space of the receptor compared to the whole (with a fully explored surface of the ligand), is due to the high specificity of JET and to the definition of the cone (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) that takes into account JET's lower PPV.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have addressed the problem of predicting protein interactions using high-throughput CC-D calculations on a dataset of 168 proteins. We have shown that a simple docking algorithm combined with evolutionary information, can be used to discriminate interacting from non-interacting proteins. The purpose of the method is the <italic>in silico</italic> large-scale screening of protein structures to find a small set of potential protein partners that could be tested experimentally. The approach reminds the one of drug design aiming to screen large sets of small molecules in order to identify a small set of potential drugs that becomes experimentally testable. These approaches do not pretend to exactly identify a unique solution but rather a set of reasonable candidates, and reduce, in this manner, the amount of experimental time and costs. This means that we are not focused on the correct docking of experimentally known partners, which can be achieved via other more effective but much more computationally demanding methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Janin1">[43]</xref>. However, one can envisage to use such more sophisticated methods on the small set of candidates that our coarse method identifies to propose more precise models of the potential complexes.</p>
<p>We have realized a large-scale PPI analysis by assuming to know the residues forming the experimental interface of the native complexes (no associated experimental conformation is considered) and by using predictions of binding sites. Experimental binding sites can be seen as perfect predictions, and the analysis based on them is realized for two reasons: 1. to understand how much evolutionary information can contribute to PPI reconstruction when coupled with a coarse-grain docking algorithm using an energy function, and 2. to decouple true PPI signal from noise and identify PPI properties that are not consequences of accumulated errors due to predictive algorithms. This second reason allowed us to be confident, for instance, on the promiscuity observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g005">Figure 5B</xref> (bottom black dots) by ensuring that it is not generated by noise in predictions (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).</p>
<p>A few large-scale analyses, that are similar in spirit, have been performed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Yoshikawa1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>. A comparison of our results with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>, based on the ten protein complexes discussed in detail in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>, reveals a similar performance of the two methods. However, a full comparison with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref> is impossible since they treat only a subset of the Mintseris dataset, use a large background set and do not provide a detailed measure of the performance of their method. On the contrary, our method is tested on all complexes of the Mintseris dataset, a good testing platform for methods dedicated to protein partner prediction due to its numerous structural differences. The global analysis of the two methods (over the subset of 56 proteins; see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Wass1">[33]</xref>) highlights that we can reasonably search for protein partners within sets of a few hundred monomers. We demonstrated that improving current predictive methods is possible through a better prediction of binding sites, and we precisely estimated the effect of such predictions.</p>
<p>We could only partially compare to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Yoshikawa1">[32]</xref> since they do not perform a CC-D of the Mintseris dataset but only cross the 84 receptors against the 84 ligands, that is a fourth of the interactions explored in our analysis. Performances of our method and the one reported in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Yoshikawa1">[32]</xref> are comparable on the common subset, but notice that contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Yoshikawa1">[32]</xref>, we use unbound structures and we make no use of the non-naive split of the dataset (that is, receptors versus ligands).</p>
<p>The predictive performance of the method is encouraging for the whole Mintseris Benchmark 2.0 and very satisfactory for the enzyme-inhibitor subset (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t002">Table 2</xref>). For this latter, the AUC reaches a very high value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> while the AUC for the whole Mintseris dataset is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Notice that the way we computed the AUC is very strict, since we asked the true partner to be ranked first over the tested dataset. A more relaxed evaluation is reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t001">Table 1</xref> where we show that a fourth of the 168 proteins in the Mintseris dataset are recognized by looking at the top 17 predictions over the 168 tested partners. If the binding site of the proteins is correctly predicted, the half of the proteins in the dataset are recognized by looking at the top 8 predictions, and two third by looking at the top 17. This is a very encouraging result with respect to the potential applicability of this <italic>in silico</italic> predictive approach to the reconstruction of PPI networks. In fact, proposing to a biologist a set of less than 20 interactions to test is very reasonable.</p>
<p>The analysis on the average IR for the enzyme-inhibitor subset highlights that an average IR threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> allows the method to propose about 12 partners, a reasonable number of proteins to be selected for experimental tests. In 38 cases over 46 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g006">Figure 6</xref>), the true partner is present in the retained subset showing a very high sensitivity. For the whole Mintseris benchmark, for roughly the half of the dataset (82 proteins), the true partner is retrieved with an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Notice that when considering the experimental binding site of each partner, 138 proteins over 168 display an average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This means that a precise binding site prediction method will lead to a successful partners discrimination, a problem that could be considered as being much more ambitious than the binding site prediction problem. Again, these results support the feasibility of the approach to identify potential partners but, most of all, they highlight the interest of testing a protein within a large environment, by randomly choosing many small subsets of proteins in the environment, and by selecting as potential partners to be experimentally tested, those proteins that present a stable average IR <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (black dots, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g005">Figure 5</xref>) with the protein under study. The selection of 10 potential partners instead of 17 (as suggested by the direct evaluation of the NII matrix in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003369-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003369-t001">Table 1</xref>) might be crucial for experimental validation. This observation opens a way to new computational schema for partner predictions.</p>
<p>The analysis highlights an important point on the behavior of all proteins with respect to their partners. For each protein, there is a small set of partners that displays a systematic (black points in the bottom of Figure 5AB) very low average IR that lead to ask whether these partners might physically interact and not be false positives. Three reasonable explanations for this set of highly potential partners can be given: (i) partners can interact on a merely physical base but never meet in the cell due to different cellular compartments localization, (ii) partners can interact for functional purposes, possibly not described until now (several different partners are expected to interact with a protein), (iii) partners can interact in the cell not for functional purposes but generating a competition with the functional partner, possibly participating to the regulation of the protein interactions in the cell. Taking into account these possibilities, this set of highly potential partners becomes interesting for further studies. For instance, these interactions would deserve to be experimentally tested to see how strongly they interact, and whether they form a structurally well-defined complex. Also, for a given protein and a set of highly potential partners, one could ask whether general structural (geometrical or physico-chemical) features of the interface exist and in the positive case, classify these interfaces. These further studies could contribute to give important insights into protein partnership discrimination.</p>
<p>For each protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we defined a signature representing the strength of interaction of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with all other proteins. As mentioned above, signatures found for all <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>'s in the Mintseris dataset demonstrate the existence of strong interactions with some proteins, but also the absence of interactions with other proteins, and so on. The spectrum of strengths of interactions suggests the notion of PPI to be revisited so to include the larger panel of potential complex formations between a protein and its potential partners. Several questions could then be asked on proteins presenting similar signatures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Lukatsky1">[44]</xref>, but they go beyond the aim of this work.</p>
<p>We have shown that evolutionary information can also be used to restrict the conformational space of the docking exploration without an important loss in sensitivity. This result is very important in view of reducing the computational cost of highly time demanding docking calculations (all atom description and precise energy functions) and the perspective of enlarging the dataset size for future CC-D calculations.</p>
<p>To conclude, we are the first to perform a CC-D of a pool of proteins covering a large spectrum of functions and interaction modes, performing it on unbound structures and providing energy values (even though simplified) taking into account electrostatic forces. Our approach is the first combining evolutionary information with CC-D simulations. The evaluation of the performance of these two contributions to the problem of partner identification, suggests that there is still room for improvement in the solution. In particular, we have shown that a precise identification of protein binding sites allows for very satisfactory predictions. Data coming from the CC-D calculations and the evolutionary analysis are provided and they will help the community to evaluate further CC-D studies and methodological developments. In particular, the decoy set constitutes a unique dataset of “negative” partners. For them, we provide about 2000 conformations and an associated coarse-grain energy score. It might be extremely useful to suitably parametrize docking scoring functions, more refined than our coarse-grain scoring function, to discriminate partners. In the context of this study, a subset of these decoy structures filtered by our coarse-grain scoring function could be re-scored for a better partnership evaluation by using a more refined score function better discriminating the interaction signals.</p>

<title>Systematic docking simulations</title>
<p>Our docking algorithm (see Figure S52 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>) was derived from the ATTRACT protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Zacharias2">[46]</xref> and uses a multiple energy minimization scheme. For each pair of proteins, the first molecule (called the receptor) was fixed in space, while the second (termed the ligand) was used as a probe and placed at multiple positions on the surface of the receptor. The initial distance of the probe from the receptor was chosen so that no pair of probe-receptor pseudo-atoms came closer than 6 Å. Starting probe positions were randomly created around the receptor surface with a density of one position per 10 Å<sup>2</sup>, and for each starting position, 210 different ligand orientations were generated, resulting in a total number of start configurations ranging from roughly 100,000 to 450,000 depending on the size of the receptor. During each energy minimization, the ligand protein was kept at a given location over the surface of the receptor protein, using a harmonic restraint to maintain its center of mass on a vector passing through the center of mass of the receptor protein. The direction of this vector was defined by two Euler angles <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, (where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was chosen to pass through the center of the binding interface of the receptor protein) as shown in Figure S52 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>. By using a Korobov grid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Korobov1">[51]</xref> and varying the Euler angles from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively, it was possible to uniformly sample interactions over the complete surface of the receptor and to represent its binding potential using 2D energy maps (each point corresponding to the best ligand orientation for the chosen <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> pair).

<title>Computational implementation and data analysis</title>
<p>Each energy minimization for a pair of interacting proteins typically takes 15 s on a single 2 GHz processor. As noted above, approximately 100,000 to 450,000 minimizations are needed to probe all possible interaction conformations, as a function of the size of the interacting proteins. Therefore, a CC-D search on the benchmark, namely <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> receptor/ligand pairs, would require several thousand years of computation on a single processor. However, since each minimization is independent of the others, this problem belongs to the “embarrassingly parallel” category and is well adapted to multiprocessor machines, and particularly to grid-computing systems. Our calculations have been carried out in 2007 by the public World Community Grid (WCG, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.worldcommunitygrid.org" xlink:type="simple">www.worldcommunitygrid.org</ext-link>), with the help of thousands of internautes donating their computer time to the project. It took approximately seven months to perform CC-D calculations on the complete dataset of 168 proteins. More technical details regarding the execution of the program on WCG can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Berstis1">[52]</xref>.

<title>Protein interaction index and its normalization</title>
<p>In order to improve the quality of the predictions of protein interaction partners, in our earlier study we developed a normalized interaction index (NII) that takes into account whether a protein-protein interface involves amino acids belonging to a known interaction site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-SacquinMora1">[12]</xref>. This information can potentially be obtained using predictive tools (see below), but here we use the experimentally determined interfaces of the 84 binary complexes in the Docking Benchmark. We however recall that all our docking trials involve unbound protein conformations. For each protein partner in a given complex <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we determine which fraction of the docked interface residues (abbreviated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) are found in the experimental interface for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Thus defining an overall fraction for the complex as <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is important to notice that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> formula can be computed from either experimental interfaces (as defined above) or predicted interfaces (where prediction could be realized, for instance, with evolutionary information; see paragraph below). The notion of “FIR” proposes a new concept for docking evaluation that can be used as an alternative to the usual docking metrics <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Mendez1">[54]</xref> originally designed to evaluate the accuracy of pairwise protein docking models.

Also, for the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measure, contacts are defined with respect to a 5 Å cutoff on the RMSD of heavy atoms, while for FIR, contacts are defined from a change of solvent accessibility.</p>

<title>Residue scoring based on evolutionary information</title>
<p>Protein interfaces are predicted with the Joint Evolutionary Trees (JET) method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003369-Engelen1">[38]</xref>. JET is a large-scale method designed to detect very different types of interactions. It predicts interface patches for protein families by combining residue conservation with physico-chemical properties expected at the protein interfaces. Conserved patches are then extended by using heuristics leading to alternative interaction sites for different JET runs. For each protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e236" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, 10 runs of JET were launched and we defined a score <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e237" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for each surface residue <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003369.e238" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be the number of occurrences of the residue in extended patches divided by 10.

<title>Cone definition for the conformational space restriction</title>
<p>To restraint the conformational space of the docking algorithm, we combine JET interface predictions with MAXDo, in such a way that only surface regions containing residues predicted by JET will be analyzed by MAXDo. To do so, for each docked orientation, we computed the center of mass of the ligand and defined the axis linking it to the center of mass of the receptor. We remind that the position of the receptor is fixed. Along this axis, we define an imaginary tube of radius <italic>r</italic> = 2.9 Å. For each ligand orientation, we check whether the interface of the resulting ligand-receptor complex involves residues predicted by JET or not (Figure S53 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003369.s001">Text S1</xref>). Each residue is approximated to a point whose coordinates represent the average of the atom's coordinates. The distance of this point from the axis of the tube, allows to establish whether the residue falls inside the tube or not, and therefore, whether the ligand orientation should be retained or not. Strictly speaking, one should also use the scalar product between the vectors going from the receptor center of mass to the residue and to the ligand center of mass (this product decides whether the residue lies on the side of the ligand-receptor interface). We ask for just one single residue in the orientation interface to be within the tube to retain this latter.</p>

Docked conformations were clustered using a 3 Å cutoff and the best-scored conformations of the 500 first clusters were retained for the analysis. A protocol similar to that described for MAXDo was applied to evaluate partner prediction based on HEX results, (i) by assuming knowledge of the experimental interfaces and (ii) by crossing docking scores with evolutionary information. All 500 conformations were considered for residue scoring based on docking and for protein interaction index calculation.
