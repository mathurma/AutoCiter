<abstract>
<p>The glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), a key pharmacological target in type 2 diabetes (T2D) and obesity, undergoes rapid endocytosis after stimulation by endogenous and therapeutic agonists. We have previously highlighted the relevance of this process in fine-tuning GLP-1R responses in pancreatic beta cells to control insulin secretion. In the present study, we demonstrate an important role for the translocation of active GLP-1Rs into liquid-ordered plasma membrane nanodomains, which act as hotspots for optimal coordination of intracellular signaling and clathrin-mediated endocytosis. This process is dynamically regulated by agonist binding through palmitoylation of the GLP-1R at its carboxyl-terminal tail. Biased GLP-1R agonists and small molecule allosteric modulation both influence GLP-1R palmitoylation, clustering, nanodomain signaling, and internalization. Downstream effects on insulin secretion from pancreatic beta cells indicate that these processes are relevant to GLP-1R physiological actions and might be therapeutically targetable.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>G protein–coupled receptors (GPCRs), the largest membrane receptor family in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref001">1</xref>], are integral membrane proteins, and, as such, both their physical organization and their signaling properties are modulated by the lipid composition of the surrounding membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref003">3</xref>]. The localization of GPCRs to dynamic membrane nanodomains has been widely reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref006">6</xref>]. These nanodomains, or membrane rafts, which cannot be directly observed in living cells with current methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref007">7</xref>], are often described as highly organized detergent-resistant, liquid-ordered, glycosphingolipid- and cholesterol-rich platforms where receptor-signaling complexes become compartmentalized, facilitating efficient coupling with G proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref009">9</xref>]. Additionally, most GPCRs are modified posttranslationally with one or more palmitic acid chains linked covalently, but reversibly, via a <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="https://www.sciencedirect.com/topics/biochemistry-genetics-and-molecular-biology/thioester" xlink:type="simple">thioester</ext-link> bond to cysteines within the intracellular domain of the receptor, in a process known as palmitoylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref010">10</xref>].

GPCR palmitoylation at or near the end of its C-terminal tail creates a new membrane anchor and a further intracellular loop [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref015">15</xref>] that modifies the GPCR structure and its interactions with specific intracellular partners, favoring receptor partitioning into membrane nanodomains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Class B GPCRs, such as the glucagon-like peptide-1 receptor (GLP-1R), play crucial roles in the control of glucose and energy metabolism and are key investigational targets for the treatment of several metabolic disorders including insulin resistance, obesity, and type 2 diabetes (T2D) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref018">18</xref>]. GLP-1 mimetics have been used clinically for over 10 yr [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref019">19</xref>], but with the current sharp rise in the worldwide incidence of both T2D and obesity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref020">20</xref>], there is a pressing need to develop more effective drugs with fewer associated side effects. We [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>] and others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref023">23</xref>] have previously described how GLP-1R signaling responses are modulated by intracellular membrane trafficking processes, with “biased” agonism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref024">24</xref>] being one potentially tractable means to achieve this in a therapeutic context. In the present study, we focus on the influence of the lipid microenvironment on GLP-1R trafficking and functionality in pancreatic beta cells, where it serves to augment glucose-stimulated insulin release to allow tight regulation of blood glucose [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref025">25</xref>]. We establish here that binding of GLP-1R to the therapeutic agonist exendin-4 (exenatide) triggers increased GLP-1R clustering and reduced lateral diffusion at the plasma membrane, resulting in the segregation of biologically active GLP-1Rs into cholesterol-rich plasma membrane nanodomains that enable compartmentalization of acute receptor signaling responses prior to GLP-1R endocytosis via clathrin-coated pits (CCPs). Interestingly, these processes could be modulated using biased agonists previously derived by us from exendin-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>], as well as with the small molecule allosteric modulator 4-(3-benzyloxyphenyl)-2-ethylsulfinyl-6-(trifluoromethyl)pyrimidine (BETP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref027">27</xref>]. Moreover, we found that raft localization of the structurally and functionally related glucose-dependent insulinotropic polypeptide receptor (GIPR), also found in beta cells, was constitutive and not subject to agonist-mediated regulation. Disruption of the plasma membrane microarchitecture via cholesterol depletion had a substantial impact on acute GLP-1R clustering, signaling, and endocytosis. We also demonstrate that palmitoylation of the GLP-1R, known to occur at cysteine 438 near the C-terminal end of its cytoplasmic tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref028">28</xref>], is an agonist-mediated event that also plays a role in determining the degree of receptor clustering, nanodomain segregation, and internalization.</p>
<p>This is, to our knowledge, the first report linking receptor palmitoylation and nanodomain partitioning to modified or biased responses of a class B GPCR in pancreatic beta cells, opening the door for future studies based on the direct manipulation of these processes to control GLP-1R action, with the potential to translate into more effective diabetes therapies.</p>

<title>Activated GLP-1Rs accumulate in plasma membrane nanodomains</title>
<p>Association with plasma membrane raft nanodomains is a known mechanism to organize membrane receptors into signaling microclusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref029">29</xref>]. Localization of GPCRs to membrane rafts can be constitutive or ligand-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref030">30</xref>]. To determine the influence of agonist binding upon GLP-1R raft partitioning in pancreatic beta cells, we measured SNAP-GLP-1R levels in purified detergent-resistant fractions (DRFs) and detergent-soluble fractions (DSFs) from total membrane preparations of mouse insulinoma MIN6B1 cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref031">31</xref>] stably expressing human GLP-1R SNAP-tagged at the extracellular N terminus (MIN6B1 SNAP-GLP-1R cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref021">21</xref>]. Stimulation with a saturating concentration of the orthosteric peptide GLP-1R agonist exendin-4 resulted in increased receptor recruitment to flotillin-positive DRFs compared to vehicle control conditions, suggesting increased partitioning into membrane nanodomains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The increased raft partitioning primarily concerned the poly-glycosylated fraction of the receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s001">S1A Fig</xref>), known to represent the receptor pool functional for agonist binding at the cell surface [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s001">S1B Fig</xref>). Increased enrichment of poly-glycosylated GLP-1Rs in membrane raft fractions was also present at lower concentrations of exendin-4 and upon stimulation with the endogenous agonist GLP-1(7–36)NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). To corroborate this biochemical finding, we developed a new method to monitor SNAP-GLP-1R localization in cholesterol-rich nanodomains using time-resolved (TR)-Förster resonance energy transfer (FRET) and the solvatochromic membrane probe NR12S [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref035">35</xref>], as the latter shows blue-shifted emission in liquid-ordered compared to liquid-disordered membrane environments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s001">S1D Fig</xref>). In cells expressing SNAP-GLP-1R labeled with the long-lived lanthanide FRET donor Lumi4-Tb, TR-FRET was increased upon exendin-4 addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s001">S1E Fig</xref>), indicating relative movement between the Lumi4-Tb-labeled GLP-1R extracellular domain and the plasma membrane, possibly reflecting the closure of the receptor extracellular domain upon ligand binding, as recently suggested [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref036">36</xref>].

<p>As raft association is known to regulate cell surface receptor clustering [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref008">8</xref>], we next determined the degree of GLP-1R clustering at the plasma membrane before and after stimulation with exendin-4. We performed electron microscopy (EM) analysis of intact 2D sheets of apical membranes ripped off from adherent MIN6B1 SNAP-GLP-1R cells labeled live with the membrane-impermeable BG-SS-PEG4-biotin SNAP-tag probe followed by gold-conjugated streptavidin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s001">S1I Fig</xref>). Quantification of gold-particle distances to the nearest neighbor showed increased clustering of SNAP-GLP-1Rs following exendin-4 stimulation. This was supported by total internal reflection fluorescence (TIRF)-photoactivatable localization microscopy (PALM) data, which showed an increase in the average number of receptors per cluster after 1 min of exendin-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), with receptor oligomers already present in basal conditions in keeping with a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref037">37</xref>]. To gain more kinetic information on agonist-induced GLP-1R clustering, we used a dual surface labeling approach that allows detection of receptor–receptor interactions by TR-FRET. Because of the long-lived fluorescence of Lumi4-Tb, energy transfer in this assay results from both stable and transient protein–protein interactions, which increases when receptors are in closer proximity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref039">39</xref>].

<p>Membrane nanodomains have often been described as hotspots for signaling as a result of cosegregation of receptors with their corresponding signaling effectors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref005">5</xref>]. Using MIN6B1 SNAP-GLP-1R cells expressing the yellow fluorescent protein (YFP)-tagged Gs alpha subunit (Gα<sub>S</sub>), we found that Gα<sub>S</sub>-YFP clearly partitioned into DRFs both before and after exendin-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Moreover, exendin-4-induced recruitment of the active GPCR regulatory factor β-arrestin-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref041">41</xref>] to the GLP-1R was significantly increased in DRFs versus DSFs of Chinese hamster ovary (CHO)-PathHunter cells expressing ProLink (PK)-tagged human GLP-1R and β-arrestin-2-EA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g001">Fig 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>Effect of methyl-β-cyclodextrin-induced nanodomain disruption on GLP-1R behavior</title>
<p>To investigate the effect of nanodomain recruitment on GLP-1R cellular behavior in beta cells, we used methyl-β-cyclodextrin (MβCD) to disrupt the plasma membrane architecture via sequestration of cholesterol and other lipids [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref042">42</xref>]. Efficiency of cholesterol depletion by MβCD was determined by filipin staining and quantified biochemically; note also that MβCD treatment did not alter receptor surface SNAP-GLP-1R expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>). We observed that binding affinity of the fluorescent exendin-4 conjugate exendin-4-K12-fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>] to SNAP-GLP-1R at equilibrium was reduced by MβCD in a dose-dependent manner, as measured by TR-FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref043">43</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s002">S2D Fig</xref>).

<p>Endocytosis of receptors previously recruited to membrane nanodomains can occur via a range of clathrin-dependent and clathrin-independent pathways, with the specific pathway utilized in each case being particular to each individual receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref050">50</xref>].

In a previous study, we detected a very transient delay on GLP-1R internalization in cells lacking both β-arrestin-1 and β-arrestin-2, out of keeping with the more marked effects on signaling responses, which we now attribute primarily to avoidance of β-arrestin-mediated desensitization at the plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>]. In view of our latest observation of the profound effect of cholesterol depletion on GLP-1R internalization, we reassessed the contribution of β-arrestins with and without MβCD exposure. Using diffusion-enhanced resonance energy transfer (DERET) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref051">51</xref>], we first noted very minor differences in agonist-induced SNAP-GLP-1R endocytosis in wild-type versus β-arrestin-1/2 knockout human embryonic kidney 293 (HEK293) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref052">52</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>). However, endocytosis was substantially inhibited by MβCD irrespective of β-arrestin status (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), suggesting that preservation of membrane nanodomain organization, rather than recruitment of β-arrestins, is critical to sustain SNAP-GLP-1R cell entry. Indeed, exendin-4-induced SNAP-GLP-1R clustering was robust in both cell types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g003">Fig 3D</xref>), and we also found similar binding affinities for exendin-4-K12-FITC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). In view of the persistence of GLP-1R endocytosis in the absence of β-arrestins, and as these are classically thought to couple GPCRs to clathrin via AP2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref053">53</xref>], we again probed the route of GLP-1R endocytosis by TIRF microscopy in wild-type versus β-arrestin-1/2 knockout cells. We found a high degree of colocalization of clustered SNAP-GLP-1Rs with AP2 loci in both cell types (Manders’ coefficients 0.969 ± 0.005 and 0.967 ± 0.002, wild-type and β-arrestin-1/2 knockout, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Overall, our results suggest that the main pathway for entry of GLP-1Rs is clathrin-mediated but does not require β-arrestins.</p>

<title>Role of agonist-mediated palmitoylation in controlling GLP-1R behavior</title>
<p>C-terminal palmitoylation is one of the means by which GPCRs may partition into membrane rafts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref017">17</xref>]. Prompted by this, and by a previous report demonstrating constitutive palmitoylation of the GLP-1R cytoplasmic tail at cysteine 438 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref028">28</xref>], we analyzed the importance of this posttranslational modification in GLP-1R agonist-dependent nanodomain segregation. Using CHO SNAP-GLP-1R cells, we detected a low level of basal GLP-1R palmitoylation that was noticeably increased following exendin-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). To confirm these results in pancreatic beta cells, we repeated the palmitoylation assay in INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R<sup>−/−</sup> SNAP-GLP-1R cells, where we detected increased GLP-1R palmitoylation following stimulation with a range of exendin-4 concentrations, as well as with the endogenous agonist GLP-1(7–36)NH<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). GLP-1R palmitoylation was also examined in MIN6B1 SNAP-GLP-1R cells following exendin-4 stimulation in the presence or absence of the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-bromopalmitate (2-BP) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and following incubation with excess palmitate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), where it was greatly enhanced.</p>

<p>In order to further analyze the specific role of GLP-1R palmitoylation on exendin-4-triggered cellular effects, we mutated SNAP-GLP-1R to replace cysteine 438, previously described as its only palmitoylation site [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref028">28</xref>], with alanine (C438A; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). We first confirmed that mutant SNAP-GLP-1R C438A is no longer palmitoylated following exendin-4 stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

Additionally, we did not detect any significant differences in binding affinity of exendin-4-K12-FITC to mutant versus wild-type GLP-1R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s004">S4C and S4D Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In keeping with a putative role for palmitoylation in the formation of receptor clusters, we observed delayed exendin-4-triggered clustering with C438A SNAP-GLP-1R compared to wild type, albeit with a full response eventually appearing after longer agonist exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5D</xref>, kinetic traces shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s004">S4E Fig</xref>). Moreover, EM analysis of nearest neighbors in 2D plasma membrane sheets showed reduced exendin-4-induced clustering with the C438A mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5E</xref>). Recruitment of poly-glycosylated C438A SNAP-GLP-1Rs to DRFs after exendin-4 stimulation was concomitantly reduced with C438A compared to wild-type receptor (fold increase versus wild type of 0.57 ± 0.02) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5F</xref>).</p>
<p>We next compared the trafficking properties of wild-type versus C438A mutant SNAP-GLP-1R stably expressed in INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R<sup>−/−</sup>, as well as in MIN6B1 cells in which endogenous GLP-1R was knocked out by CRISPR/Cas9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s004">S4F Fig</xref>). We detected reduced internalization of the C438A mutant in both beta cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s004">S4G Fig</xref>), with no effect on receptor recycling after internalization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s004">S4H and S4I Fig</xref>). Internalization measurements by DERET or time-lapse confocal microscopy of wild-type or C438A SNAP-GLP-1Rs in INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R<sup>−/−</sup> cells again revealed reduced internalization with the palmitoylation-deficient mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s004">S4J Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s018">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s019">S4</xref> Movies).</p>
<p>The GLP-1R C438A mutation has variously been reported to result in reduced cAMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref055">55</xref>] or to have no effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref056">56</xref>], when measured in HEK293 or CHO-K1 cells. In accordance with the former reports, we found that cAMP production was reduced with C438A compared to wild-type SNAP-GLP-1R in INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R<sup>−/−</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5J</xref>). Consistent with this finding, exendin-4-induced recruitment of β-arrestin-2 to C438A SNAP-GLP-1Rs was reduced compared to wild type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5K</xref>). Critically, this translated into significant reductions in exendin-4-induced insulin secretion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g005">Fig 5L</xref>), indicating that GLP-1R palmitoylation may play an important role in glucose homeostasis or responses to pharmacological GLP-1R agonists in diabetes.</p>
<p>The closely related GIPR is also found in beta cells and plays a similar role to GLP-1R in regulating glucose-stimulated insulin release [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref025">25</xref>]. Interestingly, GIPR C-terminal cysteine residues 406 and 411 have previously been implicated in GIPR desensitization, although palmitoylation was not examined [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref057">57</xref>]. Highlighting that agonist-dependent modulation of palmitoylation and recruitment to membrane nanodomains are receptor-specific responses, we found that GIPR displayed a high degree of constitutive palmitoylation, which was not further increased by GIP stimulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s005">S5A Fig</xref>). Similarly, SNAP-GIPR was extensively recruited to DRFs under basal conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s005">S5B Fig</xref>) and showed a higher degree of constitutive clustering compared to GLP-1Rs, despite similar surface expression levels, with no detectable increase upon GIP addition (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s005">S5C Fig</xref>). Although not agonist-regulated, GIPR localization to cholesterol-rich nanodomains was functionally important, as its endocytosis was virtually abolished after MβCD treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s005">S5D Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Biased GLP-1R agonists show distinct patterns of clustering and palmitoylation</title>
<p>We have previously investigated the effects of a panel of exendin-4-derived biased GLP-1R agonists with marked differences in binding kinetics, preference for cAMP versus β-arrestin recruitment, and receptor internalization and recycling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>]. Although they were measured acutely, bias profiles were predictive of the ability of each agonist to support long-term GLP-1R signaling and insulin secretion from beta cells, with lower-affinity, slow-internalizing agonists more efficacious for longer-term responses despite being less potent acutely. Given that differential palmitoylation and/or nanodomain partitioning has been linked to the establishment of signal bias [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref058">58</xref>], we explored the possibility that two exemplar agonists from this panel with opposite bias effects, namely exendin-phe1 and exendin-asp3, might influence GLP-1R palmitoylation, clustering, and/or recruitment to membrane nanodomains compared to the parental agonist exendin-4.</p>
<p>We first analyzed the level of SNAP-GLP-1R palmitoylation elicited by these three agonists and found that stimulation with exendin-asp3, a high-affinity agonist biased toward β-arrestin recruitment and internalization, increased SNAP-GLP-1R palmitoylation compared to exendin-4, whereas stimulation with exendin-phe1, a low-affinity agonist biased in opposite directions, had a reduced effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). We next examined whether a similar pattern was present for membrane raft partitioning and found that a smaller proportion of poly-glycosylated SNAP-GLP-1Rs segregated to DRFs following stimulation with exendin-phe1, with exendin-asp3 triggering a similar level of raft recruitment to exendin-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). Supporting this finding, NR12S FRET measurements indicated a greater increase in signal from liquid-ordered versus liquid-disordered spectral regions with exendin-4 and exendin-asp3 in comparison to exendin-phe1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>). In keeping with this, both SNAP-GLP-1R clustering and internalization were virtually absent with exendin-phe1 compared to either exendin-4 or exendin-asp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s006">S6C–S6E Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to further characterize the behavior of individual GLP-1Rs at the plasma membrane following stimulation with these agonists, we performed single-molecule TIRF microscopy tracking experiments to identify individual receptor trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref060">60</xref>] in CHO-K1 cells transiently expressing SNAP-GLP-1R at low/physiological levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s020">S5</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s023">S8</xref> Movies). A mean squared displacement (MSD) analysis was used to analyze individual GLP-1R trajectories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref061">61</xref>]. These were classified into four groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s006">S6F Fig</xref>) based on both their diffusion coefficient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, top) and their anomalous diffusion exponent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, bottom). Under vehicle conditions, 14% of the receptors were immobile, 32% were confined (subdiffusion), 48% followed normal Brownian diffusion, and 6% had directional motion (superdiffusion). Following exendin-4 stimulation, the fraction of immobile receptors increased to 77%. Exendin-asp3 caused very similar changes to exendin-4 (64% of immobile receptors). Conversely, the effect of exendin-phe1 stimulation was very similar to that of vehicle, with only 12% of the receptors immobile and no significant changes upon the distribution of mobile receptors among the different groups, indicating that stimulation with this biased agonist is associated with a different pattern of lateral diffusion of plasma membrane GLP-1Rs.</p>
<p>Next, we determined signaling responses to each biased agonist at multiple doses in real time in CHO SNAP-GLP-1R cells with <sup>T</sup>Epac<sup>VV</sup>, AKAR4-NES (cytosolic PKA sensor) or AKAR4-Lyn biosensors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s007">S7A Fig</xref>), allowing the construction of sequential dose-response curves across the entire stimulation period to observe changes in potency over time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s007">S7B Fig</xref>), so as to assess whether the differential membrane raft translocation of GLP-1R by biased agonists controls spatial organization of cAMP signaling. These results suggested selective reductions in nanodomain-specific AKAR4-Lyn signaling with exendin-phe1 compared to exendin-asp3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g006">Fig 6F</xref>), in keeping with the reduced tendency of this agonist to induce GLP-1R raft localization. Although the signal bias profiles broadly matched the measured localization pattern for each agonist from membrane fractionation experiments, agreement was not perfect. In particular, exendin-asp3 displayed enhanced potency for AKAR4-Lyn signaling, despite no evidence of additional nanodomain translocation beyond that achieved by exendin-4. Nevertheless, these data support the hypothesis that, in contrast with exendin-4, exendin-phe1 fails to immobilize GLP-1Rs in cholesterol-rich signaling hotspots.</p>
<p>Our earlier observation that treatment with MβCD reduces binding affinity of exendin-4-K12-FITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g002">Fig 2</xref>) prompted us to question whether agonist-induced GLP-1R clustering might increase the tendency for dissociating agonist molecules to rebind to nearby receptors, contributing to affinity measures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref062">62</xref>]. In view of the profound differences in agonist-induced SNAP-GLP-1R clustering with exendin-phe1 versus exendin-4, we compared the affinity-modulating effects of MβCD on exendin-4-K12-FITC and exendin-phe1-K12-FITC in parallel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s007">S7C and S7D Fig</xref>) and found that MβCD reduced binding affinity of both ligands to a similar extent. These data suggest that the effect of MβCD on binding kinetics either precedes or is independent of its effect on receptor clustering, as exendin-phe1-driven clustering is minimal. Of note, a number of GPCRs have been found to form direct and functional allosteric interactions with cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref064">64</xref>], the selective depletion of which could underlie the observed reduction in affinity independently of wider effects on plasma membrane microarchitecture.</p>

<title>Allosterical control of GLP-1R nanodomain segregation</title>
<p>Previous reports highlight that the GLP-1R-specific positive allosteric modulator (PAM) BETP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref055">55</xref>] can markedly augment responses to weak GLP-1R agonists such as oxyntomodulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref065">65</xref>] and GLP-1(9–36)NH<sub>2</sub> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref026">26</xref>]. We therefore determined whether BETP played any role in GLP-1R clustering and nanodomain segregation in beta cells. Indeed, whereas the effect of BETP or exendin-phe1 alone on clustering in INS-1 832/3 GLP-1R<sup>−/−</sup> SNAP-GLP-1R cells was marginal, coapplication of exendin-phe1 with BETP resulted in rapid SNAP-GLP-1R clustering, comparable to that obtained with exendin-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). These results were supported by EM analysis from MIN6B1 SNAP-GLP-1R cells stimulated with exendin-phe1 in the presence or absence of BETP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). We also found that BETP was able to rescue the reduced SNAP-GLP-1R segregation to membrane nanodomains elicited by exendin-phe1, with SNAP-GLP-1Rs now being recruited to membrane rafts to the same extent as with exendin-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>

<p>Revisiting the concept of receptor cluster-driven rebinding as a possible contributor to agonist binding affinity, we found that costimulation with BETP was able to significantly increase the binding affinity of exendin-phe1-K12-FITC, with a less marked effect on exendin-4-K12-FITC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g007">Fig 7D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s008">S8A and S8B Fig</xref>). This agonist specificity correlates with agonist-specific BETP effects on GLP-1R clustering and the putative rebinding mechanism consequent to this, contrasting with the abovementioned agonist-equal affinity changes triggered by MβCD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To determine the functional impact of these changes in beta cells, we analyzed the signaling and trafficking characteristics of exendin-phe1 in the presence and absence of BETP. Potency estimates for exendin-phe1-induced cAMP production in INS-1 832/3 cells with endogenous GLP-1R expression were markedly increased, with a smaller effect on potency when exendin-4 was used as the orthosteric probe (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). β-arrestin-2 recruitment to the GLP-1R was also substantially increased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000097.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). Moreover, DERET measurements showed that SNAP-GLP-1R endocytosis was significantly increased for exendin-phe1 when coapplied with BETP compared to exendin-phe1 alone, with no effect of BETP on vehicle or exendin-4-triggered GLP-1R internalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g007">Fig 7F</xref>). This was supported by confocal microscopy analysis using FITC conjugates of exendin-phe1 ± BETP versus exendin-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g007">Fig 7G</xref>).</p>
<p>To further elucidate the mechanism by which BETP potentiates GLP-1R responses, we examined the relative contributions of GLP-1R palmitoylation, β-arrestins, and cholesterol-dependent membrane compartmentalization to its effect. BETP is known to cross the plasma membrane to covalently bind two intracellular GLP-1R cysteine residues (347 and 438, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g008">Fig 8A</xref> for a schematic of BETP GLP-1R binding sites) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref055">55</xref>]. Accordingly, BETP caused a significant reduction in exendin-4-induced palmitoylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g008">Fig 8B</xref>), indicating that it is able to block transfer of palmitate to the GLP-1R by binding to its known palmitoylation site. We speculated that some effects of this allosteric modulator might relate to alterations in receptor conformation through chemical modification of cysteine 438, in a manner analogous to the effect of palmitoylation at this residue. However, we found that the effect of BETP on internalization of the C438A SNAP-GLP-1R mutant stimulated by exendin-phe1 was comparable to that of wild-type receptors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g008">Fig 8C and 8D</xref>). This is in keeping with the current understanding that the pharmacology of BETP is mediated via binding to cysteine 347 rather than 438 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref055">55</xref>] and suggests that, despite its contribution to optimal internalization, cysteine 438 palmitoylation is not an obligatory event for GLP-1R endocytosis.</p>

<p>As with exendin-4, β-arrestins appear dispensable for exendin-phe1-induced GLP-1R endocytosis when potentiated by BETP, as shown using the HEK293 β-arrestin-1/2 CRISPR knockout model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000097.g008">Fig 8E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The role of the plasma membrane lipid environment in the control of GPCR functional selectivity remains a relatively underexplored area, primarily because of the technical challenges associated with the study of lipid–protein cross talk [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref007">7</xref>]. Despite this, emerging evidence using newly developed methods places lipid nanodomains as key regulators of GPCR signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref067">67</xref>].</p>
<p>In the present study, we have unveiled a central role for this lipid context in the modulation of the biological action of the beta cell GLP-1R, a class B GPCR with a significant role in metabolic regulation and a prime T2D target [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref025">25</xref>]. We found that GLP-1R clustering within beta cell membrane nanodomains and receptor palmitoylation at its C-terminal end are agonist-regulated processes, indicating that the GLP-1R interaction with its surrounding lipid environment is conditioned by its activation state. These processes are likely to be interconnected. Agonist-induced changes to GPCR conformation, typically involving outward movement of transmembrane (TM) helix 6, may result in energetically unfavorable “hydrophobic mismatch” between the exterior receptor surface and local membrane structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref002">2</xref>]. Consequently, the activated receptor may seek out membrane nanodomains with altered lipid content and hydrophobicity, and receptor oligomer assembly may be favored through stable interactions between complementary hydrophobic TM helix interfaces. Accordingly, our data show that disruption of membrane lipid organization through cholesterol-depleting MβCD treatment leads to reductions in agonist-induced GLP-1R clustering. Similarly, we found that the palmitoylation-deficient GLP-1R C438A mutant was less likely to be found in membrane rafts when activated. Palmitoylation is widely considered a dynamic raft-targeting mechanism for GPCRs, as the attached acyl chains anchor the receptor via its C-terminus in lipid-rich membrane regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref068">68</xref>]. Notably, membrane-localized palmitoyl acyltransferase enzymes and protein thioesterases can themselves be palmitoylated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref069">69</xref>] and might therefore be preferentially situated in rafts. With this in mind, it is plausible that receptor oligomerization, clustering, and palmitoylation could be mutually augmented, which could explain why residual exendin-4-induced clustering was observed both after MβCD treatment and with the GLP-1R C438A palmitoylation-null mutant. Nevertheless, there are many examples of palmitoylated proteins that are not raft-associated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref069">69</xref>], including the commonly used non–raft marker transferrin receptor, and raft partitioning of certain palmitoylated proteins such as caveolin-1 is not affected after removal of its palmitoylation sites by mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref010">10</xref>], highlighting the multifactorial and complex nature of this process.</p>
<p>Modulation of GPCR posttranslational modifications, as well as receptor clustering and recruitment to specific plasma membrane nanodomains, have all previously been suggested as means by which biased signaling can be regulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref058">58</xref>]. We found marked differences in GLP-1R clustering and nanodomain recruitment between biased exendin-4-based agonists previously shown by us to exhibit significant differences in receptor binding affinity and signaling preference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>], as well as distinct GLP-1R palmitoylation profiles as shown in this study. Related to this, our single-molecule tracking analysis also demonstrates that the plasma membrane lateral diffusion of GLP-1R molecules is altered upon agonist binding, with high-affinity agonists decreasing the average diffusion coefficient of the receptor, as recently reported for the closely related class B GPCR glucagon receptor (GCGR) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref070">70</xref>], whereas the lower-affinity biased agonist exendin-phe1 causes virtually no change. Although we did not determine the structural basis for these distinct behaviors, it seems plausible that specific TM helix rearrangements stabilized by different agonists, as previously reported for the GLP-1R [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref071">71</xref>], could affect how the receptor interacts with other membrane constituents via phenomena discussed in the previous paragraph.</p>
<p>The observation that these effects are recapitulated to a certain extent by the palmitoylation-null C438A GLP-1R mutant suggests a partial role for this posttranslational modification in the establishment of signal bias. However, the observed reductions in receptor clustering, raft segregation, and signaling, as well as the reduction in β-arrestin recruitment and GLP-1R internalization, were milder with the latter compared to exendin-phe1. Additionally, allosteric augmentation of agonist residence time with the GLP-1R-specific PAM BETP is in itself capable of inducing nanodomain clustering. BETP is able, as shown here, of exerting its effects while at the same time inhibiting GLP-1R palmitoylation, the latter presumably because of its covalent binding to GLP-1R cysteine 438 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref055">55</xref>], which would block any posttranslational modification at this residue. Whether binding of BETP at cysteine 438 or at other alternative cysteine sites could functionally substitute for the absence of palmitic acid at this residue to promote nanodomain translocation was not formally assessed in the present study, but it appears improbable that the mechanism is C438-specific, as the effect of BETP on GLP-1R endocytosis was preserved in the GLP-1R C438A mutant, which was also previously reported to show normal potentiation of partial agonist signaling responses in contrast to C347A [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref055">55</xref>]. Taken together, the above considerations suggest that the control of GLP-1R recruitment to membrane nanodomains and its associated effects on receptor signaling are likely to encompass contributions from various factors.</p>
<p>As well as receptor conformational changes influencing interactions with plasma membrane lipids, the converse can also be true. For example, binding to a specific raft lipid has been shown to allosterically change the conformation of the human epidermal growth factor (EGF) receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref072">72</xref>], and interactions with cholesterol can increase the binding affinity of certain GPCRs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref073">73</xref>], with molecular dynamics simulations suggesting that cholesterol allosterically modulates receptors by limiting their conformational flexibility [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref074">74</xref>]. Thus, functional association of GLP-1R with membrane rafts might potentially induce specific conformational changes that could modulate its agonist binding properties. In this context, receptor clustering associated with nanodomain segregation might dynamically influence ongoing agonist binding events. Firstly, cross talk within oligomeric complexes is known to alter the binding properties of individual receptor protomers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref075">75</xref>], although this typically manifests as negative cooperativity, i.e., with secondary protomers displaying reduced affinity, as previously described for GLP-1R constitutive homodimers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref037">37</xref>]. Alternatively, aggregation of receptors within specific membrane regions could shift the behavior of a dissociating agonist toward rebinding to a nearby available receptor rather than diffusing away into the extracellular space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref076">76</xref>]. Apparent support for the latter phenomenon was provided by our cholesterol depletion studies in exendin-4-stimulated conditions, in which an association was seen between reduced GLP-1R clustering and reduced binding affinity for exendin-4. However, examining this further using two agonists (exendin-4 and exendin-phe1) with opposing clustering capabilities and bidirectional manipulation of this process with BETP and MβCD provided mixed results. Specifically, the former selectively enhanced exendin-phe1 binding, whereas the effect of the latter was equal for both agonists. The likelihood that these manipulations affect multiple nonoverlapping cellular processes beyond their effects on receptor clustering, potentially including direct allosteric control of binding events by cholesterol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref077">77</xref>], may underlie these discrepancies.</p>
<p>Membrane nanodomains are thought to compartmentalize cellular processes by contributing to the organization of signaling molecules. Our observation that the main GLP-1R signal transducer, GαS, is predominantly raft-associated in beta cells underlines the importance of agonist-induced GLP-1R nanodomain segregation in the optimization of GLP-1R signaling, with disturbances in this process predicted to carry deep consequences for the control of insulin secretion, as illustrated in the present study by the acute signaling and insulin secretion defects harbored by the C438A palmitoylation-null mutant. Interestingly, the same agonist dependency for either palmitoylation or membrane raft recruitment was not found with the closely related GIPR, which has a higher constitutive activity in the absence of agonist stimulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref078">78</xref>]. Although we did not examine this possibility, local control of cAMP and PKA signaling might involve A-kinase anchoring proteins (AKAPs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref079">79</xref>]. For example, the AKAP79/150 signaling complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref080">80</xref>], known to be palmitoylated and targeted to lipid raft domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref081">81</xref>] and therefore likely to be in close apposition to activated GLP-1Rs, increases GLP-1-induced insulin secretion through anchoring of multifunctional protein phosphatases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref082">82</xref>].</p>
<p>Interestingly, despite being recruited to lipid rafts in response to agonist stimulation, the GLP-1R appears to follow a clathrin-dependent pathway of internalization. Additionally, we found that presence of cholesterol was required to ensure efficient GLP-1R endocytosis, as demonstrated by the inhibition of agonist-induced GLP-1R internalization following cholesterol extraction with MβCD. This phenotype correlated with concomitant reductions in agonist binding affinity and GLP-1R clustering upon MβCD exposure, with all these effects triggered at similar MβCD concentrations. Cholesterol extraction is known to inhibit both clathrin-dependent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref083">83</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref084">84</xref>] and clathrin-independent [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref085">85</xref>] pathways of endocytosis, as, to varying extents, all endocytosis pathways are sensitive to cholesterol depletion, with some of them also being interconnected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref086">86</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref087">87</xref>]. It can therefore be technically challenging to distinguish between endocytic pathways and their functional reliance on membrane nanodomains, with cholesterol dependency not necessarily an adequate tool to do so [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref088">88</xref>]. Moreover, the same raft‐associated protein can occasionally be internalized via different pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref085">85</xref>], and blocking one pathway with either a specific chemical inhibitor or using a genetic approach such as small interfering RNA (siRNA)-mediated depletion of specific endocytic factors can have indirect effects and/or result in the up-regulation of residual pathways as a compensatory mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref089">89</xref>]. Although our direct observation of the association of clustered GLP-1Rs with the clathrin adaptor AP2 as well as presence of gold-labeled GLP-1Rs in CCPs points toward clathrin-mediated endocytosis as the main GLP-1R internalization pathway in beta cells under normal conditions, it remains to be established whether the receptor can follow alternative pathways under different contexts and/or cell types.</p>
<p>It is also not yet known how the receptor internalizes from cholesterol-rich membrane nanodomains. This has previously been described for other raft-associated GPCRs as either following an atypical clathrin-mediated mechanism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref048">48</xref>] or via a sequential association to membrane rafts and CCPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref090">90</xref>], with raft recruitment preceding CCP incorporation. Additionally, although recruitment of β-arrestins to the GLP-1R occurred preferentially at membrane rafts, indicative of a higher level of receptor activation within these nanodomains and presumably associated with the β-arrestin-dependent GLP-1R desensitization previously observed by us [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>], β-arrestins appeared to play a very minor role in GLP-1R endocytosis. It is worth noting that the GLP-1R harbors an AP2-binding domain in its C-terminal tail and can interact directly with this clathrin adaptor, reducing the need for additional intermediaries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref091">91</xref>].</p>
<p>In conclusion, in the present study, we have employed biochemical assays in conjunction with high-resolution microscopy and spatially localized FRET biosensor experiments to establish the existence of an agonist-triggered GLP-1R palmitoylation and clustering mechanism coupled to nanodomain-dependent GLP-1R signaling and internalization. We have also established that this mechanism can be controlled by the modulation of agonist binding affinities, either with biased GLP-1R agonists or with the PAM BETP. Future investigations—including identification of the specific palmitoyltransferase(s) and palmitoyl protein thioesterase(s) responsible for the regulation of agonist-induced GLP-1R palmitoylation in beta cells, as well as use of molecular dynamics simulations, model systems to fine-tune the plasma membrane lipid composition, and superresolution experiments to examine dynamic changes in GLP-1R conformation and binding affinities associated with interactions with specific lipid nanodomains at a single-molecule level in real time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref092">92</xref>]—will all be required to further develop our understanding of the impact of membrane lipid composition on the spatiotemporal organization of GLP-1R signaling.</p>

For kinetic measurements and analysis, washed, Lumi4-Tb-labeled cells were treated with NR12S at the indicated concentration, and a 5-min baseline read was performed (λEx = 335 nm, λEm = 490, 570, and 610 nm). Agonist was then added and changes in TR-FRET sequentially monitored. Signals at each wavelength were blank-subtracted and expressed ratiometrically to each other, with agonist-induced changes quantified relative to individual well baseline.</p>

<title>Measurement of GLP-1R binding parameters by TR-FRET</title>
<p>For equilibrium binding assay at multiple MβCD concentrations, cells expressing SNAP-GLP-1R were first labeled with SNAP-Lumi4-Tb (40 nM) for 60 min at room temperature and added to 96-well white plates. MβCD treatments in HBSS were applied for 45 min along with metabolic inhibitors (20 mM 2-deoxyglucose and 10 mM NaN<sub>3</sub>) to prevent GLP-1R endocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref097">97</xref>]. Exendin-4-K12-FITC or exendin-9-K12-FITC at a final BSA concentration of 0.1% were applied and allowed to bind at room temperature for 3 h. TR-FRET was then measured over 10 min at room temperature using a Flexstation 3 plate reader (λEx = 335 nm, λEm = 520 and 620 nm, delay 50 μs, integration time 300 μs). Binding was quantified ratiometrically as a 520/620 signal, and K<sub>d</sub> was determined using the Prism saturation binding model “one site–specific binding”. For kinetic binding assays, cells expressing SNAP-GLP-1R were first labeled with SNAP-Lumi4-Tb (40 nM) for 60 min at room temperature. Where relevant, MβCD treatments were performed after Lumi4-Tb labeling. After washing, cells were placed in HBSS + 0.1% BSA, supplemented with metabolic inhibitors as above, and baseline TR-FRET was measured over 10 min at 37 °C as above. FITC-conjugated agonists were then added, and TR-FRET was sequentially measured to monitor agonist association. Binding was quantified ratiometrically as a 520/620 signal, and baseline-subtracted data were analyzed using the GraphPad Prism model “association kinetics: two or more concentrations of hot” to obtain association (<italic>k</italic><sub>on</sub>) and dissociation (<italic>k</italic><sub>off</sub>) rate constants, from which the equilibrium binding constant K<sub>d</sub> was determined.</p>

Cells expressing SNAP-GLP-1R were first labeled with SNAP-Lumi4-Tb (40 nM) for 1 h at room temperature. Where relevant, MβCD treatments were performed after Lumi4-Tb labeling. After washing, cells were placed in HBSS supplemented with 24 mM fluorescein. A 10-min baseline read at 37 °C was taken in a Flexstation 3 plate reader in TR-FRET mode (λEx = 335 nm, λEm = 520 and 620 nm, delay 400 μs, integration time 1,500 μs), after which compounds were injected to the wells. Loss of surface SNAP-GLP-1R was detected as changes over time in the homogenous time-resolved fluorescence (HTRF) ratio (620/520 signal after blank subtraction at each time point). Dose-response curves were constructed from AUC obtained from kinetic traces at different agonist concentrations and fitted to 4-parameter logistic curves to calculate potency (log EC<sub>50</sub>) and efficacy (E<sub>max</sub>) values.</p>

<title>Measurement of FITC-ligand uptake by TR-FRET</title>
<p>Cells expressing SNAP-GLP-1R were first labeled with SNAP-Lumi4-Tb (40 nM) for 60 min at room temperature. After washing, MβCD treatments in HBSS were added to the cells directly in 96-well plates for 45 min. Cells were then moved to the cold room to temporarily arrest endocytic processes before addition of 100 nM exendin-4-K12-FITC or exendin(9–39)-K12-FITC, which were allowed to bind for 3 h at 4 °C to reach a state of quasi-equilibrium. The plate was then moved directly to a Flexstation 3 plate reader at 37 °C to initiate endocytosis of prebound FITC-ligand with the extracellular ligand concentration remaining constant. TR-FRET signal was monitored as above (λEx = 335 nm, λEm = 520 and 620 nm, delay 50 μs, integration time 300 μs) over 30 min. Here, entry to the endosomal pathway leads to dissociation of labeled receptor-ligand complexes, resulting in a reduction in TR-FRET signal. The acidic endosomal pH also reduces inherent FITC fluorescence. Net ligand uptake was therefore calculated as the AUC for change in TR-FRET signal throughout the 30-min assay period.</p>

<title>Real-time measurement of cAMP production and PKA activation using FRET biosensors</title>
<p>The <sup>T</sup>Epac<sup>VV</sup> biosensor was a gift from Dr. K. Jalink, The Netherlands Cancer Institute. The AKAR4-NES and AKAR4-Lyn biosensors were gifts from Dr Jin Zhang (Addgene plasmid #61620). Cells expressing SNAP-GLP-1Rs were transiently transfected with the relevant biosensor plasmid for 36 h prior to the assay and placed in HBSS in 96-well clear-bottom black plates. After a 5-min baseline read at 37 °C (λEx = 440 nm, λEm = 485 and 535 nm) in a Flexstation 3 plate reader, compounds were injected to each well, and sequential readings immediately commenced. FRET was expressed ratiometrically as signal at 535 nm divided by signal at 485 nm. Individual well responses were normalized to baseline to reduce variability. Dose responses were either analyzed by obtaining the cumulative AUC relative to baseline over a fixed time period, or at each time point, or time bin, to allow kinetic comparisons of agonists between each pathway. To determine agonist-related biased signaling between each biosensor, the relative potency ratio approach was taken, as all compounds were full agonists in each pathway measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref098">98</xref>]. Dose-response curves were constructed for each agonist at indicated time points, and log EC<sub>50</sub> values for exendin-phe1 and exendin-asp3 responses in each pathway were subtracted from those of reference agonist exendin-4 to generate normalized potency estimates (ΔLog EC<sub>50</sub>), followed by subtraction of the test pathway (AKAR4-Lyn) from the reference pathway (AKAR4-NES or <sup>T</sup>Epac<sup>VV</sup>) to provide the bias estimate (ΔΔLog EC<sub>50</sub>). As all agonists in each pathway were measured in parallel during the same experiment using the same stock of serially diluted ligand, experiment-specific ΔLog EC<sub>50</sub> and ΔΔLog EC<sub>50</sub> values could be produced without requiring error propagation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref022">22</xref>].</p>

<title>Palmitoylation assays</title>
<p>For the detection of palmitoylated GLP-1Rs, cells were stimulated with 100 nM of the indicated agonist for 10 min and, when appropriate, pretreated with 10 μM BETP for 5 min (and throughout the agonist stimulation period) or overnight with 200 μM of the palmitoylation inhibitor 2-BP. Isolation of palmitoylated proteins was performed with the CAPTUREome S-Palmitoylated Protein Kit (Badrilla), following the manufacturer’s instructions. The assay is based on the acyl-resin assisted capture method, described in detail elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000097.ref099">99</xref>]. Key steps include blocking of free thiol groups with a blocking reagent, cleavage of thioester linkages to release the palmitate group, and capture of newly liberated thiols with the CAPTUREome capture resin. Briefly, cells were lysed and free thiols blocked in the manufacturer’s blocking buffer at 40 °C for 4 h with constant vortexing. Proteins were then precipitated with cold acetone for 20 min at −20 °C. Following centrifugation at 16,000<italic>g</italic> for 5 min, the pellet was extensively washed with 70% cold acetone and resuspended in the manufacturer’s binding buffer. Approximately 10% of the soluble lysate was saved as the input fraction (IF). Prewashed CAPTUREome capture resin was added to the lysates. To this mixture, either the thioester cleavage or the acyl-preservation reagents were added. Resins were washed five times with the manufacturer’s binding buffer. Urea sample buffer (100 mM Tris-HCl [pH 6.8], 2.5% SDS, 4 M urea, 50 mM dithiothreitol, 0.05% bromophenol blue) was used to elute captured proteins from the resin. Eluted samples were incubated at 37 °C for 30 min before western blotting for SNAP-GLP-1R to detect the fraction of palmitoylated versus nonpalmitoylated receptor. Resin-bound proteins treated with the thioester cleavage reagent are referred to as the cleaved bound fraction (cBF) and represent the fraction of palmitoylated proteins, whereas resin-bound proteins treated with the acyl-preservation reagent are referred to as the preserved bound fraction (pBF) and are used as negative control for the assay. Corresponding unbound fractions are known as the cleaved unbound fraction (cUF) and the preserved unbound fraction (pUF).</p>
