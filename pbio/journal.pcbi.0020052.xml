In order to make use of this data for understanding particular organisms and for discerning general principles about how organisms function, it will be necessary to reconstruct their various biochemical reaction networks. Principal among these will be transcriptional regulatory networks. Given the physical and logical complexity of these networks, the various sources of (often noisy) data that can be utilized for their elucidation, the monetary costs involved, and the huge number of potential experiments (~10<sup>12</sup>) that can be performed, experiment design algorithms will be necessary for synthesizing the various computational and experimental data to maximize the efficiency of regulatory network reconstruction. This paper presents an algorithm for experimental design to systematically and efficiently reconstruct transcriptional regulatory networks. It is meant to be applied iteratively in conjunction with an experimental laboratory component. The algorithm is presented here in the context of reconstructing transcriptional regulation for metabolism in <italic>Escherichia coli,</italic> and, through a retrospective analysis with previously performed experiments, we show that the produced experiment designs conform to how a human would design experiments. The algorithm is able to utilize probability estimates based on a wide range of computational and experimental sources to suggest experiments with the highest potential of discovering the greatest amount of new regulatory knowledge.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="synopsis"><title>Synopsis</title><p>In recent years, the exploration of life has been bolstered through the advent of whole genome sequencing. This new data source significantly enables the reconstruction of genome-scale metabolic networks. After a metabolic reconstruction, it will be necessary to discover the genetic control mechanisms that operate within an organism. Transcriptional regulatory network (TRN) reconstruction is costly both in terms of time and money, so it is critical that the reconstruction efforts be made as efficient as possible. Experiments must be designed so that the most new regulatory knowledge is discovered in each experiment. The huge number of possible experiments (~10<sup>12</sup>) and the vast amount of heterogeneous data available for designing experiments overwhelms the human ability to assimilate. The authors have developed an algorithm that utilizes a mathematical model of a reconstructed metabolic network integrated with a partially reconstructed TRN to identify the experiment designs with the highest potential of yielding the most new regulatory knowledge. The authors show that the produced experiment designs are similar to those a human expert would produce, and that the algorithm has a facility to incorporate any relevant data source to design such experiments.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>This work was funded in part by National Institute of General Medical Services (NIHGMS) grant GM068837.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="10"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Barrett CL, Palsson BO (2006) Iterative reconstruction of transcriptional regulatory networks: An algorithmic approach.

The picture emerging from metagenomic [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b003">3</xref>] and environmental sequencing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b004">4</xref>] efforts is that the number of sequenced genomes will surge in the near future. In order to further our understanding of these organisms, it will be necessary to reconstruct their various biochemical reaction networks. First will be metabolism, which is arguably the most basic function that a cell performs. After metabolic reconstruction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b005">5</xref>], the second most feasible reconstruction will be that of transcriptional regulatory networks (TRNs). These regulatory reconstructions will require methods to systematically, comprehensively, and efficiently reconstruct TRNs for which little data exist. Initial work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b012">12</xref>] on systematic TRN reconstruction has been performed. These pioneering efforts span the range from the theoretical to combined computational and experimental iterative methods, and they address many of the important issues in TRN reconstruction. No single method is available, though, that iterates between computational and experimental phases, utilizes a dynamic modeling framework, has a mechanism for incorporating probabilistic data derived from any source, and explores all of the ways that a network can be activated by different growth environments. All of these aspects are relevant to the “open question” of “whether automated experimental design can be useful in a large and poorly characterized biological system with noisy data” [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b007">7</xref>]. Since the functional state of a TRN is a direct consequence of its environment, an experiment design algorithm must comprehensively probe the TRN with different growth environments and must infer, based on whatever computational and experimental data that exist, which parts of the network will be most fruitful to target with experimental investigations. To be practical, the algorithm must suggest the most efficient series of experiments, for the potential number of experiments is vast.</p><p>This paper presents an algorithm for systematically and efficiently reconstructing the topology and condition-dependent logic of TRNs. Practically, this means discovering new transcription factor (TF)–target gene regulatory connections, the (Boolean) logic of how TFs regulate target genes, and the environmental stimuli that modulate TF activity. The algorithm is presented here in the context of reconstructing transcriptional regulation for metabolism in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content>. The computational algorithm is intended to be applied iteratively, in conjunction with an experimental laboratory component that discovers direct TF–target gene interactions and the logic of the interactions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020052-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The computational component is based on dynamic growth simulations using regulated Flux Balance Analysis (rFBA), which is a constraints-based approach for bounding allowable steady-state metabolic network flux distributions, coupled with a Boolean logic formalism for transcriptional regulation. The laboratory component has been partially detailed elsewhere [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b013">13</xref>]. In summary, this experimental procedure employs single or double TF knockout (KO) strains to infer TF–target gene logic rules from a comparison between KO and wild-type gene expression profiles in two growth environments. This procedure is now augmented with TF binding assays to confirm direct TF interaction with target gene promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b016">16</xref>]. In the context of this experimental protocol, an experiment design consists of a growth environment shift and a group of TFs (or “knockout group” [KG]) for which to create deletion strains. The purpose of the algorithm described herein is to produce such experiment designs, and to do so with the primary goal of maximizing the efficiency of the reconstruction process.</p><fig id="pcbi-0020052-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0020052.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>An Overview of the Combined Computational and Experimental Iterative Procedure</title><p>The computational algorithm utilizes a dynamic simulation of the current integrated transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network reconstruction to design experiments.

Efficiency gains are realized from fewer iterations in two key ways: time spent researching the next most informative experiment design (which could conceivably require weeks to months); and, laboratory supply and personnel costs required to perform each iteration. Minimizing the total number of iterations necessitates maximizing the number of new regulatory interactions discovered in each iteration. Given the experimental protocol described above, maximal rule discovery in each iteration depends on a simultaneous maximization and minimization. Assuming for a moment that one had a KG in mind for which one wanted to discover the TRN, it would be necessary to identify two growth environments that each maximally activate the regulatory connections for the identified TFs. Simultaneously, one would want to minimize the connections identically activated in both environments to minimize redundant discoveries.</p><p>This strategy is complicated by three facts. First, one would not have a complete TRN by which to judge whether the proposed growth environment shift–TF KG combination would be the one to yield the most new regulatory logic at the current stage of the reconstruction. Second, the best picture one could draw for the complete, real TRN would come from various data sources (e.g., literature, homology, expression profile based algorithms, location analysis, and TF binding site prediction algorithms) that are characterized by uncertainty and noise. Third, it would not be an optimal strategy to first choose a KG and then the best growth environment shift for that KG. Since the growth environment determines how a TRN is activated, and each of the possible KGs would be associated with different patterns of regulatory activity depending on the environment, it is the combination of growth environment shift and TF KG that determines the maximum yield of new regulatory logic.</p><p>The goal of designing a maximally efficient experimental strategy thus requires the resolution of three critical issues. First, how does one use criteria from various sources—with their attendant uncertainties, incompleteness, and noise—to infer as complete a picture as possible of the structure and logic of the TRN? Second, how does one utilize this incomplete picture to decide which growth environment shift–TF KG combination is most likely to yield the greatest amount of new regulatory knowledge? And third, how does one do this while steering away from previously discovered regulatory logic and towards new knowledge? After detailing the algorithm that addresses these issues in the next section, we describe how it has been applied and assessed in the Implementation section below.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Algorithm</title><p>The logic of the algorithm, depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020052-g002">Figure 2</xref>, is to simulate growth in a comprehensive suite of environments, and for each simulation, record the observed expression states of all genes and how the TRN was logically activated. This information is then used to identify the group of TFs (KG) that is most widely acting and most densely interacting, and the two growth environments (representing a growth environment shift) in which this occurs. The resulting combination of KG and growth environment shift is then considered the experiment design with the greatest potential for providing the most new regulatory rules. This presumption is based on the power law nature of TRNs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b018">18</xref>], which implies that more highly connected TFs are more likely to be involved in undiscovered regulatory interactions. This methodology has the added advantage of (dis)confirming rules already in the model, but this becomes less of an issue as subsequent iterations utilize more speculative information in place of rules in the model as a basis for suggesting experiment designs.

This behavior is in line with the human-conceived experiment designs from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020052-t001">Table 1</xref>, which both utilized terminal electron acceptor shifts. This result is satisfying, for it supports our goal of developing an algorithm that designs experiments similarly to how a human expert would. Such a computational reasoning process will become especially advantageous when large amounts of speculative information (from high-throughput experimental and computational sources) are added to the design procedure, for such valuable information would overwhelm any person's reasoning ability. Explicitly, both human and algorithm sought two growth environments that activate the integrated transcriptional regulatory and metabolic (ITRAM) network in maximal, and maximally different, ways. And additionally, for maximal rule discovery, both targeted for KO those TFs most responsible for mediating the network activations.</p><p>The last four experiment designs are of a qualitatively different nature. These last four are mainly aimed at elucidating nitrogen-related regulation, and so do not probe regulation states that are as different as seen with electron acceptor and glucose shifts. They do this by shifting from a growth environment containing two components, where at least one can also function as a nitrogen source, to an environment containing just one component that functions as both the carbon and nitrogen source. These experiments are expected to reveal less, and less globally acting, regulation—as implied by the lower N<sub>R</sub> values. The ranking of experiment designs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020052-t002">Table 2</xref> illustrates how the algorithm works to uncover more global regulation first and then focuses on fine-grained resolution through discovery of more local regulation.</p><p>The TFs suggested for the experiment designs in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020052-t002">Table 2</xref> conform to the reasoning of targeting for KO those TFs most responsible for the network activations. For example, in correspondence with the top six suggested growth environment shifts being carbon source or respiratory condition shifts, the suggested TFs are widely influential glucose and carbon metabolism related (crp, mlc, and cra) and respiratory-state specific (arcA, fnr, and narL). Both fis and lrp are included because they are generally widely acting and interact at promoters with some of the other more global TFs, namely crp and arcA, and to a lesser extent, mlc and narL. The remaining TF, rpoS, is primarily associated with stress response and transition to stationary phase, both of which elicit large gene expression program changes. The TF rpoS is known to have a large regulon and to be present at low levels during log phase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b020">20</xref>]. Whether or not to investigate rpoS during log phase as suggested by the algorithm would likely attract expert evaluation more than any of the other suggested TFs. Given the wide-ranging influence of rpoS, an expert may decide that an investigation of the role of rpoS in log phase is worthwhile, especially since a clearer understanding of its regulatory targets in log phase may clarify its function in stress and stationary conditions. Such an expert evaluation step is the setting for which the algorithm was designed.</p><p>Both of the experiment designs of <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020052-t001">Table 1</xref> do occur in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020052-t002">Table 2</xref> (indicated by boldface text), but they are not the top-ranked designs.

The experiment designs from both human and the algorithm suggest the fnr and arcA TF KOs, but they suggest different additional sets of three. It is not currently known whether the algorithm-suggested group of three TFs would be more informative than those chosen by humans, but as discussed above, at least two of the three suggested by human were found to be relatively uninformative. The second design from <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020052-t001">Table 1</xref> is ranked sixth in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0020052-t002">Table 2</xref>, and both human and algorithm suggest the same TF that has so far been investigated in that iteration.</p><p>Just as the algorithm was run to retrospectively suggest experiments for the first iteration, we used the updated reconstruction resulting from the completed first iteration to retrospectively suggest experiment designs for the second iteration.

As a secondary objective, the algorithm seeks the most densely interacting group of TFs so that the more complex regulation will be identified first. This ordering of objectives is used so that the algorithm will function well for both associative and dissociative scale-free networks, in which in the latter the most connected nodes are not connected to each other.</p><p>To grasp why the algorithm produces the experiment designs that it does and how it arrives at a rank ordering of their information potential, it is helpful to consider a result from previous work [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b021">21</xref>] directly related to the algorithm work reported here. This result is included here as <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020052-sg001">Figure S1</xref>. This figure is the result of clustering the activity profiles computed in Step 1 of the algorithm. It shows distinct clusters of activity profiles whose relative spatial arrangement is due to the growth environments to which the contained activity profiles correspond. In particular, it was found that the most prominent discriminators between activity profiles were the terminal electron acceptor present in the growth environment and whether or not glucose or gluconate was the carbon source. A secondary level of clustering, seen as distinct but overlapping clusters, was found to be due to the nitrogen source.</p><p>The observed clustering in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020052-sg001">Figure S1</xref> both explains the experiment design algorithm's results and illustrates how it arrives at its design ranking. As discussed earlier, the intent of the algorithm is (in part) to identify two growth environments that each maximally activate the TRN, and that do so in the most dissimilar manner. Activity profiles in the same clusters of <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0020052-sg001">Figure S1</xref> represent similar activations of the TRN, whereas those in different clusters represent more dissimilar activations—and to a degree directly corresponding to their separation distance. Because the terminal electron acceptor and the presence of glucose in the growth environment were found to be the prime discriminators between clusters, they primarily determine the dissimilarity of the two environments' activity profiles.</p></sec><sec id="s3b"><title>Obtaining the Initial Network</title><p>The demonstration of the algorithm with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> represents a special case because of the large body of scientific literature that exists for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content>. For the algorithm presented here to be applicable to an organism, there must be some initial characterization of its TRN. Because the algorithm presented here has the capability to incorporate and utilize essentially any source of probabilistic data through the basic units that constitute the activity profiles, it can be flexibly applied in an organism-specific manner since certain types of data may be more readily or inexpensively attainable, depending upon the organism.

Efficiency is based on time and cost; time is minimized through the algorithm-based experiment design process that would likely take a human expert weeks to months, and cost is minimized through the minimization of the number of laboratory experiments that need to be performed. The algorithm operates by deciding, given the current state of knowledge embodied in the TRN reconstruction, which experiment design—consisting of a group of TF KO strains and a growth environment shift—is most likely to yield the greatest number of new regulatory logic rules. The designs are equally applicable to overexpression studies. The algorithm has the ability to base its decisions on any data source that can assign a probability to the direct interaction of a TF and its regulatory targets and/or to the logical nature of its interactions. This aspect of the algorithm is significant, for it overcomes the finiteness inherent in a model and synthesizes a potentially vast amount of experimental and computational data that would not be possible by a human. We performed a limited retrospective comparison involving two previously performed TRN reconstruction iterations and found that the experiment designs that would have been suggested by the algorithm closely match the experiment designs that were chosen by human experts. This result illustrated our second goal of developing an algorithm with human expert–like reasoning ability. We expect this ability, when coupled with large amounts of probabilistic experimental and computational data, will significantly augment the limited assimilation ability of human experimentalists. Given the increasing number of organisms whose genomes have been sequenced and whose gene complement characterization is ever improving, we expect that this algorithm or others like or based on it will be necessary to efficiently uncover their transcriptional regulatory systems.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>The model.</title><p>The algorithm presented herein is demonstrated using the first available genome-scale reconstruction of the integrated transcriptional regulatory and metabolic network for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">E. coli</named-content> (iMC1010<sup>v1</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0020052-b013">13</xref>].

In this framework, each simulation is an iterative process of short time intervals. In each iteration, the off/on status of all genes and the concentrations of environmental components from the previous iteration are noted and are then used to evaluate the (Boolean) transcriptional regulatory logic for every gene. The result is an updated off/on status for every gene, and thus every reaction, in the model. Then, using a steady-state flux assumption, a biomass pseudo-reaction is maximized, which results in the setting of all reaction flux values in the metabolic network. Based on these flux values, the concentrations of environmental constituents and the biomass are updated. This update completes an iteration. For this work, an environment that results in a biomass doubling time of at most 12 h is considered to allow cellular growth. Simulations corresponded to log-phase growth for 50 min, with time steps in 5-min intervals.</p></sec><sec id="s4c"><title>Library of growth environments.</title><p>Every growth simulation must occur in a defined nutritional environment.

Each basic unit is composed of four cells, which correspond to the four possible (Boolean) combinations of TF and target gene states (i.e., TF “inactive”/target “not expressed,” TF “inactive”/target “expressed,” TF “active”/target “not expressed,” and TF “active”/target “expressed”).

The procedure for creating an activity profile begins by recording the computed expression state of the genes in the model in every time step (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0020052-g003">Figure 3</xref>). For those TF–target pairs whose regulatory connection is explicitly contained in the model, Equation 2 is used for placing values in the basic unit. Since we use experimentally confirmed data in the model, the second term in Equation 2—which can literally be interpreted as “the TF can bind the target promoter, given the model”—is taken to be unity. The first term is either 0 or 1 depending on whether the joint TF–target state combination was observed in any simulation time step.

To prevent the algorithm from repeatedly suggesting the same experiments, it is necessary to record which criteria were used to suggest any experiments performed in earlier iterations. As is explained in Steps 6–8 of the Algorithm section, these criteria consist of particular cells of the shift activity profiles. Thus, we record in a “history mask” those cells of the shift activity profile that were the criteria for choosing experiment designs that were actually implemented in previous iterations. The history mask has the same dimensions as a shift activity profile, and any cell whose corresponding logic has been confirmed by an experiment that was used to suggest a design is “marked.” The history mask is applied to each shift activity profile; those shift activity profile cells whose corresponding history mask cells are marked are overwritten with the value 0.0.</p></sec><sec id="s4k"><title>KO groups.</title><p>One of the fundamental outputs of the algorithm is the identification of groups of TFs for which to create single-deletion KO strains.

This number will be growth environment dependent. To quantify the regulatory activity of a TF <italic>f,</italic> we define R(<italic>f</italic> | S<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>) as the sum over all connection weights between <italic>f</italic> and all of its inferred and/or known regulatory targets in both growth environments <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic>. The connection weights are derived from the shift activity profiles in the following manner. First, all of the basic units for <italic>f</italic> in the shift activity profile for S<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> are identified. For each basic unit that meets two conditions, its largest contained weight is added to R(<italic>f</italic> | S<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic>). The first condition states that the TF must be active in at least one of the environments <italic>i</italic> or <italic>j,</italic> because an experiment utilizing this growth environment shift with this TF KO strain would be uninformative otherwise. Specifically, this means that the last two cells of the basic unit, corresponding to TF “active”/target “not expressed” and TF “active”/target “expressed,” must both not be zero. The second condition states that the activity relationship between a TF and its target gene must have changed in the shift, otherwise the KO in the second environment may likely provide no new information. Specifically, the number of non-zero cells in the basic unit must be greater than one. The regulatory activity of KG <italic>k</italic> in growth environment S<italic><sub>ij</sub></italic> is then computed as
