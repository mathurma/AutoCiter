        <p>Functional MRI (fMRI) experiments rely on precise characterization of the blood oxygen level dependent (BOLD) signal. As the spatial resolution of fMRI reaches the sub-millimeter range, the need for quantitative modelling of spatiotemporal properties of this hemodynamic signal has become pressing. Here, we find that a detailed physiologically-based model of spatiotemporal BOLD responses predicts traveling waves with velocities and spatial ranges in empirically observable ranges. Two measurable parameters, related to physiology, characterize these waves: wave velocity and damping rate. To test these predictions, high-resolution fMRI data are acquired from subjects viewing discrete visual stimuli. Predictions and experiment show strong agreement, in particular confirming BOLD waves propagating for at least 5–10 mm across the cortical surface at speeds of 2–12 mm s-1. These observations enable fundamentally new approaches to fMRI analysis, crucial for fMRI data acquired at high spatial resolution.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Functional magnetic resonance imaging (fMRI) experiments have substantially advanced our understanding of the structure and function of the human brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Friston1">[1]</xref>. Hemodynamic responses to neuronal activity are observed experimentally in fMRI data via the blood oxygenation dependent (BOLD) signal, which provides a noninvasive measure of neuronal activity. Understanding the mechanisms that drive this BOLD response, combined with detailed characterization of its spatial and temporal properties, is fundamental for accurately inferring the underlying neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Logothetis1">[2]</xref>. Such an understanding has clear benefits for many areas of neuroscience, particularly those concerned with detailed functional mapping of the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Schira1">[3]</xref>, those using multivariate classifiers that implicitly incorporate the spatial distribution of BOLD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kamitani1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Haynes1">[5]</xref>, and those that focus on understanding and modeling spatiotemporal cortical activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Breakspear1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Breakspear2">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The temporal properties of the hemodynamic BOLD response have been well characterized by existing physiologically based models, such as the balloon model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Buxton1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Robinson2">[14]</xref>. Although the spatial response of BOLD has been characterized experimentally via hemodynamic point spread functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Engel1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Shmuel1">[18]</xref>, it is commonly agreed that the spatial and spatiotemporal properties are relatively poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Uurbil1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kriegeskorte1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Many studies work from the premise that the hemodynamic BOLD response is space-time separable, i.e. is the product of a temporal HRF and a simple Gaussian spatial kernel. The latter assumed as a simple ansatz or ascribed to diffusive effects, for example <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Friston3">[21]</xref>. This approach raises the following concerns: (i) since the temporal dynamics of the HRF is the focus of most theoretical analyses, e.g. the balloon model, this precludes dynamics that couple space and time, dismissing whole classes of dynamics, such as waves; (ii) in practice, employing a static spatial filter then convolving with a temporal HRF on a voxel-wise basis neglects non-separable interactions between neighboring voxels; and (iii) calculating temporal correlations between voxels then assumes that the hemodynamic processes responsible for the signal occur on scales smaller than the resolution of the measurements. In summary, neglecting spatial effects such as voxel-voxel interactions and boundary conditions (e.g., blood outflow from one voxel must enter neighboring ones) ignores important phenomena and physical constraints that could be used to increase signal to noise ratios and to improve inferences of neural activity and its spatial structure. These constraints are becoming increasingly relevant, as advances in hardware and software improve the spatial resolution of fMRI by reducing voxel sizes.</p>
      <p>While treating spatial hemodynamics as a Gaussian is a reasonable first approximation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Engel1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kriegeskorte1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Logothetis2">[22]</xref>, this requires spatiotemporal BOLD dynamics, such as spatially delayed activity to be attributed solely to the underlying neuronal activity, without hemodynamic effects from neighboring tissue, an assumption that may not be valid. In this limit, BOLD measurements would simply impose a spatial low-pass filter of neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kriegeskorte1">[20]</xref>. Several studies have already presented results that challenge this assumption, most strikingly by demonstrating reliable classification of neuronal structures such as ocular dominance or orientation columns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kamitani1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Haynes1">[5]</xref> on scales significantly smaller than the resolution of the fMRI protocols used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kamitani1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Haynes1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Uurbil1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Haynes2">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Swisher1">[24]</xref>. Although there are suggestions that the organization of orientation columns may have low spatial frequency components, hemodynamics may also contribute to this effect. Going in the opposite direction, as voxels decrease in size, they must eventually become smaller in linear extent than the hemodynamic response, and thus become highly interdependent. Recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kriegeskorte1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Drysdale1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Shmuel2">[27]</xref>, have highlighted how BOLD responses involve active changes in cortical vasculature, and hence reflect their mechanical and other spatiotemporal response properties, with spatial scales that are at least partly distinct from the scales of the underlying neuronal activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kriegeskorte1">[20]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given the above points, the mapping between neuronal activity and the spatially extended BOLD response cannot be assumed to be a spatially local temporal convolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kriegeskorte1">[20]</xref>, but should rather be treated in a comprehensive framework that accounts for both spatial and temporal properties and their interactions. A recent theoretical approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Drysdale1">[25]</xref> treats cortical vessels as pores penetrating the cortical tissue and draws on a rich framework of methods developed in geophysics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Wang1">[28]</xref> to derive a physiologically based approximation of the hemodynamics. This model is expressed in terms of a closed set of dynamical equations that reduces to the familiar balloon model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Drysdale1">[25]</xref> in the appropriate limit where spatial effects are averaged over each voxel. It analyzes the spatiotemporal hemodynamic response by modeling the coupled changes in blood flow, pressure, volume, and oxygenation levels that occur in response to neural activity.</p>
      <p>The objective of the present work is to make and empirically test novel predictions of the model, focusing particularly on spatiotemporal dynamics. We first predict the quantitative spatiotemporal hemodynamic response function (stHRF) for physiologically plausible parameters. We find that the model predicts a local response and damped traveling waves, whose speed and range are potentially observable with current high resolution fMRI. Second, we acquire and characterize such high resolution fMRI data from subjects viewing a visual stimulus designed to excite spatially localized neuronal activity in primary visual cortex. We observe hemodynamic waves in these experimental data, whose characteristics confirm our theoretical predictions of wave ranges, damping rates, and speeds, and constrain the physiological parameters of the model.</p>

        <p>Cortical hemodynamics and the resulting BOLD signal are modeled by incorporating the physiological properties of cortical vasculature into the theory of fluid flow through a porous elastic medium. The pores are the dense elastic cortical vasculature that penetrate the bulk cortical tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Drysdale1">[25]</xref>. In response to a rise in neural activity, local arterial inflow increases, deforming surrounding tissue and thus exerting outward pressure on neighboring tissue. The model predicts coupled dynamical changes in pressure, blood volume, and deoxyhemoglobin (dHb) content in the two-dimensional sheet comprising the cortex and its vascular layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref>). We refer the reader to the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for full details of the model.</p>

            <p>A: The hemodynamic response is driven by a localized spatiotemporal input, which represents neural activity and causes a change in arterial inflow of blood, which sets up a pressure gradient ∇P. B: This mass inflow deforms surrounding tissue and thus exerts pressure on nearby vessels. C: The rise in pressure causes further volume changes in adjacent vessels, which propagate outwards via interactions with successive regions of tissue. Damping of the response through blood viscosity and losses via outflow. D: The increase of local inflow increases oxygenated hemoglobin (oHb), reducing the amount of local deoxygenated hemoglobin (dHb). As oxygen is simultaneously passively extracted from blood, oHb is converted to dHb, causing a delayed rise of dHb during vessel relaxation.</p>

        <p>Here we linearize this model and derive the stHRF, which is the BOLD response due to a spatially point-like, brief increase in neuronal activity. The main stages of this response are as follows: An increase in neuronal activity <italic>z</italic>(<bold>r</bold>,<italic>t</italic>) occurs, as a function of time <italic>t</italic> and position <bold>r</bold> on the cortical sheet. This causes relaxation of the smooth arterial muscles (mediated by astrocytes), inducing an increased influx of blood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g001"><bold>Figure 1A</bold></xref>) increasing local vessel volume and pressure. Blood then flows to regions of lower pressure, resulting in a redistribution of pressure through the medium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g001"><bold>Figure 1B</bold></xref>). These pressure changes induce further blood volume changes in adjacent cortical tissue. As a consequence of conservation of mass and momentum, this results in local changes of blood velocity in this adjacent tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g001"><bold>Figure 1C</bold></xref>). As these coupled changes propagate outwards, the viscous properties of blood lead to damping of their amplitude (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g001"><bold>Figures 1C, D</bold></xref>). This is accompanied by outflows to draining veins, reducing vessel volume, and thus yielding further dissipation. Although these two sources of dissipation occur at small scales, they are reflected in the larger scale dynamics of the system.</p>
        <p>Together, the above processes result in the propagation of pressure changes that travel beyond the ∼1 mm range of direct blood flow between adjacent arterioles and venules. In our theory, the time required for changes in directly coupled adjacent tissue to occur is comparable to the time it takes for the blood to transit the gray matter (∼1 s). Consequently, these considerations predict propagation speeds of order 1 mm/s.</p>
        <p>During the change in vessel volume, local deoxyhemoglobin (dHb) content also changes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g001"><bold>Figure 1D</bold></xref>). The influx of arterial blood increases the content of oxygenated hemoglobin (oHb), hence reducing local dHb concentration. Further reductions occur by the removal of dHb by local outflow. As this process occurs, oxygen diffuses passively into the cortical tissue, converting oHb to dHb. Together, these processes result in an initial decrease of local dHb concentration followed by a delayed increase.</p>
        <p>The BOLD signal thus reflects the net change of blood volume and dHb content. In the case of a spatiotemporally localized neural activation, the predicted BOLD response is given by the stHRF, expressed in Eqs. <bold>1</bold>–<bold>5</bold> of the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>. The response to a more general stimulus is obtained by convolving the stimulus with the stHRF, as discussed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>. Critically, the predicted stHRF (Eq. <bold>5</bold>) implies that the hemodynamic response contains a component that propagates as damped traveling waves over spatial scales potentially far greater than those of the neural signal that generated them. In other words, our model predicts that even if neuronal activity is restricted to a very small patch of cortex, it will cause changes in the BOLD signal that propagate for several millimeters over a few seconds.</p>
        <p>The precise quantitative properties of the predicted BOLD signal depend on several key physiological parameters that can be experimentally determined. Our analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>) indicates that the average vascular stiffness and the rate of damping due to blood viscosity and outflow at boundaries are the most critical parameters (see <bold>Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold> for a complete list of parameters). High stiffness results in a rapid return to equilibrium, thereby increasing the wave speed and range. Conversely high blood viscosity results in strong damping, thereby reducing the range of the waves. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g002">Figure 2</xref> shows a range of predicted spatially extended BOLD responses spanning physiologically realistic ranges of these two parameters (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>). A combination of strong damping and low stiffness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>, top left panel) is predicted to lead to localized responses whose spatial extent is mostly confined to that of the neuronal signal. Although there would still be some weak signal propagation, it is unlikely this would be detectable given typical levels of measurement noise and voxel sizes. This parameter set corresponds to cases where the stHRF spatial scale is smaller than a typical voxel size, where the approach of treating voxels independently would be justified.</p>

Between these two extremes there is a broad region of physiologically plausible values of these parameters (medium damping and/or vascular stiffness) for which traveling hemodynamic waves are predicted to have properties that are potentially detectable in current experiments but with ranges that would not likely have led to their detection to date.</p>

        <p>These concentric visual stimuli resulted in strong BOLD modulations in early visual cortex, as seen in the example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g003">Figure 3C</xref>. As a result of the retinotopic projection from visual field to early cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>), these concentric rings are projected to lines on the cortical surface, one for each eccentricity. We find that the maximum BOLD modulation occurs on these lines, and that signal modulations weaken away from these peak responses. The three rings were presented at the same time. However, since the hemodynamic responses of the last two rings were not sufficiently separated on the cortex (in all subjects), we focus on the responses to the most inner ring, which was clearly separated (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) from the responses of the other rings. The spatiotemporal evoked response is shown in a series of snapshots at different times <italic>t</italic> with respect to the stimulus onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>).

        <p>The outward propagation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>), discussed in the previous section, suggests the possibility of a traveling wave response, propagating normal to the centerline of the underlying neuronal response. We now focus on characterizing this response. Because stimulation of an isoeccentric curve in the visual field excites an approximately straight line of neurons in V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Tootell1">[33]</xref>, normal directions are clearly identifiable on a flattened cortex. We thus estimate the centerline of the primary isoeccentric response in a flattened representation of V1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g004"><bold>Figures 4A,B</bold></xref>), and average the signal change over all points the same distance from this centerline (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).

        <p>To estimate the speed of wave propagation, phase fronts of the BOLD signal were estimated (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).

        <p>As depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold></xref>, our analysis shows that: (i) Near the centerline there is a localized response at approximately |<italic>x</italic>|&lt;1 mm, corresponding to the spatial scale of the expected neural response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Vanduffel1">[34]</xref>, including the lateral spreading of thalamocortical projections from the lateral geniculate nucleus to V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Steriade1">[35]</xref>. (note that all that is required to estimate the properties of the waves, in the following analysis, is that the central region, i.e. Δx, be small compared to the propagation distance of the waves so that we separate the propagating from the local component). (ii) Propagation occurs away from the center at a roughly constant speed (constant slope of the phase front) in both directions. Straight-line fits towards the fovea (F, red) and toward the periphery (P, black) yield propagation speeds <italic>v</italic><sub>F</sub> = 2.3±0.2 mm s<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>v</italic><sub>P</sub> = 1.8±0.2 mm s<sup>−1</sup> (s.d.), respectively for Subject 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). (iii) The signal is attenuated as it propagates, with fits to the log-linear plots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>) yielding spatial damping constants <italic>K</italic><sub>P</sub> = 0.33±0.02 mm<sup>−1</sup> and <italic>K</italic><sub>F</sub> = 0.39±0.02 mm<sup>−1</sup> (s.d.).

        <p>Data of sufficient quality to enable segmentation and primary response identification were obtained in seven of the eight available hemispheres. Data from the left hemisphere of one subject contained signal drop-out and artifact, most likely due to head movement, which prevented artifact-free surface-based reconstruction. Clear evidence of propagating waves in BOLD signal was observed in all seven of these usable data sets (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s005">Figure S5</xref></bold>).</p>
        <p>A total of 14 sets of wave responses were found, from which parameter estimates were able to be made for 12 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>). Two cases of propagation toward the periphery in one subject showed interference from the second stimulus ring and were not used. These 12 responses yielded group averages <italic>v</italic> = 4±2 mm s<sup>−1</sup>, <italic>K</italic> = 0.28±0.03 mm<sup>−1</sup>, and Γ = 0.8±0.2 s<sup>−1</sup> (s.e.m). The scatter plot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5E</bold></xref>) shows a correlation (R<sup>2</sup> = 0.22) between the temporal damping rate and the velocity. As discussed above, the ratio between these two quantities yield secondary estimates for spatial damping and are consistent with the substantially smaller relative uncertainty in the spatial damping constant. Furthermore, this shows that the spatial extent is relatively fixed regardless of the wave properties. This is consistent with the observation that the mean FWHM of the responses is clustered around 4.7±0.4 mm (s.e.m).</p>
        <p>To recap, our biophysical theory shows that spatiotemporal hemodynamic responses obey a wave equation, whose key parameters are the wave velocity and a damping constant affecting decay in time and space. These parameters can be estimated from the empirical responses using simple regression analyses. We find that the parameter estimates here all lie within the a priori ranges estimated independently of the model (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The increasing resolution of functional MRI and the development of analysis methods that depend on spatial patterns in these data underline the need for a systematic, quantitative approach to the spatial and temporal properties of the BOLD signal that is based on the properties of the underlying tissue and vasculature. Here we apply a recent physiologically based theory of hemodynamics in cortical tissue and vasculature to derive the linear spatiotemporal hemodynamic response function (stHRF), which is the response to a spatiotemporally localized stimulus of moderate amplitude. High resolution fMRI data are then used to test the predicted BOLD response to localized neuronal modulation in early visual cortex. Just two extra measurable parameters – <italic>v</italic><sub>β</sub> and Γ - suffice to characterize the spatial properties of the response.</p>
      <p>The theory used is the first to make a mean-field approximation to cortical vasculature and goes beyond spatially point-like multicompartment models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Mandeville1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Boas1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Zheng1">[37]</xref> as it allows calculation of spatiotemporal hemodynamic responses to general stimuli. It predicts, and the data demonstrate, that the hemodynamic response to a spatially highly localized neuronal drive exhibits traveling waves that propagate over a few mm of cortical tissue. Moreover, the velocity, damping and characteristic range of the observed waves are well within the range of theoretical predictions. These traveling waves have not been previously predicted or reported in human cortex. The central part of the response is non-propagating and has a temporal profile consistent with the standard balloon model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Buxton1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Robinson2">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Buxton2">[38]</xref>.</p>
      <p>A further key implication of the spatial effects in our data is that fMRI voxels should only be treated independently if each voxel is larger than the stHRF scale. For interpreting fMRI acquired at sufficiently high spatial resolution the spatiotemporal properties of the stHRF must also be taken into account. Moreover, when voxels are small, we speculate that propagation of hemodynamic waves beyond their boundaries may underlie the observation that some experiments can be sensitive to structures at scales below the voxel size, including ocular dominance and orientation preference columns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kamitani1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Haynes1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Swisher1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The combination of modeling and data allows us to estimate key physiological parameters of the model from observations of individual subjects. This lays the basis for replacing fMRI analysis procedures that rely on purely empirical analysis by ones that relate to the underlying physiology. We have shown how characterization of the spatiotemporal properties of fMRI data allows properties of the cortical tissue and vasculature to be inferred, hence accounting for differences between subjects and, potentially, brain regions. For example, relatively low blood viscosity and/or high tissue stiffness are predicted to lead to longer-range wave propagation. Specific experimental manipulations, such as the use of blood-thinning agents, could be employed to test the predicted changes in wave speed and spatial range. Similarly, the reduction in tissue elasticity that typically occurs with ageing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kotsis1">[39]</xref>, should be able to be probed noninvasively via its effects on wave velocity, and thereby taken into account when making inferences about neuronal activity in cohorts where age may be a confound. Likewise, regionally specific vascular properties have recently been highlighted as an important potential confound in studies of effective connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Friston4">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-David1">[41]</xref>, thereby underlining the need for a careful measurement and allowance for hemodynamic effects.</p>
      <p>It is worth asking why hemodynamic waves have not been previously observed in fMRI. Some reasons are: (i) If voxel dimensions are large and sampled over a long time period, the hemodynamic response is not sufficiently resolved to detect propagating waves (ii) If the BOLD signal is spatially smoothed, then the spatiotemporal structure of the measured BOLD signal will be averaged out; (iii) Wave propagation is confined to occur within the cortical sheet and will be only be readily apparent in surface-based data reconstruction; (iv) Hemodynamic waves from a point source (e.g., a localized activation in a typical study) in two spatial dimensions decay more rapidly with distance than from the line source our experiment, where net decay can occur only in the direction perpendicular to the cortical locus of our one-dimensional stimulus. Despite these points, as high resolution protocols and surface-rendered data analysis techniques gain widespread use, the need for quantitative spatial analysis will likewise grow.</p>
      <p>An important consequence of having hemodynamic traveling waves is that the spatial dynamics of BOLD are not independent of their temporal dynamics. The conventional factorization into spatial and temporal convolution operators is thus not valid in general. A greater understanding of the BOLD response, and brain mapping in general, would come from understanding the spatiotemporal hemodynamic response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Kriegeskorte1">[20]</xref>. The present spatiotemporal HRF provides a solution to this problem, starting from a theory of spatiotemporal hemodynamics.</p>
      <p>Several other issues arise from having hemodynamic traveling waves. (i) The existence of hemodynamic waves mean that spatiotemporal hemodynamics, induced by nearby sources, can interact in a nontrivial way, a property that occurs in the temporal domain, concerning the nonlinear interaction between temporally proximate responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Friston2">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Buxton2">[38]</xref>. (ii) These findings cast further doubt on those measures of effective connectivity, such as Granger causality, unless they include a careful treatment of hemodynamic effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Friston4">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Roebroeck1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Chang1">[43]</xref>. (iii) On the other hand, experimental designs could exploit the wave properties of hemodynamics by using stimuli that induce resonant properties of cortical tissue - akin to the temporal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Robinson2">[14]</xref>- enhancing detection of the evoked signal.</p>
      <p>Traveling waves of neuronal or glial origin have been described throughout the brain, including in visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Chang1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Dahlem1">[46]</xref>, raising the question of whether these waves might be responsible for the hemodynamic traveling waves seen in our data. However, several considerations argue against this: (i) The close match between the theoretically predicted values and the observed data strongly supports the conclusion that the waves in our data are of hemodynamic origin. (ii) Previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Grinvald1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Benucci1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Xu1">[48]</xref> that reported propagating neuronal waves in V1 of similar spatial extent to those seen here demonstrated that these waves are 1–2 orders of magnitude <italic>faster</italic> (approximately 200 mm s<sup>−1</sup> in cats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Benucci1">[47]</xref>, 100–250 mm s<sup>−1</sup> in primates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Grinvald1">[45]</xref> and 50–70 mm s<sup>−1</sup> in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Xu1">[48]</xref>), and waves in cortical white matter travel even faster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Chang1">[43]</xref>. Likewise, although the spatial scales may be similar to those presently reported, the diffusion of nitrous oxide - which mediates the coupling between neuronal activity and vasodilation - occurs too rapidly to explain our results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Friston3">[21]</xref>. (iii) Another possible source of propagating signal of possible relevance are calcium waves traveling via astrocytes because these mediate the neuronal signal in vasodilation. However, these calcium waves travel at ∼10 µm s<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Peters1">[49]</xref>, which is 2 orders of magnitude <italic>slower</italic> that the waves reported here.</p>
      <p>Although hemodynamic waves have not been characterized, detected, or previously modeled, existing work has detailed some spatiotemporal properties of the BOLD response. Previous studies have demonstrated hemodynamic contributions to spatiotemporal BOLD response, including: the effect of draining veins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Lee1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Bianciardi1">[51]</xref> which induces a latent BOLD signal due to these veins; effects across vascular layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Tian1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Hirano1">[53]</xref> that induce layer dependent delays of the BOLD response; and general effects of the vascular network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Chang1">[43]</xref> that cause delayed BOLD responses across extensive brain regions. Studies have also implemented ways to minimize such effects to improve spatial specificity of functional activations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Chang1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Lee1">[50]</xref>. The hemodynamic waves are different from the mentioned phenomena in that they exhibit propagation across the cortical surface. As the waves pass through they induce changes in arterioles, capillaries, and venules – not reliant on overall drainage by large veins. The possible interplay of these effects will be subject to future modeling and experimental work.</p>
      <p>In summary, with advances in imaging technology and data analysis, intervoxel effects will become more pronounced, demanding spatiotemporal analyses based on the underlying brain structure and hemodynamics. By verifying a model that enables such analysis, the present paper opens the way to new fMRI probes of brain activity. These new possibilities include experiments using spatial deconvolution to discriminate between neural and hemodynamic contributions to the spatiotemporal BOLD response evoked by complex sensory stimuli. An important potential application would be to disentangle negative components of the BOLD response from surround inhibition in the visual cortex. Our analysis also affords novel insights and physiological information on neurovasculature, a subject of particular significance to ageing and vascular health. Finally, the combination of the present stHRF with spatially embedded neural field models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Robinson1">[8]</xref> would allow a systematic and integrated computational framework for inferring dynamic activity in underlying neuronal populations from fMRI data.</p>

        <title>Theoretical prediction</title>
        <p>The theoretical prediction of the stHRF is derived from a physiologically-based model for spatiotemporal hemodynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Drysdale1">[25]</xref>. This model treats brain tissue as a poroelastic medium, with interconnected pores representing the cortical vasculature. The governing equations are a set of nonlinear partial differential equations that connect blood flow velocity <bold><italic>v</italic></bold>, mass density contributed by blood (i.e. the part of the total density contributed by blood as opposed to tissue) <italic>ξ</italic>, deoxygenated hemoglobin concentration <italic>Q</italic>, and blood pressure <italic>P</italic> due to an increase in arterial flow <italic>F</italic> caused by an increase neural activity <italic>z</italic>, as a function of time <italic>t</italic> and position on the cortex <bold><italic>r</italic></bold>. Although we describe changes in blood volume throughout the text, we model changes in ξ - which is closely related to the fractional volume of blood in tissue: <italic>ξ</italic>/<italic>ρ</italic><sub>f</sub>, where <italic>ρ<sub>f</sub></italic> is the density of blood itself. These model equations were recently derived and explained in a separate paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Drysdale1">[25]</xref>. We provide a synopsis here and apply this with appropriate boundary conditions (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>) to calculate the stHRF and derive a hemodynamic wave equation.</p>
        <p>The dynamics of flow <italic>F(</italic><bold><italic>r</italic></bold><italic>,t)</italic> are modeled as a damped harmonic oscillator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Friston2">[13]</xref> driven by neural activity <italic>z(</italic><bold><italic>r</italic></bold><italic>,t):</italic> <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002435.e001" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>The dynamics in Eq. <bold>1</bold> are parameterized by the signal decay rate κ, the flow-dependent elimination constant <italic>γ</italic> and the resting flow <italic>F<sub>0</sub></italic>. The neural activity <italic>z(</italic><bold><italic>r</italic></bold><italic>,t)</italic> drives a distribution of arterial control sites (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s001">Figure S1</xref></bold>), as described further in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>.</p>
        <p>The vascular response due to this increase in arterial flow is then constrained by physical laws, including conservation laws. Firstly, the conservation of blood mass is embodied by<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002435.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>c<sub>P</sub></italic> is a proportionality constant. This conservation law describes how the rate of change of local blood mass density ∂<italic>ξ</italic>/∂<italic>t</italic> is determined by the local divergence of the flow <italic>ρ<sub>f</sub></italic>∇•(<bold><italic>v</italic></bold>), the source of mass due to the average inflow of blood <italic>F</italic>, and the average venous outflow of blood <italic>c<sub>P</sub>P</italic>. These latter source/sink terms are mean-field terms that describe the average spatiotemporal hemodynamic processes (For more details see the <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold> on the derivation of these terms).</p>
        <p>The rate at which blood travels through the vasculature depends on the elastic response of cortical vessels. This process must conserve momentum, expressed as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002435.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>P</italic> is the average pore pressure, <italic>D</italic> parameterizes damping due to blood viscosity, and <italic>c</italic><sub>1</sub>/<italic>ρ<sub>f</sub></italic> is the constant of proportionality between pressure gradient and acceleration in the porous medium. This equation describes how forces are directed down pressure gradients, causing blood to accelerate toward regions of lower pressure. These velocity changes are resisted by blood viscosity leading to the resistive term <italic>D</italic>(<bold><italic>v</italic></bold><bold>-</bold><bold><italic>v</italic></bold><italic><sub>F</sub></italic> - <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><italic><sub>P</sub></italic>) where <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><italic><sub>F</sub></italic> and <bold><italic>v</italic></bold><italic><sub>P</sub></italic> are the blood velocities at inflow and outflow, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>). The average pressure is related to the elastic properties of blood vessels by the constitutive equation, <disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002435.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>where the elasticity of blood vessels is parameterized by the Grubb exponent 1/<italic>β</italic> (see <bold>Table S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>) and a proportionality constant <italic>c</italic><sub>2</sub>, as in previous empirical studies of cerebral blood flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Grubb1">[54]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As changes in local blood volume occur, oxygen diffuses into cortical tissue because of the increased partial pressure of oxygen. This process produces blood deoxyhemoglobin (dHb) - whose concentration is represented by <italic>Q</italic> - from oxygenated hemoglobin. The local concentration of hemoglobin in tissue is a fixed proportion <italic>ψ</italic> (in mmol kg<sup>−1</sup>), of local blood density in tissue, and is thus expressed as <italic>ψξ</italic>. Hence, the difference <italic>ψξ</italic> - <italic>Q</italic> is the amount of oxygenated hemoglobin. If <italic>η</italic> is the fractional rate at which oxygen passes from oxygenated hemoglobin to cortical tissue, the flow of dHb obeys a conservation equation, similar to Eq. <bold>2</bold> for the conservation of blood mass:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002435.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where the difference term (<italic>ψξ</italic> - <italic>Q</italic>)<italic>η</italic> on the right hand side introduces the source of dHb, in which dHb is convereted to oHb at a rate <italic>η</italic>, and the term –<italic>QPc<sub>P</sub></italic>/(<italic>ξρ<sub>f</sub></italic>) represents the rate of reduction of dHb concentration due to blood outflow. This assumes that the blood is well mixed so the concentration leaving a vascular unit is <italic>Q</italic>/(<italic>ξρ<sub>f</sub></italic>) at a rate of average venous blood outflow <italic>c<sub>P</sub>P</italic> (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>). As in Eq. <bold>2</bold>, the net outflow rate, here dHb ∇•(<italic>Q</italic><bold><italic>v</italic></bold>), is balanced by local changes in content, here ∂<italic>Q</italic>/∂<italic>t</italic>.</p>
        <p>Finally, the measured BOLD signal <italic>y</italic> is predicted by a recent semi-empirical relation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Stephan2">[55]</xref> between tissue blood volume content <italic>ξ/ρ<sub>f</sub></italic> and dHb content Q to be<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002435.e006" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>where <italic>V<sub>0</sub></italic> is the resting total volume, <italic>Q<sub>0</sub></italic> is the resting fraction of dHb, and the constants <italic>k<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>k<sub>2</sub></italic>, and <italic>k<sub>3</sub></italic> depend on the acquisition parameters, including field strength and echo time.</p>

          <p>Eq. <bold>1</bold>–<bold>6</bold> are a closed set of nonlinear partial differential equations which describe the hemodynamics in response to an arbitrary neural signal <italic>z(</italic><bold><italic>r</italic></bold><italic>,t)</italic>.

          <p>Provided the amplitude of neural activity is not too large, the model's response is approximately linear. Therefore, the hemodynamic variables henceforth represent linear perturbations from the steady state of hemodynamics. We thus approximate the hemodynamic response by linearizing the system <bold>1</bold>–<bold>6</bold> and arrive at the hemodynamic wave equation<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002435.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where Γ is the damping parameter and <italic>ν</italic><sub>β</sub> is the propagation velocity. This equation predicts waves of <italic>ξ</italic> in response to an increase in local activity <italic>F</italic>. The damping parameter is given by 2Γ = <italic>β</italic>/<italic>τ</italic>+<italic>D</italic>/<italic>ρ</italic><sub>f</sub> and shows that dissipation of <italic>ξ</italic> waves is due to viscous damping, <italic>D/ρ</italic><sub>f</sub>,and blood outflow <italic>β</italic>/<italic>τ</italic> at boundaries, which also dissipates wave amplitude. This equation represents the dominant factor that determines the traveling-wave part of the hemodynamic response (the rest of the equations are detailed in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>). Ranges for <italic>ν</italic><sub>β</sub> and Γ are of the order of mm s<sup>−1</sup> and s<sup>−1</sup>, respectively (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>).</p>
          <p>Fourier methods are next used to calculate a set of transfer functions, <italic>T<sub>Lz</sub></italic>, which describe the ratio of the response of a hemodynamic quantity <italic>L</italic> (i.e., <italic>Q</italic>, <italic>ξ</italic>, <italic>y</italic>, or <italic>F</italic>) at a given spatial frequency (i.e., wave vector) <bold><italic>k</italic></bold> and temporal angular frequency <italic>ω</italic>, to the change in neural activity signal <italic>z(</italic><bold><italic>k</italic></bold><italic>,ω)</italic>. These transfer functions act as spatiotemporal filters and can be used to derive the BOLD frequency response to an arbitrary neural input. Hence, this includes the impulse response from a spatiotemporal neural input; i.e. the spatiotemporal HRF. This transfer function <italic>T<sub>yz</sub></italic> maps from neural activity <italic>z(</italic><bold><italic>r</italic></bold><italic>,t)</italic>, to BOLD signal <italic>y(</italic><bold><italic>r</italic></bold><italic>,t)</italic>.

        <p>Participants viewed visual stimuli via a mirror mounted on the head coil at a viewing distance of 1.5 m, resulting in a display spanning a diameter of 11° (or 5.5° in eccentricity). The visual paradigm was prepared with Presentation® software. Stimulus duration and fMRI pulse timing were logged with 0.1 ms accuracy. The stimulus consisted of 3 concentric rings simultaneously presented at 0.6°, 1.6°, and 3° eccentricity, presented in a block paradigm. (on for 8 s and off for 12.25 s). Each annulus was only 1 pixel wide (roughly 0.014° visual angle).</p>
        <p>As known from retinotopic studies, isoeccentric lines in the visual field map to approximately straight lines in primary visual cortex.

        <p>During the ‘on’ state, the annuli were divided into black and gray dashes that reversed roles 4 times per second (i.e., in a 2 Hz cycle). During the ‘off’ state, the annuli remained black (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s002">Figure S2</xref></bold>). To improve visual fixation, a black fixation cross extended across the entire screen, 4 black circles were permanently present, and a pseudorandomly flickering fixation dot fluctuated between red, green, and blue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Tyler1">[56]</xref>. Subjects reported that they were able to maintain alertness and attend to the fixation cross throughout data acquisition.</p>

Each fMRI session consisted of 8 stimulus blocks, consisting of 80+1 fMRI volumes (the extra scan was due to the delayed onset) plus an additional 7 ‘off’ scans prior to the first block. Hence each session contained 88 fMRI volumes, a running time of 176 s, 14 such sessions were acquired from each subject.</p>
        <p>To improve timing accuracy and synchronization we used a monitor refresh rate of 60 Hz for the visual display, and a TR of 2006 ms, rather than 2000 ms, to compensate for system delays.

Apart from the spatial up-sampling and mapping, no further preprocessing of the data in the spatial dimension was performed. The temporal time series of each voxel were low-pass filtered with a third order Butterworth filter below 0.1 Hz. Furthermore, although there were three concentric rings, we focus only on the 0.6° ring closest to the fovea when analyzing the spatiotemporal hemodynamic response as this was clearly spatially distinct whereas there was some overlap in responses to the furthest two rings (1.6°, and 3°).</p>

        <title>Estimation of physiological parameters from data</title>
        <p>The empirical estimates for the properties of the wave fronts were calculated from the phase fronts emerging from the peak of the BOLD signal at <italic>x</italic> = 0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref>). From here, the two principal characteristics of the spatiotemporal response can be identified, the local response, close to <italic>x = 0</italic>, as a region of near-uniform phase spanning |<italic>x</italic>|&lt;1 mm, and the propagating component heading away from these regions at |<italic>x</italic>|&gt;1 mm (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5B</bold></xref> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>). This is consistent with the expected neural point spread function estimated from independent physiological data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002435-Vanduffel1">[34]</xref>. Straight-line fits to this propagating region, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, yielded estimates of the wave velocity ν<sub>β</sub>.</p>
        <p>The BOLD signal was measured at each point on the phase front as a function of time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5C</bold></xref>) and space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002435-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>). Transformation to logarithmic scales yielded approximately straight line plots, suggesting exponential decay of BOLD signal in space and time. Linear regression then yielded rate constants of temporal and spatial signal decay. Estimation of the standard error of these linear regressions provided error estimates for these parameters (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002435.s006">Text S1</xref></bold>).</p>

These rings flickered back and forth with four reversals per second during the stimulus on phase. These rings were overlaid on a grey background and fixation grid consisting of rings and lines (in dark grey) that were always present. The sizes of the rings and the lines are exaggerated for clarity, and in the experimental design were 1 pixel wide. The intensities of the light and dark grays are also exaggerated on the spatial oscillation on each ring: 1, 2, &amp; 3, and shown below on the 2 Hz flicker panel. During the off phase rings 1,2, &amp; 3 were set at the luminosity of the fixation grid. Not shown here is the fixation task, which was a small square at the centre which pseudorandomly osciallated between red, green and blue. Lumonisty values were measured at: 1.1×10<sup>6</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup> and 3×10<sup>5</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup> for the light and dark grays respectively. The background gray was measured at 6×10<sup>5</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup>, and the dark stimulus fixation lines were measured at 1.5×10<sup>5</sup> cd/m<sup>2</sup>. These lumonisity values were measured with a Minolta © CS-100 photometer under conditions matching those of the subjects in the scanner.</p>
