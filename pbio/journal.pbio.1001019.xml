        <p>The anterior visceral endoderm (AVE), a signalling centre within the simple epithelium of the visceral endoderm (VE), is required for anterior-posterior axis specification in the mouse embryo. AVE cells migrate directionally within the VE, thereby properly positioning the future anterior of the embryo and orientating the primary body axis. AVE cells consistently come to an abrupt stop at the border between the anterior epiblast and extra-embryonic ectoderm, which represents an end-point to their proximal migration. Little is known about the underlying basis for this barrier and how surrounding cells in the VE respond to or influence AVE migration. We use high-resolution 3D reconstructions of protein localisation patterns and time-lapse microscopy to show that AVE cells move by exchanging neighbours within an intact epithelium. Cell movement and mixing is restricted to the VE overlying the epiblast, characterised by the enrichment of Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2) to the lateral plasma membrane, a hallmark of Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signalling. AVE cells halt upon reaching the adjoining region of VE overlying the extra-embryonic ectoderm, which displays reduced neighbour exchange and in which Dvl2 is excluded specifically from the plasma membrane. Though a single continuous sheet, these two regions of VE show distinct patterns of F-actin localisation, in cortical rings and an apical shroud, respectively. We genetically perturb PCP signalling and show that this disrupts the localisation pattern of Dvl2 and F-actin and the normal migration of AVE cells. In <italic>Nodal</italic> null embryos, membrane localisation of Dvl2 is reduced, while in mutants for the <italic>Nodal</italic> inhibitor <italic>Lefty1</italic>, Dvl2 is ectopically membrane localised, establishing a role for Nodal in modulating PCP signalling. These results show that the limits of AVE migration are determined by regional differences in cell behaviour and protein localisation within an otherwise apparently uniform VE. In addition to coordinating global cell movements across epithelia (such as during convergence extension), PCP signalling in interplay with TGFβ signalling can demarcate regions of differing behaviour within epithelia, thereby modulating the movement of cells within them.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The orientation of the head-tail axis is determined during embryogenesis by the movements of a subset of cells called the AVE (anterior visceral endoderm). These cells migrate from their initial position within the simple epithelium of the visceral endoderm (VE) to a location from which they eventually induce anterior pattern in the adjacent epiblast. Little is understood about how AVE cells migrate within the VE, why they stop migrating where they do, and how surrounding cells in the VE respond to or influence AVE migration. In this study, we use time-lapse microscopy and high-resolution 3D reconstructions of protein localisation patterns to address these issues. Our results show that AVE cells move by exchanging neighbours within an intact epithelium. The limits of AVE migration are determined by regional differences in cell behaviour and protein localisation within an otherwise apparently uniform VE. Finally, we examine the role of planar cell polarity (PCP) signalling, which is responsible for coordinating morphogenetic events across different epithelia. We show that in addition to this traditional role in coordinating global cell movements, PCP signalling along with TGFβ signalling can demarcate regions of differing behaviour within epithelia, thereby modulating the movement of cells within them.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The anterior visceral endoderm (AVE) is a specialised sub-set of the visceral endoderm (VE) that is responsible for inducing anterior pattern in the underlying epiblast (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Beddington1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Rossant1">[4]</xref>). It is induced at the distal tip of the egg-cylinder in a Nodal dependent manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Brennan1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Mesnard1">[7]</xref>. From this initial distal position, it migrates directionally to the future embryonic anterior, thereby properly orientating the anterior-posterior axis of the embryo. Once positioned over the future anterior epiblast, the AVE represses posterior markers in the abutting epiblast, thereby restricting their expression to the opposite side of the epiblast cup, where the primitive streak later forms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-PereaGomez1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Dkk1</italic>, an inhibitor of canonical Wnt signalling, has been demonstrated to act as a guidance cue for AVE migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-KimuraYoshida1">[9]</xref>. An asymmetry in the early distal VE expression of the <italic>Nodal</italic> antagonists <italic>Lefty1</italic> and <italic>Cer1</italic> has been reported to result in differential proliferation in the VE, leading to the initial displacement of the AVE towards the future anterior <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Yamamoto1">[10]</xref>. There are no reports of pre-gastrulation developmental abnormalities in either <italic>Lefty1</italic> or <italic>Cer1</italic> null mutant embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Meno1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Belo1">[15]</xref>. However, <italic>Lefty1;Cer1</italic> double mutants show an abnormal accumulation of cells in the anterior region of the VE as early as 6.5 days <italic>post coitum</italic> (dpc) (just prior to gastrulation) as well as an expansion and occasional duplication of the primitive streak at gastrulation stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-PereaGomez2">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Planar Cell Polarity (PCP) signalling is responsible for coordinating morphogenetic events across fields of cells, such as the regular orientation of bristles on the fly wing, or polarised mediolateral intercalation during embryonic axis elongation by convergent extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Axelrod1">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Strutt1">[20]</xref>. Dishevelled (Dvl) is a key mediator of Wnt signalling through both canonical and PCP pathways. Dvl translocation to the cell membrane is a hallmark of PCP signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Axelrod2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Wallingford1">[22]</xref>. Another core PCP molecule is flamingo, an atypical member of the E-Cadherin super-family. Flamingo is a 7-pass trans-membrane molecule that is essential for normal PCP function, though the exact mechanism by which it acts remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Usui1">[23]</xref>. One of the primary modes of action of PCP signalling is through non-muscle myosin IIA and F-actin, that together facilitate junctional remodelling in epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Winter1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Blankenship1">[26]</xref>. Mutants of <italic>Nap1</italic>, a regulator of Actin branching, have AVE migration defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Rakeman1">[27]</xref>. The small GTPase Rac1 modulates cytoskeletal dynamics in response to PCP signals. <italic>Rac1</italic> mutants have also recently been shown to have AVE migration defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Migeotte1">[28]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Time-lapse studies show that the movement of AVE cells to the future anterior is an active process that is completed in the order of 4 to 5 h and that AVE cells come to an abrupt halt at the boundary between the epiblast and the extraembryonic ectoderm (ExE) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Srinivas2">[29]</xref>. The VE remains a monolayer during AVE migration, suggesting that AVE cells migrate through the surrounding VE cells rather than on top of them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Srinivas2">[29]</xref>. However, since it is only AVE cells that have been visualised to date, very little is known about how surrounding VE cells respond to or possibly influence AVE migration. For example, it is unknown if the cells surrounding AVE cells are also motile and whether VE cells “ahead” of the migrating AVE are displaced onto the ExE, displaced laterally, or removed in some other way such as apoptosis. Why AVE cells stop moving proximally upon reaching the ExE is also unknown, particularly given that the VE overlying the epiblast and ExE are part of a single continuous sheet.</p>
      <p>Using time-lapse microscopy to record the behaviour of VE cells, we show that those cells overlying the epiblast exchange neighbours through cell intercalation, while cells in the VE overlying the ExE are relatively static in their behaviour. This difference in behaviour correlates with regional differences in the localisation of F-actin and non-muscle myosin IIA. Dishevelled-2 (Dvl2) is membrane localised specifically in the VE overlying the epiblast, suggestive of active PCP signalling in this region. Genetically perturbing Dvl2 localisation leads to the abnormal migration of AVE cells onto the ExE. Membrane localisation of Dvl2 is reduced in <italic>Nodal</italic> mutants and ectopically increased in mutants of the <italic>Nodal</italic> inhibitor <italic>Lefty1</italic>, suggesting a way by which these key patterning molecules might also influence morphogenetic events.</p>

        <title>The VE Retains Epithelial Integrity During AVE Migration</title>
        <p>Our previous time-lapse studies of AVE cells show them migrating in a manner reminiscent of fibroblasts, with cellular projections predominantly in the direction of migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Srinivas2">[29]</xref>. To determine if AVE cells might be undergoing an epithelial to mesenchymal transition during migration and to determine if the end-point to their migration might be a manifestation of differences in the structure of the VE epithelium, we visualised the epithelial apical junctional markers ZO-1 (tight junctions) and E-cadherin (adherens junctions) at different stages of AVE migration. To visualise the AVE, we used embryos carrying a <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> reporter transgene that labels AVE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Rodriguez2">[30]</xref>. To obtain information about the three-dimensional pattern of distribution of these molecules in the context of the whole embryo, we captured image volumes of entire embryos by confocal microscopy and visualised the data as opacity rendered 3D representations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s005">Movie S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Both ZO-1 and E-cadherin were detected continuously and uniformly along cell-cell junctions throughout the VE, at all stages of AVE migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s006">Movie S2</xref>). We did not detect any discontinuity in ZO-1 or E-cadherin even amongst migrating AVE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g001">Figure 1B–F'</xref>), indicating that the AVE and surrounding VE retain epithelial integrity during AVE migration. These results are also consistent with similar findings recently published by Migeotte et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Migeotte1">[28]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Intercalation and Dynamic Behaviour of Cells in the VE</title>
        <p>To visualise surrounding VE cells during AVE migration, we used time-lapse microscopy and DIC optics to monitor apical cell borders of the surface VE. We captured images from five focal planes at each time-point so cell outlines could be visualised unambiguously, and with a 15 min interval to achieve sufficient temporal resolution to follow individual cells from one time-point to the next. We used <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> transgenic embryos, so that AVE migration could be monitored. Four embryos remained in the field of view and in focus from the start of AVE migration to the finish and were used to quantify VE cell movement characteristics. Due to the strong curvature of the surface of the egg-cylinder, cell outlines in the “peripheral” regions of the VE could not be easily discerned and therefore cells in this region were not included in analyses.</p>
        <p>Cells of the VE overlying the epiblast (referred to hereafter as Epi-VE) showed dramatically different behaviour as compared to cells of the VE overlying the ExE (referred to hereafter as ExE-VE).</p>
        <p>We observed extensive neighbour exchange as a result of cell intercalation among the <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> negative cells of the Epi-VE just “ahead” of the migrating AVE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s007">Movie S3</xref>).

            <p>(A) Specific frames from a time-lapse sequence of surface VE during migration of AVE cells (green). Images were captured at 5 focal planes every 15 min. Representative cells are outlined in different colours so they can be easily followed. Dotted lines indicate the border between the Epi-VE and ExE-VE. AVE migration is accompanied by a great deal of cell intercalation among Epi-VE cells, resulting in neighbour exchange. In contrast, cells of the ExE-VE are relatively static. (B) Average number of neighbour exchange events in the Epi-VE versus ExE-VE (<italic>n</italic> = 46 and 44 cells, respectively, from 4 embryos). Exchange events were normalised for the number of cells tracked and expressed as the number of exchange events per cell per time interval (15 min for the time-lapse data). There were on average 0.15 exchange events per cell (i.e., one exchange event involving two cells, among every ∼7 cells) in the Epi-VE in every 15 min period. (C, C') First and last frames of a time-lapse sequence showing the tracks of representative cells in the Epi-VE. <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> expressing AVE cells are marked green and non-Hex-GFP Epi-VE cells are magenta. (D) Another embryo, illustrating dramatic changes in cell shapes in the Epi-VE during AVE migration. Non-Hex-GFP positive cells of the Epi-VE (outlined) are unable to move onto the ExE-VE. (E) Comparison of the average distance moved by cells in one time interval (15 min) in the Epi-VE versus ExE-VE (<italic>n</italic> = 46 and 44 cells, respectively, from four embryos), with an illustrative example of tracks of cells in the two regions. (F) Comparison of average shape factor of cells in the Epi-VE versus ExE-VE (<italic>n</italic> = 46 and 44 cells, respectively, from four embryos), with illustrative example of cells shapes in the two regions. Shape factor can range form 0 to 1, higher values being closer to circles or regular shapes than lower values. * indicates <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 and ** indicates <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001 (student's <italic>t</italic> test).

        <p>Cell tracking showed that <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> negative Epi-VE cells ahead of the AVE moved in a directional manner similar to AVE cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g002">Figure 2C and C'</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s008">Movie S4</xref>). Rather than simply moving aside to make way for migrating AVE cells, these cells remain ahead of AVE cells by moving proximally, until they reached the border with the ExE-VE. Once there, they become severely distorted in shape and start to move laterally, being unable to move onto the ExE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g002">Figure 2D and C'</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s009">Movie S5</xref>). This is similar to the behaviour AVE cells show upon reaching the ExE, where the leading AVE cells change shape and start to move laterally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Srinivas2">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Compared with Epi-VE cells, ExE-VE cells showed significantly less average movement (<italic>n</italic> = 46 and 44 cells for the Epi-VE and ExE-VE, respectively, from 4 embryos; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, Student's <italic>t</italic> test; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Cells of the Epi-VE were irregular in shape and appeared very labile, changing shape continuously. In comparison, cells of the ExE-VE were more regular in outline and did not change shape, remaining relatively static. To quantify this difference we determined the “shape factor” of cells, which is a measure of how close to being a perfect circle a shape is. Values can range from 0 to 1, with higher values indicative of a more circular or regular shape. Consistent with ExE-VE cells being more regular in outline, the average shape factor of ExE-VE cells was significantly higher than that of Epi-VE cells (<italic>n</italic> = 46 and 44 cells for the Epi-VE and ExE-VE, respectively, from 4 embryos; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, Student's <italic>t</italic> test, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g002">Figure 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s007">Movies S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s008">S4</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s009">S5</xref>).</p>

During AVE migration, however, a difference in F-actin levels and localisation in the Epi-VE and ExE-VE became evident. F-actin was present in cortical rings in both regions but, in addition, was greatly enriched in the apical cell cortex specifically in the ExE-VE, forming a shroud across this region in opacity renderings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g003">Figure 3B, B'</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s010">Movie S6</xref>). This actin shroud was found to be in place well before AVE cells reached the end-point of migration. In contrast, in the behaviourally labile cells of the Epi-VE, F-actin was lower in general, remained depleted in the apical cortex, and was specifically restricted to the lateral cell cortex. This broad difference in F-actin localisation was also observed in 6.25 dpc and 7.5 dpc embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s001">Figure S1A and D</xref>).

F-actin was detected in both the Epiblast and ExE.

To determine if PCP signalling might be involved in AVE migration, we assayed the sub-cellular localisation of Dvl2 by immunostaining <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> embryos at different stages of AVE migration with an antibody against Dvl2.</p>
        <p>Opacity rendered volumes showed that in early 5.5 dpc embryos (in which the AVE was still at the distal tip, prior to migration), Dvl2 was detected in the lateral cell membrane in both the Epi-VE and ExE-VE, though it was present at slightly lower levels in the ExE-VE, particularly in the region adjacent to the Epi-VE (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g004">Figure 4A, A'</xref>). In embryos in which the AVE is in the process of migrating (as shown by Hex-GFP positive AVE cells), Dvl2 was differentially localised in the two regions of the VE. In the Epi-VE, Dvl2 remained enriched in lateral cell membranes. In the ExE-VE, however, Dvl2 was greatly reduced in the lateral membrane. In some ExE-VE cells, particularly those close to the border with the Epi-VE, Dvl2 was reduced throughout the cell, in both the membrane and cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g004">Figure 4B, B'</xref>). This difference in localisation increased progressively during AVE migration such that in embryos in which the AVE had reached the proximal extent of migration, in the Epi-VE Dvl2 remained elevated in the cell membrane, while in the ExE-VE it was excluded from the cell membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g004">Figure 4C–D'</xref>) or downregulated throughout the cell (unpublished data). By 6.25 dpc, Dvl2 was almost completely absent from the ExE-VE, though it remained membrane enriched in the Epi-VE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). This region specific difference in Dvl2 localisation was also observed in 7.5 dpc embryos (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). We did not detect any difference in localisation of Dvl2 between AVE and surrounding Epi-VE cells.</p>

        <p>Consistent with a role for Dvl2 in F-actin remodelling, we found that the levels and localisation differences of the two are complementary. In those regions where Dvl2 was downregulated or excluded from the plasma membrane (ExE-VE), F-actin was upregulated and more apically localised. Conversely, where Dvl2 was enriched in the lateral plasma membrane (Epi-VE), F-actin was localised to cortical rings (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g004">Figure 4E–F„</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s001">Figure S1C and F</xref>).</p>

        <p>We therefore engineered a near-identical construct, but using the mouse Celsr1 sequence (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s002">Figure S2A</xref>).

The normal membrane enrichment of Dvl2 was repressed in cells of the Epi-VE, with it instead being found in an abnormally diffuse pattern throughout the VE.

        <p>These results suggest that Nodal activity is required for normal Dvl2 localisation. To further test this, we cultured 5.5 dpc embryos overnight in SB431542, a specific inhibitor of Nodal signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Mesnard1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Inman1">[41]</xref>. Control cultured embryos showed normal membrane enrichment of Dvl2 in the Epi-VE (<italic>n</italic> = 6). However, embryos cultured in the presence of inhibitor failed to enrich Dvl2 to the membrane (<italic>n</italic> = 7) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g006">Figure 6E, F</xref>).</p>
        <p>It has previously been shown that if the ExE and overlying VE are microsurgically removed from a 5.5 dpc embryo and the resulting embryonic explant cultured overnight, <italic>Nodal</italic> expression is lost in the epiblast and AVE cells fail to show migratory activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Rodriguez1">[6]</xref>. We looked at Dvl2 localisation in such explants (<italic>n</italic> = 6) and found that Dvl2 failed to become membrane enriched (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g006">Figure 6G, G'</xref>).</p>
        <p>Lefty1 is a secreted inhibitor of Nodal. In the absence of Lefty1, one would expect there to be increased Nodal signalling and increased or ectopic membrane enrichment of Dvl2. To test this hypothesis, we looked at Dvl2 in mutants for <italic>Lefty1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Meno1">[11]</xref>. Embryos were dissected at 6.25 dpc, stained for Dvl2, scanned, and opacity rendered. All the <italic>Lefty1</italic> homozygous null embryos examined (<italic>n</italic> = 4) had an abnormal persistence and enrichment of Dvl2 in the lateral cell membrane in the ExE-VE (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g006">Figure 6A and D</xref>). This defect was also seen in a few heterozygous mutants (2 out of 8). Dvl2 was expressed as normal in the epiblast of mutants but, in addition, was abnormally expressed in the ExE as well (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). <italic>Lefty1</italic> mutants also showed an attenuation of the apical F-actin shroud (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g006">Figure 6A'</xref> and D').</p>
        <p>The earliest phenotype reported for <italic>Lefty1</italic> null mutants is at 8.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Meno1">[11]</xref>. To determine if the altered Dvl2 localisation in <italic>Lefty1</italic> null mutants might lead to an undetected AVE migration phenotype, we examined 6.25 dpc <italic>Lefty1</italic> null embryos carrying the <italic>Hex-GFP</italic> transgene and stained for Par-3 a marker of epithelial polarity that shows cell outlines. Of the seven such embryos examined, five had an AVE migration defect (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02, chi-square test, compared to four wild-type littermates). One of the five showed an arrest in AVE migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g006">Figure 6I, I'</xref>), while the remaining four showed an over-migration phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g006">Figure 6H, H„</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001019.s015">Movie S11</xref>). All showed the normal localisation pattern of Par-3. Among 13 heterozygotes examined, five had mild AVE migration defects (one showed a slight delay and four had slightly over-migrated). Among the total of eight embryos with an “over-migration” phenotype, six had been stained for F-actin. Four of these six showed a loss or attenuation of the F-actin shroud.</p>

        <title>Regional Differences in Cell Behaviour in the VE</title>
        <p>The AVE and surrounding VE retain epithelial integrity during AVE migration. By using DIC optics to follow non-AVE cells of the VE, we show that AVE cells are not unique in their migratory movement and that surrounding cells of the Epi-VE also show a great deal of movement. We observe considerable cell intercalation in the Epi-VE (including among AVE and non-AVE cells). Migeotte et al. have recently reported cell intercalation among AVE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Migeotte1">[28]</xref>. Together, these suggest that AVE cells move through an intact VE epithelium by cell intercalation.</p>
        <p>AVE cells stop migrating proximally upon reaching the border between the Epi-VE and ExE-VE and appear to become “squashed” against the ExE-VE and displaced laterally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Srinivas2">[29]</xref>. Cell tracking shows that Epi-VE cells ahead of the AVE show directional movement very similar to AVE cells, first moving proximally up to the ExE-VE and then getting squashed and displaced laterally. This suggests the stereotypic movement of AVE cells is part of a broader process of movement among all the cells of the Epi-VE.</p>
        <p>AVE cells show protrusions predominantly in the direction in which they move <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Srinivas2">[29]</xref>. These cellular protrusions have recently been shown to extend from the basal aspect of AVE cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Migeotte1">[28]</xref>. It is possible that these protrusions sense a guidance cue like Dkk1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-KimuraYoshida1">[9]</xref>, which provides directional information to AVE cells, that then move through the intact VE epithelium by cell intercalation. Since non-Hex-GFP cells of the Epi-VE can only be tracked by DIC contrast of their apical surface (as opposed to Hex-GFP cells in which the entire cytoplasm is labelled), we cannot determine if they too show basal cellular projections. If the mode of movement of these cells is similar to that of AVE cells, one would predict that they also show directional cellular projections.</p>
        <p>In contrast to the Epi-VE, cells in the ExE-VE show a marked absence of intercalation and are relatively static in shape and position. There are therefore two behaviourally distinct regions in the VE, consistent with differences in marker gene expression in these two regions that indicate they are differently patterned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Mesnard1">[7]</xref>. Like AVE cells, other Epi-VE cells “ahead” of the migrating AVE are also unable to move into the ExE-VE. This suggests that the inability of AVE cells to migrate into the ExE-VE is not an autonomous property of AVE cells caused, for example, by a change in their character during the course of migration leading them to stop at the ExE-VE. Rather, it appears to be a feature of the cellular context within which they move and a result of the inability of Epi-VE cells to intercalate with cells of the ExE-VE. In this view, surrounding VE cells influence the migration of AVE cells, both by providing a “permissive” environment where migration can take place (by allowing cell intercalation and changes in cell shape as in the Epi-VE) as well as by creating a non-permissive environment to halt proximal migration (by being less able to participate in intercalation and change shape as in the ExE-VE).</p>

        <title>Regional Differences in Molecular Localisation in the VE</title>
        <p>Exploiting opacity rendering techniques has enabled us to detect regional differences in protein localisation in the VE that might otherwise have been missed. Differences in behaviour of cells in the VE are mirrored by differences in the localisation of the molecular motors F-actin and myosin IIA. It is possible that the different localisation of these molecules might cause the different behaviour of cells, with cortical actin rings in the Epi-VE facilitating the intercalation required for AVE migration and elevated actin levels localised to an apical shroud in the ExE-VE “locking” these cells in place with respect to each other and forming a barrier to AVE migration. Consistent with this, we see a diminution of the actin shroud in the majority of <italic>Lefty1</italic> mutants in which AVE cells “breach” the normal end-point to migration and move into the ExE-VE. Moreover, mutants for <italic>Nap1</italic>, a regulator of F-actin dynamics, show AVE migration defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Rakeman1">[27]</xref> and null mutants for myosin IIA have severe VE defects by 6.5 dpc and die by 7.5 dpc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Conti1">[42]</xref>. Furthermore, reduction of myosin IIA leads to a reduction in F-actin stress fibres and increased migration in cultured human foreskin fibroblast cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-EvenRam1">[43]</xref>. However, to establish a direct causal role for these two molecules in modulating cell intercalation behaviour in the VE, one would need to directly and specifically disrupt their localisation in embryos to determine if AVE migration is perturbed. It would also be interesting to characterise myosin IIA mutants at 5.5 dpc, to determine if AVE migration or Epi-VE cell intercalation is altered.</p>
        <p>Further highlighting differences between the Epi-VE and ExE-VE, we find that during AVE migration, Dvl2 is membrane localised specifically in the Epi-VE, suggestive of active PCP signalling in this region. The levels and localisation of Dvl2 shift in the ExE-VE through a continuum, from being membrane enriched prior to AVE migration to being progressively downregulated in both the plasma membrane and cytoplasm as the AVE migrates until it is almost completely absent in the ExE-VE of 6.25 dpc embryos. In contrast, Dvl2 remains unchanged in the Epi-VE, being membrane enriched at all stages. This view of Dvl2 localisation dynamics is built on data from a series of fixed stages. To probe in more detail how Dvl2 localisation changes and AVE migration relate to one another, it will be interesting to perform time-lapse microscopy of embryos expressing a fluorescent Dvl2 fusion protein.</p>
        <p>Expression of a membrane tethered C-terminal fragment of the mouse Celsr-1 protein disrupts the membrane localisation of Dvl2 and Vangl2 in the Epi-VE, indicative of perturbed PCP signalling. Due to the widespread expression of the <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> transgene, the PCP disruption in the VE could be caused indirectly by effects in the epiblast or ExE. Such embryos show a range of AVE migration defects, consistent with a role for PCP signalling in AVE migration. The defect in Dvl2 and F-actin localisation in such embryos is subject to the dose of <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> (all homozygotes are affected, while only half the heterozygotes are affected) consistent with it being a specific effect of the <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> modification. The abnormal cytoplasmic aggregates of actin in these embryos are possibly the result of actin normally destined for the apical cortical domain instead accumulating in the cytoplasm. These embryos produce viable offspring despite defects in AVE migration, indicating that the embryo is able to accommodate a surprising amount of imprecision in AVE position during anterior pattering.</p>
        <p>The phenotype of the <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> line is mild, even though this construct recapitulates the convergent extension defects caused by the zebrafish version when injected into zebrafish embryos. This difference in outcome in zebrafish and mouse could be due to a combination of reasons: the Lyn-Celsr1 construct is a mild dominant negative and injecting it in zebrafish allows one to express it at higher levels than can be achieved from the <italic>ROSA26</italic> locus in mice, which is not expressed at particularly high levels; differences in how PCP signalling is set up in zebrafish and mouse might make the former more susceptible to disruption. In support of the latter possibility is the reported functional redundancy in PCP signalling at later stages of mouse embryogenesis for the key PCP molecules Dvl-1, Dvl2, and Dvl-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Etheridge1">[44]</xref>. Since AVE migration is vital for the further development of the embryo, it would not be surprising if there is redundancy to the mechanisms regulating it.</p>
        <p>Mutants of PCP pathway genes generally have phenotypes at relatively late stages in development, for example in the organ of Corti, neural tube, or developing heart. To date, no pre-gastrulation defects have been reported in such mutants, contrary to what one might expect if PCP signalling was involved in AVE migration. However, given that <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> and <italic>Lefty1</italic> embryos do not show any obvious patterning defects at 5.5 dpc despite mislocalisation of Dvl2 and perturbed AVE migration, it is possible that a similarly subtle non-lethal early phenotype has been missed in these PCP mutants. For example, Dvl1−/−, Dvl2−/−, and Dvl3−/− triple mutants have impaired gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Hashimoto1">[45]</xref>, consistent with a possible AVE defect.</p>

        <title>Nodal Signalling Is Required for Membrane Localisation of Dvl2</title>
        <p>Consistent with experiments in the Xenopus animal cap that show that Activin can lead to membrane localisation of Dishevelled, membrane enrichment of Dvl2 is lost in the VE of <italic>Nodal</italic> mutants. This result is unlikely to be simply due to a general breakdown of epithelial organisation of the VE because the VE of <italic>Nodal</italic> null mutants continues to express E-cadherin as normal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Mesnard1">[7]</xref>, indicating it retains epithelial characteristics. Furthermore, similar results were observed in embryos cultured in the Nodal inhibitor SB431542 and in explants where the ExE had been removed, which downregulate <italic>Nodal</italic> in the epiblast. In both N<italic>odal</italic> mutants and SB431542 treated embryos, the entire VE appears uniform with respect to Dvl2 localisation, consistent with a role for Nodal in setting up regional identity in the VE suggested by Mesnard et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Mesnard1">[7]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As one might predict, if <italic>Nodal</italic> had a specific effect on the membrane localisation of Dvl2, we see ectopic membrane localisation of Dvl2 in mutants of the <italic>Nodal</italic> inhibitor <italic>Lefty1.</italic> Moreover, <italic>Lefty1</italic> mutants show otherwise normal VE epithelial morphology, including normal expression of Par-3, a marker of epithelial polarity, suggesting that the VE is not broadly disrupted and consistent with the effect of Nodal and Lefty1 on Dvl2 localisation being a specific one. In both mutants, we see effects in the ExE-VE, though <italic>Nodal</italic> is expressed in the epiblast, and <italic>Lefty1</italic> is expressed in the AVE. Both are secreted molecules and might diffuse and act directly on the ExE-VE (in addition to on the Epi-VE). While our results point to a specific interaction between the Nodal and PCP signalling pathways, it remains unclear whether this interaction is direct (as in Nodal and PCP signalling pathways having components that interact, leading to cross-talk) or indirect (as in requiring the activation/repression of a Nodal target gene that then affects PCP signalling).</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we suggest a model where there are two behaviourally distinct regions in the VE, one with exuberant cell movements in which AVE cells migrate by cell intercalation and a static region in which migration is not possible. These two regions are characterised by differences in localisation of Dvl2, F-actin, and myosin IIA, regulated by interplay between Nodal and PCP signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001019-g007">Figure 7</xref>). The interface between these two regions of different behaviour creates an effective barrier to AVE migration that can be disrupted by perturbing Dvl2 localisation. The dynamic pattern of Dvl2 localisation is directly or indirectly dependent on Nodal signalling, providing a mechanism whereby this key patterning molecule might also modulate cell behaviour in epithelia.</p>

These cells are labile (depicted by the black double-headed arrows within the cell boundary), which facilitates AVE migration by cell intercalation. In contrast, in the ExE-VE, Dvl2 is excluded from the membrane and F-actin is localised to an apical shroud. These cells are static in shape and do not intercalate, creating a barrier to migration. Nodal signalling directly or indirectly influences the membrane localisation of Dvl2.</p>

        <title>Confocal Microscopy and Volume Rendering</title>
        <p>Fixed samples were imaged on Zeiss LSM 510META and Zeiss LSM 710 confocal microscopes using 20X/0.75NA or 40X/1.2NA lenses as appropriate. DAPI was excited at 405 nm, EGFP at 488 nm, Alexa Fluor 555 at 543 nm, Alexa Fluor at 633 nm, and Atto647N-Phalloidin at 633 nm. Z-stacks of entire embryos were acquired at a 0.8 um interval using non-saturating scan parameters. Z-stacks of embryos were opacity rendered as 3D volumes using Volocity Software (Improvision, UK). Extended focus projections were maximum intensity projections. Figures were prepared with Adobe CS2 Photoshop and Illustrator (Adobe Inc).</p>

        <title>Generation of ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup> Mice</title>
        <p>The targeting construct was made by inserting a <italic>Lyn-Celsr1-EGFP</italic> fusion gene into pBigT and pROSA26PA (details of molecular cloning available on request) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Srinivas3">[46]</xref>. This construct was used to modify the ROSA26 locus of ES cells by homologous recombination. The construct contained a LoxP flanked transcriptional stop cassette, such that expression of <italic>Lyn-Celsr1-EGFP</italic> was conditional on Cre expression. ES cells were subject to positive selection for neomycin resistance and negative selection against DTA. ES cells were screened using the Southern Blot and positive clones used to produce germline chimeras by blastocyst injection. Mice inheriting the transgene through the germline were crossed to a βactin-Cre line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001019-Lewandoski1">[47]</xref> to excise the floxed transcriptional stop cassette in all tissues. Such mice were bred to segregate out the β-actin transgene and establish the <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> line that expresses <italic>Lyn-Celsr1-EGFP</italic> ubiquitously and constitutively.</p>

        <p>Antibody stained confocal imaged embryos were recovered from slides, washed in syringe filtered PBT thrice for 5 min, washed in lysis buffer (50 mM Tris HCl pH 8–8.5, 1 mM EDTA, 0.5% Tween-20) for 5 min, transferred into PCR strips containing lysis buffer (16 µl for 5.5 dpc embryos) and Proteinase K (1 µl 20 mg/ml PK per 25 µl of embryo lysis buffer), lysed at 55°C for 1 h, and the ProteinaseK inactivated by incubating at 95°C for 10 min. PCR genotyping was performed using 3 µl of lysed embryo as template, the appropriate primers, and Illustra puReTaq Ready-To-Go PCR Beads (GE Healthcare Catalogue No. 27-9557-01 (0.2 ml tubes/plate 96)).</p>

          <p>Generation of the <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> mouse line. (A) Diagram illustrating the structure of the Celsr1 protein, and that a C-terminal truncated version of the protein disrupts PCP signalling. (B) The fusion gene contains a myristoylation signal from the Lyn kinase (to target the protein to the inner leaflet of the plasma membrane), the C-terminal domain of mouse Celsr-1 (to disrupt PCP signalling), and EGFP to monitor localisation of the fusion protein. Expression of the truncated mouse Celsr1 in zebrafish embryos results in a convergent extension defect, indicative of impaired PCP signalling. The phenotype was classed as mild or severe according to the extent of the defects observed. RNA in situ hybridisation on tail-bud stage embryos marking the anterior edge of the neural plate (distal-less3), the prechordal plate (cathepsin-L), and the notochord (no tail). A schematic of the tailbud stage embryo, on the left, shows the location of these structures; Pre, Prechordal plate; NP, Neural Plate; Ntc, Notochord. Anterior is to the top and posterior is to the bottom. Marker analysis revealed that, compared to control uninjected embryos, those injected with Lyn-Celsr1-GFP have a wider neural plate, a posteriorised prechordal plate, and a wider notochord. Embryos expressing a control membrane tethered GFP did not demonstrate any developmental abnormalities. (C) Schematic outlining the strategy used to target the ROSA26 locus. (D) Southern blot analysis of genomic DNA from a correctly targeted clone digested with Eco RV, StuI, and BamHI, probed with a 5′ external probe. All three digests produced correct bands for the wild-type allele (upper bands) and targeted allele (lower bands). (E) Expression of <italic>ROSA26<sup>Lyn-Celsr1</sup></italic> in a 5.5 dpc embryo.
