        <p>In January 2010 two groups independently published the observation that the depletion of CD8+ cells in SIV-infected macaques had no detectable impact on the lifespan of productively infected cells. This unexpected observation led the authors to suggest that CD8+ T cells control SIV viraemia via non-lytic mechanisms. However, a number of alternative plausible explanations, compatible with a lytic model of CD8+ T cell control, were proposed. This left the field with no consensus on how to interpret these experiments and no clear indication whether CD8+ T cells operated primarily via a lytic or a non-lytic mechanism. The aim of this work was to investigate why CD8+ T cells do not appear to reduce the lifespan of SIV-infected cells in vivo.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Several studies have shown a role for CD8+ T cells in controlling SIV-infection. However, early last year two groups independently showed that depletion of CD8+ lymphocytes did not result in a measurable increase in the lifespan of productively infected cells, suggesting that direct cell killing may not be the major mechanism of antiviral activity by CD8+ lymphocytes. We investigated whether the lack of an effect on lifespan of infected cells indeed excludes a lytic role for CD8+ cells and whether a non-lytic effect of CD8+ cells, for instance by preventing new infections or blocking production of free virions, better explains the similar death rates of SIV-infected cells in animals with and without CD8+ lymphocytes. We found that, even though lytic models of CD8+ cell function are compatible with the absence of an effect of CD8+ cells on the lifespan of productively infected cells, the most likely mechanism of CD8-control in SIV-infection is via a non-lytic mechanism.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>One of the most direct and convincing demonstrations of the importance of CD8+ T cells in controlling SIV infection in vivo is the observation that, on depleting CD8+ cells, SIV-1 viral load increases by 0.5–1 log. This observation has been made in both acute and chronic infection and has been replicated by a number of groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Jin1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Schmitz1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In 2010 two ground-breaking papers by Klatt et al and Wong et al, reported that following CD8+ cell depletion, although there was a robust increase in viral load, there was no increase in the lifespan of cells productively infected with SIV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klatt1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Wong1">[5]</xref>. That is, when the lifespan of productively infected cells was measured there was no detectable difference between control macaques with an intact CD8+ T cell response and CD8+-depleted macaques. This highly unexpected result forced a re-evaluation of the role of CD8+ T cells in SIV infection and the authors concluded that CD8+ T cells controlled viral load (since CD8+ cell depletion lead to an increase in viral load) but that control was primarily via non-lytic mechanisms (since CD8+ depletion did not increase the lifespan of infected cells).</p>
      <p>However, it has been argued that the data are not incompatible with a lytic mechanism of CD8+ T cell control. It has been hypothesised that (i) ART-treatment may impair CD8+ T cell killing (ii) CD8+ T cell killing may occur just before the cell would die anyway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klenerman1">[6]</xref> (iii) CD8+ T cell killing may occur prior to viral production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klatt1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Althaus1">[7]</xref> or (iv) the measurements of lifespan may not be sufficiently accurate to detect a difference between depleted and control animals.</p>
      <p>The aim of this project was to firstly investigate whether the lack of an effect of CD8-depletion on lifespan is compatible with CD8+ T cell control of SIV viraemia via a lytic mechanism and then to establish whether the data best supports a lytic or non-lytic mechanism of CD8+ T cell control.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>The data of Klatt et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klatt1">[4]</xref> was analysed. Briefly, 10 SIV<sub>mac239</sub>-infected rhesus macaques were divided into two groups of 5. One group (“control”) was treated with antiretroviral therapy (ART) alone, the other was first depleted of CD8+ lymphocytes by OKT8F mAb injection and then treated with ART (“depleted”). Depletion was performed in both early and late chronic infection (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). The death rate (1/lifespan) of short-lived productively infected cells was estimated from the rate of viral clearance following ART <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Wei1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Ho1">[9]</xref>. Estimated death rates and model fits are shown in the supplementary information (see Table S1 and Figure S1 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
      <p>The analysis was divided into two parts. First, we investigated whether the similar death rates of productively infected cells in control and depleted macaques rule out the possibility that CD8+ T cells act predominantly via lysis. Second, we investigated how well lytic and non-lytic mechanisms explain the longitudinal dynamics of viral load and CD4 T cell count.</p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>1. Do the data rule out a lytic mechanism of action?</title>
        <p>There are a number of explanations that potentially reconcile the lack of an effect of CD8-depletion on infected cell lifespan with a major cytolytic role for CD8+ T cells. We investigated each of these possibilities in turn.</p>
        <sec id="s2a1">
          <title>(i) Impairment of CTL function by ART</title>
          <p>It has been observed that protease inhibitors impair CD8+ T cell function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Andre1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Chavan1">[11]</xref>. Whilst this phenomenon has not been reported for the reverse transcriptase inhibitors used in this study we decided to assess the impact of ART on CD8+ T cell function as this could explain the absence of an effect of CD8+ cell depletion on infected cell lifespan. The frequency of functional SIV-specific CD8+ cells was quantified by staining for IFNγ, TNFα, Il-2 and CD107 following ex vivo stimulation by SIV peptides. The frequency of IL-2+ and CD107+ cells was reduced following ART (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002200-g001">Figure 1</xref>) consistent with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Trabattoni1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, one explanation for the similar lifespan of infected cells in depleted and control animals is that ART impaired CD8+ T cell lytic function rendering control animals similar to CD8-depleted animals. To test this hypothesis we included the frequency of lytic CD8+ cells (quantified by CD107 expression) in the model and calculated the death rate of infected cells corrected for reduced CD8+ T cell function i.e. we estimated what the death rate of short-lived infected cells would have been in control animals if CD8+ T cell function was not impaired. Although this correction did increase the death rate of infected cells in control animals and thus increased the difference between control and depleted animals we only found a significant difference between the groups when we assumed all infected cell death was due to CTL killing (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002200-g001">Figure 1</xref>). The current estimate of the fraction of total death rate attributable to CTL-killing is 20–30% (section iv and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Asquith1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Asquith2">[14]</xref>). We conclude that the negative effect of ART on CD8+ T cell function is unlikely to explain similar infected cell death rates in control and depleted macaques.</p>

          <title>(ii) CD8+ T cell killing may occur just before the cell would die anyway or (iii) prior to viral production</title>
          <p>Two groups have suggested that CD8+ T cells may control viral load via lytic mechanisms but have little impact on infected cell lifespan due to the infected cell lifecycle. Klenerman et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klenerman1">[6]</xref> suggested that if viral production increased with the duration of cell infection and the virus is highly cytopathic then CD8+ T cells may have little impact on the lifespan of the infected cell (as they kill infected cells shortly before they would die anyhow) but may have a large impact on viral load (as reducing the infected cell lifespan even by only a small amount prevents a large proportion of viral production). Althaus et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Althaus1">[7]</xref> proposed the opposite model: that CD8+ T cells kill infected cells prior to viral production. They suggested that, prior to de novo production of viral proteins, infected cells are a target for CD8+ T cells recognising viral proteins in the infecting particles but that later in the viral life cycle, when the cell is productively infected, they evade CD8+ T cell surveillance due to Nef-induced down-regulation of MHC class I A and B molecules. CD8+ T cells thus kill infected cells but do not shorten the lifespan of productively infected cells which is what is quantified during ART treatment. Both these possibilities are qualitatively consistent with the observations of Klatt et al, i.e. they could in principle reconcile a model in which CD8+ T cell exert their anti-viral control by a lytic mechanism with the lack of an impact of depletion on the lifespan of productively infected cells (see Figure S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Althaus1">[7]</xref>). However, it was clear that the reconciliation could only be achieved for a minority of parameter values. In part 2 we investigate whether these parameter values are consistent with SIV dynamics.</p>

          <title>(iv) The measurements of infected cell lifespan are not accurate enough</title>
          <p>One of the simplest explanations for the similarity in infected cell lifespan between control and CD8-depleted animals is that CD8+ T cells control viraemia by a purely lytic mechanism but the estimates of lifespan are not accurate enough to detect the increase in lifespan following depletion. There are three steps to testing this explanation:</p>
          <list list-type="order">
            <list-item>
              <p>estimate the increase in lifespan that would be expected following depletion if CD8+ T cells controlled viraemia by lysis.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>estimate the errors on the measurements of lifespan of productively infected cells.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>test if the experimental design is sufficient to observe the expected difference in lifespan between depleted and control animals.</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>If CD8+ T cells control viraemia by a purely lytic mechanism and target cell numbers are constant, then the rate of increase of viral load following CD8+ cell depletion is equal to the rate of lysis of productively infected cells by CD8+ T cells. We estimate that, in these 10 macaques, the geometric mean of the rate of increase in viral load is 0.25d<sup>−1</sup> (see Table S2 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref>). So the rate of lysis of productively infected cells by CD8+ T cells is approximately 0.25d<sup>−1</sup>; this is similar to previous estimates of the rate of CD8+ T cell killing made using two independent approaches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Asquith1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Asquith2">[14]</xref>. Relaxing the assumption of constant target cells has little impact on the estimate of the rate of CTL killing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref>). Since it was necessary to start ART soon after CD8+ depletion there are only 3 viral load measurements from which we can estimate the rate of increase of viral load following CD8+ depletion. This makes estimating the rate of increase in viral load problematic. We explored possible sources of error in our estimates but found little evidence for significant inaccuracy (see Figure S3 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref>). Our estimates are similar to those reported by Wong et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Jin1">[1]</xref> (geometric mean 0.39 d<sup>−1</sup>) but lower than the rates implied by Jin et al (geometric mean 0.8d<sup>−1</sup>). Differences could be due to differences in the viral strain and/or depletion protocol and timing. So, even if all of the increase in viraemia following depletion is attributable to loss of CD8+ T cell control and all of this control is exerted via lytic mechanisms, the predicted decrease in death rate following CD8-depletion is relatively small: about 0.3 per day, and may not be readily detectable.</p>
          <p>Next, it is necessary to assess how accurately the lifespan (i.e. 1/death rate) of productively infected cells can be measured. We evaluated 4 widely used methods of estimating the errors on the measurements of infected cell lifespan (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). We found that the optimal method was bootstrapping the cases followed by trimming of extremes; the method employed in the original manuscript of Klatt et al (bootstrapping the residuals) tended to underestimate the error that is, it gave optimistically tight confidence intervals (see Figure S4 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>

It can be seen that the errors are large and consequently, although the difference in death rates between depleted and control animals is about zero, our confidence in this difference is poor. To quantify this confidence we estimated the distribution of the difference in death rates between depleted and control animals. This yielded a broad distribution both for early chronic and late chronic infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002200-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although the distributions were centred on zero (i.e. they supported the original conclusion that there was no difference in the death rates of infected cells in the presence and absence of CD8+ T cells) they were not incompatible with a substantial difference in death rates up to and including the death rate if all viral control is attributable to CTL lysis (0.3 per day). Removing two animals with particularly large error bars did not change this result. We conclude that the estimates of productively infected cell death are not sufficiently accurate to rule out the possibility that all control of viraemia is via lytic mechanisms.</p>

          <p>Even if the measurements of the death rates of productively infected cells in control and depleted animals are not accurate enough to detect a significant difference between the two groups intuitively we might expect to at least see a trend towards higher death rates in control animals. However, this was not the case (see Figure S5 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref>). This underlines the difficulty to observe differences between control and depleted animals.</p>
          <p>Wong et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Wong1">[5]</xref> also investigated whether their estimates of the death rate were sufficiently accurate to exclude a lytic role for CD8+ T cells and, using a different method, they concluded the opposite to us, i.e. that their experiments were sufficiently accurate. However, there was a minor numerical discrepancy in their calculation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002200.s001">Text S1</xref>), when we adjusted this we found that their conclusions were reversed and they could no longer exclude a lytic role for CD8+ T cells.</p>
          <p>To summarize, we show that the lack of an effect of depletion on the lifespan of infected cells is not sufficient to rule out a lytic mechanism. A number of different explanations including models that assume early CTL killing in the eclipse phase; models that assume late CTL killing just before the cell would die anyhow and simple lytic models that reflect the inaccuracy of death rate measurements and thus our inability to detect differences between control and depleted animals, are all capable of explaining the lack of an effect of depletion on lifespan of infected cells. In contrast, impairment of CD8+ T cell function by ART cannot explain the similar death rates in depleted and control animals. Next we investigated how well each of the models which work in principle predict viral load and CD4+ T cell dynamics in SIV infected macaques.</p>

The 4 non-lytic control models were: i) a model in which non-lytic factors reduced new infection events ii) an extension of model i to include two populations of productively infected cells iii) a model in which non-lytic factors reduce virion production iv) an extension of model iii to include two populations of productively infected cells.</p>

        <p>Although the quality of the fits is rather poor, our results show clear and consistent support for the non-lytic model in which CD8+ T cells reduce infection; none of the lytic models receive any support for most data sets. The best-fitting non-lytic model (non-lytic model ii, in which non-lytic factors reduced new infection events and there are two populations of productively infected cells) was compared with each of the lytic models in turn. In every case the non-lytic model provided a significantly better fit (lytic model i higher AICc 6/7 cases P = 0.043, mean difference in AICc = 15; lytic model ii higher AICc 6/7 cases P = 0.028, mean difference in AICc = 26; lytic model iii higher AICc 7/7 cases P = 0.018, mean difference in AICc = 40; lytic model iv higher AICc 7/7 cases P = 0.018, mean difference in AICc = 39. All P values 2 tailed paired Mann-Whitney). Furthermore the non-lytic model in which infection was reduced performed consistently better than the non-lytic model in which virion production was reduced though the differences in performance were not as large as for the comparison between lytic and non-lytic models (non-lytic model in which virion production was reduced (iv) had a higher AICc in 7/7 cases compared to the similar non-lytic model ii; P = 0.018, 2 tailed paired Mann-Whitney, mean difference in the AICc = 10).</p>
        <p>The reason why the lytic models fail can be seen from studying the equations. In the lytic models the rate of post-ART decline in viral load is determined by infected cell death due to viral toxicity and CD8+ T cell killing. Under the CD8 depletion regime post-ART decline in viral load is solely determined by infected cell death due to viral toxicity. Thus, to predict the similar post-ART decline under the two treatment-regimes lytic models need to attribute a small role to CD8+ cells. This small role of CD8+ T cells is poorly compatible with the increase in viral load following CD8 depletion in the absence of ART. Therefore, lytic models cannot accurately fit both post-ART decline and the increase in viral load upon depletion whereas non-lytic models can. Consequently models with a non-lytic component are likely to consistently outperform similar models with a lytic component.</p>
        <p>We conclude that although self-consistent hypotheses can be constructed in which CD8+ T cells exert their antiviral effects by lysis without a detectable impact on infected cell lifespan, these models are poorly predictive and a non-lytic model provides a better explanation of the viral load and CD4+ T cell dynamics.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>SIV-infection of rhesus macaques is one of the best and most widely used animal models of HIV-1 infection. Indeed, the observation that CD8+ cell depletion in rhesus macaques causes an increase in viral load is frequently cited as strong evidence that CD8+ T cells control infection in HIV-1-infected humans. The finding that CD8+ T cell depletion has no discernable impact on infected cell lifespan in SIV-infected macaques is reminiscent of earlier observations in HIV-1-infected humans in which there was no relationship between infected cell lifespan and disease stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klenerman1">[6]</xref>. That is, in individuals with a high CD4+ T cell count and, presumably, a relatively intact CD8+ T cell response the lifespan of infected cells was very similar to individuals with a CD4 count &lt;100. The similarity of these observations underscores the importance and generality of the work of Klatt et al and Wong et al.</p>
      <p>We investigated a number of hypotheses to try and reconcile a major lytic role for CD8+ T cells with the observation that depletion of CD8+ T cells had little impact on the lifespan of infected cells. We found evidence that ART impairs CD8+ T cell function and allowing for this impairment increased the difference in lifespan between control and depleted animals but the difference remained small. Following Klenerman et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klenerman1">[6]</xref> and Althaus et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Althaus1">[7]</xref> we also investigated models in which CD8+ T cell killing occurred just prior to when a cell would die anyhow or prior to viral production. These models were qualitatively consistent but only for relatively narrow parameter ranges and required further assumptions (namely that SIV is highly cytopathic or that infected cells are most vulnerable to CD8+ T cell killing prior to viral production, respectively). Unexpectedly, the simplest hypothesis: that the measurements of lifespan were not accurate enough to detect the difference between control and depleted animals did offer a plausible explanation.</p>
      <p>Depletion of CD8+ T cells results in a large increase in viral load so intuitively we expect that this implies that CD8+ T cells rapidly kill infected cells. If lysis is so rapid, it should clearly manifest as an increase in infected cell lifespan in the absence of CD8+ T cells. However, the large increase in viral load following depletion occurs over several days and, even if it is assumed to be due entirely to the removal of lytic CD8+ T cells, analysis shows that this only implies a rate of CD8+ T cell killing of 0.3 per day. That is, the rise in viraemia following CD8+ T cell depletion, indicates that CD8+ T cells are responsible for about 30% of productively infected cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Markowitz1">[20]</xref>. It is therefore not surprising that it is difficult to detect evidence for this relatively small contribution to cell death even in the extreme case of CD8-depleted macaques let alone in humans at different stages of infection.</p>
      <p>Next we investigated which mechanism provides the best explanation of SIV dynamics in acute and chronic infection. This analysis found strong support for non-lytic mechanisms of CD8+ T cell-mediated control of SIV infection, in particular via blocking of infection. The models we used were fully mechanistic, low parameter models which were constrained by CD8+ T cell data and were required to fit viral load and CD4+ T cell count data simultaneously over a wide dynamic range. Consequently the divergence between observation and prediction (particularly for CD4+ T cell counts) was rather large. Clearly, none of the models used represents the true model of SIV dynamics. However, the use of the AIC enables us to select the model which contains most information of the true model, i.e. is closest to reality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Burnham1">[21]</xref>. Furthermore, the improved performance of the non-lytic models compared to the lytic models can be understood intuitively and is likely to be a general feature of comparisons between lytic and non-lytic models.</p>
      <p>We conclude that on their own, the lifespan estimates of Klatt and Wong cannot exclude the possibility that CD8+ T cell exert their antiviral effects via cytolysis. However, in conjunction with the failure of lytic models to compete with non-lytic models in predicting the time course of infection, the evidence favours a picture in which CD8+ T cells control infection via the production of non-lytic factors that reduce infection.</p>

During ART treatment, infection rate β = 0, so the model reduces to:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002200.e007" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002200.e008" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002200.e009" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula>Where δ<sub>I</sub> and δ<sub>S</sub> are the death rates of the T<sup>*</sup> and M<sup>*</sup> population and p<sub>T</sub> and p<sub>M</sub> are production rates of free virions by the T<sup>*</sup> and M<sup>*</sup> population respectively (all in d<sup>−1</sup>). Fraction f is the proportion of infected cell death attributable to CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell killing; (1-f) is the proportion attributable to all other factors. Impaired CD8+ T cell function was represented by the fraction of CD107+ CD8+ T cells, E(t), relative to the pre-ART fraction of CD107+ CD8+ T cells, E0. E(t) was obtained by linear interpolation between data points. Resulting death rate estimates in control animals (i.e. corrected for CD8+ T cell impairment) were compared with death rates estimated in depleted animals using a Mann-Whitney test for different values of f.</p>

        <title>Alternative lytic models: assuming late virion production and late killing of infected cells</title>
        <p>It has been suggested <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002200-Klenerman1">[6]</xref> that infected cells initially produce few virions while the bulk of virions are produced just before the cells dies. This was represented by 2 populations of SIV-infected cells: population L* consists of recently infected cells that do not produce virions and die at a negligible rate; population A* represents productively infected cells.
