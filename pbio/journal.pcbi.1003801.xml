<abstract>
<p>Functional genomics screens using multi-parametric assays are powerful approaches for identifying genes involved in particular cellular processes. However, they suffer from problems like noise, and often provide little insight into molecular mechanisms. A bottleneck for addressing these issues is the lack of computational methods for the systematic integration of multi-parametric phenotypic datasets with molecular interactions. Here, we present Integrative Multi Profile Analysis of Cellular Traits (IMPACT). The main goal of IMPACT is to identify the most consistent phenotypic profile among interacting genes. This approach utilizes two types of external information: sets of related genes (IMPACT-sets) and network information (IMPACT-modules). Based on the notion that interacting genes are more likely to be involved in similar functions than non-interacting genes, this data is used as a prior to inform the filtering of phenotypic profiles that are similar among interacting genes. IMPACT-sets selects the most frequent profile among a set of related genes. IMPACT-modules identifies sub-networks containing genes with similar phenotype profiles. The statistical significance of these selections is subsequently quantified <italic>via</italic> permutations of the data. IMPACT (1) handles multiple profiles per gene, (2) rescues genes with weak phenotypes and (3) accounts for multiple biases e.g. caused by the network topology. Application to a genome-wide RNAi screen on endocytosis showed that IMPACT improved the recovery of known endocytosis-related genes, decreased off-target effects, and detected consistent phenotypes. Those findings were confirmed by rescreening 468 genes. Additionally we validated an unexpected influence of the IGF-receptor on EGF-endocytosis. IMPACT facilitates the selection of high-quality phenotypic profiles using different types of independent information, thereby supporting the molecular interpretation of functional screens.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Genome-scale functional genomics screens are important tools for investigating the function of genes. Technological progress allows for the simultaneous measurement of multiple parameters quantifying the response of cells to gene perturbations such as RNA interference. Such multi-dimensional screens provide rich data, but there is a lack of computational methods for interpreting these complex measurements. We have developed two computational methods that combine the data from multi-dimensional functional genomics screens with protein interaction information. These methods search for phenotype patterns that are consistent among interacting genes. Thereby, we could reduce the noise in the data and facilitate the mechanistic interpretation of the findings. The performance of the methods was demonstrated through application to a genome-wide screen studying endocytosis. Subsequent experimental validation demonstrated the improved detection of phenotypic profiles through the use of protein interaction data. Our analysis revealed unexpected roles of specific network modules and protein complexes with respect to endocytosis. Detailed follow-up experiments investigating the dynamics of endocytosis uncovered crosstalk between the cancer-related EGF and IGF pathways with so far unknown effects on endocytosis and cargo trafficking.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Genome-scale functional genetics screens using technologies such as RNA interference (RNAi) have recently started to generate high-dimensional datasets by measuring either the same parameter in different cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Shao1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Barbie1">[2]</xref> or different features in the same cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Snijder1">[5]</xref>.</p>
<p>Such high-dimensionality improves the phenotypic specificity but, at the same time, increases the complexity of the analysis: the knock-down of two genes may have a similar phenotype on one parameter but yield different results on another. This poses a substantial challenge for the mechanistic interpretation of such screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Piano1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Fuchs1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>Furthermore, it has been noticed that targeting the same gene with different siRNAs can lead to conflicting results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>. This ambiguity is caused by the additive influence of noise in the assay and off-target effects (OTEs). OTEs occur when the detected phenotype is due to interactions between the silencing molecules and genes other than the intended target <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Echeverri1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Echeverri2">[9]</xref>. Thus, OTEs complicate the functional interpretation of RNAi screens and may lead to spurious gene annotation. Even though OTEs can be reduced in small-scale studies (e.g. by gene rescue experiments), it is very difficult to completely avoid them in large-scale genomic screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Jackson1">[10]</xref>. Consequently, it is often impossible to unambiguously assign the assay readout to a target gene without considering additional information. Note that frequently even replicate measurements using the same siRNA can be inconsistent, which is not necessarily an indication of bad experimental skills, but rather a problem intrinsic to the complexity of genome-wide screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Birmingham1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Bushman1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that integrating independent information, such as protein interaction networks with RNAi screening data removes noise and improves the elucidation of molecular mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Fuchs1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Berndt1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Reiss1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Young1">[18]</xref>. These approaches exploit the fact that phenotypes that are observed consistently across a set of interacting genes are less likely to be noise. Hence, interaction data can be used to filter for genes that are more likely true positives. However, existing studies have not sufficiently addressed the problem of high-dimensional phenotypes nor the ambiguity of results from different siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Fuchs1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Reiss1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Tu1">[16]</xref>. The issue of multiple profiles per gene is relevant for studies performing replicate measurements with the same siRNAs, using different siRNAs per gene, as well as studies conducting functional assays on cells from multiple individuals/different cell lines.</p>
<p>Further, published studies often rely on first defining an arbitrary cut-off value for selecting ‘hit genes’ and subsequently interpreting their phenotypes using prior information <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Gunsalus1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Tu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Li1">[19]</xref>. Such approach is problematic because genes falling just below the threshold may be rejected even though their phenotype is consistent with interacting genes. Instead, it has been suggested to infer sets of relevant genes by first integrating the phenotype data with network information without any threshold and then simultaneously accounting for strength of the phenotype and its consistency in the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Gonzalez1">[20]</xref>. Two classes of such methods exist: methods of the first class assume one phenotype score per gene (e.g. the strength of the phenotype) and search for network regions enriched for high-scoring genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Tu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Wang1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Ideker1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Wang2">[22]</xref>. The second class works on multi-dimensional phenotypic profiles, and assesses the similarity of them between genes being close in the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Fuchs1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Ulitsky1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Fuchs2">[24]</xref>. In these cases, multiple measurements are available to describe the loss of function phenotype, such as the number of objects, their average size, the average intensity of a marker protein and so on. We could not find a method integrating <italic>multiple</italic> phenotype vectors per gene with interaction data.</p>
<p>Thus, there is a need for new computational methods allowing for the integration of multi-parametric phenotypic data with molecular interaction information.</p>
<p>Here, we present a computational framework called IMPACT (Integrative Multi Profile Analysis of Cellular Traits) that integrates high-dimensional, quantitative phenotypic profiles with independent data like protein interactions. We devised two algorithms operating on two different types of prior information: sets of related genes (IMPACT-sets) and network information (IMPACT-modules). This framework offers several advantages: first, it can handle multiple phenotypic profiles per gene; second it avoids <italic>a priori</italic> definition of ‘hit genes’ based on score thresholding; third, it allows to rescue genes that do not have a significant phenotype based on the RNAi data alone, but show a behavior consistent with their interacting partners. Further, it can cope with many potential biases, e.g. caused by the different frequency of phenotype patterns in the screen, by the structure of the network, or due to variable numbers of knock-down experiments per gene. We validated both methods using a multi-parametric genome-wide RNAi screen on endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref> leading to new insights into the underlying molecular pathways.</p>

<title>Overview of the computational methods</title>
<p>We designed a general framework that combines data from quantitative multi-parametric measurements with protein interaction information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We refer to the set of parameters measured after each knock-down experiment as ‘phenotypic profile’. Given several profiles from different si-/esi-RNAs targeting the same gene, our aim was to identify the most likely ‘authentic’ profile, i.e. selecting those profiles that are least affected by noise and OTEs. IMPACT exploits that profiles being similar across interacting genes/proteins are more likely true (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For this filtering process, we developed two methods using two types of gene-gene relationships: sets of genes and binary network information (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g001">Figure 1 b)</xref>.</p>

<title>Pipeline and schematic illustration of the integrative analysis.</title>
<p>(<bold>a</bold>) Overview of the analysis. (<bold>b</bold>) Schematic of the two integrative methods. They combine phenotypic information from RNAi screening data (heatmaps) with either known protein complexes (top) or binary interaction networks (bottom). Each gene (A through G) has been assayed with several different siRNAs, i.e., several profiles are obtained. The heatmap thus shows the different profiles per gene using a color code (deviation from average); each column represents a phenotype parameter (such as number or size of endosomes). In the case of sets (top) our method assesses all profiles associated with all genes in the set and identifies an over-represented profile. In the case of network data (bottom) the method searches for network modules (sub-networks) enriched for a common profile. In both cases the algorithm determines a ‘references’ profile representing the common profile of the set or network module. Note that in the network case we also consider anti-correlated profiles, as genes might have opposing effects on the readout. For the set-based analysis, significance is determined through appropriate randomizations that take into account the number of genes and profiles in each complex (<bold>c</bold>). For the network-based analysis, the significance of each module is estimated by a semi-analytical approach that takes into account the composition of the module at any expansion step and the probability of observing specific patterns in the dataset (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref> for details).</p>

<title>Gene set-based analysis (IMPACT-sets)</title>
<p>The first method utilizes pre-defined sets of genes with common properties (e.g. genes encoding components of a multi-protein complex or common pathway). The aim is to identify an enriched phenotype that is shared by a maximum number of genes/proteins in the set. We achieve this goal using an approach that is similar to common cluster analysis, but constrained on the members of a given set: the algorithm identifies the largest group (cluster) of profiles spanning a maximum number of genes in the set (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref> for details). The advantage compared to standard cluster analysis is that the use of prior information (set membership) forces the method to select common profiles for genes that are known to operate together. Once protein complexes with coherent phenotypic profiles are identified, they are scored with respect to how likely such consistency might occur by chance (p-values). Empirical p-values are computed by permuting the gene labels across complexes many (e.g. 5,000) times (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s016">Figure S16</xref>). Importantly, this permutation keeps together sets of profiles that were obtained for the same gene. For this set-based analysis, we used 1930 complexes with phenotype information from a database of more than 2000 experimentally verified mammalian protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Ruepp1">[25]</xref>.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a2">
<title>Network-based analysis (IMPACT-modules)</title>
<p>The second method combines the RNAi screening data with binary interaction data, such as physical protein binding data. In this case the aim is to screen the network for sub-networks (modules) enriched for a common phenotypic signature. The components of such network modules are assumed to be involved in the same or related pathways or biological processes. This approach is based on a greedy search for sub-networks consisting of genes with at least <italic>k</italic> profiles that are correlated with a given ‘seed profile’. This search iteratively expands a network module around a seed gene using similarity with the seed profile as a selection criterion. See <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref> for details on how to select the seed profiles. The probability (p-value) of obtaining the observed sub-network by chance is subsequently computed by taking into account (1) the number of genes in the sub-network, (2) the number of profiles (knock-downs) per gene, (3) the number of neighbours per gene in the expanding module, and (4) the frequency of the seed profile in the entire network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g001">Figure 1c</xref>). This algorithm computes the probability of finding the observed number of correlated neighbor genes at each expansion step by accounting for the exact neighborhood at that iteration (i.e. the number of interacting genes and the number of profiles per gene; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref> for details). This strategy accounts for the potential biases introduced by different numbers of profiles per gene. Further, we noticed that some phenotypic patterns are shared by more genes than others, which affects the probability of observing such profile in a random set of genes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref>). Hence, IMPACT also corrects for that potential bias. For the network-based analysis we combined binary protein-protein interaction data from three databases reporting experimentally verified interactions: HPRD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Mishra1">[26]</xref>, IntAct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Aranda1">[27]</xref>, and KEGG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Kanehisa1">[28]</xref>. The final network contained 9,642 genes and 49,827 non-redundant interactions.</p>
<p>Both approaches require the definition of thresholds (e.g. a similarity threshold for phenotypic profiles). However, it is not necessary to decide on a list of ‘hit genes’ <italic>before</italic> integration with the interaction data. Instead, the algorithms consider all genes and all of their profiles, provided the genes are part of the network (or sets, respectively). Our framework can also deal with multiple knock-down experiments per gene without having to combine (‘average’) the profiles before the integration with external data.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2a3">
<title>Selected profiles and reference profile</title>
<p>A major goal of IMPACT is to select those phenotypic profiles that are least affected by noise and OTEs by using external, independent information. These ‘selected profiles’ are subsequently used to define a representative profile called ‘reference profile’, computed as the median of all selected profiles belonging to a given module or set (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s001">Figure S1b</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref>). The reference is not used during the module/set search procedure: it is an output that provides summarized information of the phenotypic effect for each module or set identified.</p>
<p>In the case of networks, selected profiles include both positively and negatively correlated phenotypes within the same module. This approach accounts for the possibility of inhibitory (negative) interactions between members of the same pathway. However, in the case of protein complexes we require that all selected profiles have a positive correlation with each other. These decisions might have to be adapted when IMPACT is applied to other data. Because of the consensus among interacting partners, both, the selected profiles and the reference profiles are thought to better reflect the ‘true’ phenotype of the genes. We operationally define the ‘true phenotype’ of a gene as the phenotypic profile that would be obtained if the assay was perfect (i.e., no noise, identical knock-down efficiency across all genes, no OTEs, etc.). Of course, we do not know the ‘true’ phenotype of any single gene. However, below we provide multiple lines of evidence suggesting that the selected profiles are indeed closer to that ideal scenario than the discarded profiles.</p>
<p>An important assumption underlying our analysis is that physically interacting genes are more likely to show a similar (i.e. positively or negatively correlated) phenotype. Indeed, genes that are linked in our network have significantly more similar phenotypic profiles than random pairs of genes (p-value of 7×10<sup>−11</sup> and 2×10<sup>−7</sup> with the Kolmogorov-Smirnov test and Mann-Whitney U test, respectively).</p>

<title>Classification performance on known endocytosis-related genes</title>
<p>We applied our methods to an image-based, genome-wide RNAi screen assessing the role of genes in transferrin (TF) and epidermal growth factor (EGF) endocytosis in human HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g001">Figure 1a</xref> and Input Data in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref>). Forty quantitative parameters describing various aspects of cargo uptake and propagation along the endocytic pathway, such as endosome number, size and intracellular distribution, were extracted by image analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Rink1">[29]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s020">Table S1</xref>). On average about 7 si-/esi-RNA per gene were screened. Ideally, one would expect a high correlation between the phenotypic profiles of different siRNAs targeting the same gene. However, those profiles were often not significantly correlated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s001">Figures S1</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s002">S2</xref>). Such inconsistency is neither caused by technical or biological variation in the screen, nor by different silencing potency of the siRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>, but mainly due to siRNA-specific OTEs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Echeverri1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Kittler1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Kittler2">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>In order to systematically and quantitatively assess the performance of recovering genes involved in endocytosis, we compiled a set of known endocytosis-related genes as positive controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g001">Figure 1a</xref>). This selection is based on relevant Gene Ontology (GO) terms and exclusively using experimentally inferred gene annotations (in total 387 genes annotated for the terms reported in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s021">Table S2</xref>).

<p>We ranked the genes based on the p-values of the protein complexes or network modules they belong to, and tested whether known endocytosis related genes (i.e. genes from the positive set) rank higher than the negative set genes.

<title>Comparison of algorithm search parameters</title>
<p>Since our integrative approach requires the definition of a ‘similarity threshold’ <italic>T</italic> (based on the Pearson correlation coefficient <italic>R</italic>) for calling two profiles ‘similar’, we tested several values of <italic>T</italic> for the set-based (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s006">Figure S6</xref> a) and network-based analysis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s007">Figure S7</xref> c). We obtained the best performance for both the set- and network-based approaches using cutoff values of <italic>T</italic> = 0.7 (AUC-IMPACT-sets <italic>T = 0.7</italic>: 0.619; AUC-IMPACT-modules <italic>T = 0.7</italic>: 0.648). In case of the network-based analysis one has also to choose the minimum number (<italic>k</italic>) of profiles that have to be similar per gene to include a gene in the current network module. We obtained the best result with <italic>k = 3</italic> and <italic>k = 2</italic> (AUCs 0.648 and 0.553 respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s007">Figure S7</xref> a). All the following tests have been carried out with <italic>T</italic> = 0.7 and <italic>k</italic> = 3 for modules (AUC = 0.648) and <italic>T</italic> = 0.7 for sets (AUC = 0.619), unless explicitly stated otherwise. Since IMPACT-sets requires positive values of correlation above the threshold <italic>T</italic> for the searching, we tested the effect of allowing also negatively correlated profiles to be included, i.e. similarity is the absolute value of correlation as in IMPACT-modules (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref>). Allowing for anti-correlation in IMPACT-sets reduced the AUC from 0.619 to 0.567, suggesting that by-and-large phenotypic profiles of genes whose products participate in the same complex are positively correlated. Additionally, enforcing positive correlation in IMPACT-modules slightly decreased performances (AUCs from 0.648 to 0.627 for <italic>T</italic> = 0.7, <italic>k</italic> = 3 and from 0.553 to 0.539 for <italic>T</italic> = 0.7, <italic>k</italic> = 2; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s032">Table S13</xref>).</p>

<title>Effects of seed selection, network coverage, and parameter subsets on module search</title>
<p>We tested how seed selection affects final estimates of significance: relaxing the seed selection threshold <italic>T_s</italic> (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref>) from 0.8 to 0.5, i.e. allowing for the inclusion of less correlated phenotypic patterns as starting point for the search, reduced the algorithm's performance (AUC for <italic>T_s</italic> = 0.8: 0.648; AUC for <italic>T_s</italic> = 0.5: 0.571). Reshuffling the selected seed profiles to random positions within the network lowered the performance (for <italic>T</italic> = 0.7, <italic>k</italic> = 3: AUC = 0.59 and 65% less modules; for <italic>T</italic> = 0.7, <italic>k</italic> = 2: AUC = 0.507 and 50% less modules than the respective real cases), suggesting that seed profiles are indeed specific for their network context (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s032">Table S13</xref>).</p>
<p>We investigated the effect of network coverage and parameter subsetting on the classification outcome, to test respectively the effect of prior information or phenotypic readout on module identification. For evaluating network coverage sensitivity, we tested IMPACT-modules on modified networks obtained by random removal of 33% and 50% of the interactions. A sparser network leads to lower classification performances (AUC = 0.62±0.076 and 0.55±0.085, respectively; <italic>n</italic> = 7 random tests each), but the performance is still better than the random case with AUC = 0.5 (p-values of 0.05 and 0.28, respectively). Thus, even an incomplete network improves the detection of correct phenotypes.</p>
<p>Next, we evaluated the importance of using the complete 40-parameter profiles by comparing the results obtained when using only a sub-set of the parameters. Here, we grouped the parameters into 7 groups (G1 to G7) according to their biological similarity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s020">Table S1</xref>) and compared the results after systematic removal of each group of parameters. In general, we noticed that removal of parameters reduces the performance to different extent depending on the parameters removed (AUCs in the range [0.5034, 0.63] versus 0.648 of the full parameter set; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s026">Table S7</xref>). The fact that the performance is reduced in all 7 cases suggests that all parameters are informative.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b3">
<title>Effects of network permutation and phenotypic noise on module search</title>
<p>We also explored the effect of randomly permuting: 1) network topology (i.e. shuffling edges); 2) gene assignment (i.e. shuffling genes with all their profiles on the same network structure); 3) profile assignment (i.e. shuffling profiles across genes on the same network structure) and 4) network and profile assignment (i.e. shuffling profiles and edges). In all cases the performance went down, with AUCs of 0.529±0.070 (p = 0.34), 0.515±0.087 (p = 0.43), 0.510±0.081 (p = 0.45) and 0.433±0.067 (p = 0.78) versus 0.648 (p = 0.01) of the real case (values are averaged for 3 independent randomizations; method parameters always set to <italic>T = 0.7</italic> and <italic>k = 3</italic>).</p>
<p>We further investigated the role of overall noise in the screening data by adding various levels of noise to the phenotypic profiles. To do this, we added to each parameter of the original phenotypic data normally distributed values <italic>N(μ, σ)</italic> with mean <italic>μ = 0</italic> and standard deviation <italic>σ</italic> = 0.05, 0.1 and 0.2 (i.e., we perturbed each parameter with random noise of 5, 10 and 20% of the original z-normalized data variance). After repeating IMPACT-modules (<italic>T = 0.7</italic>, <italic>k = 3</italic>) on <italic>n = 4</italic> independent random cases, we obtained average AUCs of 0.542±0.073, 0.561±0.077 and 0.556±0.073, respectively, worse when compared to 0.648 of the real case, but still better than random (p-values of 0.28, 0.21 and 0.22). Also, the number of identified modules decreased progressively to 63%, 57% and 37% with increasing noise added, i.e. also the sensitivity is affected. The fact that the AUCs stay above the background level underlines the robustness of IMPACT-modules.</p>

<title>Comparison to screen analysis</title>
<p>Using external information for the profile selection clearly improved the recovery of known endocytosis genes compared to not using such information. This is shown by comparing our results (IMPACT-sets and IMPACT-modules) to a method based on the phenotypic strength as measured by the Chi-square test, which was used in the initial publication of the RNAi screen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Specifically, we used two versions of the Chi-square test: the first using the average profiles and the second the mode profiles, the latter being used in the previously published analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>. Our results show improved selection of endocytic genes (higher AUCs) for both, protein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g002">Figure 2a</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s028">Table S9</xref>) and network modules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g002">Figure 2b</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s027">Table S8</xref>). We also compared the true and false positive rates of our two methods with the values from the hit list of the original publication, where a combined approach assessing phenotypic strength (Chi-square on mode profile) and phenotypic specificity (Phenoscore on mean-shift clustering) was used to define scoring genes. Our results show better performances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>
<p>Further, we compared the counts of endocytosis genes (based on GO annotation) selected as significant by IMPACT (p-value&lt; = 0.1) to the count in the hit list based on the Chi-square of the mode profile. To perform a balanced comparison, we selected the 2,720 significant genes from IMPACT-sets and IMPACT-modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s024">Table S5</xref>) and the top 2,720 genes from the sorted Chi-square list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s010">Figure S10</xref>). The endocytic genes recovered specifically by IMPACT (79) are more than the ones missed (36, of which only 26 map on the interaction data), showing that our method has a better sensitivity/specificity trade-off, as also highlighted by the AUC analysis.</p>
<p>An important feature of IMPACT is that alternative phenotypic profiles per gene do not have to be collapsed to a single profile prior to the analysis. In order to investigate the relevance of this feature, we applied the IMPACT to single profiles per gene computed either (i) as the average, <italic>single-avg</italic>, or (ii) as the multi-parametric mode, <italic>single-mode</italic> (representing the most probable profile <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>). In both cases, all performance measures (ROC, PR and BACC curves) went down for the module-based approach (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s007">Figures S7b</xref>) and the AUCs decreased to 0.528 and 0.496 for <italic>single-mode</italic> and <italic>single-avg</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s023">Table S4</xref>, right). For the set-based approach, we observed AUCs of 0.636 and 0.571 for <italic>single-mode</italic> and <italic>single-avg</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s006">Figure S6b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s023">Table S4</xref>, left). Thus, using <italic>single-mode</italic> for IMPACT-sets slightly improved the AUC compared to the standard analysis (AUC = 0.619). However, the number of genes in significant complexes decreased to 16% (for <italic>single-mode</italic>) and 18% (for <italic>single-avg</italic>) of the total number of significant genes detected when considering all profiles prior to averaging. This underlines the importance of considering all available profiles separately for maximizing accuracy and sensitivity.</p>

<title>Comparison to other methods</title>
<p>We compared our network-based approach to two published network-based methods, JActiveModules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Ideker1">[21]</xref> and MATISSE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Ulitsky1">[23]</xref>. JActiveModules is a representative for the class of methods assuming one score per gene and then searching for sub-networks that are enriched for high-scoring genes. MATISSE represents methods operating on single multi-dimensional profiles per gene. None of the methods can cope with multiple profiles per gene. We used each gene's mode-profile as input for MATISSE and the p-value of the Chi-square statistic calculated on the mode profile as input for JActiveModules. Our network analysis performed better than both, JActiveModules and MATISSE (AUCs of 0.507 and 0.518; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g002">Figure 2b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s027">Table S8</xref>). We previously performed parameter tuning to choose the best performing parameters (<italic>T = 0.7</italic>, <italic>k = 3</italic>) by analyzing the classification of endocytosis GO terms. In order to ensure a fair comparison we also tested the method performances on an independent list, selected according to different criteria. We used the merged list of Rab5 effectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Christoforidis1">[34]</xref> and of proteins containing domains that are known to be related to endocytosis (PX, FYVE, BAR, TBD and VPS9, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>), comprising of 306 members, of which 213 are present in the interaction network (the overlap with the endocytosis GO annotation gene list was just 62 genes). IMPACT-modules (both for <italic>T</italic> = 0.7, <italic>k</italic> = 2 and <italic>T</italic> = 0.7, <italic>k</italic> = 3) out-performed the other approaches on this new list as well as on the union of the two, the GO terms list and the RAB5 effectors and proteins with endocytic domains list (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s029">Table S10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s015">Figure S15</xref>). Also IMPACT-sets performed better on this new list of positives (AUC = 0.624) when compared to Chi-square on mode and average profiles (AUCs of 0.571 and 0.518 respectively).</p>
<p>The degree of a gene in the network (the number of its neighbors) is an indicator of pleiotropy. Thus, genes with a high degree are more likely to be involved in many cellular functions, potentially leading to inflated performance estimates when using networks to predict gene function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Gillis1">[35]</xref>. We therefore tested if the improved enrichment of known endocytosis genes among high scoring network modules might be an artifact of the degree distribution, but this was not the case (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s008">Figure S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s027">Table S8</xref>).</p>
<p>In summary, these analyses demonstrate that including protein interaction information improves the filtering of relevant phenotypes from high-dimensional functional screens and it underlines the importance to maximally exploit the information contained in the several, multi-dimensional profiles obtained per gene.</p>
<p>Most of the above analysis required at least three profiles per gene to be similar with interacting genes for inclusion in a network module (<italic>k</italic> = 3). Such stringent threshold led to very good recovery of known endocytosis genes. In order to improve the potential for new discoveries we subsequently lowered the required number of consistent profiles from 3 to 2. This value still yields a better performance compared to other methods (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s027">Table S8</xref>), while increasing the number of newly predicted genes in network modules 10-fold.</p>

<title>Rescreen confirms profile selection</title>
<p>In order to also experimentally validate that our approach improves the phenotype selection, we rescreened 468 genes from the most significant protein complexes and network modules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s024">Table S5</xref>) using an improved set of 4 siRNAs per gene (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref>). The siRNAs used for this rescreen represented a new, independent set of reagents from a different provider, produced with newer technology, which improves the knock-down efficiency, induces less toxicity, and lowers off-target effects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Watts1">[36]</xref>. In order to independently confirm the improved quality of the new siRNAs we validated that both, individual parameters as well as phenotypic profiles are more reproducible using the new set of siRNAs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s003">Figures S3</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s004">S4</xref>). Importantly, profiles of different siRNAs targeting the same gene are more similar in the rescreen compared to the primary screen. Therefore, the new profiles are expected to be closer to the true phenotype.</p>
<p>The profiles selected by IMPACT are thought to be closer to the true phenotype of the genes than the rejected ones and, thus, should also be more similar to the rescreen data. Indeed, we observed that the pairwise correlation of the selected profiles to the new profiles is significantly higher than the correlation between rejected and new profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Furthermore, the reference profiles (i.e., the median of selected profiles per set or network module) are even more similar to the rescreen data than the selected profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Although being significant, the improvement is not dramatic: this is partly due to the fact that the phenotypic data for the new set of oligonucleotides are better but still noisy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s003">Figure S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s004">S4</xref>). To confirm this notion, we selected a few strong examples where the set of new oligo profiles show high intra-similarity within the rescreen (suggesting low noise). The similarity of the profiles selected by IMPACT is much higher to this new set than to the old ones for the same gene. Among those, we had some genes important for endocytosis (PDPK1, Furin, MLC1) and for signaling (ERBB2, IGF1R) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s019">Figure S19</xref>).</p>

Selected profiles are significantly better correlated with rescreen profiles than rejected profiles (p = 8.51×10<sup>−5</sup> MW test; p = 8.94×10<sup>−13</sup> KS test); reference profiles are even more strongly correlated with the rescreen profiles (p = 1.48×10<sup>−18</sup> MW test; p = 1.1×10<sup>−32</sup> KS test).

<title>Phenotyping endocytosis core machineries</title>
<p>In order to visualize the phenotypes of the analyzed complexes and network modules we created a ‘phenotype map’ representing the strength and specificity of the phenotype for transferrin or EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g004">Figures 4</xref> &amp; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g005">5</xref>). This visualization groups phenotypically related complexes and network modules and it also shows simplified representations of the profiles, thus, facilitating the interpretation of the findings. Even though the analysis above already showed that our method improved phenotype selection, we also verified the validity of our results by focusing on proteins and protein complexes with known functions related to endocytosis. Our analysis rescued several genes that did not score in the initial analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>, like RAB4A, SARA (ZFYVE9), APPL1, RAB11FIP1, VPS28, VAMP8, VIT1A, STX2 and SNX1 (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s031">Table S12</xref> for full list of 91 endocytic genes selected by IMPACT and missed in the previous analysis). Genes selected by IMPACT were enriched also for other endocytosis-related functional terms from the KEGG and GO annotations (DAVID analysis, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Huang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Huang2">[38]</xref>), such as endocytosis (p = 1.9e-3, modified Fisher's Exact Test), phosphatidylinositol signaling system (p = 1.3e-14) and inositol phosphate metabolism (p = 1.4e-8) for KEGG; membrane enclosed lumen (p = 1.7e-26) and membrane bounded vesicle (p = 1.5e-5) for cellular compartment (GO CC); membrane fusion (p = 1.8e-3), invagination (p = 6.5e-2) and docking (p = 9e-2) for GO biological processes (GO BP). Moreover, our method selected expected phenotypes for several known cellular machineries. The AP2 complex, for instance, is known to be primarily involved in transferrin endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Olusanya1">[39]</xref>.

Also, our analysis further elucidated how the position of a protein in a pathway relates to its phenotype.</p>
<p>For example, we detected two transforming growth factor beta (TGF-beta) related network modules with distinct phenotypic profiles (“Activins” and “SMADs-Notch”, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Consistent with the fact that Activins and SMADs act in the same pathway, our algorithm assigned related phenotypes to them, both showing a reduction of transferrin and EGF uptake, as already reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref> with a stronger impact on transferrin than EGF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g005">Figure 5</xref>). However, our analysis also uncovered significant differences between these two parts of the TGF-beta pathway. The first module contains several Activin receptors (ACVR1B, ACVR2B, ACVR2A, ACVR1 and AXVRL1) that are known to modulate and transform signals for the TGF-beta superfamily of ligands. The second module links the TGF-beta and Notch pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Blokzijl1">[42]</xref>. This SMADs-Notch module has a core consisting of SMAD2, SMAD3 and NOTCH1, which in turn are associated with several transcriptional regulators (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g005">Figure 5</xref>). SMAD3 and NOTCH1 were missed in the initial screen hit list and have been rescued by the integrative analysis. Knock-down of genes in both, the Activins and SMADs-Notch sub-networks, significantly reduced the number of endosomes (G1), underlining the importance of these pathways for endocytosis. However, knock-down of the Activin module reduces cargo uptake (G2), whereas knock-down of the SMADs-Notch module increases cargo uptake for transferrin endosomes.</p>
<p>The difference between the Activins and SMADs-Notch modules underlines that upstream and downstream components of the same signaling pathway (i.e. the TGF-β pathway in this case) can have different effects on endocytosis. Thus, the position of proteins in the pathway seems to critically affect the impact on the assay's readout.</p>
<sec id="s2e1">
<title>Crosstalk between EGFR and IGFR impacts on EGF endocytosis</title>
<p>Another network module related to cell signaling contains the EGF receptor (EGFR) together with huntingtin (HTT), catenin delta 1 (CTNND1) and the IGF-1 receptor (IGFR, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This module was of particular interest because of the importance of IGF-EGF crosstalk in signaling and cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Roudabush1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Morgillo1">[44]</xref>. Our analysis suggested a specific effect of this interaction on EGF endocytosis (and not transferrin). Moreover, the Insulin signaling pathway was one of the most enriched among the ones identified by IMPACT-modules. IGF1R was specifically rescued by our analysis as a weak but specific phenotype and the results were confirmed by our rescreen. Taken together all these facts lead us to investigate the EGFR-IGFR interaction more in detail.</p>
<p>All proteins in this module, except for EGFR, share a phenotypic profile in which EGF endocytosis is up-regulated. Whereas knock-down of EGFR causes a decrease in EGF endocytosis, as expected, silencing of the other genes in the module leads to an anti-correlated profile, consisting of increase in the number of EGF-positive endosomes, endosomal EGF concentration and distance of EGF endosomes from the nucleus. In contrast, the transferrin related parameters did not show relevant changes. We were particularly interested in the crosstalk between IGFR and EGFR, because the constitutive activity of these signaling pathways is characteristic of many tumors and chemotherapy resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Roudabush1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Nahta1">[48]</xref>. Our analysis suggests that IGFR exerts a specific regulation on EGFR trafficking, an observation that has not been reported so far. We reasoned that this crosstalk might be mediated either by a direct interaction between the two receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Morgillo1">[44]</xref> or by a modulation of EGFR trafficking by IGFR signaling.</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we measured the effect of IGF-1 stimulation on the cellular uptake kinetics of EGF and transferrin by confocal fluorescence microscopy. For this, HeLa cells were pulsed with EGF and transferrin for 10 minutes (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Methods</xref>) and chased for different periods of time, in the absence or presence of 50 and 250 ng/ml IGF-1. We found that IGF-1 significantly accelerated the kinetics of EGF internalization (<italic>integral vesicular intensity</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6 a)</xref>, whereas transferrin uptake was unaffected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6 b)</xref>. After an initial accumulation phase of approximately 20 minutes, intracellular vesicular EGF decreased monotonously following first-order kinetics, consistent with endosomal degradation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Leslie1">[49]</xref>. Transferrin total intensity (integral vesicular intensity, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6 b)</xref> showed a rapid monotonous decay after pulse, in agreement with its recycling kinetics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Maxfield1">[50]</xref>. The decay of EGF (i.e. degradation) was specifically accelerated in the presence of IGF whereas that of transferrin (i.e. recycling) was unchanged, as quantified by the estimation of the rate constants after fitting a decaying exponential function to the experimental data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s011">Figure S11</xref>).</p>

<p>To better visualize the changes induced by IGF-1, we subtracted the total cargo vesicular intensity distributions between the control and stimulated conditions for each time point. This representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6 c)</xref> emphasizes the changes in cargo content in different sub-populations of endosomes out of the total endosomal network. The results indicate that IGF-1 exerted two main effects. First, it caused the appearance of a higher number of endosomes containing EGF, as shown by the positive values in vesicular intensity differences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6 c</xref>, panel above). Second, stimulation caused a faster endosomal accumulation of EGF (note the shift over time of the peak toward higher vesicular intensity values, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6c</xref>, panel above). In contrast, the transferrin was re-distributed between endosomes only at the initial time points (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6 c</xref>, panel below), without alterations in the total amount of intracellular transferrin (note that the positive and negative values of vesicular intensity differences neutralize each other, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003801-g006">Figure 6 c</xref>, panel below).</p>
<p>In conclusion, our analysis was able to uncover a novel aspect of the crosstalk between IGF-1 and EGF, through acceleration of EGF uptake and transport along the degradative pathway. These results demonstrate the ability of IMPACT to reveal novel interactions between functional modules and to assist the molecular interpretation of genetic screens.</p>

<title>Application of IMPACT to other data sets</title>
<p>We evaluated the general applicability of IMPACT in three different ways: first, we applied IMPACT-modules to the same RNAi screening data, but using a different network as a prior. Second, we ran it on another siRNA screen with autophagy as an endpoint <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-McKnight1">[51]</xref> and finally, we used IMPACT to analyze a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in human cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Shalem1">[52]</xref> (see respective paragraphs in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s042">Text S2</xref>).</p>
<p>We run IMPACT-modules for the endocytosis screen on different interaction networks derived from the STRING database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Franceschini1">[53]</xref>. STRING incorporates diverse types of information, such as co-expression, experimentally validated protein binding, and text mining, to predict the functional relationships between genes. Importantly, it can be used to evaluate the importance of these individual feature types for the phenotype prediction. This analysis revealed that the choice of the network strongly affects the quality of the phenotype prediction. Specifically, we noticed that 1) the performance deteriorates when considering co-expression data only (AUC = 0.505); 2) experimentally validated interaction networks yield better classification (AUC = 0.6483 for the HPRD-Intact-KEGG combined network and 0.603 for STRING experimental) than networks allowing also non-experimental interactions such as database and text mining predictions (AUC = 0.553). See paragraph Other sources of prior information, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s042">Text S2</xref>. Thus, this analysis confirmed that using high-quality, experimentally confirmed protein interaction data maximally reduced noise from the RNAi data. Importantly, both experimental networks (our combined and STRING-experimental) gave results that were better than random.</p>
<p>Next, we run IMPACT-modules on a siRNA autophagy screen in the human HEK293 cell line <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-McKnight1">[51]</xref> where 3 replicates of the entire screen were acquired and 3 different image-based parameters were measured. We analyzed the recovery of the known autophagy genes reported in the human autophagy database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.autophagy.lu" xlink:type="simple">www.autophagy.lu</ext-link>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Moussay1">[54]</xref>). The original screen analysis identified 25 known genes (out of the 175 autophagy genes screened) among the 1'000 reported hits (enrichment p-value = 0.04); IMPACT-modules identified 1'332 significant genes, of which 46 were autophagy annotated (out of the 161 mapping on the network; enrichment p-value = 2e-3). Also, IMPACT performed better than the ranking measure considered in the screen for classifying the known autophagy genes (AUC = 0.563, p = 2e-4 for IMPACT; AUC = 0.4949, p = 0.59 for hit ranking). See paragraph Analysis of the siRNA autophagy screen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s042">Text S2</xref>.</p>
<p>Finally, we run IMPACT-modules on a CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in the human melanoma cell line A375 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Shalem1">[52]</xref>, where the authors investigated the effect of gene loss upon treatment with vemurafenib, a therapeutic drug inhibitor of BRAF, by measuring cell viability in 4 different conditions (vehicle versus drug, 7 and 14 days). IMPACT identified 1'659 significant genes (p&lt;0.05). Gene enrichment analysis of over-represent GO biological processes and KEGG pathways (DAVID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Huang1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Huang2">[38]</xref>) revealed interesting insights into the mechanism of action of the drug. Pathways involved in cancer and related to BRAF activity, such as “Melanoma”, “MAPK”, “Pathways in cancer” were strongly enriched (fold enrichment of 2.35, 1.84, 2.06; p-value of 3e-7, 8e-11, 2e-20 respectively). Also, biological processes related to phosphorylation, kinase activity, cell migration, cell proliferation and cell death were strongly enriched (p-values ranging from 1e-12 to 1e-6). The screen hit list derived using RIGER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Luo1">[55]</xref> identified overall GO and KEGG terms with higher p-values and lower fold enrichment (i.e. less significant), related mainly to “Oxidative phosphorylation” (p = 1e-4), transcription (2e-4) and histone modification (1.2e-3). See paragraph Analysis of the CRISPR-Cas9 knockout screen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s042">Text S2</xref>. Thus, we conclude that IMPACT improves the analysis of functional genomics screens beyond RNAi screens.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Multi-parametric phenotyping is becoming increasingly important for understanding basic biological processes and disease mechanisms. Such high-dimensional phenotyping is being conducted in RNAi screens, (conditional) knock-out screens, quantitative trait loci (QTL) studies, chemical genomics and gene editing screens. In this study, we developed a novel approach for analyzing multi-dimensional functional genomics screens in combination with external information in order to facilitate the mechanistic interpretation and to cope with noise in phenotype detection. Our approach provides significant methodological advantages, because it integrates (1) set-based and network-based prior information, (2) high-dimensional (multi-parametric) phenotypic profiles, and (3) multiple profiles per gene. Further, it handles several potential biases, e.g. due to the network topology (number of neighbors) or the frequency of phenotypic profiles. This data integration of course critically relies on existing interaction information, which is still sparse and noisy. However, our study demonstrates that the impact of noise and OTEs could be drastically reduced for those genes that are part of a network. A broad range of novel insights into the function of both known and new cellular machineries could be gained, only some of which could be addressed in this study. The use of two methods obviously increased the scope of prior information that could be used for the analysis (protein complexes and protein-interaction networks).</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Alternative approaches</title>
<p>We chose to use only protein interaction data to support mechanistic interpretation of the phenotypes in terms of molecular machineries. Co-expression and co-functionality data have a broader coverage of the genome, however they do not necessarily imply molecular interactions and would therefore not satisfy the purpose.</p>
<p>Instead of using IMPACT-sets, one may also transform protein complexes into interaction networks by considering all pairwise interactions instead of protein sets. In this case, one could use IMPACT-modules to perform the analysis. We tested this possibility (IMPACT-modules on sets) and calculated the classification performance (AUC) in identifying known endocytic genes. Running IMPACT-modules on sets still performs better than the other approaches considered in this study, but its performance is worse compared to IMPACT-sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s025">Table S6</xref>). Two reasons may explain this phenomenon: first, the statistical analysis of IMPACT-sets may be better suited for the analysis of sets. Second, the conversion of sets into networks is questionable. Thus, considering set information, when available, rather than splitting it into binary interactions can be advantageous.</p>
<p>The complexity of our approach arises in part from the fact that we considered all phenotypic profiles separately and selected the profiles with an enriched pattern among other genes in the set or interacting genes in the network. A simpler approach would have been to combine all profiles of a gene first (e.g. averaging) and then assessing the consistency in the networks. However, this method would not take into account that different siRNAs often produce very different profiles due to their heterogeneous off-target signatures. In fact, sometimes less than half of the siRNAs yield profiles resembling the correct phenotype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s018">Figure S18</xref>) and averaging would result in profiles that are more strongly affected by OTEs and noise. We indeed observed that applying IMPACT after averaging either decreases performances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s006">Figures S6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s007">S7b</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s023">Table S4</xref>) or reduces the number of selected genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s024">Table S5</xref>), with a stronger effect on network module identification.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Method assessment</title>
<p>The classification analysis showed improvements relative to other approaches, both considering (JAM, MATISSE) and ignoring (Chi-square) prior information. However, we were hoping for an even better performance: using IMPACT the AUCs never exceeded 0.65 for endocytosis GO terms and 0.67 for the Rab5 effectors and proteins with endocytic domains. Our analysis showed that noise in both, the RNAi screening data and the network can significantly compromise the performance. However, using a network-prior improves the signal-to-noise ratio, which is even more important when data is noisy. Also, reducing network coverage led to lower performances, suggesting that IMPACT or related methods relying on prior information can further improve as new protein-protein interactions will be discovered. Importantly, whichever method is used, the quality of the results is always limited by the quality of the input data. Thus, all method assessment should be regarded as relative comparisons of alternative approaches.</p>
<p>One concern when comparing methods relying on prior information (such as IMPACT, JAM, Matisse) to methods relying on phenotypic data only is that the performances of these methods may be inflated by the fact that interacting genes tend to share the same annotation used for evaluation, which may result in circular reasoning. This problem cannot be completely solved since equally annotated, connected genes could be at the core of molecular machineries, which makes it difficult to distinguish a circularity bias from the reality of the underlying biology. We have tried to address this problem in two ways: first, we evaluated the enrichment of not just any GO term among top-scoring genes, but terms specific for endocytosis. A network-based method running on random data may still identify sub-networks or protein complexes that are enriched for certain functions, but not necessarily for the functions relevant for the screen. Second, we have performed extensive new experimental validation, which is independent of any reported annotation in public databases.</p>
<p>Application of our two methods to an endocytosis RNAi screen led to improved recovery of known endocytosis-related genes compared to the analysis of the primary screen data alone. Further, based on several performance measures, our network-based method performs better than published methods that are either mono-parametric or do not assume multiple profiles per gene. Importantly, using only one (averaged) profile per gene also reduces the performance of our method, which demonstrates that considering multiple profiles is crucial. The importance to assess sets and modules based on individual-siRNA profiles was also confirmed by the rescreen, which showed that the selected profiles were significantly better correlated with the new independent data than the rejected profiles. Moreover, the partial coverage that prior information based approaches can offer (in our case, 9,715 out of the 17,730 genes in the screen were mapped on the interaction network) suggests as a sensible solution the use of IMPACT as a complement rather than an alternative to other methods relying only on phenotypic information, to combine the strengths of both, i.e. identifying protein machineries and elucidating their function with IMPACT, while still assessing the effect of genes without interaction information.</p>
<p>The computation of the significance of network modules controls for potential biases, such as the topology of the sub-networks, that were ignored in previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Tu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Ideker1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Ulitsky1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Chuang1">[56]</xref>. To address this, our approach takes into consideration the number of neighbors (degree) and the number of profiles (siRNAs) of each gene, as well as the frequency of the enriched phenotypic profile across all genes in the network. Not considering these factors may lead to inflated or deflated significance estimates. Note that global permutation testing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Tu1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Chuang1">[56]</xref> would neither account for the specificities of a given phenotypic profile nor for the local topology of the network. Whereas our network search is based on a heuristic greedy search, other methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Dittrich1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Backes1">[58]</xref> provide exact solutions using constraint programming for module search. However, these approaches can only deal with a single score per gene; further development will be necessary to devise similar strategies for multi-parametric measurements and multiple profiles per gene.</p>

<title>Pathway analysis</title>
<p>Recent work already suggested feedback regulation of signaling pathways onto endocytosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Polo1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Scita1">[59]</xref><xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>. The findings in this study (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s030">Table S11</xref>) underline the tight bonds between the endocytic machinery and signaling networks. Additionally, our network analysis revealed that different modules within the same signaling pathway can exert diverse effects on trafficking (e.g. Activins- and SMADs-containing modules within the TGF-beta pathway), whereas components of different signaling pathways (e.g. TGF-beta and Notch) can have similar effects on endocytosis. Thus, there is no trivial relationship between a gene's membership in a signaling pathway and effects on cellular machineries.</p>
<p>Our computational analysis suggested that IGFR might impact specifically on EGFR trafficking, an observation that has not been described so far. This effect might be mediated by direct binding between activated IGFR and EGFR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Morgillo1">[44]</xref> or by the IGFR signaling pathway. Our experiments confirmed that IGF stimulation induced faster endosomal accumulation of EGF, probably by accelerating early endosome fusion. The redistribution of transferrin was not surprising, since the two cargos extensively colocalize in endosomes at early time points <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Leonard1">[60]</xref>. However, IGF-1 stimulation affected specifically EGF trafficking kinetics by inducing both faster uptake and decay (consistent with degradation) without affecting the overall uptake and recycling kinetics of transferrin. Importantly, since these effects were relatively weak, IGFR was not detected as a hit gene in the initial analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>. Only the integrated analysis exploiting the network context revealed its effect on EGF endocytosis.</p>
<p>Other mechanisms of crosstalk among IGFR and EGFR involving receptor cross-activation and heterodimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Morgillo1">[44]</xref> or cross-transcriptional regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Roudabush1">[43]</xref> have previously been proposed. Our findings extend those reports by uncovering novel aspects of the integration of these signaling pathways at the level of the trafficking system.</p>

<title>Application to other data sets</title>
<p>The application of the screen to other sources of prior information and other phenotypic data revealed important aspects of the presented method. First, the choice of prior information can significantly affect the quality of the results. Molecular interaction data (as opposed to functional relationships such as co-expression) helped best to reduce noise and improve the mechanistic interpretation of the results.</p>
<p>For the CRISPR screen application, it is difficult to compare the performance of our method to the RIGER screen analysis due to the absence of a positive set. However, we have shown that our method can be successfully applied to diverse kinds of data and can lead to interesting hypotheses to further explore. IMPACT did not reveal modules of genes involved in drug resistance (i.e. increasing cell viability), because they either lack network context or the phenotypic effect is not conserved among interactors. However, it succeeded in identifying molecular machineries responding to the drug (i.e. decreasing cell viability), which could have potential therapeutic applications for the design of co-inhibitors of other genes in the pathway to overcome drug resistance in melanoma.</p>
<p>Despite the aforementioned advantages, there are limitations to this approach. Our network covers less than half of the human protein coding genes. Genes outside the network are ‘inaccessible’ to our analysis. We anticipate that future projects will use other information (such as predicted protein-protein interactions) and also improve the statistical framework. This work therefore just represents the beginning of a gradually more integrated analysis of high-dimensional functional screens in conjunction with network data.</p>

<p>Both IMPACT-sets and IMPACT-modules work on a high-dimensional dataset generated by functional screens (e.g. knock-down, knock-out, gene editing screen). Here, the phenotype of each gene <italic>g</italic> is measured <italic>m</italic> times, as for instance after knock-down with <italic>m</italic> different oligonucleotides.

<p>We considered as phenotypic data for our analysis a high-dimensional image-based RNAi screen performed in human HeLa cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003801-Collinet1">[3]</xref>. This screen aimed to characterize the loss of function phenotype of each gene involved in the endocytosis of two cargo molecules, transferrin (TF) and the epidermal growth factor (EGF). To this purpose, 40 parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s020">Table S1</xref>) were quantitatively measured to assess the effect of multiple oligonucleotide knock-downs per gene, with an average of about 7 different si-/esi-RNA reagents per gene.

<title>Gene-set-based approach (IMPACT-sets)</title>
<p>The gene-set-based approach tests for the enrichment of a set of related genes for a specific phenotypic profile. The set of genes can be defined based on functional relationships (e.g. pathway co-membership) or physical association (protein complexes). The algorithm consists of two main steps: First, the algorithm identifies a ‘common’ phenotypic pattern that is shared by a maximum number of genes in the set. Then, the statistical assessment is performed via randomizations: for each set with an enriched profile, we generate random sets of the same size and with the same number of profiles per gene in each set. The resulting empirical distribution is used for computing p-values.</p>
<sec id="s4c1">
<title>Enriched pattern estimation</title>
<p>Let us consider a gene set <italic>G</italic> as a set of multiple genes <italic>g<sub>i</sub></italic>. We denote the number of genes in the set with <italic>n<sub>g</sub></italic> and the total number of profiles in the whole set with <italic>n<sub>p</sub></italic>. IMPACT-sets builds the squared similarity matrix <italic>S</italic> of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> representing the pair-wise similarity between all the profiles <italic>P</italic> present in set <italic>G</italic>. In principle, any similarity measure can be used; here we use the Pearson correlation coefficient. All profiles with correlation scores above a threshold <italic>T</italic> are considered ‘similar’. Only positively correlated profiles are considered. The searching heuristic selects the row (i.e. profile) in <italic>S</italic> having the largest number of genes <italic>n<sub>T</sub></italic> similar above <italic>T</italic>. If two subsets have equal <italic>n<sub>T</sub></italic>, the heuristic selects the subset with the maximal sum of correlation values. Note that IMPACT-sets choses the profile with the maximum number of genes having similar profiles. Just maximizing the number of similar profiles in the set may bias the results in favor of genes with large numbers of profiles. Profiles belonging to the selected profiles define the enriched pattern and are used to calculate the reference profile of the set <italic>G</italic> as the median of all selected profiles.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4c2">
<title>Statistical assessment for IMPACT-sets</title>
<p>The statistical assessment is done comparing the number of similar profiles in the observed (real) set to a respective empirical background distribution. The random distributions are computed using random sets that have the same structure (same number of genes <italic>n<sub>g</sub></italic> and the same number of phenotypic profiles per gene <italic>n<sub>p_g</sub></italic>) as the real sets. Genes are shuffled between sets, but profiles of the same gene are kept together. In this way we maintained the inherent correlation between profiles of the same gene also in the background distributions. Since the probability of observing <italic>n</italic> similar genes by chance depends on <italic>n<sub>g</sub></italic> and <italic>n<sub>p_g</sub></italic>, we generated specific background distribution for each tested complex. Given a set <italic>G</italic>, we performed <italic>N_rand</italic> (5000 in our case) randomizations by assembling complexes with the same structure, i.e. <italic>n<sub>g</sub></italic> genes and <italic>n<sub>p_g</sub></italic> profiles per each gene. We then applied the searching step on each of the <italic>N_rand</italic> complexes and we compared the result from the real case to the distribution of results obtained from the randomizations. The p-value is estimated as the fraction of times the same or more profiles are selected as with the observed data.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s4d">
<title>Network-based approach (IMPACT-modules)</title>
<p>For the network-based analysis of the phenotypic data, we have implemented a greedy search algorithm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s017">Figure S17</xref>). This search method may operate on any network representing genes as nodes and any kind of relationship between genes as (undirected) edges. The method can be applied to phenotypic data where either multiple profiles are available for each gene or when there is a single profile per gene.</p>
<p>The algorithm works in three main steps:</p>
<list list-type="order"><list-item>
<p><bold>seed selection</bold>: selection of genes (network nodes) as starting points for performing the search;</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold>module expansion</bold>: identification of sub-networks with homogeneous phenotypic profiles;</p>
</list-item><list-item>
<p><bold>module assessment</bold>: determination of statistical significance via computing the module p-value.</p>
</list-item></list>
<sec id="s4d1">
<title>Seed selection</title>
<p>Seed selection iteratively tests each node with at least <italic>k_s</italic> profiles as a potential seed node. The procedure assesses all direct neighbours of a node and the centre-node itself as a ‘gene set’. It then searches for an enriched phenotypic profile in this set using a procedure similar to the method IMPACT-sets described above. We keep as seed nodes only those genes having an enriched phenotypic pattern in the set, i.e. profiles showing a similarity (absolute value of Pearson correlation coefficient) above a threshold <italic>T_s</italic> between each putative seed node and its network neighbours. If such enriched profile exists and if at least one profile of the neighbours is selected, the centre-node will be used as a seed node and the profiles selected in the enriched pattern will be used to calculate the seed profile. Such seed profile is the median of all the selected profiles, where the sign of the profile is taken into account for each neighbour node by swapping the anti-correlated profiles within the node. If any node has profiles both correlated and anti-correlated above the threshold <italic>T_s</italic>, the heuristic selects the profiles that maximize the sum of negative or positive correlation values. In our analysis, we set <italic>k_s</italic> and <italic>T_s</italic> to 2 and 0.8, respectively.</p>
<p>Alternatively, the list of seed nodes can also be created using genes of interest or genes satisfying other properties (e.g. genes exhibiting very strong phenotypes).</p>
</sec><sec id="s4d2">
<title>Module expansion</title>
<p>The module expansion starts from the seed nodes. Neighbours of the current module are assessed by comparing their phenotypic profiles to the seed profile (Pearson correlation). At each step all neighbours having at least <italic>k</italic> phenotypic profiles that are similar above a threshold <italic>T</italic> are added to the module. <italic>k</italic> can either be the minimal number or the minimal fraction of profiles with similarity above the threshold <italic>T</italic> required for the inclusion of the gene in the expansion step. The method requires that the absolute (i.e. negative and positive) correlation between profiles must be equal or above the defined threshold <italic>T</italic>. Different profiles obtained for the same gene must always be positively correlated. Note that, during the module expansion, the seed profile is not changed, i.e. it is not updated after including new genes in the module. This is done to ensure that the seed profile does not start to gradually deviate from the initial profile. The module expansion stops when there are no neighbours satisfying the similarity condition or the maximum module size exceeded 50 expansion steps. Similarly to the set-based analysis, a phenotypic signature for the detected module is computed as the reference profile. This consists of the median of all the selected profiles belonging to the genes in each module. Due to the search strategy this reference profile may deviate slightly, but not strongly, from the seed profile. Since modules can contain both positively and negatively correlated profiles, we accounted for profile sign when computing the median for the reference profile i.e. if the majority of profiles are positively correlated to the seed profile, all the negatively correlated ones are swapped (multiplied by −1), or vice versa.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4d3">
<title>Module assessment</title>
<p>The statistical significance of modules detected is assessed in a semi-analytical way. Our approach computes the probability of observing a specific module by chance, by viewing the module expansion as a stochastic process. At each step of the expansion we compute the probability of including the given number of neighbours under the null-hypothesis that genes (and thus their profiles) are randomly distributed on the network. For this procedure we utilize profile-specific empirical probability distributions that take the inter-dependency of profiles for each gene into account.</p>
<p>Profile-specific distributions are needed to correct for the fact that certain phenotypic profiles are more frequent in the dataset than others. We noticed that certain types (clusters) of profiles are more frequent than others (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s005">Figure S5b</xref>), which may bias the selection in favor of more frequent profiles. (For the set based approach we did not observe such a frequency bias; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003801.s005">Figure S5a</xref>). Hence, we created profile-specific background distributions for each seed profile, i.e. the probability of observing a correlated pair of profiles is dependent on the specific phenotypic pattern of the seed profile <italic>p<sub>s</sub></italic> and the number of profiles per gene. In our case, the number of profiles per gene was very variable and only few genes had many (&gt;7) profiles measured. Thus, it was not possible to generate a background distribution for each possible number of profiles per gene. Instead, we grouped genes with similar (though not identical) numbers of profiles into <italic>n_bin</italic> bins and subsequently randomly drew genes from these bins to generate the background distributions. For each seed node <italic>s</italic> and each of the <italic>n_bin</italic> groups (i.e., <italic>b<sub>1</sub></italic>, <italic>b<sub>2</sub></italic>, … <italic>b<sub>n</sub></italic>), we counted how many times we selected at least <italic>k</italic> profiles where the correlation of the seed profile with the profiles of <italic>N_rand</italic> genes extracted from the bin <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> exceeds the similarity threshold <italic>T</italic>. Therefore, the profile-specific probability for the inclusion of a node belonging to the bin <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic> (i.e. with a specific number of profiles) during seed expansion is<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003801.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>i</italic> is the bin index, <italic>N<sub>rand</sub></italic> is the desired number of random node extractions and<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003801.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>Here, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the function that returns the number of occurrences, <italic>k</italic> is the minimal number of occurrences, <italic>T</italic> is the minimal similarity value required, <italic>p<sub>s</sub></italic> and <italic>p<sub>g</sub></italic> are respectively the seed profile and the profile of the gene <italic>g</italic> randomly extracted from the current bin <italic>b<sub>i</sub></italic>.</p>
<p>The module expansion is considered as a stochastic process made of consecutive states. Each state (i.e. expansion step) consists of the direct neighbors of the current module that contains both, nodes that satisfy the similarity criterion (e.g. minimum 2 profiles similar above threshold) and nodes that do not satisfy it. Consequently, we consider the current neighbors as a set of Bernoulli experiments leading to a binomial distribution for expressing the probability associated with each state of the system. The probability mass distribution and the cumulative distribution function are thus:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003801.e008"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e008" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1003801.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e009" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where:</p>

<p>For each step of the module expansion we estimate the probability of observing it, i.e. the probability associated with the event of having the current module together with <italic>k</italic> similar and <italic>n-k</italic> dissimilar neighbors. For instance, at the initial step we have a state <italic>x<sub>0</sub></italic> for which we can compute a probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; after the inclusion of the first set of similar neighbours, the module is in the state <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which occurs by chance with a probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003801.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and so on.
