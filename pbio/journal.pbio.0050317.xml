        <p>Actin polymerization-driven protrusion of the leading edge is a key element of cell motility. The important actin nucleators formins and the Arp2/3 complex are believed to have nonoverlapping functions in inducing actin filament bundles in filopodia and dendritic networks in lamellipodia, respectively. We tested this idea by investigating the role of mDia2 formin in leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Unexpectedly, mDia2 depletion by short interfering RNA (siRNA) severely inhibited lamellipodia. Structural analysis of the actin network in the few remaining lamellipodia suggested an mDia2 role in generation of long filaments. Consistently, constitutively active mDia2 (ΔGBD-mDia2) induced accumulation of long actin filaments in lamellipodia and increased persistence of lamellipodial protrusion. Depletion of mDia2 also inhibited filopodia, whereas expression of ΔGBD-mDia2 promoted their formation. Correlative light and electron microscopy showed that ΔGBD-mDia2–induced filopodia were formed from lamellipodial network through gradual convergence of long lamellipodial filaments into bundles. Efficient filopodia induction required mDia2 targeting to the membrane, likely through a scaffolding protein Abi1. Furthermore, mDia2 and Abi1 interacted through the N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 and the SH3-containing Abi1 sequences. We propose that mDia2 plays an important role in formation of lamellipodia by nucleating and/or protecting from capping lamellipodial actin filaments, which subsequently exhibit high tendency to converge into filopodia.</p>

          <p>Cell motility is a cyclic process, with the protrusion of the leading edge followed by retraction of the rear. Protrusion is driven by polymerization of actin filaments, with the spatial organization of these filaments determining the shape of the protrusions. For example, the spike-like filopodia contain bundles of long actin filaments, whereas the sheet-like lamellipodia contain branched actin networks. In biochemical assays, two stimulators of actin polymerization, Arp2/3 complex and formins, induce branched or individual filaments, respectively. In cells, Arp2/3 complex and formins also appear to be implicated in the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia, respectively. However, when we investigated the role of mDia2 formin by functional approaches, we unexpectedly found that it is essential, not only for filopodia, but also for lamellipodia. Moreover, functions of mDia2 in lamellipodia and filopodia appeared intimately linked. We recorded behavior of cells by light microscopy and then used electron microscopy to study actin architecture in the same cells. We found that an activated form of mDia2 was first recruited to lamellipodia, where it induced many long, unbranched filaments, and from there, drove formation of filopodia through gradual convergence of these lamellipodial filaments into bundles. These data demonstrate a strong relationship between structurally different actin filament arrays and molecular machineries involved in their formation.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Cell motility is a cyclic process consisting of protrusion of the leading edge followed by retraction of the rear. Actin filament polymerization provides a driving force for protrusion, whereas the shape and dynamics of protrusive organelles depend on the spatial organization of underlying filaments and activity of accessory molecules. Spatially restricted and temporally controlled actin filament nucleation is critical for generating membrane protrusions. Arp2/3 complex and formins are two major actin filament nucleators acting as convergent nodes of signaling pathways leading to initiation of actin-based motility (reviewed in[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b002">2</xref>]. Arp2/3 complex nucleates branched actin filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b004">4</xref>]. Conversely, formins nucleate single linear filaments, binding to and protecting from capping their growing barbed ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b007">7</xref>]. Therefore, Arp2/3 complex and formins are thought to have nonoverlapping functions in cells in the formation of dendritic networks and linear bundles, respectively. These distinct roles have been clearly demonstrated in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b008">8</xref>], but appear to be conserved also in mammals. Thus, Arp2/3 complex is a key nucleator during lamellipodia extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b012">12</xref>] and endocytosis, where it functions downstream of WAVE [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b013">13</xref>] and N-WASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b014">14</xref>] Arp2/3 activators, respectively. Formins mDia1 and mDia2, instead, play a role in stress-fiber formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b015">15</xref>] and filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>], respectively. <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> dDia2 is also both necessary and sufficient for filopodia extension [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b018">18</xref>].</p>
      <p>The concept of functional separation of Arp2/3 complex and formins during leading-edge protrusion to generate dendritic networks in lamellipodia and parallel bundles in filopodia, respectively, is challenged by the observation that filopodia may arise by reorganization of the lamellipodial network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b020">20</xref>]. In this process, termed the convergent elongation, Arp2/3-dependent nucleation was proposed to supply filaments for filopodial bundles. However, other studies point to a nonessential role of Arp2/3 complex in filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b021">21</xref>] favoring an alternative model whereby formin mDia2 is sufficient to generate a filopodial bundle not necessarily associated with lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b022">22</xref>]. Thus, the mechanisms of filopodia formation and contribution of different actin nucleators to the generation of protrusions in mammalian cells are far from being elucidated.</p>
      <p>The domain organization of two related formins, mDia1 and mDia2, and functions of individual domains are well characterized [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b024">24</xref>]. The functional module consisting of FH1 and FH2 domains is responsible for nucleation, barbed-end binding, and anticapping protection of formins in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b007">7</xref>]. In cells, the FH1FH2 domain of mDia1 can travel on polymerizing barbed ends over significant distances until it stops at the cell membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b025">25</xref>]. The N-terminal regulatory region upstream of the FH1FH2 module contains the GTPase-binding domain (GBD), the Diaphanous inhibitory domain (DID), the dimerization domain (DD), and the coiled coil region (CC), whereas the Diaphanous autoinhibitory domain (DAD) is present at the C-terminus of the molecule. Full-length Diaphanous-related formins are autoinhibited through intramolecular interaction between DID and DAD, which is thought to be relieved by specific small GTPases binding to GBD and displacing DAD from DID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b026">26</xref>]. Disruption of this intramolecular interaction by deleting DAD or DID sequences generates constitutively active mutants of these formins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b027">27</xref>].</p>
      <p>In this study, aiming to characterize the mDia2-dependent mechanism of filopodia formation, we investigated a role of mDia2 in the leading-edge protrusion by loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches followed by detailed analyses of the phenotypes using light and electron microscopy (EM) and a combination of both. Unexpectedly, we found that mDia2 was implicated in lamellipodia formation, suggesting that the Arp2/3 complex, despite being essential, was not sufficient for this function. Furthermore, the constitutively active mDia2 mutant efficiently induced filopodia, but these filopodia were formed, not from a focal spot away from lamellipodia, but by the gradual reorganization of lamellipodial filaments converging into filopodial bundles. We also found that specific targeting to the membrane was essential for mDia2 functions in protrusion. The targeting required a multifunctional scaffolding protein Abi1, which also participates in other actin-remodeling events, including regulation of Arp2/3-dependent nucleation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b013">13</xref>]. Thus, two types of actin-based protrusions, lamellipodia and filopodia, despite containing structurally distinct actin filament arrays, display considerable dynamic relationship with each other and share mDia2 as a key molecular player.</p>

        <title>Knockdown of mDia2 by siRNA Inhibits Lamellipodia and Filopodia</title>
        <p>Mouse melanoma B16F1 cells form broad lamellipodia interspersed by a varying number of filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). During their lifetime, filopodial bundles might remain within lamellipodia and are often termed microspikes, or protrude beyond the leading edge, becoming bona fide filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>]. We determined the intracellular localization of endogenous mDia2 by immunostaining, and found that it concentrated at filopodial tips, but also was distinctly enriched in lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Filopodial localization is consistent with previously shown targeting of activated mDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>] and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> formin dDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b018">18</xref>] to filopodial tips, but lamellipodial enrichment was unexpected, and suggested that mDia2 might function in both types of protrusions.</p>

        <p>We investigated mDia2 functions in cells using the RNA interference (RNAi) approach. Transfection of B16F1 cells with mDia2 short interfering RNA (siRNA) significantly depleted endogenous mDia2, but not other proteins involved in actin-based protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), such as the p34-Arc subunit of Arp2/3 complex, a filopodial actin-bundling protein fascin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b028">28</xref>], or VASP, an actin-binding protein localizing to filopodia tips, lamellipodial edges, and focal adhesions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b029">29</xref>]. Depletion of mDia2 caused a significant delay in cell spreading (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), cell migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), and a striking inhibition of both lamellipodia and filopodia, as compared to control, scrambled siRNA-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">1</xref>H; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv001">Videos S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv002">S2</xref>). Quantitative analysis of phalloidin-stained cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) revealed that less than 10% of the cell periphery in mDia2-depleted cells was occupied by actin-rich fringes morphologically resembling lamellipodia (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for quantification criteria), as compared to approximately 50% in control cells. Furthermore, the presence of lamellipodia sharply declined with decreasing levels of mDia2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Accordingly, the lamellipodial markers, p16-Arc (Arp2/3 subunit) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>H), capping protein, Abi1, or VASP (unpublished data) were no longer enriched at the cell edge in mDia2 siRNA-treated cells. Thus, control cells had 53.1 ± 11.1% (<italic>n</italic> = 11) of their perimeter stained with p16-Arc antibody, whereas mDia2 knockdown cells had only 4.4 ± 1.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 10) of Arp2/3-positive edges. Notably, the remaining lamellipodia in mDia2-depleted cells were abnormal morphologically, as they were very narrow in the direction perpendicular to the edge and often resembled small ruffles, whereas classical broad and flat lamellipodia were not observed. These lamellipodia were also abnormal kinetically, as they quickly switched to retraction after transient protrusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>G), and their protrusion rate and persistence were significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>E).</p>

        <p>Some filopodia also remained after transfection with mDia2 siRNA, but they appeared less rigid than normal, frequently bending and protruding in a curvy path. Although fascin was present in these filopodia, the number of fascin-containing structures was significantly decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figure 1</xref>H). No obvious changes in stress-fiber levels or organization were detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Depletion of mDia2 also caused accumulation of pigment granules, consistent with a role of mDia2 either in membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b031">31</xref>] or transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b032">32</xref>].</p>
        <p>The effects of mDia2 siRNA on lamellipodia and filopodia were specific because they could be rescued by RNAi-resistant full-length green fluorescent protein (GFP)-mDia2 (FL-mDia2*) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g001">Figures 1</xref>E, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g002">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg002">S2</xref>). Although GFP-FL-mDia2* localized mainly cytoplasmically, as reported earlier for wild-type FL-mDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b027">27</xref>], it was sometimes enriched in lamellipodia and at filopodial tips, especially in rescued cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), apparently because of less competition from the endogenous untagged protein. As additional specificity tests, we attempted to rescue the mDia2 knockdown phenotype by expressing proteins with potentially redundant activities, a closely related formin GFP-mDia1 and GFP-VASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b034">34</xref>]. However, neither of them produced a significant rescue, suggesting nonredundant functions with mDia2. To test a possibility that inhibition of lamellipodia involved down-regulation of Rac1, we expressed constitutively active Rac1V12 in mDia2 knockdown cells. Although Rac1V12 increased lamellipodia and filopodia in control cells, it did not restore their amount in mDia2 siRNA-treated cells. Interestingly, FH1FH2-mDia2 also did not rescue the phenotype (see below).</p>
        <p>Platinum replica EM was used to reveal specific defects caused by mDia2 depletion in the architecture of the protrusive organelles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Normal lamellipodia in B16F1 cells are filled with branched actin network consisting of combination of long and short filaments, whereas filopodia contain tight bundles of long actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">3</xref>B) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>]. In mDia2-knockdown cells, actin filament organization at the cell periphery was severely disrupted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">Figure 3</xref>C–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">3</xref>G). Consistent with light microscopic data, only a small fraction (8.7 ± 8.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 5) of cell perimeter in these cells contained dendritic actin network characteristic for lamellipodia. The rare remaining lamellipodia contained patches of dense network poorly connected to the rest of the cytoskeleton and formed by short branching actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">Figure 3</xref>F), while long filaments were not obvious there. This morphology suggests that Arp2/3-dependent actin nucleation likely remains functional [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b004">4</xref>], but anticapping protection and/or linear filament elongation was compromised [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b033">33</xref>]. Remaining filopodia, instead of a regular bundle of long, parallel filaments, contained less-uniform actin arrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">Figure 3</xref>G).</p>

        <title>Effects of Constitutively Active ΔGBD-mDia2 on Lamellipodia Structure and Dynamics</title>
        <p>In addition to loss-of-function analysis by RNAi, we also tested mDia2 functions by a gain-of-function approach using a constitutively active mDia2 mutant (ΔGBD-mDia2) lacking GBD and a part of DID [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>]. We reasoned that any unusual features induced by this mutant would point to specific molecular mechanisms of mDia2 involvement in cell protrusion.</p>
        <p>In B16F1 cells, GFP-ΔGBD-mDia2 localized to a subset of lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g004">Figures 4</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g005">5</xref>) and to filopodial tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>) with relatively low cytoplasmic fluorescence. This localization is consistent with the functional importance of the endogenous protein for these protrusions. Compared to endogenous mDia2, ΔGBD-mDia2 had narrower distribution at the very edge of lamellipodia. ΔGBD-mDia2–positive lamellipodia contained normal lamellipodial components, Arp2/3 complex, capping protein, VASP, and Abi1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g004">Figure 4</xref>A). However, at edges with high levels of ΔGBD-mDia2, capping protein was not detected, possibly reflecting anticapping activity of formins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b007">7</xref>]. Conversely, the pattern of ΔGBD-mDia2 at the leading edge frequently correlated with that of Abi1. However, Abi1 only partially colocalized with the endogenous mDia2, which formed a broader band at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). An unusual feature of ΔGBD-mDia2–positive lamellipodia was the presence of fascin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), which is normally not detected in B16F1 lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>]. Analysis of dynamic behavior of ΔGBD-positive lamellipodia revealed that their protrusion is remarkably persistent, whereas the rate of protrusion is slower than that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>

        <p>Correlative EM analysis ΔGBD-mDia2–positive lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g005">Figure 5</xref>) revealed that they had unusual abundance of long, parallel, unbranched actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g005">Figure 5</xref>D). Quantitative analysis of filament orientation revealed a narrow distribution of angles in ΔGBD-mDia2–positive lamellipodia compared to very broad distribution in control lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g005">Figure 5</xref>E–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g005">5</xref>G). Enrichment in long filaments after expression of constitutively active mDia2 complements the siRNA data showing apparent filament shortening after mDia2 depletion. These long filaments frequently displayed apparently free (not engaged in branch formation) proximal ends (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg004">Figure S4</xref>), which are very rare in normal lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b035">35</xref>], suggesting that active mDia2 might nucleate these linear filaments within lamellipodia. However, ΔGBD-mDia2–positive lamellipodia also contained some branched filaments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg004">Figure S4</xref>) and Arp2/3 complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g004">Figure 4</xref>A), suggesting that the lamellipodial network represents a mixture of linear and dendritic actin filament arrays. The atypical abundance of long, parallel filaments induced by constitutively active mDia2 might cause the peculiar recruitment of fascin.</p>
        <p>Thus, the gain-of-function approach showed that the constitutively active mDia2 mutant was recruited to lamellipodia and induced structural reorganization of the lamellipodial actin network by promoting formation of long filaments, as well as increased the persistence of lamellipodia protrusion. These results corroborate the findings of mDia2 knockdown experiments, which suggested mDia2 function in lamellipodia.</p>

        <title>Constitutively Active ΔGBD-mDia2 Induces Club-Like Filopodia</title>
        <p>Our findings of mDia2 involvement in lamellipodia formation apparently contrast with previous reports showing a role of mDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>] and <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> dDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b018">18</xref>] in filopodia. However, we found that the lamellipodial localization of GFP-ΔGBD-mDia2 was transient and especially evident at early stages of transfection. At later times, ΔGBD-mDia2 induced abundant filopodia with ΔGBD-mDia2 localizing at their tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv003">Video S3</xref>), consistent with other reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b018">18</xref>].

Fascin was concentrated predominantly in thick distal parts of filopodia. VASP colocalized with ΔGBD-mDia2 at filopodial tips in some cells, but high levels of ΔGBD-mDia2 seemed to displace VASP from tips to the filopodial shafts, possibly reflecting VASP's bundling ability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b038">38</xref>]. Abi1, which usually localizes to lamellipodial edges and filopodial tips [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b039">39</xref>], was faint at the filopodial tips enriched in ΔGBD-mDia2.</p>
        <p>Filopodia induced by ΔGBD-mDia2 frequently were very long, flexible, not attached to the substratum, and occasionally appeared on the dorsal cell surface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg005">Figure S5</xref>), resembling filopodia induced by a small GTPase Rif through mDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>]. During protrusion, ΔGBD-mDia2 remained at filopodial tips (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>D), consistent with the formins' ability to ride on elongating barbed ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b025">25</xref>]. The thick termini of filopodia moved forward, remaining approximately of the same length, suggesting actin filament treadmilling within these domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>D). Consistent with this idea, GFP-actin speckles moved retrogradely in ΔGBD-mDia2–induced filopodia and disappeared upon or after exiting the thick terminal domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>F–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">6</xref>H; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv004">Video S4</xref>). The protrusion rate of ΔGBD-mDia2–positive filopodia was slightly lower than that of control filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>E).</p>
        <p>By EM analysis, ΔGBD-mDia2–mediated filopodia contained actin bundles, which looked normal in their distal domains, but displayed informative differences in the proximal regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In normal filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), filaments in their roots commonly splay apart, reflecting the convergent elongation process of filopodia formation, and frequently terminate at branch points in the surrounding network [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>]. Conversely, many ΔGBD-mDia2–induced filopodia displayed tapered bundles at the rear, with numerous unbound proximal ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g007">7</xref>B), which are predicted to be pointed ends based on their orientation. Since actin network is assembled predominantly at the leading edge and then treadmills backwards, undergoing little rearrangement except depolymerization, the structural organization of the network to some extent portrays its immediate history [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b040">40</xref>]. Therefore, tapered roots of ΔGBD-mDia2–induced bundles suggest that these filaments were nucleated by ΔGBD-mDia2 and/or they were nucleated by Arp2/3 complex, but then debranched and depolymerized from the pointed ends. Notably, some ΔGBD-mDia2–induced filopodia contained bundles with splayed roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g007">Figure 7</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g007">7</xref>C), and some filaments in these filopodia originated from a branch point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g007">Figure 7</xref>C), suggesting that Arp2/3-nucleated filaments might contribute to bundle formation.</p>

        <p>Together, these results confirm the previous observations that mDia2 plays a role in filopodia generation, and localizes to filopodial tips. We extend prior observations by showing that although filopodia induced by active mDia2 share many features with normal filopodia, they also display an abnormal abundance of prematurely terminated filaments in the proximal parts of filopodial bundles.</p>

        <title>ΔGBD-mDia2–Induced Filopodia Are Formed from Lamellipodia</title>
        <p>We next asked whether mDia2 roles in lamellipodia and filopodia are related. Kinetic analysis of filopodia initiation showed that virtually all ΔGBD-mDia2–induced filopodia formed from ΔGBD-mDia2–positive lamellipodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv005">Video S5</xref>). In this pathway, a line of ΔGBD-mDia2 fluorescence at the lamellipodial leading edge gradually condensed into dots at the tips of newly formed filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>A), similar to VASP behavior in naturally occurring filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>]. Full-length GFP-mDia2 displayed similar behavior (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv006">Video S6</xref>), although high cytoplasmic fluorescence of this autoinhibited protein significantly decreased contrast of the leading edge signal. Newly formed ΔGBD-mDia2–induced filopodia might subsequently fuse with each other, generating larger filopodia and gradually acquiring a club-like shape (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). Some filopodia subsequently translocated to the dorsal surface of lamella; the majority of dorsal protrusions were formed by this pathway (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

Since ΔGBD-mDia2 is dynamically associated with the advancing cell edge, its localization marks the position of the cell edge at the respective time point. Therefore, only structures behind the color line existed at that time, and structures in front of the line were formed later. In (H), ΔGBD-mDia2 fluorescence at the 0:00 time point (yellow) projects to a region with unbundled filaments behind it; subsequently, filaments begin to converge, and a partially condensed fluorescence (red, 0:50) projects to partially bundled filaments; by the end of the sequence, when GFP condenses into a dot (green), a bundle is formed. In (I), line of ΔGBD-mDia2 in the first frame (yellow) projects to a region with sparse actin filaments, possibly due to network disassembly (see text).</p>

        <p>To understand the mechanism of lamellipodia-to-filopodia transition, we performed correlative EM for cells with known live history (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>B–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>J; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv007">Video S7</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sv009">S9</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref> shows two examples of filopodia formed during live imaging. One filopodium began to form approximately 30 s before fixation, as judged from condensation of GFP fluorescence at the leading edge (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>E). In the corresponding EM image, this filopodium consisted of long filaments originating from a broad area at the base and coming together at the tip (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>H). Projection of the life history onto EM image revealed that filaments converged in parallel with condensation of GFP fluorescence (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref> legend for detail), similar to normal filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>].</p>
        <p>The second example (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>G) shows a slightly older filopodium formed from a line of GFP fluorescence visible in the first frame of the movie. By approximately 50–60 s before fixation, the line gradually condensed into a dot, suggesting that the filopodial bundle was formed by that time. Subsequently, the dot moved approximately 1 μm as the filopodium protruded. In the corresponding EM image (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>I and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>J), the filopodium contained a spindle-shaped actin bundle that tapered both toward the front (perhaps because of tighter filament bundling) and toward the rear due to gradual termination of filaments. The projection of the fluorescence history of this filopodium onto the EM image showed a sparse actin network proximally from the position of the leading edge at time 0:00 (yellow line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>I). Such morphology might be explained by nucleation of a filament bundle by ΔGBD-mDia2 at a local spot in actin-poor region, followed by elongation of the bundle, as proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b022">22</xref>]. However, in this case, we would see an emergence and gradual advance of a dot of ΔGBD-mDia2 fluorescence in the time-lapse movie instead of a fluorescent line converging into a dot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>F). As we showed above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g005">Figure 5</xref>), the linear distribution of ΔGBD-mDia2, as it appears at the 0:00 time point for this filopodium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>F and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">8</xref>I), always associates with dense lamellipodial network of long, aligned filaments. Thus, the tapered shape of the filopodium root among sparse actin network is more consistent with the alternative possibility that actin depolymerization eliminated much actin from the filopodium rear in parallel with the filopodium protrusion at the front.</p>
        <p>Correlative analysis of six cells imaged live for 90–120 s showed that all nascent filopodia (31 total) emerged by condensation of linear lamellipodial fluorescence. At EM level, 14 out of these 31 filopodia were similar in structure to the first example in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>; five were similar to the second example; nine displayed an intermediate organization, having a fully formed distal bundle with well-preserved splayed filaments in the root; they looked similar to the filopodium marked by an asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g007">Figure 7</xref>; and one filopodium contained converging filaments like in the first example, but showed significant actin depletion at the root, like in the second example.</p>
        <p>These data, collectively, indicate that induction of filopodia by active mDia2 temporally and mechanistically follows the mDia2 appearance in lamellipodia. Long, unbranched actin filaments induced by ΔGBD-mDia2 in the lamellipodial network seem to play an important role in this process by expressing a high tendency to converge into bundles, and leading to filopodia induction in association with pre-existing lamellipodia.</p>

Truncation of the FH2 domain from the C-terminus or its complete removal from FH1FH2-mDia2 abrogated filopodia-inducing ability and localization to filopodia tips (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, although mDia2 nucleating and barbed end-binding module FH1FH2 is required for and capable of tip localization and weak filopodia induction, additional motifs of ΔGBD-mDia2 are needed for robust mDia2 targeting to the leading edge and efficient induction of filopodia. This is strengthened by the observation that an analogous mutant of mDia1 localized differently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

We first examined filopodia in Abi1KD cells quantitatively and by EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">Figures 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg007">S7</xref>). Control HeLa cells formed a mixture of filopodia and small lamellipodia or ruffles, whereas Abi1KD cells lacked ruffles and displayed long filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">Figures 11</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg007">S7</xref>). Since filopodial bundles are normally partially embedded into a lamellipodial actin network, inhibition of lamellipodia likely exposed these internal parts, leading to apparent elongation of filopodia. Despite having longer filopodia, Abi1KD cells had fewer filopodia per cell than control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">Figure 11</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">11</xref>D), indicating that Abi1 and/or its interacting partners, such as other members of WANP complex, may play a role in filopodia formation. Interestingly, despite almost complete absence of a lamellipodial dendritic network, EM analysis revealed multiple branched filaments in the roots of filopodia in Abi1KD cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), suggesting a preferential formation of filopodia at the sites with residual activity of Arp2/3 complex.</p>

        <p>We tested next whether the human ortholog of mDia2 (DIAPH3) plays a role in filopodia formation in control and Abi1KD HeLa cells using both loss-of-function and gain-of-function approaches. Similar to B16F1 cells, DIAPH3 siRNA significantly depleted DIAPH3 expression and impaired cell spreading and protrusive activity in control and Abi1KD HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">Figure 11</xref>). DIAPH3 depletion decreased filopodia length and number in Abi1KD HeLa cells, and inhibited ruffles and filopodia in control HeLa cells, confirming in the human system that DIAPH3 is an important part of the mechanism of lamellipodia and filopodia formation.</p>
        <p>Similar to B16F1 cells, expression of ΔGBD-mDia2 in HeLa cells induced long, robust filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g012">Figure 12</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g012">12</xref>C). Interestingly, the number of filopodia decreased after ΔGBD-mDia2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">Figure 11</xref>B), which might occur because of extensive fusion of neighboring filopodia, a well-known feature of filopodia dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b040">40</xref>]. In contrast, Abi1KD cells formed slender and significantly shorter filopodia in the same conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">Figure 11</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g011">11</xref>C), whereas their number slightly, but significantly, decreased compared to ΔGBD-mDia2–expressing control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g012">Figure 12</xref>B). Furthermore, ΔGBD-mDia2 in Abi1KD cells localized cytoplasmically, with only faint signal at the filopodial tips, which was more sensitive to detergent extraction than in control HeLa cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g012">Figure 12</xref>D). Thus, the ΔGBD-mDia2 in Abi1KD cells, similar to FH1FH2-mDia2 in B16F1 cells, was deficient in robust targeting to the edge and efficient induction of filopodia, suggesting a role of Abi1 in ΔGBD-mDia2 targeting.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, by combination of loss-of-function (RNAi) and gain-of-function (constitutively active mutant) approaches, we investigated a role of mDia2 formin in the actin-based protrusion in motile cells. Although our original goal was to characterize the mechanism of mDia2-dependent filopodia formation, we unexpectedly found that mDia2 is important for lamellipodial protrusion and induces filopodia in association with lamellipodia. Based on our data, we propose a model suggesting that mDia2 is recruited to the lamellipodial leading edge in an Abi1-dependent manner, where it nucleates new filaments and/or maintains filament elongation by protecting barbed ends from capping. In the course of elongation, lamellipodial filaments converge and become bundled, generating filopodia.</p>
      <sec id="s3a">
        <title>Targeting of mDia2 to the Leading Edge</title>
        <p>We found that mDia2 can be recruited to the leading edge by at least two mechanisms, one of which relies on binding of the mDia2 FH1FH2 module to barbed ends and another on N-terminal mDia2 sequences interacting with Abi1. The FH1FH2 module contributes to localization to filopodial tips by binding to and riding on elongating barbed ends, which accumulate at the membrane after encountering the boundary conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b025">25</xref>]. However, FH1FH2-mDia2 was not sufficient to fully restore formin's functions in mDia2-interferred cells and to efficiently induce filopodia, likely reflecting inferior membrane targeting of FH1FH2-mDia2 as compared to ΔGBD-mDia2 or full-length mDia2. In the second mechanism, binding of N-terminal regulatory sequences of mDia2 to Abi1 provides a potential additional surface for mDia2 proper localization to leading edges. This is also consistent with the observation that similar regions were previously shown to control targeting of other formins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b042">42</xref>]. It is also possible that Abi1 not only recruits mDia2 to the membrane, but also participates in its regulation, but we currently do not have data to evaluate this idea.</p>
        <p>The majority of Abi1 has been shown to be engaged in complex with WAVE, Nap1, and PIR121 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b048">48</xref>]. However, we did not detect interaction of mDia2 with WAVE, Nap1, or PIR121, indicating that mDia2 and Abi1 may form a distinct macromolecular signaling unit with respect to the WANP complex. Accordingly, only a minor fraction of Abi1 interacted with mDia2 in coimmunoprecipitation experiments. The ability of Abi1 to act as a scaffolding molecule driving the formation of additional signaling units, such as those containing N-WASP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b014">14</xref>] or Eps8 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b050">50</xref>], has been previously observed. The Abi1-mDia2 assembly adds to the versatility of Abi1, which by entering distinct complexes is capable of controlling diverse processes and/or coordinating related activities, such as the formation of lamellipodia and filopodia protrusions reported here. The precise regulatory events governing the relationship between these units remain to be defined and represent one of the challenges for future investigation.</p>

        <title>Lamellipodia Protrusion</title>
        <p>Specific targeting of proteins is a common way to confine the protein activity to a certain area. Therefore, mDia2 targeting to lamellipodia and filopodia points to an idea that mDia2 may function there. Although mDia2′s role in filopodia is expected [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>], the lamellipodial function contrasts with the current belief that formins and Arp2/3 complex are responsible for different actin structures. Two complementary sets of data in our study suggest that mDia2 is an important player in lamellipodial protrusion. First, mDia2 inhibition by siRNA severely impaired lamellipodia and reduced long filaments in the remaining lamellipodial network. Second, constitutively active ΔGBD-mDia2, conversely, induced numerous long filaments in lamellipodia. Similar complementarity was observed regarding the persistence of lamellipodia protrusion, which decreased after mDia2 depletion and increased after expression of the constitutively active mutant. The lamellipodial function seems specific for mDia2; other formins, which were supposedly present in knockdown cells, were not sufficient. Moreover, overexpression of a related formin, mDia1, did not rescue lamellipodia formation. Interestingly, 3T3 cells lacking mDia2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b015">15</xref>] still make lamellipodia. We found, however, that 3T3 cells express another related formin, mDia3, which is absent in B16F1 cells (unpublished data), raising a possibility that mDia3 may be partially redundant with mDia2.</p>
        <p>Biochemical activities of mDia2 suggest that it may contribute to lamellipodia formation through nucleation and/or anticapping protection of actin filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g013">Figure 13</xref>A). Our ΔGBD-mDia2 data are consistent with both possibilities. Thus, high frequency of linear filaments with unlinked “pointed” ends, and fast depolymerization of actin filaments from the rear (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>) are consistent with formin, but not with Arp2/3-mediated nucleation. The anticapping activity of mDia2 is also employed during lamellipodia formation. Indeed, the dissociation of mDia2 from barbed ends is very slow, at least in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b051">51</xref>], suggesting that it would protect the nucleated filaments from capping for long time. In addition to this consideration, we found that (1) capping protein was diminished in ΔGBD-mDia2–rich lamellipodial regions; (2) ΔGBD-mDia2 enrichment at the leading edge correlated with the presence of long actin filaments in EM images; and (3) mDia2-depleted lamellipodia contained very short branched filaments. The latter observation also suggests that mDia2 may protect from capping branched filaments, apparently nucleated by Arp2/3 complex. The ability of ΔGBD-mDia2 to displace VASP from barbed ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figures 6</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050317-sg006">S6</xref>) is also consistent with this idea. Notably, long unbranched filaments may also form in the course of debranching of Arp2/3-nucleated and mDia2-protected filaments without nucleation by ΔGBD-mDia2. Importantly, lamellipodial filaments nucleated and/or protected from capping by mDia2 may be responsible for the presence of long filaments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b052">52</xref>], and two kinetically distinct actin subpopulations in lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b053">53</xref>] noted earlier.</p>

            <title>Models for mDia2 Functions in Lamellipodia and Filopodia</title>
            <p>(A) In lamellipodia, mDia2 is targeted to the membrane in an Abi1-dependent manner, where it may nucleate “mother” filaments, which serve as a base for Arp2/3-dependent nucleation, and/or protect from capping elongating barbed ends, which are nucleated by mDia2 itself or by Arp2/3 complex. Other barbed ends may be protected from capping by VASP. Unnecessary barbed ends are capped by capping protein.</p>
            <p>(B) During formation of filopodia, lamellipodial filaments associated at their barbed ends with mDia2 or VASP converge during elongation and become cross-linked, thus forming filopodial bundles.</p>

        <p>It is unclear why mDia2 has such a significant role in lamellipodial protrusion, considering the well-established involvement of Arp2/3 complex in this process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b001">1</xref>]. One possibility is that mDia2-nucleated filaments may help to initiate lamellipodia by nucleating “mother” filaments, which are required to Arp2/3-dependent nucleation. Additionally, mDia2 may be a better “device,” compared to VASP, for example, to maintain fast and processive barbed-end growth and thus to ensure persistent protrusion. Long filaments induced by mDia2 in lamellipodia may also provide better connection of lamellipodia to the rest of the cytoskeleton. In any case, our results suggest that two different actin nucleators, Arp2/3 complex and mDia2, jointly contribute to generation of lamellipodia.</p>

        <title>Filopodia Protrusion</title>
        <p>A role of mDia2 in filopodia formation in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>] and of dDia2 in <italic>Dictyostelium</italic> was reported [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b018">18</xref>], but the mechanism of formin-mediated filopodia induction has not been fully investigated. The previous model suggested that mDia2 initiates filopodia from a focal spot not necessarily associated with lamellipodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b022">22</xref>], thus putting this mechanism at an apparent conflict with the convergent elongation model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>]. In this study, we provide evidence to solve this contradiction. By investigating the spatiokinetic mechanism underlying filopodia initiation by active mDia2, we found that, in our experimental system, lamellipodia are a highly preferred site for filopodia initiation, although subsequently, filopodia may lose association with lamellipodia, for example, by moving to the dorsal surface. However, we cannot exclude a possibility that in other experimental systems or conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b054">54</xref>], formins may nucleate actin bundles from focal spots without association with lamellipodia or other dendritic arrays.</p>
        <p>The overall process of filopodia initiation by mDia2 was very similar to that described for naturally emerging filopodia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>] and involved gradual convergence of lamellipodial filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g013">Figure 13</xref>B). These results show that the convergent elongation mechanism is applicable to formin-induced filaments. Importantly, FL-mDia2 displayed similar convergence of lamellipodial fluorescence into dots, as ΔGBD-mDia2, suggesting that convergence behavior is not entirely due to excessive activity of ΔGBD-mDia2. Initiation of filopodia by ΔGBD-mDia2 was very efficient, whereas the lamellipodia from which the filopodia arose were quite transient. This can be explained by the favorable combination of biochemical activities in mDia2, which may drive the efficient transformation of lamellipodia into filopodia, not only by nucleating and elongating filaments, but also by cross-linking them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b055">55</xref>] and thus promoting the initiation of filament convergence. A downside of the excessive activity of ΔGBD-mDia2 is that filopodia acquired an abnormal club-like shape, in which the majority of filaments did not extend all the way to the cell body. Based on the known mechanism of formin-mediated nucleation and our data obtained by correlative light microscopy and EM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g008">Figure 8</xref>), and by observing GFP-actin dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050317-g006">Figure 6</xref>), we interpret this phenotype as fast depolymerization of mDia2-nucleated filaments from unprotected pointed ends.</p>
        <p>Because of formation of atypical club-like filopodia, we suppose that ΔGBD-mDia2 does not fully recapitulate the physiological pathway of filopodia formation. Based on the structural data, we previously proposed that Arp2/3 complex nucleates filaments for filopodial bundles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>]. We have confirmed this idea by a functional siRNA approach showing that Arp2/3 depletion inhibits filopodia (F. Korobova and T. Svitkina, unpublished data. These two sets of data together suggest that Arp2/3 complex and mDia2 may jointly contribute to filopodia formation. In such case, one would expect that the balanced activities of these two nucleators are important for the normal filopodial shape and functions, whereas any imbalance will likely lead to aberrant filopodia. Club-like filopodia induced by constitutive activation of mDia2 may serve as an illustration for this contention. Abnormal filopodia were also formed after depletion of mDia2. However, the relative roles of formins and Arp2/3 complex in filopodia await further investigation.</p>
        <p>In summary, we have shown that mDia2 plays a role in formation of both lamellipodia and filopodia. However, these roles are not separate, but related to each other; mDia2 first participates in lamellipodia formation and then induces filopodia from lamellipodia. A most likely scenario is that mDia2-nucleated actin filaments and/or filaments nucleated by Arp2/3 complex and protected by mDia2 are initially dispersed in the lamellipodial network, and subsequently, they elongate persistently and gradually converge, eventually segregating themselves into filopodial bundles. Although regulation of actin dynamics is the most straightforward way to explain how mDia2 may function in protrusion, we cannot exclude a possibility that other mDia2 activities, such as regulation of microtubule dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b056">56</xref>], membrane trafficking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b031">31</xref>], surface blebbing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b057">57</xref>], or transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b032">32</xref>], also contribute to generation of observed phenotypes.</p>

        <p>B16F1 mouse melanoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b019">19</xref>], HeLa cells, and Abi1KD HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b011">11</xref>] were cultured as described. Transient transfection of DNA and siRNA was performed using Fugene6 or Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen), respectively. Lipofectamine 2000 was used for cotransfection of siRNA and DNA. Light microscopy was performed using Eclipse TE2000-U inverted microscope (Nikon) equipped with Planapo 100 × 1.3 NA or 20 × 0.75 objectives and Cascade 512B CCD camera (Photometrics) driven by Metamorph imaging software (Molecular Devices). For live-cell imaging, cells were transferred into phenol red–free L-15 or DMEM medium (Gibco) supplemented with 10% FBS and kept on the microscope stage at 35 °C during observation.</p>
        <p>Samples for platinum replica EM were processed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b060">60</xref>] and analyzed using JEOL 1200EX transmission electron microscope operated at 120 kV. Cells expressing ΔGBD-mDia2 for EM analysis were identified by correlative EM or isolated by FACS. Immunostaining was performed after cell extraction for 5 min at room temperature with 1% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer (100 mM PIPES-KOH [pH 6.9] 1 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 mM EGTA) containing 2% polyetheleneglycol (MW 35,000) and 2 μM phalloidin, followed by fixation with 0.2% glutaraldehyde and quenching with NaBH<sub>4</sub>. Texas red phalloidin (0.033 μM; Molecular Probes) was used for actin staining. Fascin staining was performed after methanol fixation of extracted cells. For staining with VASP or mDia2 antibody, cells were extracted/fixed by a mixture of 0.25% glutaraldehyde and 0.5% Triton X-100 in PEM buffer for 20 min. To evaluate cytoskeletal association of mDia2 constructs, cells were first imaged live, then culture medium was replaced by the extraction solution, the same as used for immunostaining, and another image was acquired approximately 2 min later.</p>

        <title>Image analysis and statistics.</title>
        <p>All morphometric measurements were done using MetaMorph Imaging software (Molecular Devices) unless stated otherwise. Graphs and statistical analysis were done using SigmaPlot software. Statistical significance was determined by the Student <italic>t</italic>-test.</p>
        <p>Quantification of lamellipodia and filopodia were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b020">20</xref>]. Briefly, MetaMorph line function was used to trace and measure the whole-cell perimeter and the cell perimeter with adjacent lamellipodia (an actin-rich fringe with fluorescence intensity gradually declining with the distance from the edge) on fixed phalloidin-stained cells. The fraction of the cell perimeter occupied by lamellipodia was used as a parameter for quantification. For quantification purposes, filopodia were defined as actin-rich finger-like protrusions crossing the cell edge and having fluorescence intensity at least 1.2-fold above background. Quantification was performed using a blind experimental procedure by an uninformed observer on coded samples. Control and experimentally treated cells in mixed populations were measured using phalloidin channel only. After numbers were assigned to individual cells, the phalloidin images were combined with other channels showing siRNA or a rescue construct, the identity of samples was decoded, and numbers were entered into respective columns of a spread sheet for statistical analysis.</p>
        <p>For spreading assays, the projected cell area was measured 2 h after plating. For cell migration analysis, cells transfected with mDia2 siRNA (Cy3 labeled) or control siRNA (nonlabeled) were co-cultured in 35-mm dishes and imaged 36–48 h post-transfection (4 h after plating). Phase contrast time-lapse sequences were acquired with 5-min intervals for 6 h using a 4× objective. Fluorescence images to identify siRNA-transfected cells were acquired immediately before and after each movie. Cell positions were recorded every ten frames using Track Object tool in MetaMorph. An average instantaneous rate was calculated for each cell, and then the mean speed of cell migration was determined for each group of cells. To analyze the lamellipodial dynamics, time-lapse sequences were acquired with 3-s intervals for 10 min using a 100× objective. Kymographs were generated along straight lines drawn in the direction of protrusion. Rates of lamellipodia protrusion were determined based on slopes produced by advancing leading edges. Persistence corresponds to time intervals during which individual protrusions occurred. The relative mDia2 levels in control and mDia2 siRNA-treated cells were determined by immunostaining after fixation with paraformaldehyde and permeabilization with Triton X-100. Integrated fluorescence intensity of mDia2 staining for each cell after background subtraction was plotted against the fraction of the cell edge occupied by lamellipodia.</p>
        <p>To determine the degree of mutual orientation of actin filaments in lamellipodia of control and ΔGBD-mDia2-expressing cells, square EM images of the lamellipodial network ranging from 0.13 to 0.53 μm<sup>2</sup> were thresholded using Adobe Photoshop to maximally highlight the linear features. Matlab software was used to generate two-dimensional Fast Fourier Transform from these images, collect radial intensity line scans, plot intensity as a function of angle, and fit a Gaussian curve to the major peak. Standard deviation of the Gaussian fit was used as a parameter of the orientational order. Matlab code for this analysis was provided by J. Winer, Q. Wen, and P. Janmey (University of Pennsylvania).</p>

        <p>For immunoblotting, cells were lysed in buffer containing 10 mM Tris (pH 7.5), 150 mM NaCl, 1% Triton X-100, 10% glycerol, and a protease inhibitor tablet (Roche). Protein concentration of the lysates was determined using Bio-Rad protein assay kit (Bio-Rad). Proteins were separated by SDS-PAGE (7.5%–10% polyacrylamide). Tubulin was used as loading control. Immunoblots were developed using ECF Western blotting kit (Amersham).</p>
        <p>Coimmunoprecipitation and in vitro binding assays were performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b059">59</xref>]. For coimmunoprecipitation, total cellular lysates (1 mg) of 293T cells cotransfected with GFP-FL-mDia2 and Abi1, alone or in combination, were immunoprecipitated with an Abi1 antibody. For GST pull-down assay, total cellular lysates (1 mg) of 293T cells transfected with GFP-mDia2 were incubated with 1.5 μM of immobilized GST-Abi1, GST-Abi1-SH3 (aa 330–480), or GST, as a control. Lysates (20 μg) and bound proteins in both cases were resolved by SDS-PAGE and immunoblotted. GFP antibody was used to detect GFP-mDia2 constructs.</p>

          <p>Arrowhead points to the formation of a club-like filopodium by fusion of several smaller filopodia. Discontinuous linear fluorescence of ΔGBD-mDia2 (0:00 time point) gradually converges (0:30) and produces two distinct dots at the tips of small filopodia (1:00). Another filopodium is seen in-between with barely detectable GFP signal. The right filopodium moves laterally (1:00 through 2:00), and all three filopodia fuse (2:30), producing a single filopodium that protrudes extensively and acquires a club-like shape.</p>
          <p>Arrow points to the formation of a dorsal protrusion from a lateral filopodium. Linear fluorescence at the lower right side of the lamellipodium (0:30) gradually produces two filopodia by the 2:00 time point, which fuse (3:00), and the resulting structure translocates to the dorsal surface of lamella.</p>

          <title>Phenotypes Induced by Expression of ΔN2-mDia1 or Inactive mDia2 Mutants in B16F1 Cells and by ΔGBD-mDia2 in Ena/VASP-Deficient Cells</title>
          <p>(A) Phenotype induced by expression of GFP-ΔN2-mDia1. GFP fluorescence of GFP-ΔN2-mDia1 (left) and F-actin enrichment (middle) are found throughout the cytoplasm of a bipolar cell as previously described in other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050317-b043">43</xref>]. Only very short, finger-like protrusions with slight enrichment of ΔN2-mDia1 at the tips could be observed at the cell edges abutted by actin bundles (right). No filopodial-like protrusions reaching significant length were observed. Arrow in the merged panel points to a region enlarged at right.</p>
          <p>(B) Expression of GFP-tagged mDia2 constructs in B16F1 cells. FH1 domain, residues 519–600 (FH1), and truncated FH1FH2, residues 519–909 (trFH1FH2) have cytoplasmic distribution and do not induce filopodia. Scale bars indicate 10 μm.</p>
          <p>(C) Filopodia induction does not depend on Ena/VASP proteins. Expression of GFP-ΔGBD-mDia2 (a and b) or mRFP1-ΔGBD-mDia2 (c) in Ena/VASP-deficient MV<sup>D7</sup> cells (a) or MV<sup>D7</sup> cells stably re-expressing GFP-Mena (MVD7-EM) (b) or transiently re-expressing GFP-VASP (c). (a and b) ΔGBD-mDia2 localizes to the membrane and induces filopodia equally well in MV<sup>D7</sup> and MV<sup>D7</sup>-EM cells. (c) In cells expressing relatively low levels of ΔGBD-mDia2 (top row), re-expressed VASP is still occasionally present at filopodial tips (arrow), but is displaced to more proximal regions of filopodia (arrowheads) in highly expressing cells (bottom row). Scale bars indicate 5 μm in (a and b) and 10 μm in (c).</p>
