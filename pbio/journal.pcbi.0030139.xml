Simulating the model on a computer, we consistently observe the “Big Bang” scenario whereby exponential population growth ensues as soon as favorable sequence–structure combinations (precursors of stable proteins) are discovered. Upon that, random diversity of the structural space abruptly collapses into a small set of preferred proteins. We observe that protein folds remain stable and abundant in the population at timescales much greater than mutation or organism lifetime, and the distribution of the lifetimes of dominant folds in a population approximately follows a power law. The separation of evolutionary timescales between discovery of new folds and generation of new sequences gives rise to emergence of protein families and superfamilies whose sizes are power-law distributed, closely matching the same distributions for real proteins. On the population level we observe emergence of species—subpopulations that carry similar genomes. Further, we present a simple theory that relates stability of evolving proteins to the sizes of emerging genomes. Together, these results provide a microscopic first-principles picture of how first-gene families developed in the course of early evolution.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>Here, we address the question of how Darwinian evolution of organisms determines molecular evolution of their proteins and genomes. We developed a microscopic ab initio model of early biological evolution where the fitness (essentially lifetime) of an organism is explicitly related to the evolving sequences of its proteins. The main assumption of the model is that the death rate of an organism is determined by the stability of the least stable of their proteins. A lattice model is used to calculate stability of all proteins in a genome from their amino acid sequence. The simulation of the model starts from 100 identical organisms, each carrying the same random gene, and proceeds via random mutations, gene duplication, organism births via replication, and organism deaths. We find that exponential population growth is possible only after the discovery of a very small number of specific advantageous protein structures. The number of genes in the evolving organisms depends on the mutation rate, demonstrating the intricate relationship between the genome sizes and protein stability requirements. Further, the model explains the observed power-law distributions of protein family and superfamily sizes, as well as the scale-free character of protein structural similarity graphs. Together, these results and their analysis suggest a plausible comprehensive scenario of emergence of the protein universe in early biological evolution.</p></sec></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>The authors received financial support from the US National Institutes of Health for this study.</funding-statement></funding-group><counts><page-count count="15"/></counts><!--===== Restructure custom-meta-wrap to custom-meta-group =====--><custom-meta-group><custom-meta><meta-name>citation</meta-name><meta-value>Zeldovich KB, Chen P, Shakhnovich BE, Shakhnovich EI (2007) A first-principles model of early evolution: Emergence of gene families, species, and preferred protein folds.

While it is widely accepted that gene families and the protein universe emerged during the course of molecular evolution through selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b009">9</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b011">11</xref>], there is a substantial gap in our conceptual and mechanistic understanding of how molecular evolution occurred or what the determinants of selection are. Indeed, evolution, as we understand it, proceeds at the level of organisms and populations but not at the level of genomes. Evolutionary selection at the molecular level occurs due to a relation between genotype and phenotype, although a detailed understanding of this relation and its consequences for molecular evolution remains elusive.</p><p>A number of phenomenological models (e.g., Eigen's quasispecies model) were developed where fitness of an organism was related to the sequence of its genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b014">14</xref>]. A standard definition of fitness in phenomenological models is the growth rate of a population that is higher for the more fit species. However, the relationship between genotype and phenotype in quasispecies (QS) and similar population genetics (PG) models is purely phenomenological. For example, in single-fitness peak models, one specific genotype is postulated to be most fit, while deviations from it confer selective disadvantage. Despite providing several important insights, these types of approaches lack a fundamental microscopic connection between fitness and quantities of proteins that are both easily justifiable on biological grounds and measureable (e.g., structure/stability, function, or regulation). Therefore, such models cannot accurately describe molecular evolution of proteins.</p><p>On the other hand, a number of models were proposed that focus on emergence and evolution of sequences of model proteins and RNA under direct pressure on their molecular properties such as stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b015">15</xref>−<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b018">18</xref>], folding kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b020">20</xref>], and mutational robustness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b021">21</xref>]. Schuster and Stadler [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b022">22</xref>] first studied the evolution of biological macromolecules, RNA, in the context of population dynamics. Later, in a series of papers, Taverna and Goldstein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b010">10</xref>] used an Eigen model of reaction flow to grow populations of proteins modeled as 2-D 25 mers. These authors showed that when the requirement to exceed certain stability thresholds is imposed, the resulting distribution of structures in the evolved population appears highly skewed toward more designable structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b023">23</xref>] and more robust (i.e., less susceptible to mutations) proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b024">24</xref>].</p><p>One of the most surprising features of the protein universe is an uneven and broad distribution of proteins over folds, families, and superfamilies. While this fact had been noted by many researchers long ago [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b026">26</xref>], the quantitative descriptions of these distributions began to emerge only recently. Huynen and van Nimwegen found that sizes of paralogous gene families follow a power-law distribution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b003">3</xref>]. Gerstein and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b005">5</xref>] observed a power-law distribution of frequencies of several other properties of gene families as defined in the Structural Classification of Proteins (SCOP) database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b027">27</xref>]. Dokholyan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b002">2</xref>] studied a network of structural similarities between protein domains (called the protein domain universe graph, or the PDUG) and found that distribution of connectivities within the PDUG follows a power law (within a limited range of connectivity variance), making it a finite size counterpart of a scale-free network. This is in striking variance with an expectation from random distribution of folds, which would result in an (approximately) Gaussian distribution of connectivities of the PDUG.</p><p>The ubiquitous nature of power-law dependencies of many characteristics of gene families and of the protein universe may suggest their possible common origin from the fundamental evolutionary dynamics and/or physics of proteins. Huynen and van Nimwegen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b003">3</xref>], Gerstein and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b005">5</xref>], and Koonin and coworkers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b029">29</xref>] proposed dynamical models (the version proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b028">28</xref>] is called the birth, death, and innovation model [BDIM]) on the basis of gene duplication as a main mechanism of creation of novel types. Such models, while providing power-law distribution of family sizes in some asymptotic cases, are sometimes based on assumptions that call into question their generality. In particular, as pointed out by Koonin and coworkers, for gene duplication dynamic models to provide nontrivial power-law distributions of paralogous family sizes, one has to assume that the probability of gene duplication per gene depends in a certain regular way on the size of an already existing gene family. Further, even under this assumption, the power-law distribution in the birth, death, and innovation (BDIM) model arises only asymptotically in a steady state of evolutionary dynamics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b029">29</xref>]. In contrast, the duplication and divergence phenomenological model of Dokholyan et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b002">2</xref>] did not use such dramatic assumptions. However, this model is limited to an explanation of the scale-free nature of the PDUG, and it does not provide any insight as to the nature of the power-law distribution of gene family sizes. In protein sequence space, a similar approach has been employed by Qian et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b005">5</xref>]. However, models like the ones proposed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b028">28</xref>] and other works are purely phenomenological in nature, whereby proteins are presented as abstract nodes and where sequence–structure relationships are not considered.</p><p>Here, we present a microscopic physics-based model of early biological evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g001">Figure 1</xref>) with a realistic generic population dynamics scenario where fitness (i.e., life expectancy) of an organism is related to a simple necessary requirement of functionality of its proteins—their ability to be in native conformations. Since the latter can be estimated exactly in our model from sequences of evolving genomes, the proposed model provides a rigorous, microscopic connection between molecular evolution and population dynamics. We demonstrate that the model indeed bridges multiple evolutionary timescales, thus providing an insight into how selection of a best-fit phenotype results in molecular selection of proteins and formation of stable long-lasting protein folds and superfamilies. Furthermore, the coupling of molecular and organismal/populational scales results in the emergence of species—subpopulations of evolved organisms whose genomes are similar within their groups and dissimilar between groups. The resulting protein universe features power-law distribution for gene family and superfamily sizes closely matching real ones. The proposed model can be viewed as a first step toward a microscopic first-principles description of emergence and evolution of the protein universe.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030139-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030139.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Schematic Representation of the Genome and Population Dynamics in the Model</title><p>Individual genes undergo mutations and duplications.

				</p><p>This equation expresses a postulate that all genes of early organisms were essential at the given time; no a priori assumptions about the number of these genes are made.</p><p>We found that out of 50 simulation runs starting with different starting sequences, 27 runs successfully resulted in a steady exponential growth of the population, whereas in 23 runs the population has quickly gone extinct. A typical behavior of the population growth and protein structure dynamics in a successful evolution run is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>. After a period of “hesitation” lasting for about 100 time steps, a steady exponential growth of the population sets in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>B).

In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, color hue encodes the number of genes in the population corresponding to each of the 103,346 lattice structures (ordinate) as a function of time (abscissa). Structures marked in green are the most abundant in population at a given time, while black background corresponds to structures not found in any of the evolving organisms. The most important feature of this plot is the appearance of specific structures that correspond to highly abundant proteins comprising a significant fraction of the gene repertoire of the population. In what follows we will call them dominant protein structures (DPSs). Such proteins visually appear as bright lines on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>A. What is the genesis of DPSs, and how is their appearance related to population growth or decay?</p><p>To answer this question, let us track the development of the population of structures in time by comparing the structure repertoire, the population size, and <italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub> plots. At <italic>t</italic> = 0, the proteome consists of a single sequence–structure combination (a single line on the structural repertoire plot), which corresponds to all individuals in the initial population having that structure in the genome. Over time, random mutations diverge sequences in each organism such that the dominance of a single structure is lost. This can be seen as a smeared line on the structural repertoire plot, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, <italic>t</italic> &lt; 100. However, at a certain point, very favorable sequence–structure combinations are discovered. They represent DPSs whose incorporation into the genome leads to an abrupt increase of <italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub> and explosive exponential growth of the population through increase in fitness. Shortly after the discovery of that DPS, the diversity of the structural space abruptly collapsed, as most of the organisms converge toward the newly discovered DPS. Such a dramatic event, discovery of a limited number of dominant proteins and ensuing exponential growth of the population, can be called the “Biological Big Bang,” following a loose analogy with astrophysics. As seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, the emerged dominant folds are very persistent in time. Nevertheless, fold discovery can occur at later stages of evolution. For example, in this particular simulation, at <italic>t</italic> ≈ 1,300, new folds were discovered (white arrow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>A), they become new DPSs, and the initial DPSs are completely replaced by the new folds by <italic>t</italic> ≈ 1,600. This switchover, accompanied by a marked increase of <italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub>, is a clear manifestation of punctuated discoveries of new folds, coupled with selection at the organismal level.</p><p>Even though the number of organisms increases exponentially, the number of genes in each genome increases very slowly (and stabilizes after the discovery of DPSs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030139-sg001">Figure S1</xref>, red curve). Indeed, large genomes are not very advantageous in our model, as mutations occur in all of the genes, whereas the death rate is controlled by the gene with the lowest <italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub>. Thus, it is only this gene that bears the brunt of selective pressure. Therefore, the rest of the genome accumulates mutations and is more prone to deleterious mutations. Unless all of the genes are very carefully selected (or formation of pseudogenes is allowed), a larger number of genes means that there is a substantial probability that a point mutation will result in a sequence–structure combination with a very low <italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub>, immediately killing the organism. The observed slow increase of the size of the genome reflects the subtle balance between the selection pressure and gene duplication and is analyzed in more detail below. Remarkably, the average number of genes in the surviving organisms decreases with increasing mutation rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030139-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Indeed, if every protein is essential, then the probability of organism death due to a deleterious mutation is lower in organisms with shorter genomes. This result allows direct experimental verification and clearly sets the current model apart from the previous sequence evolution simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b010">10</xref>], which focused on the properties of individual proteins.</p><p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030139-sg002">Figure S2</xref> shows the structural repertoire and population size of an unsuccessful simulation run, where the population quickly became extinct. This simulation did not result in a discovery of a stable fold, and the structural space was evenly filled until the extinction of the population. We found (unpublished data) that the choice of starting sequence does not have any significance in determining whether a particular simulation run will result in exponential growth or extinction. Furthermore, in the case of most unsuccessful evolution runs, the genome size rapidly increases with time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030139-sg001">Figure S1</xref>, blue curve), decreasing the average evolutionary pressure per gene and making the discovery of DPSs less likely.</p><p>Based on these observations, we conjecture that biological evolution, exponential population growth, and existence of stable genomes are possible only after the discovery of a narrow set of specific protein structures.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Emergence of Families and Superfamilies</title><p>To quantify the persistence of the DPS during evolution, we calculated the distribution of DPS lifetimes, defined as the timespan during which a structure comprises more than 20% of the genes present in the most populated structure, i.e., the time between emergence of a DPS and its extinction in the population (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). We consider only DPSs that already completed their “lifecycle,” i.e., the DPSs that emerged and went extinct over the time of an evolutionary simulation. It is clear from <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g003">Figure 3</xref>B that the lifetime of a DPS is much greater than that of an organism or the average time between successive mutations. Moreover, the distribution of DPS lifetimes clearly follows a power-law–like distribution. The long nonexponential tail of the distribution demonstrates that some protein folds are extremely resistant to mutations and may persist over thousands of generations. Over such a long time, diverse protein (super)families are formed around the DPS folds. This is illustrated on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g004">Figure 4</xref>A, which shows the distribution of sizes of evolved families and superfamilies of proteins.

For simplicity, we assume that the distribution of stability <italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub> of a lattice protein after a point mutation (i) does not depend on the stability before the mutation and (ii) is uniformly distributed between 0 and 1.

It turns out that the number of DPSs in the evolved population is a very good indicator of species formation. In many cases, there is only one DPS in the evolved population. Then, the genomes of all organisms are similar, and the population is monoclonal. A more interesting case is presented in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, where two different DPSs corresponding to structures 10,107 (“A”) and 15,550 (“B”) (in our arbitrary numbering) have evolved. Are these structures randomly distributed between organisms, or are there groups of organisms preferentially using structure A, but not B, and vice versa? In the latter case, one could argue that two clonal lines or species have evolved, as each of the groups will have its own and distinct set of protein structures, and correspondingly, sequences. It turns out that in 1,536 organisms in the population, at least one gene encodes for the structure A, in 2,767 organisms, at least one gene encodes for B, but there are no organisms that include both A and B in their genomes. A total of 697 organisms have neither A nor B in their genomes. Therefore, organisms having the DPS of fold A in their genomes are very distinct from the organisms with the fold B. This difference is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, where we plotted the histograms of pairwise Hamming distances between the sequences encoding for structures A and B. The black curve represents the distribution of all pairwise Hamming distances between the sequences encoding for structure A; the red curve corresponds to structure B. Both curves are shifted toward lower values of the Hamming distance, illustrating a certain degree of similarity of multiple sequences encoding for the same structure. However, the Hamming distance between the sequences encoding for A and sequences encoding for B (green curve) is much larger and is very close to that of purely random sequences. Therefore, in sequence space, we can identify two groups of sequences that are similar within each group and dissimilar across the groups. Thus, the genomes of our model organisms can be classified according to their membership in the two well-defined groups of sequences, which is our model analogue of genome-based taxonomy. It is interesting to note that since our model is purely divergent and lateral gene transfer is not allowed, the evolving lines (or species) of organisms remain isolated, each evolving around its own DPS.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030139-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030139.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption><title>Emergence of Species</title><p>(A) Structural repertoire of an evolution run developing two DPSs is shown.

Following this logic, one should expect that ancient protein folds, being closer to prototypical DPSs, should be highly clustered and more connected than later diverged folds. To test this prediction, we analyzed the subgraph of the PDUG corresponding to the last universal common ancestor (LUCA) domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b032">32</xref>]. There are 915 LUCA domains. We compared the connectivity and clustering coefficient in the PDUG subgraph corresponding to LUCA domains with distributions for the same characteristics for 915 randomly selected domains as a control. The null hypothesis is that a random subset of protein domains has connectivity and clustering coefficients similar to that of the LUCA domains.

Divergence and selection lead to the infrequent discovery of new protein folds (dashed circles). Within these folds, mutations result in the formation of protein (super)families. The size of protein families steadily increases with time, so older families are generally larger. However, fold formation can occur at any time, branching off any family, so the newly formed families will be necessarily small. At the same time, the structures corresponding to superfamilies are all pairwise similar to each other, and for that reason they are highly clustered in the PDUG. Therefore, at any moment, the snapshot of the evolving protein universe will comprise tightly clustered families of all sizes. This picture of protein families that are “tightly knit” within each fold leads to a prediction of a peculiar property of the PDUG: that each node, (i.e., protein domain), with connectivity <italic>k,</italic> is primarily connected with nodes of similar connectivity, i.e., members of its own fold family.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030139-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030139.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption><title>Schematic Representation of the Formation of Protein Folds and Superfamilies by Punctuated Jumps in the Divergent Model</title><p>Invention of new folds and their spread in population is a rare event of which the timescale exceeds the lifetime of organisms and the mutation timescale.

We used a simple physical model of protein thermodynamics and a simple Malthusian model of the population dynamics. The main assumption of our minimalistic model is that the necessary condition of survival of a living organism is that its proteins adopt their native conformations. Therefore, the death rate of the organisms decreases when their proteins become more stable against thermal denaturation or unfolding. In other words, we assume that all genes of our model organism are essential. Biological function is not explicitly present in the model, but protein stability is the necessary condition for its evolution. Genes in our model have high mutation rates, conducive to rapid innovation. As such, our model can be directly applicable to (and can be experimentally tested on) the evolution of RNA viruses, which often encode for a handful of proteins, all of which are essential for the virus. The absence of an error correction mechanism results in very high mutation rates and heterogeneous, quasispecies-like populations of RNA viruses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b035">35</xref>] similar to what is found in this model. Rapid evolution makes RNA viruses an ideal system for experimental studies along the lines of our model, where the simulation algorithm propagates model organisms almost like an infected host cell produces new viral particles. The low number of genes (three to ten proteins per genome depending on simulations conditions, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g005">Figure 5</xref>) observed in our model is in part related to the extremely high mutation rates, about six mutations per genome per replication. In modern life, such a high rate is observed only in populations of RNA viruses that lack the error correction mechanism. Remarkably, the genomes of RNA viruses are rather short and normally encode for fewer than ten proteins. More complex DNA-based viruses and all cellular organisms invariably possess much lower mutation rates due to error correction and, correspondingly, longer genomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b036">36</xref>], in qualitative agreement with our model. Thus, our model suggests that protein stability requirements, together with mutation rates, play a crucial role in determining the size of the genomes of surviving organisms.</p><p>There is a common belief that the experimentally observed moderate stability of natural proteins is a result of positive selection for function. However, no experimental proof for this conjecture is available. Rather, a circular argument that natural proteins are not extremely stable is offered to support this claim [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b037">37</xref>]. On the contrary, a recent study demonstrated that the higher the stability of a protein, the more likely that it confers selective advantage to the protein by making it more evolvable, by enhancing its ability to tolerate more mutations and as a result evolve a new function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b038">38</xref>]. A more plausible explanation of moderate stability of natural proteins is that it is a direct result of a tradeoff between stability in the native conformation and entropy in sequence space, which opposes an evolutionary optimization beyond necessary levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b039">39</xref>]. We observe exactly this phenomenon in our model: while organisms with more stable proteins have selective advantage, the opposing factor—enormity of search in sequence/structure space—results in a compromise level of stability that corresponds to stable but not overstabilized proteins (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g002">Figure 2</xref>C). By not “overstabilized” we mean here that for the same structure, standard sequence design methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b041">41</xref>] can provide sequences with <italic>P</italic><sub>nat</sub> values that are much closer to 1 than observed in evolved model proteins (unpublished data).</p><p>Unlike in many previous attempts, our model explicitly describes the interplay of the evolution of individual genes and that of genomes (organisms) as a whole, since the death of an organism leads to a complete loss of its genome. The model gives important insights into the interplay between molecular evolution, protein fold evolution, and population dynamics. In combination with selection pressure, random diffusion in sequence and structure spaces eventually leads to the discovery of specific structures, DPSs, that are resistant to mutations and form very evolvable proteins. This, in turn, immediately leads to the “Big Bang” event whereby discovery of viable proteins is coupled to exponential population growth, as mutations are no longer a big threat to viability. The DPSs persist over many generations and may be infrequently replaced or augmented by other even more favorable structures, in a process similar to punctuated evolution. The remarkable separation of timescales between frequent mutations and rare DPS formation allows for the formation of the protein families and superfamilies. Our model suggests that the DPSs may be superseded by more advantageous folds during evolution. A similar domain-loss phenomenon has been discussed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b042">42</xref>] in the context of structure-based prokaryotic phylogenies.</p><p>The model and simulations presented here provide a quantitative first-principles description of evolution of the universe of protein families. Despite the simplicity of the structural model of proteins and the phenotype–genotype relation invoked, it is able to quantitatively reproduce the power-law distributions that are observed in the natural protein universe. Earlier phenomenological models reproduced some aspects of power-law behavior, always at the expense of invoking dramatic assumptions about the dependence of the rates of gene duplication on the sizes of already existing gene families. Here no such assumptions are made, as the model is fully microscopic in nature. Furthermore, our simulations are capable of reproducing not only “power-law”–like behavior but also marked deviation from it. Indeed, as seen on <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g004">Figure 4</xref>B, there is an inflection point in the distribution of family sizes (blue curve) where the apparent slope changes. A similar inflection point was found in a recent clustering analysis of more than 7 million global ocean sampling sequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b043">43</xref>]. Strikingly, the distribution of family sizes of evolved proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) features a noticeable inflection as well. It is not clear whether phenomenological duplication-growth models are capable of reproducing such fine details of the family size distribution.</p><p>The most intriguing (and relevant) question is the origin of the universally observed power-law distributions in our model. Clearly an explanation proposed in many phenomenological models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b028">28</xref>] is not applicable here because the rates of all processes, including gene duplication, are constant in the model and do not depend on sizes of already existing gene families. Therefore there are no ad hoc assumptions about the gene birth/death dynamics in the model that could result in power-law distributions. The only plausible reason may be that the underlying dynamics in sequence and structure spaces, coupled with selective pressure, is responsible for the emerging power-law distributions. Indeed, our key finding concerns dynamics of fold discovery and death; that the lifetimes of DPSs are power-law distributed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030139-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). The size of a protein family (and superfamily on longer timescales) is proportional to DPS lifetime. Indeed, power-law exponents for family size distribution and DPS lifetimes are very similar. While these observations are suggestive, a more detailed future analysis of our model will make it possible to find a definite answer as to the origin of ubiquitous power-law distributions in sequence and fold statistics.</p><p>Several earlier studies modeled the evolution of proteins by applying pressure directly on the proteins, assuming that the probability of replication of a protein in a population of proteins depends on its molecular properties such as stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b039">39</xref>], folding kinetics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b044">44</xref>], or both [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b016">16</xref>]. In contrast, in the present model, biological (or as will be argued below “physiological”) constraints are applied to organisms as a whole, not to individual proteins. Evolutionary simulations and simple theory presented here highlight the importance of this distinction; the genome sizes are closely connected with maximum and average stability of evolved proteins. Therefore, biological pressure is “distributed” in the genome, and all genes act in concert in response to it. Furthermore, no DPSs were found in earlier simulations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b010">10</xref>], despite the fact that the overall population of evolved lattice proteins was somewhat skewed toward more designable structures. In contrast, our key finding is that evolution of population is strongly coupled with protein evolution, as population growth is contingent upon discovery of a very limited set of protein structures. The difference here may be due to the fact that simpler, 2-D lattice models were used in previous simulations, or due to the differences in how biological pressure is applied—on whole organisms here and on individual proteins in earlier works [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b045">45</xref>].</p><p>The presented model is markedly different from standard models of PG such as Fisher-Wright and QS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b047">47</xref>]. PG and QS models are phenomenological descriptions of evolution, attributing certain values of fitness for the genomes with predetermined combinations of alleles. These models conveniently sidestep the important question of the molecular origins of the change of fitness upon recombination or mutation. The genotype–phenotype relationship in our model is not phenomenological but physiological: when a gene product loses stability (and by implication functionality), the whole organism is likely to die. This assumption is justified by recent high-throughput experiments that use RNAi to determine the impact of gene knockout on phenotype [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b049">49</xref>]. As in an experiment where knockout of essential genes results in death of an organism, in our model the deterioration of stability of any gene of an organism confers the lethal phenotype. In the present implementation, our model assumes that all genes are essential. However, this assumption can be relaxed (unpublished data), making it possible to study differentially the impact of biological constraints on the evolution of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b050">50</xref>].</p><p>Another critical distinction between our approach and traditional phenomenological models is that in PG and QS approaches a single genotype is assumed to be advantageous [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b051">51</xref>]. While the outcome may be that genomes of the populations are peaked around the most fit one (as in the standard QS model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b047">47</xref>]) or that a broader distribution among genotypes may emerge (as in the “survival of the flattest” scenario [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b052">52</xref>]), it is always an implication of the key assumption that a certain genotype confers the highest fitness. In contrast, the present model makes no a priori assumptions about the fitness advantage of a certain genotype. Strikingly, sets of organisms distributed around dominant genomes and proteomes—species—emerge here as a result of evolution at longer evolutionary times. A key factor determining the emergence of species in this model is that productive evolution occurs only when the structural diversity of proteins collapses into a small set of DPSs.</p><p>Our model of natural selection is minimalistic and is limited in its scope. It does not take into account such important biological processes as horizontal gene transfer, gene recombination, sexual reproduction, “death of a gene” (via pseudogenisation), and Darwinian selection due to competition of populations for limited resources. Also, to make the minimum possible number of assumptions, the modern amino acid alphabet is used in the model, although it has been suggested that the amino acid alphabet itself had evolved over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b053">53</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b055">55</xref>]. However, we believe that our model is an important step toward the unification of microscopic physics-based models of protein structure and function and the macroscopic (so far, phenomenological) description of the evolutionary pressure. Its extensions are straightforward and may include a more explicit consideration of protein function, protein–protein interactions, and fitness function that rewards functional (and therefore, structural) innovations. Furthermore, since habitat temperature enters the model explicitly, it can be used to study thermal adaptation of organisms as well as adaptation to variable mutation rates.

For simplicity, we do not allow for the formation of pseudogenes or any other mechanism of removal of the genes from a genome; in every organism the number of genes increases (or remains constant) with time.

This relation gives rise to an effective selection pressure on proteins since organisms that have at least one unstable protein live shorter and thus produce less progeny. This simple, direct, and physically plausible relationship between the genotype (thermodynamic properties of the proteins) and the phenotype (life expectancy) is the key novel feature of our model. Another implication of this relationship is in the “collective punishment” effect that genes do not evolve independently; a very unfavorable mutation in a gene will likely lead to a quick death of an organism, so its complete genome will not be able to proliferate. Such cooperativity creates an important selection pressure toward mutation-resistant genes encoding stable and evolvable (see below) proteins. Interestingly, purely physical factors ensure that resistance to mutations, evolvability of a new function, and thermostability are well correlated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b038">38</xref>], so little or no tradeoff may be needed to satisfy both requirements.

In principle, the relationship between growth rate and protein stability can be experimentally verified by analyzing the growth rate of bacteria at elevated temperatures. While the exact biochemical mechanisms leading to slower replication and eventual death are complicated, they all originate in the loss of protein function or enzymatic activity due to thermal denaturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b056">56</xref>].

				</p><p>In situation <italic>B</italic><sub>2</sub>, if the stability of the mutated gene is greater than <italic>f,</italic> then the original gene with stability <italic>f</italic> would remain the least stable in the genome.

Solving this inequality, we find an upper limit on the number of genes in a genome (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi-0030139-e002">Equation 2</xref>).</p></sec><sec id="s4e"><title>Family and superfamily size estimate for real proteins.</title><p>We took sequences of all structurally characterized domains from HSSP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b059">59</xref>]. We used BLAST [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b060">60</xref>] with threshold 10<sup>−10</sup> to identify all sequences with significant homology to each HSSP domain in a nonredundant sequence database NRDB90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b061">61</xref>]. We combined each set of sequences with homology into a single gene family. The number of nonredundant sequences matching the domain is the number considered in that family. We then used cross-indexing between NRDB90 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b061">61</xref>], Swiss-Prot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b062">62</xref>], and InterPro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b063">63</xref>] to define the set of different functions each gene family performs. The number of different functions as defined by InterPro becomes the number of superfamilies folding into the same domain.</p></sec><sec id="s4f"><title>Family and superfamily size estimate for model proteins.</title><p>In the model, the superfamily size is defined as the number of nonhomologous sequences with all mutual pairwise Hamming distance of 16 or more (i.e., 40% sequence identity or less) having the same native conformation. The family size is defined as the number of all sequences folding into a given structure, without removing the homologous sequences.</p></sec><sec id="s4g"><title>Protein Domain Universe Graph.</title><p>To construct the PDUG from the simulation data, we considered only the nonhomologous amino acid sequences. The selection is based on the Hamming distance between the sequences, which should exceed 18 (i.e., less than 33% sequence identity).</p><p>To calculate the structure similarity in the PDUG, we used the Q score similarity measure. The Q score measure between the two structures <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> is the number of all pairs of monomers (<italic>k,m</italic>) that are in contact both in structure <italic>i</italic> and structure <italic>j</italic>. As there are always 28 contacts in compact 27 mers, Q score varies from 0 for completely dissimilar structures to 28 for two identical structures. The Q score is analogous to the distance matrix alignment (DALI) Z score, used as a structural similarity measure for real proteins.</p></sec><sec id="s4h"><title>Definition of LUCA domains.</title><p>The simplest construction of the LUCA that still yields useful information is the delineation of the very old domains. Any domain shared by the three kingdoms of life can be placed in the LUCA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b064">64</xref>]. If any such domain were not placed in the LUCA, multiple independent discovery (or horizontal transfer) events would be required to explain the occurrence of this domain in all kingdoms. The “extra” evolution involved in this case would result in a less parsimonious scenario. Inclusion of other domains is more probabilistic and depends on the exact form and method of parsimony construction used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030139-b064">64</xref>]. We thus define the structural content of the LUCA to be all domains that have homologs in at least one archaeal, at least one prokaryotic, and at least one eukaryotic species. This yields approximately one-third of the PDUG members.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s5"><title>Supporting Information</title><supplementary-material id="pcbi-0030139-sg001" mimetype="application/postscript" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030139.sg001" xlink:type="simple"><label>Figure S1</label><caption><title>Mean Genome Size (Number of Genes per Organism) in an Exponentially Growing Population Is almost Constant Owing to the Balance between Gene Duplication and Selection Pressure</title><p>In a simulation run where population becomes extinct, the genome size grows linearly with time (blue curve).
