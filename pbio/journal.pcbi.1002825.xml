      <abstract>
        <p>It is well established that individuals age differently. Yet the nature of these inter-individual differences is still largely unknown. For humans, two main hypotheses have been recently formulated: individuals may experience differences in aging rate or aging timing. This issue is central because it directly influences predictions for human lifespan and provides strong insights into the biological determinants of aging. In this article, we propose a model which lets population heterogeneity emerge from an evolutionary algorithm. We find that whether individuals differ in (i) aging rate or (ii) timing leads to different emerging population heterogeneity. Yet, in both cases, the same mortality patterns are observed at the population level. These patterns qualitatively reproduce those of yeasts, flies, worms and humans. Such findings, supported by an extensive parameter exploration, suggest that mortality patterns across species and their potential shapes belong to a limited and robust set of possible curves. In addition, we use our model to shed light on the notion of subpopulations, link population heterogeneity with the experimental results of stress induction experiments and provide predictions about the expected mortality patterns. As biology is moving towards the study of the distribution of individual-based measures, the model and framework we propose here paves the way for evolutionary interpretations of empirical and experimental data linking the individual level to the population level.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Aging is a widespread phenomenon across the tree of life. From yeast to humans, mortality changes over age have been widely documented. Interestingly, all individuals are not equal with respect to the aging process: large variability in individual life span has been reported, even in clonal populations. Understanding the nature of these differences is of great interest for medical research. So far, two hypotheses have been proposed: individuals may differ in their aging rate or timing. Here, we show that these two hypotheses can reproduce experimental and empirical mortality patterns as a result of natural selection. We also predict the corresponding population heterogeneity in aging. Many studies define subpopulations ad hoc, the work we present provides insight into a more accurate description of inter-individual differences in aging. Finally, our analysis also predicts the modifications of these mortality patterns under stressful conditions. This exploration reproduces experimental data obtained with heat shocks and permits to foresee new mortality patterns that could be observed with other perturbations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Aging can be generally defined as age-related changes in a set of variables, from growth rate to reproductive effort, which influence the fitness of an organism. Aging is a multiscale process which can be measured at almost every level of the individual organism. Individual metrics of aging include a broad range of processes from damage to DNA and proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-vonZglinicki1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Hipkiss1">[2]</xref> to tissue loss of functionality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Herbig1">[3]</xref>. Complementary to characterization of aging through individual metrics, there is a long history of demographic studies of aging going back to Gompertz's seminal studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Gompertz1">[4]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-University1">[6]</xref> studying age-specific mortality.</p>
      <p>Age-specific mortality is arguably one of the most documented measure of aging. Since Gompertz' seminal work on human data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Gompertz1">[4]</xref>, such mortality curves have been obtained for a large variety of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel1">[7]</xref>, in a broad range of environmental conditions (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Carey1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Baeriswyl1">[9]</xref>). These curves play a central role in understanding aging processes and predicting the dynamics of population growth and human life expectancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Oeppen1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel2">[11]</xref>. Age-specific mortality curves allow the comparison of aging processes between species as the same measure can be applied from unicellular organisms to humans, as long as the death of the individual is clearly defined. All of these contribute to make changes in mortality over age a well-accepted definition of aging from the demographic perspective. This is the definition of aging considered throughout this paper. One of the striking observations resulting from inter-species comparison is that yeast, fly, worm and human mortality patterns share common properties. They all exhibit exponential increase and decrease with age <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel1">[7]</xref>, but also differ in the timing and magnitude of these exponential phases and some species even exhibit mid-age or late-age plateaus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel1">[7]</xref>. In this article, we study the evolution of mortality patterns to investigate the nature of inter-individual differences in aging.</p>
      <p>The nature of inter-individual differences in aging is crucial to study and forecast a population's life expectancy, but is as yet still largely unknown. For humans, two main hypotheses have been proposed recently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel2">[11]</xref>: individuals may differ in aging rates or timing. Namely, from one individual to the other, the aging processes may be slowed or delayed. Addressing this issue is import to understand the potential and limits of individual medical treatments. Fundamental questions about inter-individual differences, i.e. individual heterogeneity, can be tackled studying age-specific mortality patterns.</p>
      <p>Because of these exponential patterns, differences in aging rates and timing can be visualized respectively as changes in slope and shift in mortality patterns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel2">[11]</xref>. Such changes have been documented for <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> populations: when facing a diet restriction, a change in aging timing occurs while the response to fluctuations in temperature is a change in aging rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Pletcher1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Mair1">[13]</xref>. Previous work has used age-specific mortality to show that the aging rate seemed to be conserved in different human populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Finch1">[14]</xref> and differed between different strains of <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Brooks1">[15]</xref>. Both shift in level and differences in rate have been reported between baboon populations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Bronikowski1">[16]</xref> or between male and females flies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Kawasaki1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>These mortality curves are population measures: they result from the aggregation of individual's aging. Biodemographic studies of aging have shown that specific population heterogeneity can reproduce the main features of qualitatively different mortality patterns, such as late-age mortality plateaus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel3">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Missov1">[19]</xref>. To do so, these studies make ad-hoc assumptions about (i) population heterogeneity, e.g., a Gamma distribution, and (ii) the nature of inter-individual differences in aging. In this paper, we address these issues in the light of evolution, we do not assume a specific population heterogeneity and we explore different types of inter-individual differences in aging.</p>
      <p>In our model, we include Gompertz aging, that is exponential increase in mortality hazard with age, and implement heterogeneity in aging rates and timing. Population heterogeneity is allowed to evolve over generations under the influence of life-history trade-offs. Following the disposable soma theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Kirkwood1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Kirkwood2">[21]</xref> and empirical observations made in a broad range of species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Zera1">[22]</xref>, we incorporate a trade-off between reproduction and aging. In this framework, investing in maintenance mechanisms (rather than reproduction) results either in slowing or delaying aging depending on the nature of inter-individual differences.</p>
      <p>In section ‚ÄòTransitions in mortality curves‚Äô, we discuss predictions concerning population heterogeneity and the corresponding mortality patterns under different assumptions about inter-individual differences. We compare our results to mortality patterns of yeast, flies, worms and humans respectively. In section ‚ÄòInfluence of mutation rate‚Äô, we test the robustness of our results with respect to mutation rates and highlight new features for the distribution of heterogeneity. Finally, in section ‚ÄòThe notion of subpopulation‚Äô, we exploit the predictions of the model to shed light on the notion of subpopulations which is invoked in numerous experimental studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Rea1">[23]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Wu1">[24]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The model we propose describes evolving populations in which individuals age, die and compete for reproduction while they are alive. The offspring they produce fill the next non-overlapping generation until the desired population size is reached. Survival and reproductive success of each individual are connected following the disposable soma theory. The more an individual invests in reproduction, the shorter its lifespan. For each individual, a single parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> describes its resource allocation strategy between maintenance and reproduction. Different individuals may have different strategies (i.e., different <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) and one of the key features of these models is that this distribution of strategy in the population evolves over generations.</p>
        <p>For each generation, all the individuals are synchronized, starting with age zero. While an individual <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is alive, at each time step it has a probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be chosen for reproduction, proportional to its <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter, normalized by the sum of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of alive individuals: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The normalization factor implements a competition for reproduction because the ability for each individual to reproduce depends on the composition of the whole population. The higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are more likely to reproduce than the lower <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but if the population is reduced to one single individual, the probability it has to reproduce is one, independently of its <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter.</p>
        <p>Competition for reproduction has been documented in a broad range of species and can take numerous forms, from limited access to habitat <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Brawn1">[25]</xref> to dependence on external resources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Arcese1">[26]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Once an individual is chosen for reproduction, it produces one offspring which inherits its <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value if no mutation occurs. We use the term mutations here to describe a process introducing variability in the inheritance process. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002825.s011">Text S1</xref>, we explore different implementations of such a process and show that the conclusions of this paper do not rely on specific modeling choices. Each reproductive event has a fixed mutation probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>: if a mutation occurs, the offspring value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is replaced by a random number drawn from the uniform distribution between zero and one. The result is that <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a heritable trait, subject to mutations and influences the reproductive success of the individual.</p>
        <p>The model we propose simulates evolving populations with a fixed size and non-overlapping generations. We start studying individuals at maturity, so that they are able to reproduce since time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the initial population each individual is assigned a randomly chosen <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> drawn from a uniform distribution between zero and one. We then let population heterogeneity change over generations until it reaches a quasi stationary distribution.</p>
        <p>Building the generation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from generation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> occurs as follows. First, at time <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, all the individuals are alive. The higher <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have a higher probability to be chosen for reproduction and therefore the first offspring added to the initially empty generation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are likely to have high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Then, as time goes on, individuals with high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> face a faster aging process than their counterparts with low <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As the high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> die out, lower <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> have more and more access to reproduction, thus producing on average low <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> offspring. The ‚Äòlow <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>‚Äô phenotype experiences a positive frequency-dependent selection as its fitness increases as their frequency in the population increases. The reproduction process is iterated until the generation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is filled. Some individuals might have inherited a very low <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because of the mutation process. They live much longer than the time required to fill a generation and do not reproduce. These individuals we will refer to as the ‚Äòoldest old‚Äô and present the influence they have on mortality patterns in section ‚ÄòTransitions in mortality curves‚Äô. This reproduction process is asexual, as one individual is either cloned, if no mutations occur, or modified in the other case. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002825.s011">Text S1</xref>, we show that introducing sexual reproduction does not alter the conclusions of the paper.</p>

        <p>Following the disposable soma theory, we implement a trade-off at the individual level between survival and reproduction. For each individual, the hazard of death between age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and age <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is given by a function which increases with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The dependence on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> depicts heterogeneity in the population as each individual has its own <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The increase in mortality over age depends on the interactions between (i) the species biological characteristics and (ii) its environment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Pletcher1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Mair1">[13]</xref>. This interaction is captured by a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in our model which influences the rate of the individual's exponential aging, differing from one species to the other. This baseline aging is then modulated by the individual strategy of resource allocation between maintenance and reproduction, captured by the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Whether <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> modulates the rate or the timing of the baseline aging is an open question <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel2">[11]</xref>. To address it, we therefore study two distinct individual mortality functions.</p>
        <p>First, we implement <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which leads to heterogeneity in aging rates, described afterwards as the Heterogeneity in aging Rate Model (HRM). The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reflects the initial mortality and the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the interactions between the biology of the species and its environment. These two parameters are constant over generations and identical for all the individuals, thus defining a baseline aging.</p>
        <p>Second, to derive a mortality function for the Heterogeneity in aging Timing Model (HTM), let us now consider linear dependence on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the individual mortality function and two different individuals, respectively defined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Their respective mortality function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, a change in initial mortality corresponds to a delay in aging, i.e., a shift of the mortality curve along the time axis, while both individuals still share the same aging rate. In contrast, in the case of the mortality function <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> presented in the previous paragraph, two different individuals would start from the same initial mortality but differ in their aging rates.</p>
        <p>The two hypotheses concerning heterogeneity in aging postulate different underlying trade-off mechanisms. In the case of heterogeneity in aging rates, investing in maintenance mechanisms slows down the aging process whereas in the case of heterogeneity in aging timing, the same investment delays the aging process. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002825.s011">Text S1</xref>, we also present and discuss the influence of age-independent factors, usually referred to as extrinsic mortality, on the evolution of mortality patterns.</p>

        <title>Quasi-stationarity of the evolving populations</title>
        <p>Over generations, the evolutionary process reshapes the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-strategies according to the environmental parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the choice of the individual mortality function. For instance if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, in the (extreme) case of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the optimal strategy is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because the trade-off has no effect. On the other hand, high values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are likely to draw the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> towards lower values so that individuals have to survive to get the opportunity to reproduce. We present the evolution of these distributions in section ‚ÄòEvolution of heterogeneity‚Äô.</p>
        <p>After several hundreds of generations (400 in the simulations below), the distribution stabilizes and mortality curves can be estimated. The probability for a whole population to disappear in the course of evolution is strictly positive. Indeed, each individual has a non-zero probability to die at each time step and this could happen before it reproduces at all. Population size can theoretically decrease over generations until extinction. Yet, for a broad range of parameters, this does not occur and a quasi-stationary distribution of strategies is reached. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002825.s011">Text S1</xref>, we provide a mathematical formulation of the model which would allow one to study the existence and uniqueness of these quasi-stationary distributions from a formal standpoint. Here, in the following sections, we focus on the properties of these post-evolution quasi-stationary distributions.</p>
        <p>In this paper, we focus on adult mortality patterns and, as such, we do not explicitly address the heterogeneity arising from developmental processes. We assume that development leads to the expression of the inherited phenotype <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002825.s011">Text S1</xref>, we explore the effects of a maturation period before the onset of reproduction and provide mathematical tools to address the issue of additional development-induced heterogeneity in more depth.

          <p>Because it explicitly links the individual level and population measures of aging, the model we propose also allows for study of what is called ‚Äòsubpopulations‚Äô in several experimental studies. In the case of heterogeneity in aging rates, the distribution of individual lifespan in evolved populations is bimodal for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002825-g009">figure 9</xref>, first column.

Therefore, the very notion of subpopulation seems to be challenged here. Indeed, observing the lifespans leads to the distinction of two subpopulations which cannot be easily determined when analyzing the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

          <p>A subpopulation also arises in studies focused on stress induction experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Wu1">[24]</xref>.

The only exception occurs for the HRM and high <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> combination because individuals die too quickly to exhibit the two-stage exponential increase. In all the other cases, the kink shape is preserved but the time at which the kink occurs as well as the corresponding mortality levels are modified by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These findings are in agreement with experimental results for C. elegans observed under different diets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Baeriswyl1">[9]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The results presented in the other columns provide predictions concerning the expected mortality patterns for other population heterogeneity. The interests of this exploration are twofold. First, it allows one to determine whether a given stress induction experiment will modify population heterogeneity. If the same distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> cannot produce the mortality pattern with and without stress by only modifying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, our model predicts that adaptation as occurred. Second, if adaptation does not occur, the mortality patterns under perturbation present significant differences between the HRM and the HTM. One of the main observation which stands out from the comparison between <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002825-g011">figure 11</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002825-g012">12</xref> is that the mortality rates are more modified in the HRM than in the HTM in response to changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Therefore, this prediction can provide a way to decide whether inter-individual differences in aging rely on rate of timing.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Studying the evolution of heterogeneity in resource allocation strategies is at the heart of a broad range of experimental studies and today's aging research <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel2">[11]</xref>. The nature of individual mortality functions are still to be discovered: whether populations of the same species living in different environments differ in aging rates or aging timing is still an open question. Drosophila melanogaster submitted to diet changes exhibit a shift in their mortality curves (changes in the timing) while the same populations exhibit a rescaling of their mortality curves in response to temperature changes (changes in aging rates) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Mair1">[13]</xref>. The same question holds for human populations and individuals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Vaupel2">[11]</xref>. Understanding the nature of heterogeneity in aging sheds light on the biological constraints which can be circumvented. If it turns out that aging rate is the same for every human being, it might be strongly controlled at the lower levels of the organism and therefore difficult to modify.</p>
      <p>Moreover, in terms of medical treatments, focusing on aging rate or timing has distinct implications. On the one hand, modifying the rate of aging results in a high potential increase in life expectancy as aging is slowed during the whole life time. On the other hand, such changes in rate would not only extend the period of ‚Äòhealthy aging‚Äô but also morbidity. These pros and cons have arguably significant implications in terms of public policy and need to be considered with regards to population heterogeneity. If the rate of aging is a fundamental constant in humans while timing is highly variable, being able to modify aging rate via medical progress will require substantial investment while timing would be presumably more flexible and thus cheaper to modify.</p>
      <p>Numerous studies in current aging research have found mutations or treatments which dramatically influence aging dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Pletcher1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Mair1">[13]</xref>. Yet, very often the issue of timing and rate of aging is not directly addressed, for instance because survival curves are provided and not mortality curves. The models we present in this paper allow one (i) to compare their data to the transitions with the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> observed in our model and (ii) to reinterpret previously published data to address the crucial issue of rate and timing of aging.</p>
      <p>In this model, we analyze different possible heterogeneity in aging, only assuming Gompertz dependence on time. Our results show that assumptions about internal life-history trade-offs modulate the shape of population heterogeneity. Yet, in a wide array of scenarios, the same set of mortality and survival curves emerge. Population heterogeneity adapts to the environment according to the individual mortality functions but, at the population level, no qualitative changes can be observed. The transitions observed always go from a ‚Äòkink‚Äô shaped mortality curve to an exponential-U shape-exponential pattern. This robustness of the mortality patterns also echoes experimental observations of mortality and survival in different environments. In many organisms, the modifications observed in mortality patterns as a result of genetic manipulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Johnson1">[33]</xref> or environmental changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Baeriswyl1">[9]</xref> does not provide strikingly different curves. These curves can be stretched or shifted by the treatment, but generally they do not exhibit shapes radically different than those described in this paper. For instance, the survival curve shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002825-g010">figure 10</xref>, which shows a quick decrease followed by a slowing down, is a standard pattern which can be observed across species under stressful conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Fabrizio1">[30]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Chen1">[32]</xref>. This robustness of survival and mortality curves will be easier to assess thanks to increasingly available data for species other than model organisms. Such robustness may even be a key property which sheds light on the underlying mechanisms of aging across species, their effects, their limits and their evolution.</p>
      <p>The systematic exploration of different forms of inter-individual differences in aging also provides predictions about the expected distributions of heterogeneity. Even though the mortality patterns look alike in the different versions of the model, the evolved heterogeneity distributions do not. Current technical advances, such as microfluidics set-ups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Xu1">[34]</xref>, individual genomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Iafrate1">[35]</xref> or proteomics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Cohen1">[36]</xref>, allow more and more observations at the individual level, which in turn lead to population level influences. As such, we expect that the analysis of distributions and heterogeneity will replace the analysis of means over populations in the coming decade. The framework we present here, in which the distribution of heterogeneity conveys information about evolution and the aging process, anticipates this trend and paves the way for formal modeling and understanding of individual-based data. In aging research, these predictions would allow researchers to decide whether individual differences in aging rely on aging rate or timing. In other fields, it paves the way for a renewed vision of inter-individual differences evolution.</p>
      <p>Previous works have used the Price equation to link population heterogeneity and natural selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Coulson1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002825-Rebke1">[38]</xref>. The framework we propose here, with age-dependent competition and evolution of distribution provides an interesting ground for further development of these works. In this respect, the analytical framework presented in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section is of particular interest as it could in principle give explicit expressions concerning the changes in the phenotypic variance from one generation to the other.</p>
      <p>Moreover, the shape of these distributions also provides information about the link between the marker observed at the individual level and the measure of interest, such as individual lifespan. Comparing the distributions emerging from our evolutionary algorithm shows that to obtain the exponential-plateau-exponential pattern (which corresponds to a bimodal distribution of lifespans) with a unimodal distribution of the aging marker, the link between the marker and individual lifespan needs to be strongly non-linear. The exploration we propose here also provides milestones to interpret the individual-based data and their corresponding distributions.</p>
      <p>Finally, we believe that the model is also flexible enough to allow the exploration of other types of life-history trade-offs, based on the key idea of evolving heterogeneity. As such, it paves the way for future interpretations of coming individual-based observations in evolving biological systems.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>The simplicity of the framework we propose also enables the formalization of intuitive notions, such as a ‚Äòsubpopulation‚Äô and the extensive exploration of mortality functions provides predictions of possible curves for organisms yet to be studied, along with expected distributions of heterogeneity. The robustness of mortality patterns observed suggests that aging is itself a robust process, relying on similar processes across species. We hope that this work paves the way for (i) faster understanding and classification of heterogeneity distributions across species which are not model organisms and (ii) opens up new prospects in terms of understanding the evolution of aging and its robustness. The set-up allows easy changes and explorations, as well as creating space to make the interactions between aging and reproduction more complex. In that sense, it complements previous approaches combining evolutionary theories and heterogeneity, as it provides a framework to explore yet to be explained aging dynamics.</p>

All models have been implemented in C and this section provides numerical methods for the algorithm used in our simulations.</p>
        <sec id="s4a1">
          <title>Stochastic models</title>
          <p>In the stochastic models, the population has a finite size which is usually 500 individuals, unless otherwise mentioned. Modifying this parameter does not alter the conclusion of the models and the same results can be obtained for different population sizes. The mortality curve we observe as a result of the evolutionary algorithm depends on the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The transitions in the mortality patterns following <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the same for different population size, these transitions simply occur for different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
          <p>In the discrete time version of the stochastic model, the age of each individual is incremented by one at each time step and followed by a survival test. This test consists of drawing a random number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between zero and one, and comparing this number with the age-specific mortality hazard: if <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the individual survives until the next time step and dies otherwise. As we consider populations with a fixed size of 500, no individuals were experiencing a mortality hazard higher than one. As a first approximation, we have considered the age-specific probability of death to be close to the mortality hazard at the same age. This approximation provides the same results as the continuous-time version of the model (see below) which directly computes the individual lifespan according to mortality hazards. All alive individuals compete then for reproduction. Multiple reproductive events may occur in the same time step, and the offspring produced is added to the next generation if it is not full. This process of death-reproduction is then iterated until the next generation is filled.</p>
          <p>The continuous time version of the stochastic model follows the same principles. The time of death and reproduction events are drawn following continuous distributions. First, the time of death for each individual is randomly drawn following an exponential distribution which corresponds to its <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.More precisely, the procedure to draw the time of death <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for a given individual, with a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a baseline mortality described by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is the following. First, we draw randomly a number <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> between 0 and 1. Then, we compute <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, following the standard procedure to draw random numbers from exponential distributions. The time of reproductive events derive from a standard Gillespie algorithm accounting for the fact that only alive individuals compete for reproduction. More precisely, the time interval between two reproduction events is drawn from an exponential distribution of parameter 1, as these are the only events considered here (the time of death being already calculated beforehand). The stochastic model with continuous time was used for all the figures presented in the main text.</p>

        <title>Deterministic model</title>
        <p>We have also implemented a deterministic model which corresponds to the stochastic models presented in the main text in the case of infinite populations. The purpose is twofold: (i) it ensures the robustness of our results and (ii) it paves the way for an analytical analysis of the evolutionary algorithm we present in this paper. For instance, the formalisation presented in this section allows one to study from a formal standpoint the convergence to a stationary distribution with infinite populations. The deterministic model is defined at the population level and describes the changes in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the population at generation <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This distribution changes over generations through the same principle: individuals reproduce based on their <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and die according to the individual mortality function chosen. The distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> changes over time in one generation, as individuals die, following: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is therefore defined as<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002825.e146"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> accounts for the probability that an offspring inherits a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> given that its parent had a parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the finite size of the population. Indeed, as the rate of reproduction is constant over time, limiting the population size is equivalent to limiting the overall time allowed for reproduction. In sum, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the operator on <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> distributions described in the equation above. The evolutionary process described in the main text converges towards a stationary distribution of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> after several hundreds of generations when a fixed point for the operator <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is reached. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002825.s011">Text S1</xref>, we show that the deterministic model and the stochastic models produce the same results.</p>

          <title>Deterministic model</title>
          <p>For computational reasons, the possible values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are discrete.

The stochastic model with discrete time is equivalent to a deterministic model with discrete time. In this case, each time step follows the same pattern as the stochastic model: survival test ends reproduction. These two steps occur at the population level for the deterministic model with discrete time. A fraction of each class of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> survives and reproduction depends on the number of individuals in each class of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002825.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
