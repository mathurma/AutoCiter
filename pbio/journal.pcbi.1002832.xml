      <abstract>
        <p>Microbial communities are typically large, diverse, and complex, and identifying and understanding the processes driving their structure has implications ranging from ecosystem stability to human health and well-being. Phylogenetic data gives us a new insight into these processes, providing a more informative perspective on functional and trait diversity than taxonomic richness alone. But the sheer scale of high resolution phylogenetic data also presents a new challenge to ecological theory. We bring a sampling theory perspective to microbial communities, considering a local community of co-occuring organisms as a sample from a larger regional pool, and apply our framework to make analytical predictions for local phylogenetic diversity arising from a given metacommunity and community assembly process. We characterize community assembly in terms of quantitative descriptions of clustered, random and overdispersed sampling, which have been associated with hypotheses of environmental filtering and competition. Using our approach, we analyze large microbial communities from the human microbiome, uncovering significant variation in diversity across habitats relative to the null hypothesis of random sampling.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Microbial diversity analyses have revolutionized our knowledge of the microscopic world, from terrestrial and marine to human and urban environments. This growing field rests on the evolutionary relatedness of organisms, and at its frontier is the inference of ecological processes from phylogenetic diversity. However, the rapidly reducing cost of sequencing means that computational analysis of phylogenetic data is becoming increasingly intractable. We develop a new analytical method to address this issue, providing a computationally-efficient way to compare local phylogenetic diversity to a sample from a regional pool of organisms, under a given ecological process. Our approach has both pragmatic and far-reaching applications. Until now investigators have lacked even an analytical method to compare the diversity of unequally-sized communities without throwing data away, while on a deeper level our theory provides a new framework for connecting phylogenetic data to a wide range of ecological processes. As an application of our approach, we use our methods to distinguish between random, clustered and overdispersed sampling for human microbiome habitats. Finally, we identify a new, phylogenetic analogue of the widely used taxonomic measure of diversity, the Species Abundance Distribution, and we find that it has consistent behavior across microbiome habitats.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Microbial ecology has been advancing at a rapid pace, but understanding the processes driving microbial community structure remains a challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Robinson1">[1]</xref>. The first step towards identifying these processes has been to document microbial biodiversity, and the use of phylogenetic methods has been stimulated by the abundance of genomic data harvested from microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Pace1">[2]</xref>. Phylogenetic measures of diversity have been proposed as a more accurate representation than taxonomic diversity of community trait and functional diversity, and are therefore a potentially more relevant starting point for quantifying and understanding microbial communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Nee1">[3]</xref>. Phylogenetic approaches have been used to quantify microbial diversity along environmental <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Bryant1">[4]</xref> and elevational gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Wang1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Bryant2">[6]</xref>, across distinct habitat types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Casamayor1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Lauber1">[10]</xref> and for different experimental treatments, for habitats ranging from marine and freshwater, to soil, indoor and outdoor air, to the human body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Costello1">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Despite this success in documenting patterns of phylogenetic diversity in a broad range of contexts, our ability to translate these patterns into processes has been hampered by a lack of phylogenetic theory. The difficulty in formulating quantitative hypotheses impacts even the simplest of questions: which of two microbial communities is more phylogenetically diverse? If one community is larger than the other, we cannot answer this basic question without a theoretical hypothesis for the way we <italic>expect</italic> phylogenetic diversity to increase with community size. More generally, the lack of quantitative, analytical theory has made it difficult to address the relative importance of ecological processes of environmental selection, competition, dispersal and stochasticity in a given community. We have qualitative hypotheses and computational approaches to assess the impact of these processes, but there is no overarching, analytical framework within which to compare them.</p>
      <p>Phylogenetic theory can address both of these issues: the pragmatic problem of comparing phylogenetic diversity in different communities, and the larger question of inferring ecological processes from phylogenetic patterns. In this manuscript we develop a way to cast many different assembly processes in a common framework, centering around the comparison of a local community of co-occuring organisms with a sample from a regional, metacommunity of organisms. We draw from the sampling theory of taxonomic diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Plotkin1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Etienne1">[14]</xref> and our analysis rests on a new way of characterizing a metacommunity phylogenetic tree, which we term the Edge-length Abundance Distribution. This distribution is a new phylogenetic analogue of the classic taxonomic Species Abundance Distribution.</p>
      <p>As a proof-of principle application of our framework, we focus on publicly-available human microbiome data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Costello1">[11]</xref> and explore three questions centering around the comparison of microbiome phylogenetic diversity with a null hypothesis of random sampling from a metacommunity. First we document patterns across different microbiome habitats and different subjects, and identify a power-law pattern for the Edge-length Abundance Distribution. Species Abundance Distributions have been proposed to have a log-normal distribution in many ecological communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Preston1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-May1">[16]</xref>, including microbial systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Curtis1">[17]</xref>, and our work puts this observation on a new, phylogenetic footing. Second, we examine the effect of metacommunity scale on distinguishing different community assembly hypotheses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Swenson1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Swenson2">[19]</xref>. We compare the diversity of body habitats to a null hypothesis of random sampling from two different definitions of the metacommunity, one significantly larger than the other. We see a clear impact of metacommunity size on the phylogenetic diversity of body habitats relative to the null hypothesis. Finally, we address the question of whether the microbiome of a given human subject is consistent with the null hypothesis of random sampling, and find that while whole microbiome diversity for a given subject is typically much lower than a random sample from the metacommunity, this hides a wide range of different behaviors for the distinct habitats within that subject. We think of this as exploring the impact of local community resolution within the human body: different levels of resolution reveal more complexity.</p>

        <p>Phylogenetic Diversity (PD) has been defined as the total branch length connecting all organisms in a phylogenetic tree, and provides a natural phylogenetic analogue of taxonomic diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Faith1">[20]</xref>. Similarly, the UniFrac distance measure quantifies the overlap in phylogenetic branch length of two communities, and tells us how similar or different those two communities are <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Lozupone2">[21]</xref>. PD and UniFrac provide convenient measures of microbial diversity that do not rely on the ability to identify or enumerate microbial species, and are also amenable to exploring phylogenetic versions of classic biogeographical patterns of alpha and beta diversity.</p>
        <p>Comparing observed patterns of phylogenetic diversity to the patterns expected under various null models provides both a normalization to take into account the difference in sample sizes across different habitats or treatments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Schloss1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Ives1">[23]</xref>, and also a connection between patterns of phylogenetic diversity and the processes underlying them. Given information on the evolution of ecologically important traits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Blomberg1">[24]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Cahill1">[25]</xref> and the phylogenetic relatedness of organisms in local communities, an ‘ecophylogenetic’ framework can potentially provide insights into the relative importance of processes such as dispersal, competition, filtering, or drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Webb1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Stegen1">[30]</xref>. So far, these approaches to evaluating phylogenetic diversity against null models have relied on ‘brute force’ sampling, where a randomizing algorithm is used to sample tips from a phylogenetic tree, and the process is repeated many times to infer expected phylogenetic diversity for a sample of a given size. This approach becomes intractable for large phylogenetic trees, and must also be repeated for each additional hypothesis and sample size.</p>
        <p>We have developed a new, analytical approach to address these problems. Our conceptual framework links a local sample of individual organisms, a regional pool or metacommunity, and processes connecting these two scales. This perspective has a long history in ecological theory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-MacArthur1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Hubbell1">[33]</xref>, and has been recently advocated as an appropriate framework for the ecology of symbiont systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Mihaljevic1">[34]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002832-g001">Figure 1</xref> outlines the conceptual overview for this local and metacommunity framework, with explicit examples in the context of the human microbiome. Within our framework, the community assembly processes linking these local and regional scales could be either mechanistic, directly drawing on a process such as dispersal; or phenomenological, characterizing general patterns in statistical terms. The phylogenetic diversity literature has most often focused on the latter, comparing observed PD with the hypotheses of random, clustered and overdispersed sampling. We therefore focus on these sampling schemes in this manuscript, but our framework is potentially generalizable to specific community assembly mechanisms such as dispersal limitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Etienne1">[14]</xref>. The methods described in this paper have been implemented in software and will be available in version 1.5 of the picante R package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Kembel1">[35]</xref>.</p>

          <p>Random sampling has frequently been used as a null model in phylogenetic community ecology, but with the disadvantage of needing to take random samples computationally.

We now apply our framework to such microbial communities, collected from 7 human subjects across 26 distinct habitats. This data provides an ideal testing ground to demonstrate the utility of our theoretical framework: the largest metacommunity tree we sample from has <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002832.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> tips, each tip representing an individual sequence sampled in the study, which would render computational null model approaches intractable. Also, the different community types, subjects and scales allow us to address how our community assembly hypotheses depend on the choice of local community and metacommunity.</p>

          <title>Comparing local community phylogenetic diversity with a null model of community assembly</title>
          <p>We now focus on the deviation of microbiome communities from randomly assembled communities. The reason that random sampling is such a crucial baseline is that it lies between two distinct phylogenetic community assembly processes: local communities with lower PD than random are phylogenetically clustered, a signature of environmental filtering, while local communities with higher than random PD are phylogenetically overdispersed, indicating competitive interactions. The true relationship between clustering and overdispersion and these ecological mechanisms is likely more complicated than this simple description <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-ValienteBanuet1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Mayfield1">[40]</xref>, but it is a useful starting point <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Mouquet1">[27]</xref>.</p>
          <p>To evaluate the structure of a local community with respect to a given community assembly hypothesis, we need to make an assumption about the pool of individuals or taxa that this local community can draw on: the metacommunity. The ‘true’ regional pool of organisms that a given habitat from a given subject draws upon is difficult to define unambiguously, and so our approach is to allow for various definitions of the metacommunity, and examine the sensitivity of our results on these definitions. This relevance of metacommunity definition has been highlighted before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Swenson1">[18]</xref>, where it has been shown that different metacommunity sizes can lead to different conclusions about the most important ecological mechanisms structuring local communities, and our approach allows us to explore this issue for large microbial metacommunities. Secondly, we also investigate the effect of local community resolution on community assembly hypotheses: how does dividing a local community into smaller, sub-communities impact our understanding of community assembly. In particular we focus on grouping together distinct habitats to form the whole microbiome for a given subject, versus looking at habitats individually, and the effect of these two choices on our conclusions about community assembly.</p>
          <p>First, we find that PD increases as a power-law function of sample size. Our definition of a local community is all reads sampled from a single habitat, from a single subject on a single sample day. We plot the results for three habitats in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002832-g006">Figure 6</xref>, for two different definitions of the metacommunity: (1) all sampled reads from that habitat, across all subjects, and (2) all sampled reads from all habitats, across all subjects. We note the behavior of expected PD, the solid lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002832-g006">Figure 6</xref>: expected phylogenetic diversity as a function of sample size is close to a power law: this is precisely what we would expect for random sampling from a power-law EAD, just as we saw in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002832-g003">Figure 3</xref>.</p>

Solid lines represent expected PD from random sampling as a function of expected number of tips, dashed lines represent an upper bound on the 95% confidence interval computed using the variance in sampled PD (see Supplementary Information). Points represent actual PD from each of seven human subjects on one sampling day, with subjects labeled by a letter (M or F indicating male or female) and an identifying number. On the top row the reference metacommunity is all reads from <italic>that</italic> specified habitat, pooled across all seven subjects, and on the bottom row the metacommunity is all sampled reads across all subjects <italic>and</italic> all habitats. Our central conclusion is that while most samples are consistent with phylogenetic clustering, irrespective of the metacommunity, a minority of communities are consistent with overdispersed sampling from the smaller metacommunity, but clustered sampling from the larger.</p>

          </fig>
          <p>Next, we see that larger metacommunities make local samples more likely to appear clustered. There are clear differences between these two example habitats in terms of the range of PD across subjects. For metacommunity (1) we see that most samples are phylogenetically clustered, but several of them are overdispersed. In contrast, from metacommunity (2) <italic>all</italic> samples are consistent with phylogenetically-clustered sampling. This demonstrates the importance of metacommunity size on distinguishing between hypotheses of environmental filtering and competitive exclusion.</p>
          <p>Finally, increasing Local Community Resolution reveals variation in local clustering and overdispersion. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002832-g007">Figure 7</xref> we address the question of whether the microbiome of a given human subject is consistent with clustered, random, or overdispersed sampling. We consider local communities comprising all reads from a given individual, with metacommunities defined using all reads from all subjects on a single sample date. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002832-g007">Figure 7(B)</xref> we plot each subject as a single point, seeing that all individuals are consistent with clustered sampling. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002832-g007">Figure 7(A)</xref> we zoom in to one subject, plotting their microbiome PD as a cloud of individual habitats.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this manuscript we have developed a new, analytical method to quantify and distinguish different hypothesis for the phylogenetic structure of ecological communities. Our approach centers around a new characterization of phylogenetic tree shape, which we term the Edge-length Abundance Distribution (EAD), and we find that this distribution is analogous and complementary to the Species Abundance Distribution (SAD) in taxonomic sampling theory. We observe that the EAD follows a roughly power-law distribution across a number of communities within the human microbiome. Power-law patterns in the distribution of branch lengths have been observed before in phylogenetic trees <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Herrada1">[41]</xref>, but while intriguing, the relevance of these patterns was not clear. What makes this pattern different is that, just like the SAD and taxonomic diversity, the definition of the EAD is not arbitrary: it has an essential role in connecting local and regional diversity. An important next step will be to identify what kinds of ecological mechanisms and constraints can give rise to particular types of Edge-length Abundance Distribution, including approximately power law distributions.</p>
      <p>We applied this theoretical framework to investigate whether phylogenetic diversity (PD) of local communities from the human microbiome is greater or less than the expected PD for randomly drawn samples from a metacommunity. Local community PD lower than random has been associated with the hypothesis of environmental filtering, while local community PD greater than random (phylogenetic overdispersion) has been associated with competition and competitive exclusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Mouquet1">[27]</xref>. Taking as our local communities the set of organisms sampled from a single habitat from a single human subject, we observed a wide range of variation across habitats and across subjects in terms of deviation from the random hypothesis. On the other hand, it is not clear yet how to quantitatively connect these deviations to ecological processes, indicating that sampling schemes with a direct connection to ecological mechanism may in the longer term be more relevant than the phenomenological sampling schemes we have explored in this manuscript.</p>
      <p>Our results set the scene for a much more rigorous investigation of these issues, and we see three main future directions. For the first time, our framework has made the phylogenetic analysis of large microbial metacommunities analytically tractable, and we find that metacommunity size is highly relevant in our proof-of-principle analysis of human microbiome communities. This confirms the expectation that our conclusions about community assembly depend crucially on the definition of the metacommunity, and indicates the need for a very careful definition of the metacommunity to fully understand the processes structuring local phylogenetic diversity. Second, we have adapted tools from taxonomic sampling and applied them in a phylogenetic context, but this provides just the first steps towards developing a comprehensive theoretical toolbox for distinguishing hypotheses and predicting patterns. Directly characterizing ecological mechanisms, for example dispersal limitation, in terms of our phylogenetic sampling theory will provide a clearer connection between ecological process and phylogenetic patterns.</p>
      <p>Finally, we have focused here on the total phylogenetic diversity of local communities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Faith1">[20]</xref>. This is the analogue of looking at total species richness alone as a way to distinguish between different hypotheses. In studies of taxonomic diversity, species abundances have provided a way to distinguish quantitatively between different types of community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Preston1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-May1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Sugihara1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Rosenzweig1">[43]</xref>, to extrapolate taxonomic diversity to scales far beyond our samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Curtis1">[17]</xref> and to connect taxonomic pattern and mechanistic processes more clearly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-May1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Hubbell1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Sloan1">[44]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002832-Jeraldo1">[46]</xref> than using species richness alone. We do not yet have the overarching phylogenetic theory with which we can distinguish between environmental selection, competition, dispersal and stochasticity. But the application of our framework with mechanistically-based sampling schemes has the potential to put phylogenetic diversity on this same quantitative footing as taxonomic diversity, potentially allowing us to extrapolate PD from local samples to much larger scales, and to distinguish between different ecological hypotheses more effectively.</p>
