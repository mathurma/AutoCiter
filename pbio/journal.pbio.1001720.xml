<p>Wdpcp, a protein required for both planar cell polarity and ciliogenesis, regulates cell polarity and alignment via direct modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Planar cell polarity (PCP) regulates cell alignment required for collective cell movement during embryonic development. This requires PCP/PCP effector proteins, some of which also play essential roles in ciliogenesis, highlighting the long-standing question of the role of the cilium in PCP. Wdpcp, a PCP effector, was recently shown to regulate both ciliogenesis and collective cell movement, but the underlying mechanism is unknown. Here we show Wdpcp can regulate PCP by direct modulation of the actin cytoskeleton. These studies were made possible by recovery of a <italic>Wdpcp</italic> mutant mouse model. <italic>Wdpcp</italic>-deficient mice exhibit phenotypes reminiscent of Bardet–Biedl/Meckel–Gruber ciliopathy syndromes, including cardiac outflow tract and cochlea defects associated with PCP perturbation. We observed Wdpcp is localized to the transition zone, and in Wdpcp-deficient cells, Sept2, Nphp1, and Mks1 were lost from the transition zone, indicating Wdpcp is required for recruitment of proteins essential for ciliogenesis. Wdpcp is also found in the cytoplasm, where it is localized in the actin cytoskeleton and in focal adhesions. Wdpcp interacts with Sept2 and is colocalized with Sept2 in actin filaments, but in Wdpcp-deficient cells, Sept2 was lost from the actin cytoskeleton, suggesting Wdpcp is required for Sept2 recruitment to actin filaments. Significantly, organization of the actin filaments and focal contacts were markedly changed in Wdpcp-deficient cells. This was associated with decreased membrane ruffling, failure to establish cell polarity, and loss of directional cell migration. These results suggest the PCP defects in <italic>Wdpcp</italic> mutants are not caused by loss of cilia, but by direct disruption of the actin cytoskeleton. Consistent with this, <italic>Wdpcp</italic> mutant cochlea has normal kinocilia and yet exhibits PCP defects. Together, these findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that a PCP component required for ciliogenesis can directly modulate the actin cytoskeleton to regulate cell polarity and directional cell migration.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Cilia are microscopic cell surface hair-like protrusions that can act as antennae to mediate cell signaling. Mutations disrupting ciliogenesis can cause many developmental anomalies associated with syndromes known as “ciliopathies.” Some developmental defects, such as limb polydactyly, arise from disruption of cilia-transduced sonic hedgehog signaling, while other defects, such as aberrant patterning of hair cells in the inner ear, arise from disrupted Wnt signaling resulting in modulation of planar cell polarity (PCP)—a process whereby cells are polarized and aligned. While ciliopathy phenotypes would suggest that cilia are involved in modulating PCP, the mechanistic link between cilia and PCP has been elusive. Our study using a mouse model carrying a mutation in <italic>Wdpcp</italic>, a gene required for both ciliogenesis and PCP, suggest that Wdpcp modulation of PCP involves interactions with the actin cytoskeleton separate from its function in ciliogenesis. We observe Wdpcp localization in cilia, where it is required for recruitment of proteins essential for ciliogenesis. Wdpcp interacts with Sept2, and is also found in actin filaments, where it regulates actin dynamics essential for PCP. Together, these findings show that PCP regulation by Wdpcp is distinct from its function in ciliogenesis and involves direct modulation of the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cilium is a microtubule-based organelle projecting from the cell surface with a variety of signaling functions. It plays an important role in development as indicated by the wide spectrum of birth defects associated with ciliopathy syndromes such as Bardet–Biedl (BBS) and Meckel–Gruber (MKS) syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Badano1">[1]</xref>. Studies in mice showed some of the developmental anomalies associated with BBS and MKS, such as limb polydactyly, arise from the disruption of Sonic hedgehog (Shh) signaling, a process well described to be cilia transduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Caspary1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Huangfu2">[4]</xref>. This entails the regulated trafficking of Shh receptors Patched-1 (Ptch1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Rohatgi1">[5]</xref> and Smoothened (Smo) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Corbit1">[6]</xref> into the cilia, and the cilium sequestration and processing of Gli transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Haycraft1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Wen1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>Ciliopathy syndromes also exhibit developmental anomalies arising from disruption of Wnt signaling. Noncanonical or β-catenin–independent Wnt signaling specifies planar cell polarity (PCP), a process whereby cells organize and align in a polarized manner relative to the plane of the epithelium. PCP regulated convergent extension cell movement is required for neural tube closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Hildebrandt1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Wang1">[11]</xref>, and patterning of stereocilia polarity in the cochlea requires asymmetric localization of PCP core components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Montcouquiol1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Wang3">[14]</xref>. While the mechanistic link between the cilia and PCP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Jones1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Sipe1">[17]</xref> is not known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Wallingford2">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Vladar1">[19]</xref>, it is worth noting some PCP components are cilia localized and are required for ciliogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Saburi1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Park1">[22]</xref>. As cilia disruption can elevate canonical Wnt signaling, the cilium is also proposed to play a role in canonical or β-catenin–dependent Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Corbit2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Simons1">[24]</xref>. This may entail maintaining the balance between canonical versus noncanonical Wnt signaling, since cilia disruption can cause opposing effects on canonical versus noncanonical Wnt signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Simons1">[24]</xref>.</p>
<p>In this study, we investigated the role of <italic>Wdpcp</italic> and the cilia in regulating planar cell polarity using a <italic>Wdpcp</italic> mutant mouse model. <italic>Wdpcp</italic> is the homolog of <italic>Drosophila Fritz</italic>, a PCP effector required for patterning hair cell orientation in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> pupal wing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Collier1">[25]</xref>. Studies in <italic>Xenopus</italic> embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Kim1">[26]</xref> showed <italic>Fritz</italic> regulates ciliogenesis and PCP-dependent collective cell movement during gastrulation. However, the role of the cilia and <italic>Wdpcp</italic> (<italic>Fritz</italic>) in the regulation of cell polarity and polarized cell migration was unknown. In this study, we show mice deficient for Wdpcp have phenotypes consistent with MKS/BBS ciliopathy syndromes. This included disruption of ciliogenesis together with developmental anomalies consistent with PCP perturbations. We show Wdpcp is localized in the ciliary transition zone, and also in the actin cytoskeleton and focal adhesions. This involves Wdpcp interactions with Sept2 (septin 2), both in the cilia transition zone and in the actin cytoskeleton. Significantly, the Wdpcp-deficient cells not only exhibited ciliogenesis defect, but also global disruption in the actin cytoskeleton required for maintaining cell polarity and polarized cell migration. To our knowledge, these studies provide the first evidence that a PCP component required for ciliogenesis can regulate planar cell polarity by directly modulating the actin cytoskeleton.</p>

<p>(A–I) Necropsy showed <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> neonatal mutants have a wide spectrum of defects including facial cleft and anophthalmia (arrowhead in A), polydactyly (B, C), intestinal cysts (D), duplex kidney (black arrowheads in E) with glomerular cysts (white arrows in E), outflow tract defect consisting of a single common trunk (asterisk in G), and cloaca septation defect with abnormal connection between the intestine and bladder (box region in I).

<p>We mapped the mutation to a 6.36 Mb interval delimited by SNP rs26841005 and rs26856862 on mouse chromosome 11. RT-PCR analysis was carried out using RNA extracted from E12.5 hearts of <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant embryos to interrogate transcript expression from the 36 genes in the mapped interval. This analysis revealed an anomalous transcript from <italic>Wdpcp</italic> (NM_145425.3 and NP_663400.2). Further sequencing analysis suggested this was derived from a splicing defect mutation, which was confirmed with genomic DNA sequencing. An A to G substitution was observed at nucleotide 224 of the mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), corresponding to the 8<sup>th</sup> base before the splice donor site of exon 5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As a result, a premature stop codon (S54X) is generated, causing protein truncation after amino acid 54 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Quantitative PCR analysis with primers covering exons 5–6 showed only low trace amount (0.6%) of normal transcripts, suggesting <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> is essentially a null or strong hypomorphic <italic>Wdpcp</italic> mutant allele.</p>

(I–M) Immunostaining of MEFs showed Wdpcp (red, I: Wdpcp) localized in ring-like structure at the base of the cilia (green, I: anti-cetylated α-tubulin). Sept2 (green) showed colocalization with Wdpcp (red, panels L and M). The arrowheads (J–L) point to Wdpcp (J, L) and Sept2 staining (K, L).

A similar distribution was observed in NIH-3T3 cells transfected with Wdpcp–FLAG, a FLAG-tagged expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g002">Figure 2E–H</xref>). The Wdpcp ring-like structure in the cilium showed colocalization with Sept2, which is known to be present as a ring in the ciliary transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g002">Figure 2I–M</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s008">Movie S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Kim1">[26]</xref>. In <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs, no specific Wdpcp immunostaining was observed, consistent with <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> being a loss-of-function allele (see below). Even in rare <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs that are ciliated, Sept2 was usually not detected in the cilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g003">Figure 3I–L</xref>; 11 of 12 with no Sept2 staining; one with very low Sept2 staining).

<p>To further interrogate the role of Wdpcp in ciliogenesis, we examined <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs for the distribution of Nphp1, a protein also found in the ciliary transition zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Fliegauf1">[29]</xref>, and Mks1, a transition zone protein expressed only in the mother centriole and required for basal body docking to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Cui1">[27]</xref>. Both proteins are known to be required for ciliogenesis. Analysis of the rare ciliated <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs revealed Nphp1 was mislocalized to adjacent regions, such as in the basal body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g003">Figure 3E–H</xref>; five of eight cilia), while Mks1 was absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g003">Figure 3M–P</xref>; 9 of 12 cilia). In comparison, Nphp1 (25 out of 27) and Mks1 (17 out of 21) were found in the cilia transition zone and basal body, respectively, of wild-type MEFs (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01). These results show Wdpcp is required for recruitment of Mks1 and Nphp1 to the ciliary transition zone. However, Mks1 is not required for Wdpcp recruitment to the cilia, as <italic>Mks1</italic> mutant MEFs showed normal distribution of Wdpcp in the ciliary transition zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g003">Figure 3Q–T</xref>). In comparison, Ift88 distribution in the ciliary axoneme and basal body was unchanged in <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs, indicating IFT transport is not disrupted by Wdpcp deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g003">Figure 3A–D</xref>). Together, these observations suggest the ciliogenesis defect in <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs arises from the combined loss of Sept2, Nphp1, and Mks1 from the ciliary transition zone.</p>

<title>Wdpcp Required for Motile Cilia Function in Zebrafish But Not Mouse Embryos</title>
<p>To examine whether Wdpcp also may play a role in motile cilia function, we examined cilia in the mouse embryonic node and in the trachea airway epithelium. The mouse embryonic node (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s001">Figure S1C</xref>,D) exhibited a normal pattern of ciliation with motile cilia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s007">Movie S1</xref>) that generated effective flow (unpublished data). This is consistent with the absence of laterality defects in the <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants. Similarly, the trachea airway epithelia from E17.5 <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant embryos were ciliated, and the cilia were motile and exhibited normal cilia motility (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s009">Movie S3</xref>).</p>
<p>In zebrafish, <italic>wdpcp</italic> is expressed starting from 10 somite stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–O), and surprisingly, <italic>wdpcp</italic> morpholino (MO) knockdown resulted in a constellation of defects indicative of motile cilia defects. This included curved body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), pericardial effusion and kidney cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), hydrocephalus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g004">Figure 4D</xref>), and increased number of otoliths (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Consistent with motile cilia defects, <italic>wdpcp</italic> morphants exhibited a 20% incidence of heterotaxy (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s003">Figure S3</xref>). <italic>Wdpcp</italic> morphants also exhibited kidney cysts (20%) and cilia disarray in the pronephric tubule, which were more pronounced proximally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g004">Figure 4G–L</xref>). Videomicroscopy showed abnormal cilia motility throughout the pronephric tubule (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s010">Movie S4</xref>). As observed in the <italic>Wdpcp</italic> mouse mutants, some <italic>wdpcp</italic> zebrafish morphants (37%; <italic>N</italic> = 208) exhibited obstructed cloaca (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s003">Figure S3K</xref>–P). This was not correlated with the pronephric cilia disarray, as cilia disarray was observed in 38% of morphants with cloaca obstruction (<italic>n</italic> = 63) and 50% without cloaca obstruction (<italic>n</italic> = 82). Wdpcp antibody staining showed punctate Wdpcp localization in the ciliary axoneme in the pronephric tubule (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), which was lost with <italic>wdpcp</italic> MO knockdown (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g004">Figure 4E</xref>).

<p>These findings suggest that unlike mouse embryos, Wdpcp is required for motile cilia function in zebrafish embryos. This raises the question of whether the <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> allele is a null mutation or if it might have residual function that could account for the differences between the mouse and fish phenotypes. To examine this question, we generated a <italic>Wdpcp</italic> knockout mouse model by gene targeting (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s005">Figure S5A</xref>). Breeding of mice carrying the knockout allele showed homozygous <italic>Wdpcp</italic> knockout mice died at birth with the same spectrum of developmental anomalies seen in <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants, including anopthalmia, cleft palate, heart outflow tract (OFT) septation defects, duplex kidney, limb polydactyly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001720.s005">Figure S5B</xref>–E), and multiple organ cysts. As in <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants, no laterality defects were noted.

<title>Wdpcp Modulation of Actin Stress Fibers</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanism by which <italic>Wdpcp</italic> may regulate PCP, we further examined Wdpcp distribution in the cytoplasm, in particular its interaction with Sept2, which is known to associate with the actin cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Kinoshita1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Joo1">[35]</xref>.

Given the known role of Sept2 in associating with and stabilizing actin filaments, we investigated whether Wdpcp and Sept2 may be colocalized in actin filaments. Phalloidin staining to visualize actin filaments together with double immunostaining with Sept2 and Wdpcp antibodies indeed showed regions of Wdpcp and Sept2 colocalization in actin stress fibers in wild-type MEFs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g007">Figure 7A–H</xref>).

<title>Wdpcp and Sept2 Interaction</title>
<p>To interrogate Wdpcp interaction with Sept2, we carried out coimmunoprecipitation experiments to determine if Wdpcp and Sept2 may be found in the same protein complex. For these experiments, HEK-293 cells that were either transiently or stably expressing FLAG-tagged Wdpcp (FLAG–Wdpcp) were transfected with Sept2–GFP. Western blotting of total cell lysates using an anti-FLAG antibody gave the expected 90 kDa (722 AA for Wdpcp plus 3× FLAG tag) in the stably transfected cells (lane 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g008">Figure 8A</xref>), but not in nontransfected cells (lane 1, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g008">Figure 8A</xref>).

<p>HEK-293 cells expressing FLAG-tagged Wdpcp and Sept2–GFP were lysed and immunoprecipitated with a FLAG antibody, and the immunoprecipitates were then analyzed by gel electrophoresis and Western blotted in triplicates for immunodetection with a FLAG (A), GFP (B), and Sept2 (C) antibody. FLAG-tagged Wdpcp was observed to coimmunoprecipitate with Sept2–GFP and Sept2 (lanes 7 and 8). The eight lanes included: untransfected whole cell lysate (lane 1), whole cell lysate of cells stably transfected with FLAG–Wdpcp and transiently transfected with Sept2–GFP (lane 2), whole cell lysate of cells transiently transfected with Flag–Wdpcp and Sept2–GFP (lane 3), blank immunoprecipitation elution control (lane 4), immunoprecipitation negative control of untransfected cell lysate (lane 5), FLAG immunoprecipitation of FLAG-bacterial alkaline phosphatase (lane 6), FLAG immunoprecipitation of cells stably transfected with FLAG–Wdpcp and cotransfected with Sept2–GFP (lane 7), and FLAG immunoprecipitation of cells transiently transfected with Sept2–GFP and FLAG–Wdpcp (lane 8).</p>

<p>As cell motility requires actin remodeling coordinated with the assembly/disassembly of focal contact, we further examined the role of Wdpcp in the modulation of focal adhesion contacts. Phalloidin, anti-Wdpcp, and anti-vinculin triple staining showed Wdpcp is enriched in the cell cortex, where it is extensively colocalized with vinculin at points of actin filament insertion into focal adhesions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g009">Figure 9I–L</xref>). While wild-type MEFs exhibited elongated focal contacts, focal contacts in mutant MEFs appeared to be smaller and more round in shape (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g009">Figure 9M,N</xref>). Quantitative analysis showed the average size of focal adhesion contacts was decreased in the mutant MEFs (0.37 µm<sup>2</sup> versus 0.32 µm<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g009">Figure 9M,N</xref>).

<title>Wdpcp Modulates Polarized Cell Migration</title>
<p>To investigate the role of Wdpcp in polarized cell migration, we carried out a wound-scratch assay to examine the ability of the <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs to engage in directional cell migration to fill the wound gap. For this analysis, wild-type and <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs were grown to confluence, and then a wound gap was created to assess directional cell migration required for wound closure. Wild-type MEFs migrated into the wound gap in a highly organized manner with cells aligned with the direction of wound closure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g010">Figure 10A</xref>). In contrast, mutant MEFs migrated in a haphazard manner with no consistent cell alignment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001720-g010">Figure 10B</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We showed <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic>, a mouse mutant with a wide spectrum of developmental defects consistent with MKS/BBS ciliopathy syndromes, harbors a <italic>Wdpcp</italic> loss of function mutation. We generated a <italic>Wdpcp</italic> knockout mouse model, which exhibited identical phenotypes to those seen in the <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants. A role for <italic>Wdpcp</italic> in human disease is suggested by a previous finding of a homozygous <italic>WDPCP</italic> mutation in a screen of MKS/BBS patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Kim1">[26]</xref>.

Surprisingly, <italic>wdpcp</italic> MO knockdown in zebrafish embryos did not disrupt ciliogenesis, but perturbed motile cilia function. This was associated with a low incidence of heterotaxy.

<title>Wdpcp Regulates Ciliogenesis via Recruitment of Ciliary Proteins</title>
<p>Our findings indicate the ciliogenesis defect in <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants arises from the failure of <italic>Wdpcp</italic>-deficient cells to recruit proteins required for ciliogenesis to the ciliary transition zone, including Nphp1, Sept2, and Mks1. Wdpcp is observed to form a ring structure in the ciliary transition zone overlapping with Sept2. Septins are well described to form ring structures both in vitro and in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Meseroll1">[37]</xref>. In the ciliary transition zone, the septin ring forms a diffusion barrier regulating protein trafficking into the ciliary compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Hu1">[38]</xref>. Thus, failure to recruit Sept2 to the transition zone in <italic>Wdpcp</italic>-deficient cells is expected to disrupt ciliogenesis. Wdpcp-deficient cells also failed to recruit Mks1, a Meckel syndrome–associated protein localized to the mother centriole and required for basal body docking to the membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Cui1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Weatherbee1">[28]</xref>. Analysis of Mks1-deficient cells showed Wdpcp acts upstream of Mks1. We also observed Wdpcp-deficient cells with mislocalization of Nphp1, a cilia transition zone protein required for ciliogenesis and associated with cystic kidney defects in Joubert syndrome and other ciliopathies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Castori1">[39]</xref>. Together these findings indicate Wdpcp may play an important role in recruiting proteins essential for ciliogenesis. Consistent with this is the presence of two WD repeats in the Wdpcp protein. The WD40 domain has been identified in many protein interaction pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Stirnimann1">[40]</xref>, and many WD40 repeat-containing proteins have been shown to serve as scaffolds for assembly of multiprotein complexes.

<title><italic>Wdpcp</italic> Constrains Hedgehog and Canonical Wnt Signaling</title>
<p>While our studies with <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant MEFs showed Wdpcp deficiency disrupted Shh signaling, surprisingly the loss of Wdpcp function partially rescued the severe defect phenotypes of the <italic>Ptch1</italic> or <italic>Smo</italic> knockout embryos. This suggests <italic>Wdpcp</italic> may constrain Shh signaling downstream of <italic>Smo</italic>/<italic>Ptch1</italic>. As ciliogenesis is disrupted with Wdpcp deficiency, how Gli processing required for Shh activation is regulated in the <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup>/Ptch1</italic> or <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup>/Smo</italic> knockout embryos is unknown. However, it is worth noting <italic>Drosophila</italic> hedgehog signaling occurs in the absence of the cilium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Yoder1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our studies also suggested Wdpcp may have a role in constraining canonical Wnt signaling, as BAT–lacZ and the expression of canonical Wnt transducers (<italic>Dvl1/2/3</italic>) are upregulated, while canonical Wnt inhibitors were down-regulated (<italic>Dkk1/2/3</italic>) in the <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutant OFT. While a role for the cilium in constraining canonical Wnt signaling is well described, the mechanism remains unclear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Wallingford2">[18]</xref>. We note Chibby, a basal body protein that negatively regulates canonical Wnt signaling, can bind β-catenin and prevent its entry into the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Takemaru1">[42]</xref>. One possibility to consider is whether Wdpcp may function in the same multiprotein complex with Chibby to regulate β-catenin trafficking.</p>

<title>Wdpcp Modulates PCP and the Actin Cytoskeleton</title>
<p>We showed <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants exhibited PCP defects, such as malpatterning of stereocilia in the cochlea and abnormal myocardialization of the outflow tract in the heart. The myocardialization defect was characterized by failure of the invading cardiomyocytes to elongate and align their actin cytoskeleton with the direction of cell migration. We note the <italic>Loop-tail</italic> (<italic>Lp</italic>) mouse mutant harboring a mutation in the PCP component, <italic>Vangl2</italic>, also exhibits outflow tract defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Phillips1">[31]</xref>. Similar to our findings, in the <italic>Lp</italic> mutant cell protrusions into the outflow cushion were absent, and the organization of the actin cytoskeleton was disrupted. Perturbation of the actin cytoskeleton also may contribute to defects in the cochlea, as the stereocilia are actin-based structures and in <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants, formation of the kinocilia was not affected. While cochlea expression of Vangl2 was reduced in <italic>Wdpcp<sup>Cys40</sup></italic> mutants, we did not observe mislocalization of PCP core components that would suggest a disruption in PCP signaling.</p>
<p>Using Wdpcp-deficient MEFs, we investigated the role of Wdpcp in establishing planar cell polarity. Our studies indicate Wdpcp plays an essential role in PCP via regulation of the actin cytoskeleton. We showed Wdpcp modulates the actin cytoskeleton by mediating Sept2 interaction with actin. In wild-type cells, Wdpcp is colocalized with Sept2 in actin filaments, but in Wdpcp-deficient cells, Sept2 is no longer actin localized and actin stress fibers are largely absent. Instead, Sept2 is observed in “o” and “c” configurations, structures also observed with inhibition of actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Schmidt1">[36]</xref>. These results suggest formation of a Wdpcp–Sept2 complex may be required for Sept2 binding to actin filaments and the stabilization of actin filaments. Coimmunoprecipitation and Western immunoblotting confirmed Wdpcp and Sept2 localization in the same protein complex, but further experiments are needed to examine Wdpcp and Sept2 interaction with actin filaments.</p>
<p>A further indication of a role for Wdpcp in the modulation of actin dynamics was the reduction in membrane ruffling in Wdpcp mutant MEFs. We noted Wdpcp is enriched in the cell cortex where actin filaments insert into vinculin-containing focal adhesions. As focal contacts are also sites of actin polymerization, the abundance of Wdpcp in the vicinity of focal contacts may facilitate recruitment of Sept2 to enhance actin filament stabilization and stress fiber formation. We observed Wdpcp-deficient cells had smaller focal contacts, but with significantly higher concentration of vinculin. This could account for the failure of cell processes to disengage from the substratum in Wdpcp-deficient cells.</p>
<p>Most significantly, Wdpcp-deficient cells showed defects in motile cell behavior that was associated with defects in planar cell polarization. Thus, Wdpcp-deficient cells were unable to establish cell polarity in a wound scratch assay. This is indicated by failure of the Golgi to reorient to the cell's leading edge and align with the direction of cell migration. As a result, migrating cells were unable to engage in directional cell motility. It is significant to note that Golgi orientation is specified by the microtubule-organizing center or centrosome, which also templates formation of the cilium. This defect in establishing cell polarity together with perturbation in membrane and actin dynamics and the modulation of focal adhesion contacts may underlie the PCP defects associated with Wdpcp deficiency. Together, these findings suggest Wdpcp may regulate planar cell polarity by modulating both the microfilament and microtubule cytoskeleton.</p>

<title>Dual Functionality of Wdpcp in Ciliogenesis and PCP</title>
<p>We showed the PCP effector Wdpcp plays an essential role in both ciliogenesis and PCP. This appears to involve separable functions of Wdpcp in recruitment of proteins to the ciliary transition zone required for ciliogenesis, and in the modulation of actin dynamics in the cytoplasm. Our findings provide the first evidence, to our knowledge, that a PCP component required for ciliogenesis can directly modulate the actin cytoskeleton to regulate planar cell polarity and directional cell migration. These observations suggest Wdpcp regulation of PCP is independent of its role in ciliogenesis. It is interesting to consider whether such dual functionality may have evolved as a means to functionally integrate pathways regulating ciliogenesis with those regulating PCP and the cytoskeleton. Whether such dual functionality may account for other PCP proteins known to be required for ciliogenesis is an important question that needs to be addressed in future studies.</p>

<title>Quantitative Analysis of Vinculin-Containing Focal Adhesions</title>
<p>Focal adhesions were visualized using a vinculin antibody (Sigma V9264, 1∶1,000). The area of vinculin immunostaining was traced using the image editor Gimp (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.gimp.org" xlink:type="simple">www.gimp.org</ext-link>), and the area and intensity of staining were measured in 8-bit images. To quantify the length and roundness of vinculin-containing focal adhesion sites, we measured the major axis (MA) and minor axes (MI) of each focal adhesion. The mean MA length was determined and was plotted as a histogram with bin size of 10 pixels (equivalent to 0.57 µm). The roundness factor for each focal adhesion contact was measured using MI/MA*100, with 100 being focal adhesions that were perfectly round with major and minor axes of equal length.</p>

<title>Time-Lapse Videomicroscopy for Assessing Cell Motile Behavior</title>
<p>Time-lapse videomicroscopy was carried out to quantify the motile behavior of wild-type and <italic>Wdpcp</italic> mutant MEFs using an inverted microscope (Leica, DMIRE2) and a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera. Video sequences encompassing an 8 h recording period with images captured every 10 min were used to measured the number of cells having one or more filopodia/total number of cells (percentage of cells with filopodia), and we also measured the number of frames in which the same filopodia was observed (persistence of filopodia). To quantify membrane ruffling activity, we recorded cultured cells at a shorter time-lapse interval comprising 10 s for a total of 30 min. These time-lapse images were then used to measure the frequency of brightness change at the cells' leading edge to quantitate the membrane ruffling activity. This entailed selecting boxed regions from the leading edge of a migrating cell, summing the brightness for each frame, and performing Fourier transform to obtain the frequency of brightness changes. The inverse of this frequency provided an index of the “period” of membrane fluctuation (MFP, in seconds), which is a measure of membrane dynamics, with greater membrane ruffling indicated by lower MFP.</p>

<title>Wound Scratch Assay for Assaying Polarized Cell Migration</title>

Then time-lapse imaging was carried out using a 40× objective on an inverted microscope (Leica, DMIRE2) with images captured every 10 s over a 30 min interval using a Hamamatsu ORCA-ER camera. To examine cell polarity, cells were immunostained with a Golgi antibody (Sigma HPA021799, 1∶1,000) followed by DAPI staining. Cells that are polarized and aligned with the direction of migration have Golgi situated in front of the nucleus (forward facing) and aligned with the migration direction. Polarity was scored by overlaying a clock face on each cell, and polarized cells are defined as those with Golgi situated within a 60° sector centered along the direction of wound closure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Magdalena1">[53]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001720-Nobes1">[54]</xref>.</p>
