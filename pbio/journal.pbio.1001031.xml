        <p>Myosins are ATP-driven linear molecular motors that work as cellular force
                    generators, transporters, and force sensors. These functions are driven by
                    large-scale nucleotide-dependent conformational changes, termed
                    “strokes”; the “power stroke” is the force-generating
                    swinging of the myosin light chain–binding “neck” domain
                    relative to the motor domain “head” while bound to actin; the
                    “recovery stroke” is the necessary initial motion that primes, or
                    “cocks,” myosin while detached from actin. Myosin Va is a processive
                    dimer that steps unidirectionally along actin following a “hand over
                    hand” mechanism in which the trailing head detaches and steps forward
                    ∼72 nm. Despite large rotational Brownian motion of the detached head about
                    a free joint adjoining the two necks, unidirectional stepping is achieved, in
                    part by the power stroke of the attached head that moves the joint forward.
                    However, the power stroke alone cannot fully account for preferential forward
                    site binding since the orientation and angle stability of the detached head,
                    which is determined by the properties of the recovery stroke, dictate actin
                    binding site accessibility. Here, we directly observe the recovery stroke
                    dynamics and fluctuations of myosin Va using a novel, transient caged
                    ATP-controlling system that maintains constant ATP levels through stepwise
                    UV-pulse sequences of varying intensity. We immobilized the neck of monomeric
                    myosin Va on a surface and observed real time motions of bead(s) attached
                    site-specifically to the head. ATP induces a transient swing of the neck to the
                    post-recovery stroke conformation, where it remains for ∼40 s, until ATP
                    hydrolysis products are released. Angle distributions indicate that the
                    post-recovery stroke conformation is stabilized by ≥5
                        <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic> of energy. The high kinetic
                    and energetic stability of the post-recovery stroke conformation favors
                    preferential binding of the detached head to a forward site 72 nm away. Thus,
                    the recovery stroke contributes to unidirectional stepping of myosin Va.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Myosin Va is a “two-legged” ATP-dependent linear molecular motor that
                    transports cellular organelles by “stepping” along actin filaments
                    in a processive manner analogous to human walking, the two “feet”
                    alternating between forward and backward positions. During stepping, the lifted
                    leg undergoes rotational Brownian movements around a free joint at the
                    leg–leg junction. Although these movements are random, the lifted foot
                    lands preferentially on forward sites and rarely steps backward. This
                    directional bias arises in part from the forward movement of the junction
                    bending the “ankle” of the attached leg. Here, we show that the
                    lifted foot also plays a role in the direction of stepping by controlling the
                    orientation of its actin-binding site (the “sole”), which dictates
                    the accessibility of potential stepping positions. We observed the ATP-dependent
                    foot orientation and its stabilizing on individual myosin Va molecules in real
                    time under an optical microscope; we show that the lifted foot of walking myosin
                    Va is oriented in a “toe-down” conformation so that binding to a
                    forward site on actin is preferred largely over backward or adjacent sites.
                    Thus, the great kinetic and energetic stability of the myosin Va lifted foot
                    conformation contributes to unidirectional stepping along actin filaments.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Myosin is an ATP-driven linear molecular motor that produces force and unidirectional
                movement along actin filaments. The “swinging lever arm” hypothesis
                proposes that small nucleotide-dependent movements at the catalytic ATPase active
                site are amplified by rotation of the myosin “lever arm,” or
                “neck,” light chain–binding domain that extends from the motor
                domain, or “head” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Sweeney1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Spudich1">[2]</xref>. In the myosin chemomechanical cycle, the lever arm swing
                that propels the myosin motor forward along actin is referred to as the “power
                stroke” and is accepted as a general mechanism for myosin contractility. The
                “recovery stroke” is the essential motion that primes, or
                “cocks,” the lever arm in the pre-power stroke position while myosin is
                detached from actin. These strokes are the basis for the physiological functions of
                all characterized myosin motors.</p>
      <p>Myosin Va is a cargo transporter in cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Trybus1">[3]</xref> that has two heads, each
                connected to a long and relatively stiff neck <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Veigel1">[4]</xref> reinforced with six calmodulins
                    (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Myosin Va moves
                processively along actin filament and takes unidirectional “steps” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Mehta1">[5]</xref> in which it
                alternately places its two heads in forward positions ∼72 nm away from a
                previous binding site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Yildiz1">[6]</xref>, analogous to human bipedal walking. A mechanism for
                unidirectional stepping has been investigated and proposed as follows (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). When a head is
                detached off actin, the detached neck undergoes rotational Brownian fluctuations
                around a free joint at the neck–neck junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Shiroguchi1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Dunn1">[8]</xref>. Although the fluctuations are
                random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Shiroguchi1">[7]</xref>,
                the power stroke of the bound head <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Veigel1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Huxley1">[9]</xref> tilts the neck via “lever action” and moves
                the junction (i.e., the pivot point for the fluctuations) forward, thereby favoring
                binding of the detached head to a forward site.</p>

          <p>(A) Postulated recovery stroke during walking of intact myosin Va. Myosin Va
                        has two long necks (blue and green) reinforced with six calmodulin light
                        chains (small ellipsoids) and two catalytic heads (large ellipsoids) that
                        hydrolyze ATP. Walking (toward right) on an actin filament (magenta) begins
                        with binding of ATP to the trailing head to dissociate it from actin. The
                        leading neck (blue) then leans forward, powered by ATP hydrolysis
                        (presumably P<italic><sub>i</sub></italic> release) in the leading head. The
                        unbound neck (green) fluctuates around the neck–neck junction until
                        the head binds to a site ∼35 nm ahead of the blue head. If the
                        head–neck angle takes post-recovery stroke conformation, the actin
                        binding surface properly orients to bind actin only when the head is brought
                        forward. (B) Observation system. The neck portion of monomeric
                        (single-headed) myosin Va is fixed on a small bead (diameter, 50 nm; almost
                        invisible) through his-tagged calmodulin(s) and anti-his antibody(s). A
                        streptavidin-coated bead duplex (diameter 290 nm; clearly visible) is
                        attached to the myc-tagged head through biotinylated anti-myc antibody. UV
                        irradiation of caged ATP produces ATP, which is quickly consumed by apyrase
                        in the solution. Nonspecific binding of the neck portion to the small beads
                        occurred as well. (C) A time course of bead swings in response to UV flashes

      <p>This mechanism explains how a detached head can access a forward site, but not why it
                binds preferentially to a forward site 72 nm away as opposed to other accessible
                sites as, for example, a site adjacent to the bound head. For a detached head to
                bind actin, the actin-binding site of myosin must be properly oriented with respect
                to the actin filament. Therefore, since the position of the neck–neck junction
                relative to the actin filament is constrained by the bound neck, the orientation
                (angle) and stability of the detached head relative to its neck (head–neck
                angle) dictate the binding site along a filament. The detached head orientation is
                determined by the recovery stroke that occurs after ATP-induced detachment from
                actin. If the role of the recovery stroke were just to prime myosin, the
                head–neck angle could fluctuate significantly. This could allow for the
                unbound head to bind to a site near or adjacent to the bound head as well as to a
                site 72 nm away with similar frequency. Such a distribution of the step size,
                however, has never been observed in the absence of applied external load <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Mehta1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Yildiz1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Rief1">[10]</xref>. Therefore,
                another mechanism must exist.</p>
      <p>We anticipated that the recovery stroke plays a critical role in orientating the
                unbound head so that binding to a ∼72-nm forward site occurs preferentially
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Kinosita1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Ali1">[12]</xref>. In addition, it
                has been reported that myosin Va moves forward under ∼2 pN of backward load
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Mehta1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Rief1">[10]</xref> which would bring
                the junction back beyond the neutral position <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Veigel2">[13]</xref> or reverse the power stroke
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Sellers1">[14]</xref>, and
                cancels the bias introduced by the attached head power stroke. The additional role
                of the recovery stroke above can be another bias for forward stepping even in the
                presence of the load. Thus, the properties of the recovery stroke are critical for
                the myosin Va stepping mechanism.</p>
      <p>Several recent structural and kinetic studies have demonstrated the existence and
                implications of the myosin recovery stroke. High-resolution crystal structures of
                muscle myosin II <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Houdusse1">[15]</xref> identified different nucleotide-dependent head–neck
                angles in the absence of actin; these are thought to correspond to pre- and
                post-recovery stroke angles. Bulk Förster resonance energy transfer assays of
                myosin II revealed two <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Suzuki1">[16]</xref> or three <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Shih1">[17]</xref> nucleotide-dependent (averaged) transient angle
                distributions. In addition, electron microscopic analysis of myosin Va <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Burgess1">[18]</xref> showed two
                different orientations (i.e., projection angles) of heads relative to the neck,
                depending on the nucleotide in solution. These observations have contributed to a
                general model in which ATP binding triggers the recovery stroke, and phosphate
                        (P<italic><sub>i</sub></italic>) release after hydrolysis leads to
                relaxation of the recovery stroke (i.e., generation of the power stroke). However,
                the energetic and kinetic angle stability of the pre- and post-recovery stroke
                conformations of myosin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure
                    1A</xref>) and the manner in which they contribute to actin binding specificity
                during processive stepping of myosin Va remains unknown.</p>
      <p>We present in this study, to the best of our knowledge, the first direct observations
                of the myosin recovery stroke (angle change at head–neck junction) in real
                time and at the single molecule level. We developed a novel light-induced
                ATP-concentration controlling system and single motor molecule assay that enables
                the direct observation of the nucleotide-dependent dynamics and fluctuations of the
                myosin motor domain. Our observations and analysis indicate that the myosin Va motor
                conformation adopted after the recovery stroke is kinetically and energetically
                stable, which allows for the detached head to bind preferentially to a forward site
                72 nm away, thereby providing the grounds for biased forward stepping of myosin Va
                along actin filaments.</p>

        <p>We constructed an optical microscope observation system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) to directly visualize in real time
                    the nucleotide-dependent swings (i.e., strokes) and fluctuations of the myosin
                    head–neck angle using an engineered monomeric (single-headed,
                    “S1-like”) myosin Va (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We anticipated that a monomeric
                    myosin Va molecule with a 50-nm bead (gray) attached at its neck (configuration
                    depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) would
                    permit transient swinging of a 0.29-µm bead duplex (cyan) attached to the
                    distal head region. To determine how the head orientation, assayed from the bead
                    position of the 0.29-µm bead duplex, responds to ATP, we included 200
                    µM caged ATP and 1.7 mU µl<sup>−1</sup> apyrase in the
                    solution, such that ultraviolet (UV) irradiation generated an ATP transient that
                    was rapidly removed (hydrolyzed to AMP) by the apyrase with a time constant of
                    2–3 s (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s002">Figures S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g002">2B</xref>). We imaged a duplex (or a larger aggregate) of beads, and
                    initiated a full-intensity (∼2 nW µm<sup>−2</sup>, defined as
                    100%) UV pulse for 0.1 s that yielded a peak ATP concentration
                        ([ATP]<sub>peak</sub>) of ∼2 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s002">Figure S2</xref>).
                    Approximately 0.1% of duplexes made a distinct angular (&gt;30°
                    judged in real time) swing within several seconds of the UV flash. Such a low
                    frequency is not unexpected given the low probability of an unobstructed
                    configuration, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1B</xref> (drawn to scale in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s004">Figure S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>Myosin Va predominantly adopts two distinct conformations during an experiment: a
                    resting angle in the absence of ATP (i.e., before UV irradiation; cyan in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figures 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g003">3A</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s005">S5</xref>) and a
                    metastable angle (yellow) accessible only after ATP generation (save rare
                    excursions driven by Brownian fluctuations), interpreted as the post-power
                    stroke and pre-power stroke conformations of myosin Va, respectively.</p>
        <p>A large fraction (∼50%) of the beads that swung returned to the
                    original angle in less than 2 min, and the UV-induced transient swings could be
                    repeated multiple (&gt;2) times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g003">3A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s010">Video S1</xref>). We monitored 15 such duplexes (i.e., myosin Va molecules)
                    and analyzed a total of 121 swing–return pairs as detailed below. A subset
                    (∼20%) made two return swings and then detached from the surface or
                    remained immobile. The remaining ∼30% did not return or did not
                    respond to the second UV flash.</p>
        <p>Excursions to the post-recovery stroke “state” (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1C</xref> legend) are ATP (UV
                    flash)–dependent. Every UV irradiation lasting 0.1 s at 100%
                    intensity ([ATP]<sub>peak</sub> ∼ 2 µM) induced a bead swing
                    within a few seconds (0.78 s on average; 29 flashes in six molecules; e.g.,
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Shorter
                    and/or weaker irradiations yielded longer delays before a swing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s005">Figure S5A and
                        S5B</xref>) or no bead swings. UV irradiation while the bead duplex was in
                    the post-recovery stroke state, in contrast, never induced a swing: 37 flashes
                    of 0.1- or 0.2-s duration at 100% intensity failed to induce bead
                    rotation in six molecules (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). Thus, swings from the
                    pre-recovery stroke state are initiated and limited by ATP binding, and myosin
                    Va in the pre-recovery stroke state prior to a swinging event is free of bound
                    nucleotide.</p>

        <p>There were occasions where we observed momentary swings back to the pre-recovery

                    are unlikely to be purely Brownian excursions, because the bead tended to remain
                    at the pre-recovery stroke angle for a second or longer. A natural return
                    followed by immediate ATP binding that would induce a second swing is also
                    unlikely, because [ATP] must be negligibly low and these momentary
                    swings happened irrespective of the time after UV irradiation. The observed
                    momentary returns may represent reversal of the reaction responsible for the

        <title>A Role of the Recovery Stroke in Myosin Va Unidirectional Stepping</title>
        <p>The natural assumption is that the detached head accessing a forward site in the
                    post-recovery stroke conformation will have its actin binding site properly
                    oriented for productive binding to actin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Conversely, when the detached
                    head goes back to the post-recovery stroke conformation, the actin binding site
                    is predicted to be oriented incorrectly, thereby precluding actin binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). The kinetic
                    stability of the post-recovery stroke state observed here indicates that this
                    proper head orientation is maintained for ∼40 s, much longer than the
                    stepping intervals. Even if the head in the post-recovery stroke state
                    accidentally touches a backward site at a moment when the head adopts a near
                    pre-recovery angle by fluctuation or momentary reversal, the binding should be
                    unstable by at least by 5 <italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>
                    compared to forward binding. Thus, the kinetic and energetic stabilities of the

        <p>Momentary binding of a head with incorrect orientation will be unstable from

                    the lever arm (neck) elasticity and its strain influence the position of the
                    next binding site on actin, therefore the detached head preferentially binds to
                    the forward site <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Vilfan1">[27]</xref>. This model assumes that the unbound neck with bound

                    stroke conformation, which we report here.</p>
        <p>The key for directional movement is to bias the completely random Brownian
                    rotations of a detached neck toward forward binding. The power stroke and its
                    angle stability of the attached rear head contribute approximately half of the
                    bias by moving the pivot for the Brownian rotation of the unbound neck forward,
                    which allows the detached head to access positions 36- to 72–nm distant on
                    an actin filament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Veigel1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Shiroguchi1">[7]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figure
                        1A</xref>). The remaining bias between positions ∼36 nm and ∼72 nm
                    from the detached site is provided by the recovery stroke and its stability.
                    Under a high backward external load, the power stroke would fail to produce a
                    bias: owing to the compliance in the neck and/or neck–head junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Veigel2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Sellers1">[14]</xref>, the
                    neck–neck junction would be pulled back to the neutral position,
                    immediately above the bound head (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Even under this circumstance, the bias by recovery
                    stroke still works, favoring forward binding. Therefore, for ∼72-nm discrete
                    unidirectional steps of myosin Va, the recovery stroke and its angle stability
                    of the detached head contributes to the bias, in addition to the power stroke
                    and its angle stability of the attached head. This mechanism may contribute to
                    transport cargos in a cell since some cellular components could be obstacles to
                    hinder the movement of cargo at times.</p>

                    lead head binding is facilitated by a backward load on the head, and hence

                    opposite to all other myosins studied so far. It is of interest to study whether
                    the other myosins, including myosin Va, also adopt a similar, strain-dependent
                    binding for forward bias.</p>
        <p>The stability of the post-recovery stroke conformation would also be important
                    for muscle myosin II, which can produce tension without contraction (isometric
                    tension) by repeatedly “scratching” actin. Forward binding is
                    required for efficient force production, but the base of the necks does not move
                    in this situation, and thus myosin II may rely entirely on the head orientation
                    being stabilized in the post-recovery stroke state. Other linear motors may also
                    rely on an effective swing to the post-recovery stroke conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Kinosita1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Ali1">[12]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Microscopic Observations with Constant and Changeable ATP Level for a
                    Variable Time</title>
        <p>To study ligand-dependent motion of molecules, caged nucleotides (uncaged by UV
                    irradiation) have been combined with microscopic observations. UV pulse
                    irradiation allows one to trigger motion of the molecular motor and to clearly
                    show its nucleotide dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Higuchi1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Shingyoji1">[31]</xref>, and modulation of UV irradiation time allows one to
                    control motor velocity and total movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001031-Hess1">[32]</xref>. This assay design has the
                    advantage over conventional flow/mixing assays in that solution conditions
                    (e.g., nucleotide concentration) can be altered rapidly and with minimal
                    perturbation. However, caged nucleotide measurements have been limited to
                    kinetic analysis because the concentration of uncaged compound can change
                    significantly during the course of an experiment, particularly if consumed by
                    the system being examined (i.e., diffusion, enzyme–substrate interaction,
                    or apyrase). We have developed a new technique to keep ATP level constant in
                    which the concentration and time evolution can be modulated by light intensity
                    and irradiation time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g002">Figures

                    This method for visualization of a nucleotide-linked conformational change in a
                    motor protein under the controlled delivery of ATP should be generally
                    applicable to ligand-induced conformational changes of macromolecules.</p>

        <p>The purpose of the anti-his antibody was to let it serve as a cushion between the
                    myosin neck and a silica bead so as to keep the myosin intact. Direct binding,
                    though, worked as well, and some results, e.g., in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001031-g001">Figures 1C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001031.s005">S5A–S5C</xref>, were obtained with direct binding. In both cases,
                    most of the 0.29-µm beads on the surface were bound to the head of myosin
                    Va through a biotin–avidin linkage, because the bead density decreased
                    significantly without myosin, with non-biotinylated anti-myc antibody instead of
                    the biotinylated one, or by mixing excess biotin with the streptavidin-coated
                    beads before infusion. When we infused short actin filaments instead of the
                    0.29-µm beads, they attached (presumably) to myosin Va, and a flash of
                    100% UV light for 0.2 s released &gt;97% of them from the surface
                    within a few seconds.</p>

                    475–490 nm, and images at 500–535 nm were captured with an
                    intensified (VS4-1845, Video Scope) CCD camera (CCD-300-RCX, Dage-MTI).
                    Bright-field images (650–730 nm) were recorded with another CCD camera. UV
                    excitation (300–400 nm) for uncaging ATP was confined in a circle of

                        shown here. The myosin neck is immobilized on a small gray bead, and the
                        head is attached to a large blue duplex. Myosin binding to small and large
                        beads occurs by chance. Duplex bead swinging occurs only when conditions
                        under which the swinging beads do not collide with the surface are
                        satisfied: (i) myosin is on the top of the small bead, (ii) myosin is
                        properly oriented such that the swing plane is parallel to the surface, and
                        (iii) the long axis of duplex beads is almost parallel to a surface. These
                        conditions contribute to a low frequency of observed bead swinging.</p>

                        where a 100-ms flash at 100% intensity always induced a return swing,
                        short (10 ms) and/or weak (25%) flashes here often had to be applied
                        several times before a successful return swing was observed, indicating that
                        the swings depend on UV-generated ATP. (B) Continuous UV irradiation at
                        100% and 0.7% intensities for 2 s and 10 s, respectively.
                        Under 100% UV, a swing was observed at 0.74 s on average (seven
                        swings in three molecules), and under 0.7%, at 3.2 s (eight swings).
                        Under continuous irradiation, [ATP] would rise toward the
                        steady-state value of ∼50 µM at 100% (the generation rate
                        of ∼20 µM divided by the depletion rate of 1/[2–3
                        s]) or ∼0.4 µM at 0.7%, with the time constant of

                        thus consistent with ATP binding to myosin Va with the bimolecular rate
