<p>Placenta formation during pregnancy requires chorioallantoic branching morphogenesis that involves establishing an amplifying feedback loop between Frizzled5 and Gcm1 to regulate branching initiation and trophoblast differentiation.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Chorioallantoic branching morphogenesis is a key milestone during placental development, creating the large surface area for nutrient and gas exchange, and is therefore critical for the success of term pregnancy. Several Wnt pathway molecules have been shown to regulate placental development. However, it remains largely unknown how Wnt-Frizzled (Fzd) signaling spatiotemporally interacts with other essential regulators, ensuring chorionic branching morphogenesis and angiogenesis during placental development. Employing global and trophoblast-specific <italic>Fzd5</italic>-null and <italic>Gcm1</italic>-deficient mouse models, combining trophoblast stem cell lines and tetraploid aggregation assay, we demonstrate here that an amplifying signaling loop between Gcm1 and Fzd5 is essential for normal initiation of branching in the chorionic plate. While <italic>Gcm1</italic> upregulates <italic>Fzd5</italic> specifically at sites where branching initiates in the basal chorion, this elevated <italic>Fzd5</italic> expression via nuclear β-catenin signaling in turn maintains expression of <italic>Gcm1</italic>. Moreover, we show that Fzd5-mediated signaling induces the disassociation of cell junctions for branching initiation via downregulating ZO-1, claudin 4, and claudin 7 expressions in trophoblast cells at the base of the chorion. In addition, Fzd5-mediated signaling is also important for upregulation of <italic>Vegf</italic> expression in chorion trophoblast cells. Finally, we demonstrate that Fzd5-Gcm1 signaling cascade is operative during human trophoblast differentiation. These data indicate that Gcm1 and Fzd5 function in an evolutionary conserved positive feedback loop that regulates trophoblast differentiation and sites of chorionic branching morphogenesis.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Abnormal placental development during pregnancy is associated with conditions such as preeclampsia, intrauterine growth restriction, and even fetal death in humans. Here we focus on the earliest steps of placenta formation, which involves the development of the labyrinthine layer, a specialized epithelium that sits between the maternal blood and fetal blood vessels and facilitates the exchange of nutrients, gases, and wastes between the mother and fetus. Pivotal to the development of a functional labyrinth layer are the processes of folding and branching of a flat sheet of trophoblast cells (originally the outer layer of the blastocyst), and of trophoblast cell differentiation. Here, we show in mice that Frizzled5, a receptor component of the Wnt signaling pathway, and Gcm1, an important transcription factor for labyrinth development, form a positive feedback loop that directs normal placental development. We find that <italic>Gcm1</italic> up-regulates <italic>Fzd5</italic> specifically at branching sites and that elevated <italic>Fzd5</italic> expression in turn maintains expression of <italic>Gcm1</italic>. Moreover, Fzd5-mediated signaling is required for the disassociation of cell junctions and for the up-regulation of <italic>Vegf</italic> expression in trophoblast cells. Finally, with implications for human disease, we demonstrate that the FZD5-GCM1 signaling cascade operates in primary cultures of human trophoblasts undergoing differentiation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The placenta is a temporary organ first formed during pregnancy that is essential for the survival and growth of the fetus in eutherian mammals. Abnormal placental development is often associated with intrauterine growth restriction, preeclampsia, and even fetal death in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Rossant1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Maltepe1">[3]</xref>. The development of placenta starts at embryonic day 4.5 (E4.5) in mice, when the formation of different trophoblast cell types is underway. By around E10.5, a placenta with complete structure has formed. The mature placenta is composed of three major layers: the outermost layer is comprised of trophoblast giant cells and is adjacent to maternal decidua; spongiotrophoblast cells form a layer between the labyrinth and outer giant cells, and the innermost layer is the labyrinth layer, a layer important for the exchange of nutrients, gases, and wastes between the mother and fetus. Development of the labyrinth is divided into three stages: chorioallantoic attachment at E8.5, initiation of branching in trophoblast cells at the base of the chorionic plate, and branching morphogenesis and vascularization in the chorionic plate. Disturbance to any one of these stages would lead to an impaired labyrinth development, resulting in failure of pregnancy. The <italic>Glial cells missing–1</italic> (<italic>Gcm1</italic>) gene lies at a key step in labyrinth development, since its expression in clusters of trophoblast cells at the base of the chorion define the initiation of branchpoints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-AnsonCartwright1">[4]</xref>. While Gcm1 expression appears autonomously before chorioallantoic attachment, the maintenance of its expression during subsequent branching is dependent on contact with the allantois <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Hunter1">[5]</xref>. The signals that establish the initial Gcm1 pattern and which maintain it have not yet been defined.</p>
<p>Gene targeting experiments have shown that development of labyrinth is regulated by numerous signaling molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Rossant1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Maltepe1">[3]</xref> including the Wnt signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Sonderegger1">[6]</xref>. For example, mice with null mutation of <italic>Wnt7b</italic>, expressed in the chorion, die at mid-gestation stages due to a defect of chorioallantoic attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Parr1">[7]</xref>. Mutation of <italic>R-spondin3</italic>, a molecule that promotes the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway, leads to failure of branchpoint initiation in the chorionic plate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Aoki1">[8]</xref>. Similarly, deletion of <italic>Bcl9l</italic>, a vertebrate ortholog of <italic>Drosophila legless</italic> and an essential intracellular member of Wnt pathway, also results in defective branchpoint initiation and impaired differentiation of trophoblast cells in the chorion into syncytiotrophoblast layer II (SynT-II) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Matsuura1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, targeted disruption of <italic>Wnt2</italic> causes an impaired development of the labyrinth at a slightly later stage of gestation but still leading to perinatal embryo demise <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Monkley1">[10]</xref>. Defective labyrinth development has also been reported in <italic>Frizzled5</italic> (<italic>Fzd5</italic>) mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Ishikawa1">[11]</xref> though the details of the phenotype have not yet been reported. Therefore, it remains largely unknown how different Wnt ligands signal via Fzd5 receptors to regulate chorionic branching morphogenesis and/or vascularization of the labyrinth. Moreover, it is unknown how Wnt-Fzd5 signaling interacts with other essential regulators during the development of labyrinth.</p>
<p>In the present study, we have employed a variety of in vivo and in vitro models to address how Fzd5 regulates chorioallantoic development during placentation. We provide direct genetic evidence that an amplifying signaling hierarchy between Gcm1 and Fzd5 directs branching morphogenesis and trophoblast differentiation during placental development in both mice and humans.</p>

<title>Fzd5 Is Expressed in a Spatiotemporally Restricted Manner in the Developing Labyrinth Layer of the Placenta</title>
<p>To explore the pathophysiological significance of Fzd5-driven signaling during placental branching morphogenesis, we first performed in situ hybridization to examine the spatiotemporal expression profile of Fzd5 receptors in the developing placenta. <italic>Fzd5</italic> mRNA expression was mainly detected in trophoblast cells of the chorion at E8.0, and was strikingly high at the branching points in the chorion at E9.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Low levels of <italic>Fzd5</italic> mRNA were also detected in the floating allantois at E8.0, from which the fetal vessels in the labyrinth are derived; its expression declined to undetectable levels in the allantois upon attachment with the chorion at E8.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s001">Figure S1</xref>). <italic>Fzd5</italic> was also expressed in the yolk sac at later developmental stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s001">Figure S1</xref>), consistent with a previous report ascribing its necessity during yolk sac angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Ishikawa1">[11]</xref>. This spatiotemporal expression profile of <italic>Fzd5</italic> suggests that Fzd5-coupled signaling may play a role during early placental labyrinth development.</p>

<title>Fzd5 Deficiency Derails the Normal Initiation of Branching Morphogenesis</title>
<p>To unveil the physiological significance of Fzd5 during chorionic villus development, we employed global <italic>Fzd5</italic>-null mutant mouse models achieved by crossing <italic>Fzd5<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-vanEs1">[12]</xref> with <italic>Zp3-Cre</italic><sup>+/−</sup> mice. The yolk sacs of <italic>Fzd5</italic>-null mutant placentas at E10.5 were pale and devoid of blood vessels, with severely retarded fetal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These defects are consistent with previous observations showing that <italic>Fzd5</italic> is essential for yolk sac angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Ishikawa1">[11]</xref>. In addition to changes in the yolk sac, the labyrinth layer of the placenta was also significantly underdeveloped. Attachment of the chorion and allantois occurred normally in <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutants with normal expression of vascular cell adhesion molecule–1 (VCAM-1) and α4 integrin at E8.5 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which are required for chorioallantoic attachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Gurtner1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Yang1">[15]</xref>. However, the initiation and progression of branching morphogenesis in the chorion failed to occur at E9.5 in <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Immunostaining analysis of cytokeratin, which marks the placental trophoblast cells, and laminin, which stains the blood vessel endothelial cells, clearly revealed that the chorion remained flat and the primary villous branches did not initiate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The defective chorioallantoic branching was associated with altered trophoblast proliferation and differentiation. In control (<italic>Fzd5</italic><sup>+/−</sup>) placentas, trophoblast cells lining the branchpoint site in the chorionic plate ceased proliferation and mitotic division, showing no staining for either Ki67 or phospho-histone H3 (pH3), consistent with previous findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Cross1">[16]</xref>. By contrast, most trophoblast cells within the <italic>Fzd5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> chorion still underwent proliferation showing positive staining for Ki67 and pH3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1E</xref>), reinforcing the notion that <italic>Fzd5</italic> deficiency derails the normal initiation of branching morphogenesis.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Trophoblast-Expressed Fzd5 Is Essential for Chorioallantoic Branching</title>
<p>Since the development of chorionic villi involves both the chorionic trophoblasts and the blood vessels from the allantois, both of which express <italic>Fzd5</italic>, to ascertain the relative contribution of chorionic versus allantoic <italic>Fzd5</italic> in branching morphogenesis, we established a <italic>Cyp19-Cre</italic><sup>+/−</sup><italic>/Fzd5<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> mouse line by intercrossing <italic>Fzd5<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic> mice with hemizygous <italic>Cyp19-Cre</italic> mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Wenzel1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Wenzel2">[18]</xref> to achieve conditional deletion of the <italic>Fzd5</italic> gene in the trophoblast cells. <italic>Fzd5</italic> gene can be selectively deleted only in the trophoblast cells, while no depletion of <italic>Fzd5</italic> in embryonic tissues (fetal endothelial cells) and yolk sacs was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s003">Figure S3A and B</xref>). Upon conditional deletion of <italic>Fzd5</italic> in trophoblast cells, retarded fetal growth and blocked branching morphogenesis was observed, similar to that observed in Fzd5-null mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g002">Figure 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s003">Figure S3C and D</xref>). Laminin-stained and Fzd5-intact fetal blood vessels failed to penetrate into the trophoblast-specific <italic>Fzd5</italic>-null chorion, unlike the well-interdigitated maternal-fetal interface in the control (<italic>Fzd5<sup>loxp/loxp</sup></italic>) chorioallantoic plate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). These data suggest that trophoblast-expressed <italic>Fzd5</italic> is essential for the normal labyrinth development.</p>

Indeed, when diploid <italic>Fzd5</italic>-null embryos were aggregated with wild-type tetraploid <italic>Egfp</italic><sup>+/−</sup> embryos and analyzed at E12.5, the GFP-expressing cells contributed exclusively to the trophoblast cells of the placenta and endoderm of the yolk sac (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s004">Figure S4</xref>), rescuing the development of diploid <italic>Fzd5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g002">Figure 2B</xref>).

<title>Fzd5 and Gcm1 Are Regulated Reciprocally During the Initiation of Chorionic Branching</title>

At E8.75 and E9.0, when branching is initiated at the basal layer of the chorionic plate, the <italic>Gcm1</italic> expression was mainly located at the tips of branchpoint sites and lining the branching folds. Expression of <italic>Fzd5</italic> was difficult to detect and scattered in the chorionic plate before E8.5. However, after chorioallantoic attachment <italic>Fzd5</italic> expression became detectable in the chorion but in two distinct regions—in some scattered cells in the apical region as well as in the basal at the branchpoint sites where <italic>Gcm1</italic> is expressed and branching is initiated between E8.75 and E9.0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g003">Figure 3A</xref>).

<title>Fzd5 Deficiency Derails Branching Morphogenesis in the Chorion by Interfering With Trophoblast Syncytialization, Disassociation of Cell Junctions, and Chorionic Fetal Vessel Infiltration</title>
<p>To better understand the sequence of events that are regulated by <italic>Gcm1-Fzd5</italic> function, we analyzed the molecular regulatory machinery governing the syncytiotrophoblast development, trophoblast cell junction disassociation, and blood vessel development from the allantois in <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutants.</p>
<p>In mice, there are two layers of syncytiotrophoblast cells, SynT-I and -II, that lie between the fetal vessels and maternal blood sinuses in the labyrinth, with Syn-I cells lying closest to the maternal blood sinuses and with SynT-II cells lying closest to fetal endothelial cells.

<p>Observations of dynamic morphological changes in chorion trophoblast cells at branchpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) prompted us to further explore the cellular events that occur during the initiation of branching morphogenesis. Trophoblast cells at the base of chorionic plate are epithelial-like cells, which are linked to each other by cell adhesions, including tight junctions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s006">Figure S6A and B</xref>). Dissociation of tight junctions is required for epithelial cells to be transformed to mesenchymal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Thiery1">[24]</xref>. Therefore, we explored the status of the tight junction protein zonula occluden 1 (ZO-1) in the developing chorion by immunofluorescence staining. ZO-1 proteins were localized to the apical side of the trophoblast cells throughout the base of the flat control chorionic plate at E8.5 right before the initiation of branching morphogenesis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), whereas its expression was significantly down-regulated specifically at the branching sites at later times when branching began. By contrast, we noted with interest that ZO-1 expression was sustained in chorion trophoblast cells of <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutants even at E9.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In addition, claudin 4 and 7 underwent similar changes to that of ZO-1 upon Fzd5 deletion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001536.s006">Figure S6A and B</xref>). These observations suggested that <italic>Fzd5/Gcm1</italic> is essential for cell junction disassociation, an early step during chorionic branching morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Coincident with chorionic branching in wild-type placentas, the villi are immediately filled with vessels from the allantois. It is conceivable that the invasion of fetal vessels from the allantois into the space created by chorionic branching may be attracted and facilitated by vascular endothelial growth factor (VEGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Horowitz1">[25]</xref>. Expression of <italic>Vegf<sub>164</sub></italic> mRNA was readily detectable in chorion trophoblast cells at E9.0 in control placentas. However, <italic>Vegf<sub>164</sub></italic> mRNA expression was extremely low in <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), suggesting that fetal vessel infiltration is impaired by Fzd5 mutation.</p>

<title>Fzd5 Is Essential for Canonical Wnt Activation in Trophoblasts at the Branching Site</title>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The labyrinth layer of the placenta is the only site for exchange of nutrients, gases, and wastes between the maternal and fetal circulations from midgestation to term. Chorioallantoic attachment is the first step during labyrinth development, but soon thereafter, primary villi begin to develop at specific sites along the basal surface of the chorion that quickly become lined by fetoplacental blood vessels from the allantois. Defects in these processes are one of the most common causes of midgestation embryonic lethality. However, much remains unclear about the mechanisms. We provide here genetic, molecular, pharmacological, and physiological evidence that an amplifying feedback loop between Gcm1 and Fzd5 is essential for normal initiation of branching and trophoblast differentiation in the chorion of mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001536-g009">Figure 9</xref>). Moreover, our studies reveal that this signaling axis is also functional in the human placenta.</p>

However, the expression of Fzd5 was low and across the base of the chorionic plate.

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1001536.g009" position="float" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Previous studies have proposed that the trophoblast cells at the branching sites within the chorion express <italic>Gcm1</italic> and that changes in cell shape—thinning and elongation—are involved in driving the branching morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Cross1">[16]</xref>. Deletion of <italic>Gcm1</italic> in mice leads to a complete block to branching at the chorioallantoic interface. We observe a similar phenotype of impaired chorionic branching in <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutant mice, even those lacking only trophoblast-expressed <italic>Fzd5</italic>. <italic>Fzd5</italic> is expressed in clusters of cells in the apical as well as the basal chorion, though only the latter sites correlate with branching morphogenesis and overlap with <italic>Gcm1</italic>. <italic>Gcm1</italic> expression precedes that of <italic>Fzd5</italic> in the chorion and it was of great interest to note that <italic>Gcm1</italic> deficiency remarkably attenuates <italic>Fzd5</italic> expression at the site of branchpoint initiation in the basal chorion. This implies that Gcm1 regulates the onset of Fzd5 expression in the basal chorion, but we assume that this is not due to direct transcriptional activation by Gcm1 since the regulatory elements of <italic>Fzd5</italic> gene have no <italic>Gcm1</italic> binding motifs (unpublished observation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Yu1">[35]</xref>. Therefore, it is possible that the regulation of Fzd5 by Gcm1 was mediated by other indirect ways.</p>
<p>While <italic>Gcm1</italic> precedes <italic>Fzd5</italic> expression, <italic>Fzd5</italic> is in turn essential for the maintenance of <italic>Gcm1</italic> expression at the selected branching site. <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutant chorions had diminished <italic>Gcm1</italic> expression and impaired nuclear localization of β-catenin at E9.0 and beyond. Employing TS cells, we found that Fzd5 through nuclear β-catenin signaling directly regulates <italic>Gcm1</italic> expression during trophoblast differentiation. Our findings are consistent with recent studies about two important members of canonical Wnt pathway, R-spondin3 and <italic>Bcl9l</italic>. Mutations in genes encoding R-spondin3, a protein that promotes the Wnt-β-catenin signaling pathway, result in failure of chorionic branching and reduced Gcm1 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Aoki1">[8]</xref>. <italic>Bcl9l</italic> is an essential intracellular member of Wnt pathway and functions as an adaptor linking β-catenin and Pygopus. Its deficiency leads to defective branching initiation and impaired differentiation of trophoblast cells in the chorion into syncytiotrophoblast layer II (SynT-II) cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Matsuura1">[9]</xref>. In general, these observations further testify the important role of Fzd5-mediated canonical Wnt pathway on Gcm1 regulation during placental development.</p>
<p>Our studies add to the understanding of the upstream events that initiate where chorionic branching will occur. However, the cellular events downstream of Gcm1 and Fzd5 that drive chorion trophoblast differentiation and morphogenesis have not previously been well documented. In mice, trophoblast cells at the basal layer of the chorionic plate are aligned and tightly adherent to each other, similar to other polarized epithelia. This epithelium integrity is maintained by cell junctions, particularly the tight junctions at the apical side of epithelium. With the initiation of branching, the trophoblast cells that express <italic>Gcm1</italic> at the branching sites become thin and elongated, and disassociated similar to an epithelial to mesenchymal transition. However, a reduction of E-cadherin and up-regulation of vimentin has not been observed in chorion trophoblasts at the branching sites (unpublished observation). By contrast, the expression of ZO-1 and claudin4 and 7, important components of tight junctions, is dramatically reduced or diminished at the branching sites in the control chorion, whereas this down-regulation does not occur in <italic>Fzd5</italic><sup>−/−</sup> mutants. Moreover, ZO-1 can be down-regulated by Wnt-β-catenin signaling in human colorectal carcinomas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Mann1">[26]</xref>. This suggests that Fzd5 is essential for down-regulation of ZO-1 and claudins expression during branching initiation.</p>
<p>Any defect in branching morphogenesis of the chorion results in a small labyrinth layer, thus limiting the surface area for nutrient transfer as well as the extent to which fetal blood vessels can grow into the placenta and come into proximity to the maternal blood spaces. To the untrained observer and at a superficial level, mutants with small labyrinth layers due to chorion branching defects may appear to be undervascularized, but it is critical to distinguish the actual events and determine whether the volume of the fetal vascular network in the labyrinth is simply small compared to wild-type because it is proportionally limited by a reduced villous volume, as is true in many cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Watson1">[2]</xref>, or whether it is disproportionately reduced. It is worthy of further investigation to determine if there are vascular defects in <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutants. Previous studies on <italic>Wnt2</italic> mutants described an impaired fetal vascular network in the labyrinth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Monkley1">[10]</xref>, but previous descriptions of placental vascular defects in <italic>Fzd5</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Ishikawa1">[11]</xref> cannot be confirmed based on our findings of primary chorion branching defects. Whether Wnt2-Fzd5 signaling is essential for regulating the subsequent vascularization of villi after the primary villous branching occurs will require further studies. However, we provide evidence here that trophoblast-expressed Fzd5 is essential for <italic>Vegf</italic> expression in the chorionic plate, coincident with the sites of primary villous branching that are filled in by vessels from the allantois. VEGF can function as a chemoattractant as well as a growth factor to promote vessel growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Horowitz1">[25]</xref> and can be strongly up-regulated by Wnt signaling during tumorigenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Zhang1">[27]</xref>. Aberrant expression of <italic>Vegf</italic> has also been shown to be associated with severely impaired labyrinth morphogenesis, although the branching can be initiated in <italic>Lkb1</italic> and <italic>Tfeb</italic> mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Steingrimsson1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Ylikorkala1">[37]</xref>. These findings suggest that Gcm1/Fzd5 signaling initiates not just differentiation and branching morphogenesis in the chorion trophoblast but that the trophoblast may in turn regulate vascularization of the labyrinth.</p>
<p>In summary, we provide direct genetic evidence of an amplifying feedback loop of Gcm1-Fzd5 signaling in the chorion and propose three main conclusions: (1) <italic>Gcm1</italic>, first expressed in chorion trophoblast cells and further upregulated by canonical <italic>Fzd5</italic> signaling, determines the branching sites and differentiation into syncytiotrophoblasts; (2) the initial events in chorion trophoblast morphogenesis include trophoblast cell cycle exit and downregulation of ZO-1 expression, inducing the disassociation of tight junctions at the base of the chorionic plate for branching initiation; and (3) Wnt-Fzd5 signaling also up-regulates <italic>Vegf</italic> expression in the chorion and may in turn promote vascularization of the primary villi in the labyrinth. Besides shedding light on the fundamental mechanisms of branching morphogenesis during placental development, the finding has high clinical relevance, since Gcm1-Fzd5 signaling cascade is operative during human trophoblast differentiation and its aberrant regulation is often associated with trophoblast-related diseases, such as preeclampsia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Chen2">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001536-Meng1">[40]</xref>.</p>

<p>Analysis of LEF/TCF binding sites in the Gcm1 promoter. (A) Map of the Gcm1 promoter, indicating the 5-kb region containing the LEF/TCF binding sites. A fragment containing nucleotides (nt) −4,117 to −3,338 relative to the transcription site (P) is comprised of seven binding sites for LEF/TCF complex. (B) Point mutations of the seven binding sequences revealed that only the fifth sequence was responsive to canonical Wnt pathway agonists, LiCl and CHIR99021 (red in A).</p>

<p>The expression of Wnt2, Wnt5a, and Wnt7b was detected by in situ hybridization during early placentation. Wnt2 was expressed in the allantois before chorioallantoic attachment at E8.0 and was localized to the endothelial cells of the fetal blood vessels at later stages. While Wnt7b was localized to the base of the chorion plate, Wnt5a was detected in both the chorion and allantois. Al, allantois; Ch, Chorion; Dec, decidua; Epc, ectoplacental core; La, labyrinth layer; Sp, spongiotrophoblast layer. Scale bars: 200 µm.</p>
