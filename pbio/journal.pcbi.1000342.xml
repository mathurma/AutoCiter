                <p>Synchronized oscillation is very commonly observed in many neuronal systems and
                    might play an important role in the response properties of the system. We have
                    studied how the spontaneous oscillatory activity affects the responsiveness of a
                    neuronal network, using a neural network model of the visual cortex built from
                    Hodgkin-Huxley type excitatory (E-) and inhibitory (I-) neurons. When the
                    isotropic local E-I and I-E synaptic connections were sufficiently strong, the
                    network commonly generated gamma frequency oscillatory firing patterns in
                    response to random feed-forward (FF) input spikes. This spontaneous oscillatory
                    network activity injects a periodic local current that could amplify a weak
                    synaptic input and enhance the network's responsiveness. When E-E
                    connections were added, we found that the strength of oscillation can be
                    modulated by varying the FF input strength without any changes in single neuron
                    properties or interneuron connectivity. The response modulation is proportional
                    to the oscillation strength, which leads to self-regulation such that the
                    cortical network selectively amplifies various FF inputs according to its
                    strength, without requiring any adaptation mechanism. We show that this
                    selective cortical amplification is controlled by E-E cell interactions. We also
                    found that this response amplification is spatially localized, which suggests
                    that the responsiveness modulation may also be spatially selective. This
                    suggests a generalized mechanism by which neural oscillatory activity can
                    enhance the selectivity of a neural network to FF inputs.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>In the nervous system, information is delivered and processed digitally via
                    voltage spikes transmitted between cells. A neural system is characterized by
                    its input/output spike signal patterns. Generally, a network of neurons shows a
                    very different response pattern than that of a single neuron. In some cases, a
                    neural network generates interesting population activities, such as synchronized
                    oscillations, which are thought to modulate the response properties of the
                    network. However, the exact role of these neural oscillations is unknown. We
                    investigated the relationship between the oscillatory activity and the response
                    modulation in neural networks using computational simulation modeling. We found
                    that the response of the system is significantly modified by the oscillations in
                    the network. In particular, the responsiveness to weak inputs is remarkably
                    enhanced. This suggests that the oscillation can differentially amplify sensory
                    information depending on the input signal conditions. We conclude that a neural
                    network can dynamically modify its response properties by the selective
                    amplification of sensory signals due to oscillation activity, which may explain
                    some experimental observations and help us to better understand neural
                systems.</p>

            <p>Understanding the responsiveness of a cortical neural network is a fundamental
                requirement for any study of sensory information processing in the brain. Several
                experiments show that various factors can affect the neuronal response property and
                information flow in nervous systems: In the primary visual cortex, spiking responses
                of neurons can be enhanced by slow cortical oscillation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Haider1">[1]</xref>. The spike transfer
                function of thalamo-cortical neurons is modulated by noisy synaptic background
                activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Wolfart1">[2]</xref>. Gain of neuronal responses is modulated by background
                synaptic input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Chance1">[3]</xref>. Even at the single cell level, cellular
                responsiveness is significantly influenced by the presence of voltage fluctuations
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Ho1">[4]</xref>. It
                was shown recently that neuronal oscillations can increase response gain and
                decrease reaction time as a mechanism of attention selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Lakatos1">[5]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Cortical neurons commonly show synchronous or oscillatory patterns of activity, which
                is thought to be important for cortical functions of information flow <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Salinas1">[6]</xref>. In
                particular, synchronous gamma frequency oscillations (30∼70 Hz) have been
                observed in various neural circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Gray1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Whittington1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Traub1">[9]</xref>, and they
                are thought to provide a temporal structure for information processing in the brain
                    <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Bartos1">[10]</xref>.
                This gamma-band synchronization can be generated within local networks by coupling
                between GABAergic I- (inhibitory) interneurons and E- (excitatory) neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Whittington2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Traub2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Battaglia1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Bgers1">[14]</xref>, and is
                related to cognitive functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Womelsdorf1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Schoffelen1">[16]</xref>, and information
                delivery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Womelsdorf1">[15]</xref>. This population activity also has been studied in
                numerical simulations and mathematical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Traub2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Tiesinga1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Bojak1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Coombes1">[19]</xref>.</p>
            <p>Previous analyses have shown that cortical oscillations are generated in networks
                with appropriate connectivity and can be correlated with the firing phases of E- and
                I- neurons, but the effect of these oscillations on the neural network
                responsiveness to external inputs remains elusive. In this research, using a large
                network model of Hodgkin-Huxley type E- and I- neurons, we study how spontaneous
                cortical oscillation - particularly in the gamma frequency band - modulates the
                response property of a neural network. We examine the cortical responsiveness to
                external FF inputs at the single-spike level because the input-output response
                function for a single input spike is a fundamental feature of neural networks for
                information processing. A recent study emphasizing the importance of single spike
                level analysis showed that a significant amount of visual information can be
                delivered by the very first spike emitted by a neural population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Gollisch1">[20]</xref>.</p>
            <p>We found that spontaneous cortical oscillation activity noticeably changed the
                cortical input-output response function. For example, weak inputs that are normally
                missed in the responses of single neurons, were significantly enhanced by cortical
                oscillations in the network. This response modulation was similar to the observed
                effect of the membrane potential oscillation reported in a previous experimental
                study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Volgushev1">[21]</xref>. More importantly, we found that this cortical
                response modulation by the oscillation activity was controlled by external
                feed-forward (FF) input strength variation. This means that the cortical network can
                self-regulate by differentially amplifying its FF inputs according to their
                strength, without physiological changes in single neuron properties or structural
                modulation of interneuron connectivity. We show that this
                ‘differential’ amplification results from the modulation of
                gamma oscillation by cortical E-E neuron interaction. We suggest that this is an
                important example in which the modulation of gamma oscillation by cortical E-E
                interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Traub2">[12]</xref> can significantly change the population
                responsiveness. We also found that this cortical amplification effect was restricted
                spatially to an ‘oscillation active’ region, which enables the
                spatially-selective tuning of responsiveness to given FF input. We find that this
                spatial localization is determined by the range of anatomical interneuron
                connectivity. This is consistent with recent experimental findings concerning the
                effects of cortical oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Haider1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Lakatos1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Canolty1">[22]</xref>, and points to aspects of this oscillation which
                effectively enhance the response selectivity of a neural network to FF inputs.</p>

                <p>We examined a variety of neural network activity patterns produced under
                    different conditions. We used a cortical network model in which E- and I-
                    neurons interact with each other via lateral synaptic connections. We
                    constructed isotropic local cortical connections, using physiological and
                    earlier modeling data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Yoshioka1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-McLaughlin1">[24]</xref>. We varied the
                    strength of each type of cortical interaction (E-E, E-I, I-E and I-I) in order
                    to study different cortical connectivity conditions. Artificially generated
                    random spikes were injected into the cells in the center area
                    (diameter∼450 µm, ∼500 neurons: E- 377, I- 113) of
                    this network model (1 mm by 1 mm, consisting of ∼3300 neurons: E- 2500,
                    I- 841) to simulate localized FF spike input to the network. The actual spike
                    pattern for each neuron was generated by a Poisson process with constant mean
                    firing rate, and FF input strength (The amount of intracellular conductance
                    fluctuation caused by a single FF input spike) was varied within the range
                    5∼100 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>, as a control parameter. By performing
                    many simulations of different cortical parameters with FF input rates in the
                    range 5∼40 spike/s, we observed several different types of cortical

                            (B) The cortical gamma frequency rhythm is generated by E-I and I-E

                <p>We extend the previous studies by also explicitly considering E-E and I-I
                    cortical connections. In ref. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Morita1">[25]</xref>, Morita et al. showed that gamma- modulated
                    cortical excitation increases the firing rate of E- cells and decreases the E-I
                    firing phase difference. Based on these observations, they predicted that the
                    gamma- modulated E-E cell interaction will suppress the cortical oscillation. In
                    this study, we found that the gamma- modulated E-E coupling does not extinguish
                    the cortical oscillation. When E-E connections were turned on, the firing rate
                    of E- cells was increased and the E-I phase difference was diminished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref>), as shown in
                    ref. 25. But these changes did not actually suppress the cortical oscillation.
                    Instead, they caused a transition of operating ‘mode’ such
                    that the oscillation frequency dropped to a low gamma or near beta rhythm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Whittington3">[28]</xref>. This transition could not be observed using the
                    methods reported in ref 25, because they have only ‘static’
                    data of pre- and post- synaptic activities to examine
                    ‘static’ equilibrium conditions.</p>
                <p>The approximately zero E-I firing phase difference is an important feature of E-E
                    coupling, and is distinguishable from that of the case involving no or little
                    E-E coupling (∼70-degrees is usually observed in experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Hasenstaub1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Csicsvari1">[27]</xref>), so we call the
                    former situation ‘E-E interaction modulated’ E-I phase, in
                    contrast to the ‘normal’ gamma oscillation E-I phase. We
                    will analyze below how this phase modulation results from E-E coupling.</p>
                <p>The difference between the firing rates of E- and I- cells is also diminished to
                    some degree by E-E interactions, and the population oscillation frequency is

                    non-zero E-E interaction throughout the following simulations. We also allow I-I
                    connections, which reduce the firing rate of I- cells to some extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g001">Figure 1C and 1D</xref>). In this
                    study, we do not examine the role of I-I connection in detail, and the I-I

                <title>Control of Spontaneous Cortical Network Activity Strength</title>
                <p>When the cortical interactions (E-E, E-I, I-E and I-I) are completely turned off
                    and each neuron is driven by FF inputs only, there is no correlated behavior in
                    the network and the average network firing rate simply follows the instantaneous
                    input firing rate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g002">Figure
                    2A</xref>, FF). On the other hand, when cortical interactions (E-E, E-I, I-E and
                    I-I) are introduced, the network exhibits some synchronized patterns depending
                    on FF input and cortical connectivity parameters. For example, with a moderate
                    FF input strength (∼35 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>) and rate
                    (∼40 spikes/s), the neural population shows an oscillation pattern in
                    its firing rate for a broad range of cortical connectivity parameters. The
                    cross-correlogram among cortical spikes shows a clear oscillatory pattern for
                    both E- and I- cells in this case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, OA). Generally, the amplitude of the instantaneous output
                    firing rate of the neural population depends on the FF input firing rate. The
                    frequency of the oscillation is somewhat affected by the FF input strength and
                    cortical connectivity parameters, but the oscillation frequencies are mostly
                    within the gamma band range (25∼50 Hz), as in earlier experimental
                    observations and theoretical models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Whittington1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Traub1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Bauer1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Ermentrout1">[31]</xref>. For some
                    parameter range of cortical connections, this gamma oscillation can be very
                    small. When the FF input spike rate was low (∼10 spikes/s) with the
                    other parameters unchanged, the oscillating firing pattern in E- cells became
                    barely detectable even though the oscillation in I- cells was maintained to some
                    extent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, OI). We
                    examined the phase of the firing pattern of E-I cells in three cases (FF, OA,
                    and OI). The E-I spike correlogram in the OA network showed that the effect of
                    interactions among E-E cells is significant because the E- and I- cells fire
                    with little phase difference (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g002">Figure 2B</xref> (iii)), similar to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g001">Figure 1D and 1E</xref> (‘E-E interaction
                    modulated’ E-I phase), while the other two cases (FF and OI) showed no
                    clear phase relation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g002">Figure 2A
                        (iii) and 2C (iii)</xref>). Since OA and OI networks have the same
                    parameters except for the FF input firing rate, we conclude that FF input firing
                    rate is a crucial factor in determining E-E interaction strength.</p>

                            grating-like patterns, and the output firing rate oscillates with the

                            normal gamma oscillation in the E-I phase, indicating that the
                            contribution of the E-E interaction is significant in this case (see

                    output spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3A</xref> (i)
                    ***), as found in the measurements of correlated inputs
                    in a previously reported experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Usrey1">[35]</xref>. In this case, there
                    is a ‘threshold FF input strength (S<sub>thresh</sub>)’ that
                    determines whether each ‘single’ FF input spike can generate
                    an output spike or not. We calculated the responsiveness of network neurons,
                    using a cross-correlation method (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Usrey1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Perkel1">[36]</xref>. The responsiveness
                    of the cortical network was defined as (net peak integral)/(number of FF input
                    spikes), where net peak integral is the total area of the maximum response peak
                    above the background activity in each cross-correlogram. Measuring this quantity
                    at each FF input strength produces the generalized response function of the
                    network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Since
                    any subthreshold single input produces no response when cortical connections are
                    turned off (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3B</xref>
                    unpaired), the response to a single FF input spike is like a step function,
                    similar to the measured thalamo-cortical transfer function in the absence of
                    noisy background activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Wolfart1">[2]</xref>, providing the cell with a simple spike relay
                    capability with limited encoding abilities. When the cortical connections are
                    turned on, each neuron receives cortical synaptic inputs from other neurons as
                    well as FF inputs. In the presence of the spontaneous network activity of
                    synchronized oscillating patterns, the cortical spike inputs that each neuron
                    receives are also oscillating (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3A</xref> (ii)). The current fluctuation due to cortical
                    interactions is added to that by FF inputs, and as a result, a single-spike
                    sub-threshold FF input can produce an output spike response with the help of
                    this additional cortical activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3A</xref> (ii) *). This input amplification depends on the
                    phase of the cortical activity. When FF input timing is out of phase with the
                    cortical oscillation, it fails to produce an output spike for lack of additional
                    cortical current (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>
                    (ii) **) just as in the FF network. The general response
                    function of the network to a single ‘unpaired’ input spike
                    is plotted in (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g004">Figure 4A</xref>),
                    as a function of FF input strength. Different from the step-like FF case, the
                    slope of the response function changes more gradually, with a plateau near the
                    FF threshold input strength (S<sub>thresh</sub>∼30
                    µS/cm<sup>2</sup>). This broader and more gradual change of response
                    function can provide richer encoding capabilities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Wolfart1">[2]</xref>.</p>

                        <p>(A) (i) Cortical connections are turned off (FF). Neurons receive only FF
                            inputs. Each weak (&lt;30 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>) FF input
                            raises some current and voltage fluctuation but cannot cause a cortical
                            output spike unless two or more inputs are closely paired
                            (***). (ii) Cortical connections are turned on
                            (OA). In the presence of cortical gamma oscillation, each neuron
                            receives cortical spikes from nearby neurons. Since cortical activity
                            has the gamma frequency oscillation pattern, each neuron is provided
                            with a periodic current fluctuation. This cortical current amplifies
                            weak FF inputs to drive output spikes (*). This response
                            enhancement depends on the phase of oscillation, so a FF input at an
                            oscillation node is not amplified (**). (B) The response

                            for different cortical activity states. In both cases (paired and
                            unpaired), input spikes were chosen only if there were no other spikes
                            within 20 ms before each input. Paired inputs have another input within
                            20 ms after each input. Cortical output spikes were counted as is their
                            relative timing to each input spike were 0 ms). All three cases show a
                            non-zero response peak for the entire input. For unpaired input, only
                            the OA network can respond. In each correlogram, response probability
                            was normalized by the number of proper (entire or unpaired) FF input
                            spikes. For the responsiveness calculation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), each peak area was
                            measured above background activity level (dashed line). Background

                        <p>(A) The FF network has a step-like shape response function, with a
                            threshold value of ∼30 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>. The OA
                            network shows a more gradual change in its response function with a
                            plateau near the FF response threshold. Its responsiveness for weak FF
                            inputs is much stronger than for the other two cases. The OI network
                            shows little difference in its response function from that of the FF
                            network. (B) The cortical response to a single FF input spike is fastest
                            in the OA network for all input strengths. For weak FF inputs, the
                            average response delay is much shorter in the OA network than in other
                            network states. As the FF input strength increases, the difference
                            between OA and OI networks becomes smaller. The FF network always shows
                            the largest delay time, even for very strong FF inputs.</p>

                <p>Next, we examine how responsiveness changes when the oscillation is inactive
                    while the connectivity of neural population is kept the same. We lower the FF
                    input rate to 10 spike/s, so that the spontaneous oscillation is almost absent.
                    All the other parameters including cortical connectivity are kept the same so
                    that each synaptic interaction via spike delivery in the network can give the
                    same contribution as before. This time, neurons do not exhibit enhanced
                    responsiveness for weak inputs; each neuron still experiences some conductance
                    change by cortical interaction, but its contribution is negligible. The network
                    response character is similar to that of the FF network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Any
                    ‘unpaired’ weak inputs cannot generate a cortical response,
                    losing its information. We found the response function of neurons is almost the
                    same as that of the FF network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) when the cortical connections are turned off.</p>

                <title>Oscillation Strength is Self-Modifiable: Cortical Modulation Is Controlled by

                <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, the absolute
                    difference in responsiveness between the oscillatory network and the FF network
                    is large when FF input strength is weak (near the FF response threshold,
                        S<sub>input</sub>∼30 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>). This difference
                    becomes smaller as the FF input strength increases. Finally the two response
                    functions become equal at very strong inputs (S<sub>input</sub>&gt;80
                        µS/cm<sup>2</sup>). In other words, the cortical amplification due
                    to oscillation activity is large for weak FF inputs, and becomes insignificant
                    as inputs become strong. We examined how this cortical response modulation is
                    related to the change of oscillation strength. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g005">Figure 5A</xref> shows values of the network
                    oscillation as a function of FF input strength. For weak FF inputs
                    (S<sub>input</sub> = 25, 35
                        µS/cm<sup>2</sup>), the cortical oscillation is strong but it
                    becomes weaker for a medium input strength
                    (S<sub>input</sub> = 50
                    µS/cm<sup>2</sup>), and almost disappears for a strong input

                        µS/cm<sup>2</sup>). This change in the oscillation strength is
                    almost proportional to the extent of the cortical response modulation which can
                    be roughly defined as the difference between the response function and that of

                            the relative strength of gamma oscillation changes according to the FF
                            input strength. The oscillation is strongest when FF input strength is
                            35∼40 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>, and gradually diminishes as
                            input strength increases. (iii) The E-I firing pattern shows that
                            cortical oscillation is significantly modulated by the E-E interaction,
                            and two different peaks coexist (‘spike doublets’,
                            * and **). For a stronger FF input (50
                                µS/cm<sup>2</sup>), the E-I firing pattern shows only the
                            normal gamma phase feature (***). Cortical
                            oscillation is almost disappears for very strong FF input (80
                                µS/cm<sup>2</sup>). (B) The responsiveness difference
                            between the OA network and the FF network changes from positive (for
                            weak FF inputs&lt;S<sub>thresh</sub>) to negative (for moderate FF
                                inputs&gt;S<sub>thresh</sub>), and becomes zero (for strong FF
                            inputs). Its absolute value (or cortical response modulation) is almost
                            proportional to the strength of the gamma oscillation at each input
                            strength (except at the FF response threshold, ∼30
                                µS/cm<sup>2</sup>, where the difference changes from
                            positive to negative). Also the difference in response delay between the
                            OA network and the FF network is proportional to the strength of the
                            gamma oscillation, which is controlled by the FF input strength.</p>

                    is significantly affected by the E-E cell interaction. When the FF input is

                    difference of the gamma oscillation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g005">Figure 5A</xref> ***). On

                <p>We examined how the E-I firing phase is modulated from ∼70-degrees to
                    ∼0-degrees by the excitatory interactions in the E-E couplings. We
                    turned on only excitatory cortical connections (E-E and E-I) and measured the
                    firing patterns of E- and I- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g007">Figure 7</xref>). In this condition, the network generated the periodically
                    propagating waves near beta rhythm that we observed in the earlier part of this
                    study (when E-E connections were relatively stronger than other types of
                    connections). In each wave cycle, a small number of E- cells fired due to the FF
                    inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g007">Figure 7A</xref> i). Then
                    they excited nearby E- and I- cells through the E-E and the E-I connections. The
                    stimulated E- and I- cells fired almost simultaneously, or I- cells fired
                    slightly before E- cells fire (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g007">Figure 7A</xref> ii and iii) because E-I connections are stronger than E-E
                    connections. The firing of the E- cells continued for a while due to the
                    ‘chain reaction’ of E-E couplings and the I- cells
                    occasionally produced ‘spike doublets’ by this sustained
                    excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g007">Figure 7A iv and
                    7B</xref>). These inhibitory spike doublets are frequently observed during long
                    range synchronization processes in neural networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Traub1">[9]</xref>, usually along with
                    the ‘delayed’ excitation from distant cells. In our study
                    the E→E→I route could provide the
                    ‘delayed’ or ‘sustained’ excitation. As
                    a result of these E- and I- firing patterns, the E-I firing phase was
                    ∼0-degrees on average. When the average excitation to each I- cell is
                    strong enough to produce I- spike doublets, the E-I phase correlogram has two
                    peaks around 0-degrees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g005">Figure
                    5A</xref> * and **). If the excitation to I- cells is
                    not enough, or the inhibition of E- cells is strong so that the sustained E-
                    cell activity cannot drive I- cells to produce the second spike of spike
                    doublets, the E-I phase correlogram does not show clear peak separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g005">Figure 5A</xref> (iii) input strength
                    25 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>). In any case, the average E-I phase difference
                    is close to 0-degrees, clearly different from ∼70-degrees
                    ‘normal’ gamma phase distribution.</p>

                        <p>Raster plot of E- and I- cells spikes (A) and spike trains in sample E-
                            and I- cells (B). Only excitatory connections (E-E and E-I) are turned
                            on, while inhibitory connections (I-E and I-I) are turned off. (A) At
                            first, a small number of E- cells fire by FF input (i). These E- spikes
                            stimulate nearby E- and I- cells by E-E and E-I connections
                            respectively. Since the E-I connection is stronger than the E-E
                            connection in this model, I- cells fire (ii) before E- cells fire (iii)
                            in this cortical drive. The E- cells firing by means of the E-E
                            interactions continues for a while, due to the self-feedback in the E-E
                            interaction loop. As a result of this ‘lagged’
                            synchronization, the oscillation frequency is reduced. This duration of
                            excitation causes the second firing of I- cells (iv) to make a
                            ‘spike doublet’. The interval between the two spikes
                            in a spike doublet is determined by the refractory period of I- cells.
                            The first spike of a doublet forms the ‘E-E interaction
                            modulated phase’ in the E-I firing phase, while the second
                            spike forms the ‘normal’ gamma E-I phase. (B) I-
                            cells occasionally produce ‘spike doublets’. The
                            first I- spike in a doublet usually fires before nearby E- cells spike,
                            while the second I- spike usually follows the E- spike. If inhibitory
                            connections (I-E and I-I) are turned on, E- cells fire less than once in
                            each cycle, and I- spike doublets appear less frequently.</p>

                <p>The cortical response modification caused by this oscillation can be explained as
                    an effect of membrane potential oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Volgushev1">[21]</xref>. In addition,
                    the modulation of the E-E interaction by the FF input strength can be understood
                    as follows: as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure
                    3A</xref>, when the FF input strength is weak, each E- neuron can respond to
                    individual FF input only with the help of the collective cortical activity of E-
                    cells whose contribution is intrinsically periodic (oscillatory). The
                    probability of a cortical response to an FF input spike strongly depends on the
                    phase of oscillation of the E- cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g003">Figure 3A</xref> * and **),
                    and this dependence is significantly strengthened by the E-E coupling loop. In
                    the beginning of a gamma oscillation cycle, only a small number of E- cells fire
                    together, but they trigger an E-E coupling loop which drives more E- cells to
                    fire simultaneously. As a result, the peak firing rate of E- cells in a gamma
                    cycle is quite high, causing much higher spiking probability near the
                    oscillation peak. Therefore, (i) the cortical responsiveness is dependent on the
                    oscillation phase, and (ii) the gain or the cortical amplification is
                    proportional to the oscillation strength.</p>
                <p>When an FF input is strong enough to produce an output spike in each E- cell,
                    there is no significant dependence of the E- cell response on the periodic
                    cortical activity and E-E couplings, and each individual E- cell responds
                    directly to its FF input pattern, independently of the network activity. Since
                    the FF input spike train was generated by a random Poisson process, the cortical
                    response pattern is also random and not oscillatory. Although the average output
                    firing rate generally increases with increasing FF input strength, the cortical
                    response modulation actually decreases. The oscillations are depressed by
                    increasing the FF input strength while keeping the FF input rate constant. The
                    average number of FF input spikes does not decrease but the oscillation is
                    depressed, and the response function converges to the FF result. Although
                    cortical oscillation is initially established by the E-I and the I-E
                    interactions, the E-E cell interaction is crucial for responsiveness modulation
                    because its strength strongly depends on the FF input strength. Since the
                    cortical response modulation is controlled by the FF input strength in the
                    system via the self modification of network oscillation, this seems to be a very
                    effective automatic gain control system that does not require any synaptic
                    adaptation or learning mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Dan1">[37]</xref>.</p>
                <p>Next, we examine how the oscillation activity affects the response delay of the
                    network. Generally, the response time (time interval between an FF input spike
                    and a corresponding output spike) is relatively long (∼10 ms) for weak
                    inputs and becomes shorter as input strength increased for all cortical states
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). But there
                    is a significant difference in the average response time depending on the
                    network activity state. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g004">Figure
                    4B</xref> shows that the average response delay is shorter during spontaneous
                    oscillations than for the other two cortical activity states considered,
                    especially when the FF input is weak. As input strength increases, the response
                    of the oscillating network becomes similar to that of the oscillation inactive
                    network, but still faster than that of the FF network. For a sufficiently strong
                    FF input, the response time delay curve of the oscillating network and the
                    oscillation depressed network were almost the same, with a delay of about 4 ms,
                    agreeing with the experimentally known value for monosynaptic connections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Usrey1">[35]</xref>.
                    This is still faster than that measured for the FF network. Cortical interaction
                    adds some positive current to each neuron, and this additional current causes
                    the membrane voltage to reach the action potential threshold faster. In the
                    presence of cortical oscillation, the amount of cortical current added is larger
                    in the positive phase of the oscillation and on average, the larger the
                    oscillation, the greater the average positive current that is added to the cell.
                    That leads to faster responses than observed for the simple FF network. As the
                    FF input strength increases above 35 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>, the
                    oscillation amplitude decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and the net average positive current added is less. The
                    response time difference between oscillatory and FF networks decreases
                    accordingly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). E-E
                    cell interactions control the cortical oscillation strength, and the extent of
                    response delay modulation and the response modulation of the network are in turn
                    proportional to the cortical oscillation strength.</p>

                <title>Cortical Response Modification Is Localized: The FF Input Can Be Selectively

                <p>To examine the spatial localization of the cortical gain resulting from the

                    above. In the center region (diameter∼450 µm, including
                    ∼500 neurons, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g008">Figure
                    8A</xref> G1), the cells were activated as before with a FF input rate of 40
                    spikes/s, a rate that was also used to set up the spontaneous network activity
                    oscillations for the simulations described above. The surrounding neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g008">Figure 8A</xref> G2∼G11)
                    received a signal with an FF input rate of 10 spikes/s, a rate at which
                    spontaneous oscillations are hardly evident previously. The cortical neural
                    connectivity is the same everywhere so that the center and the surrounding
                    neurons could interact with each other. There are differences in the
                    responsiveness of the network between the central region that shows strong
                    spontaneous oscillations and the surrounding regions with little to no
                    oscillations. In other words, the responsiveness modification by the spontaneous
                    oscillation can be localized. A control simulation where all cortical neurons
                    received an FF input of 10 spike/s in both the center and the surrounding

                        <p>(A) In the center region (G1), cortical gamma oscillation is activated by
                            the higher FF input rate (40 spikes/s). Surrounding neurons are divided
                            into groups (G2∼G11) by their distance from the center, and
                            spontaneous oscillation is inactivated due to the lower FF input rate
                            (10 spikes/s). The control group (G<sub>∞</sub>) property was
                            separately achieved by a uniformly low FF input rate (10 spikes/s)
                            network, as an approximation of infinitely distant neurons.
                            Responsiveness and response delay measurements show that the properties
                            of surrounding neurons (G2∼G6) are continuously distributed
                            between G1 to G<sub>∞</sub> (insets), and distant groups
                            (G7∼G11) show almost the same property as
                            G<sub>∞</sub>. (B) For FF inputs weaker than the FF response
                            threshold (&lt;30 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>), responsiveness and
                            response delay changes gradually with the distance from the G1 boundary.
                            The G2 property is very similar to that of G1, while G11 properties are
                            almost the same as G<sub>∞</sub> properties. For stronger
                            inputs (&gt;30 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>), surrounding regions are
                            not much influenced by G1 oscillation. Most surrounding group properties
                            are similar to those of G<sub>∞</sub>, showing clear
                            localization of oscillation effect. For all FF input strength, the
                            influence of oscillation is certainly restricted within local area. (C)
                            The gamma oscillation effect localization is determined by the range of
                            single neuron synaptic connections. The E- and I- synaptic connections
                            of each single neuron are varied from their initial value
                            (100%, radius of 200 µm for E- cells, 100
                            µm for I- cells), to 50% (100 µm for E-
                            cells, 50 µm for I- cells). The ratio of E- to I- connections
                            range (2∶1) was kept the same in all cases. The area of
                            surrounding regions affected by the oscillation in the center region
                            shrinks, as the E- and I- synaptic connection range is reduced. For
                            comparisons, cortical responsiveness is normalized to the value of the
                            center region in each case.</p>

                    respectively, than the FF response threshold value
                    (S<sub>thresh</sub> = 30

                    the responsiveness and the response delay pattern gradually moved from the
                    oscillation-active center region (G1) to approach the control oscillation
                    suppressed case (G<sub>∞</sub>). Subsets of the <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g008">Figure 8A</xref> graphs show that the quantities
                    measured in the surrounding regions G2∼G6 are continuously distributed
                    in the interval between the values obtained for G1 and G<sub>∞</sub>.
                    Values measured in surrounding regions G7∼G11 showed negligible
                    differences from those measured for G<sub>∞</sub>, and are not plotted
                    in the figure. The effect of oscillatory network activity is restricted to a
                    central local region about 500 µm in radius. When the FF input
                    strength is larger than S<sub>thresh</sub> but not very large (30
                        µS/cm<sup>2</sup>&lt;S<sub>input</sub>&lt;50
                        µS/cm<sup>2</sup>), the spatial attenuation of the cortical
                    activity effect is more apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, S<sub>input</sub> = 35
                        µS/cm<sup>2</sup>). In this case, all surrounding regions, even
                    including the nearest region G2, are clearly separated from G1, and are close to
                        G<sub>∞</sub>. In this case, the cortical oscillation activity
                    effect is restricted to the central activated region (G1). For very strong FF
                    inputs (50 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>&lt;S<sub>input</sub>), all response
                    properties converge to control group (G<sub>∞</sub>) behavior as
                    expected since under that condition oscillatory behavior is barely evident even
                    in the central region.</p>
                <p>It seems reasonable to expect that the spatial localization of gamma oscillation
                    is dependent upon the range of single neuron synaptic connectivity so that the
                    shorter synaptic connection range, the smaller the surrounding area that is
                    affected by the oscillation in the center. To verify this expectation, we
                    reduced the excitatory and the inhibitory synaptic interaction range from the
                    initial value (radius of 200 µm for E- cells, 100 µm for I-
                    cells), keeping the ratio of E- and I- range the same. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000342-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, the range of oscillation effect is
                    proportional to the single cell synaptic connection range, as expected. This
                    suggests that the effective range of gamma oscillations is strongly dependent
                    upon the details of the anatomical connectivity of neurons in experimental
                    observations.</p>
                <p>Thus the effect of cortical oscillation is fairly well localized for weak and
                    moderate FF input strengths. Neural response properties are modified only within
                    or near the area in which spontaneous oscillation is activated. This suggests
                    that spatially selective cortical response modification is possible. Spontaneous
                    cortical oscillations can be locally induced by spatially localized thalamic
                    inputs, and the cortical response character can also be selectively tuned within
                    a limited region.</p>

            <title>Discussion</title>
            <p>As shown above, cortical responsiveness to a single unpaired FF input spike is
                enhanced by synchronized gamma frequency oscillations with the help of E-E neuronal
                interaction, particularly for weak FF input strengths. The cortical response
                modulation is proportional to the oscillation strength which is controlled by the
                network itself depending on FF input strengths. This cortical effect is spatially
                localized fairly tightly depending upon the range of cell connectivity, suggesting
                that each cortical area can be tuned selectively by well localized FF inputs. These
                findings are relevant to previous experimental and simulational results, and improve

                <title>Gamma Oscillation with E-E Cells Interaction</title>
                <p>It was previously thought that cortical E-E activity interaction is not essential
                    for gamma rhythm generation but can modify the oscillation frequency and the
                    phase of cell firing pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Whittington2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Whittington3">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Traub3">[29]</xref>. A recent
                    experimental study showed that gamma rhythms in E-E cells activity can change
                    the E- and I- cells firing phase distribution, and suggested that it may
                    suppress the gamma oscillation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Morita1">[25]</xref>. We have shown that recurrent E-E interaction
                    significantly modulates the oscillation frequency, the firing phase distribution
                    of E- and I- cells, and the oscillation strength, without extinguishing the
                    cortical oscillation. Moderate levels of E-E interaction generally strengthen
                    the oscillation, causing the ∼0-degrees E-I firing phase and the lower
                    oscillation frequency (near beta range). As a result, it modulates the cortical
                    response function that is clearly relevant to encoding/decoding of information.
                    The fact that the effect of E-E interaction is self regulatory for FF input
                    strength variation suggests a useful mechanism for the cortical gain control,
                    without neuronal feedback loops from the visual cortex to earlier visual stages.</p>
                <p>This suggests a general mechanism by which the same types of neurons in different
                    cortical layers can have different properties due to the different coupling
                    within each layer. In previous studies, it was reported that the upper and the
                    lower layers of the cortex can have different oscillation characters and phase
                    response properties <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Buffalo1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Sejnowski1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Tsubo1">[40]</xref>. Our
                    observations about the phase and the frequency modulation of cortical
                    oscillation by E-E coupling, suggest that different neuronal properties in
                    different cortical layers may originate from the different lateral connectivity
                    (especially E-E coupling) strength in each layer. For example, neurons in the
                    different hippocampus regions (CA1 and CA3) show noticeably different firing
                    phase distribution and correlation activity patterns in gamma oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Csicsvari1">[27]</xref>.
                    Considering that the E-E couplings are significant in CA3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Amaral1">[41]</xref> while they are
                    sparse in CA1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Knowles1">[42]</xref>, this may be a situation in which the E-E

                <title>Responsiveness Tuning with Fast and Slow Cortical Oscillations</title>
                <p>Previous experimental work has shown that (i) the visual responsiveness of the
                    cortical network is significantly enhanced by slow cortical oscillation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Haider1">[1]</xref> and
                    (ii) the phase of slow theta rhythm (4∼8 Hz) oscillation modulates the
                    high frequency gamma (80∼150 Hz) band oscillation power <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Canolty1">[22]</xref>.
                    Here we provide a clue to a mechanism for modification of neural response
                    properties by various types of synchronized cortical network activities. As
                    shown above in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> section, when the gamma frequency oscillation is
                    generated, it enhances the neuronal responsiveness to weak FF input. If this
                    gamma power is modulated by slower (theta or lower frequency) rhythm, then the
                    network responsiveness could depend on the phase of this slow oscillation. This
                    suggests a simple and consistent basis for the modulation of high frequency
                    oscillation power by lower frequency activity. Some previous experimental work
                    has shown that the power and the frequency of gamma oscillations can be
                    modulated by various factors such as the operation of fast spiking interneurons
                    and some neuromodulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Bartos1">[10]</xref>. In our simulation, the strength of the gamma
                    oscillations can be significantly modified by changing the strength or rate of
                    the FF input, with the help of E-E interactions but without changing any
                    individual neuronal properties or network connectivity features. In addition,
                    our results on the gamma oscillation modulation mechanism do not require
                    modifying the FF input correlation pattern, learning/adaptation behaviors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Dan1">[37]</xref> in
                    cortical synapses, or cortico-thalamic feedbacks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Andolina1">[43]</xref>. If the slow
                    frequency oscillations affect the FF input strength or the input rate locally
                    within the network, the gamma oscillations will be readily modulated. The
                    consequent modulation of the responsiveness will depend on the phase of the low
                    frequency oscillation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Haider1">[1]</xref>.</p>

                <title>Controlled and Selective Responsiveness Modification</title>
                <p>This proposed responsiveness tuning mechanism does not require any accompanied
                    background activity control. Therefore it is simpler than those gain control
                    models suggested in the previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Wolfart1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Chance1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Ho1">[4]</xref> that are mostly dependent on the modulation of
                    the background activity. An important advantage of the present model is that the
                    response modification can be ‘dynamically selective’
                    according to the FF input strength and the FF input projection range variation.
                    Since the cortical gain is modulated by FF input strength, the cortical
                    amplification is selective to FF input strength. The system effectively
                    determines the ‘optimized’ gain via modulations of
                    oscillation power spontaneously, and can avoid unnecessary adjustments even
                    without any delayed feedbacks to thalamus or thalamo-cortical neurons. Moreover,
                    the tuning is spatially localized to distances of less than about 500
                    µm for weak FF inputs, and less than 50 µm for strong
                    inputs. This is comparable or even smaller than the size of the receptive field
                    of single neuron in the mammalian primary visual cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Jones1">[44]</xref>. Therefore
                    responsiveness modulation can be spatially selective, and this is more effective
                    than mechanisms proposed in previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Wolfart1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Chance1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Ho1">[4]</xref> where the cortical modulations were generally
                    global and the gain optimization could not be achieved easily. We also suggest
                    that this mechanism might be applicable to the functional modulation of the
                    relative weight between thalamic inputs versus cortical inputs to the visual
                    cortex neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000342-Nauhaus1">[45]</xref>.</p>

                    neuron.</p>
                <p>For cortico-cortical connection, the spatial kernel in the synaptic conductance
                    equation takes the form:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the j<sup>th</sup> and k<sup>th</sup> neurons'
                    spatial positions respectively. The decay constant, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 200 µm (for E- connections) and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 100 µm (for I-). The temporal kernel in the
                    equation is set to be<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and the time constants <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in milliseconds were chosen as (3, 1) for E- and (7, 1) for I-
                    synapses where C<sub>sσ′</sub> and
                    C<sub>tσ′</sub> are normalization constants chosen so that
                    that the sum of the contributions of the two kernels would sum to unity.</p>
                <p>We assume spatially isotropic local connections with a range of 200 µm
                    in radius for E- and 100 µm in radius for I- synapses.
                        W<sub>σσ′</sub> are strengths of synaptic
                    connections for the neuron pair of type (σ, σ′). If
                    all
                    W<sub>σσ′</sub> = 0,
                    the network is then equivalent to the simple FF model. When the cortical
                    synaptic connections were turned on, these values ratios were set to
                    (W<sub>EE</sub>, W<sub>IE</sub>, W<sub>EI</sub>,
                    W<sub>II</sub>) = (0.03: 0.06: 0.12: 0.12)
                    throughout the simulation. This condition was achieved from the parameter search
                    simulations shown in the first part of <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">results</xref> section.</p>
                <p>The contribution to the E- conductance by the FF input spikes was given by:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula></p>

                    5∼100 µS/cm<sup>2</sup>, throughout the simulations reported
                    here. The temporal kernel <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000342.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> has the same form as the E- temporal cortical kernel given
