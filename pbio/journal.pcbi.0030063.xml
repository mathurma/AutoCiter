Experimental studies of MYC binding to the genome are not fully consistent. While many c-<italic>MYC</italic> recognition sites can be identified in c-<italic>MYC</italic> responsive genes, other motif matches—even experimentally confirmed sites—are associated with genes showing no c-<italic>MYC</italic> response. We have developed a computational model that integrates multiple sources of evidence to predict which genes will bind and be regulated by MYC in vivo. First, a Bayesian network classifier is used to predict those c-<italic>MYC</italic> recognition sites that are most likely to exhibit high-occupancy binding in chromatin immunoprecipitation studies. This classifier incorporates genomic sequence, experimentally determined genomic chromatin acetylation islands, and predicted methylation status from a computational model estimating the likelihood of genomic DNA methylation. We find that the predictions from this classifier are also applicable to other transcription factors, such as cAMP-response element-binding protein, whose binding sites are sensitive to DNA methylation. Second, the MYC binding probability is combined with the gene expression profile data from nine independent microarray datasets in multiple tissues. Finally, we may consider gene function annotations in Gene Ontology to predict the c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets. We assess the performance of our prediction results by comparing them with the c-<italic>myc</italic> targets identified in the biomedical literature. In total, we predict 460 likely c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes in the human genome, of which 67 have been reported to be both bound and regulated by MYC, 68 are bound by MYC, and another 80 are MYC-regulated. The approach thus successfully identifies many known c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets and suggests many novel sites. Our findings suggest that to identify c-<italic>MYC</italic> genomic targets, integration of different data sources helps to improve the accuracy.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><sec id="st1"><title/><p>c-<italic>MYC</italic> is an important proto-oncogene that controls the expression of many other genes, and MYC regulation is deranged in many cancers. Identifying c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes is one of the key steps to understand both the biological role and molecular mechanism of c-<italic>MYC</italic> action. Defining the complete list of c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes and categorizing them as genes that are directly and indirectly modulated remains a challenge. Computational models also help us to understand the mechanisms modulating c-<italic>MYC</italic> function. We describe a method to predict where MYC will bind in the genome and which c-<italic>MYC</italic> binding sites will be biologically active. The method integrates multiple sources of data, including both genome sequence and functional annotations, to predict that 460 genes are direct c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets. These include many genes previously known to be c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets as well as 245 novel direct c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets. Using multiple, independent gene-expression datasets improves the sensitivity and specificity of the prediction and demonstrates significant tissue-specific variation in c-<italic>MYC</italic> action at different genes.

Human malignancies are often associated with aberration of the c-<italic>MYC</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b003">3</xref>]. The diversity of its functions has been attributed to c-<italic>MYC</italic>'s ability to activate or repress the transcription of an extensive array of target genes mediating a wide range of cellular activities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b006">6</xref>]. c-<italic>MYC'</italic>s actions are mediated by sequence-specific binding of the c<italic>-MYC</italic> protein, dimerized with its partner MAX, to DNA elements called E-boxes with the core sequence motif 5′-CACGTG-3′ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b009">9</xref>]. Binding of the MYC–MAX heterodimer to a target gene can directly activate or repress transcription, but many E-boxes do not bind MYC, and in many experimentally confirmed cases, MYC binding is not associated with changes in gene expression. Identifying functional MYC binding sites and target genes is a critical step in understanding both the biological role and molecular mechanism of MYC action.</p><p>mRNA expression studies have identified many target genes activated or repressed by c-<italic>MYC</italic> in various animal and human cells or cell lines. The number of experimentally validated c-<italic>myc</italic> targets are expanding rapidly thanks to the use of high throughput methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b013">13</xref>]. The recent studies of Basso et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b014">14</xref>] and Remondini et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b015">15</xref>] suggest that the potential list of c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets could be much larger than what was previously anticipated. However, different experimental and theoretical studies give quite different findings, and much work remains to be done to define the complete set of c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets.</p><p>Gene expression studies alone cannot discriminate between direct and indirect targets of c<italic>-MYC</italic> action, although network-based inference of direct action has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b014">14</xref>]. Recently, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and whole genome scale analysis of methylation status have emerged as new sources of relevant data for the analysis of genomic regulatory elements.</p><p>Theoretical analysis complements and extends experimental study, and several researchers have attempted to predict c<italic>-MYC</italic> target genes using computational methods. By searching human transcript sequence, analyzing E-box location, and using genomic sequence evolutionary conservation, Schuldiner et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b016">16</xref>] identified 12 putative targets, two of which were confirmed by subsequent experimental analysis. Zeller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b017">17</xref>] built a database of c-<italic>Myc</italic> responsive genes that have been reported in publications and supported by multiple lines of evidence. They then identified seven out of 12 candidate genes in this database using phylogenetic analysis, and they confirmed six of these predictions using ChIP. The use of evolutionary conservation is also supported by Haggerty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b018">18</xref>] who categorized c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets into two classes: Class I, to which the majority of genes belong, has E-boxes that are evolutionarily conserved; and Class II, which includes genes with no region of homology at or flanking the genomic regions that exhibit MYC binding.</p><p>The promoter regions of c-<italic>MYC</italic>–regulated genes often contain E-box sequences that bind MYC with high occupancy. Li et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b017">17</xref>] analyzed genomic binding sites for c-<italic>MYC</italic> in Burkitt lymphoma cells and found a strong correlation between MYC DNA binding and gene transcription, strengthening the view that high binding occupancy of a c-<italic>MYC</italic> site near a gene's promoter region is, to some extent, a sign of a c-<italic>MYC</italic> target gene. However, this is not a hard and fast rule, and many sites that bind MYC with high occupancy are not associated with c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes. Fernandez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b019">19</xref>] performed a large-scale assay for genomic Myc binding sites in vivo by quantitative ChIP. They found that promoter E-boxes are distributed in two groups differing in MYC binding occupancy. The strongest DNA-sequence characteristic of high-affinity/high-occupancy targets was location of the E-box within a CpG island. This observation can be partially explained by the fact that most CpG dinucleotides in the mammalian genome are subject to cytosine methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b021">21</xref>], but the methylation of the CpG dinucleotide in the consensus myc binding site sequence reduces the binding affinity of myc–max dimers for the target DNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b023">23</xref>]. Further, DNA methylation is often coupled to and associated with histone methylation and the formation of heterochromatin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b024">24</xref>]. Recent work by Ernesto [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b025">25</xref>] shows that target sites are only recognized MYC by whether they are packaged in chromatin bearing high H3 K4/K79 methylation and H3 acetylation. This is true for both classic E-box (CACGTG) and alternative sequence sites.</p><p>With the abundant volumes of experimental data on c-<italic>MYC</italic> target gene expression and in vivo binding of MYC to the genome, there is an increasing need to integrate these information resources and to classify c-<italic>MYC</italic> responsive genes into direct and indirect targets. In this paper, we identified c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes using a computational approach that draws on data from multiple sources including gene expression profiling, gene annotations, ChIP, sequence conservation, and sequence composition. First, we developed a computational model to predict the likelihood of CpG methylation. Next, we developed a computational strategy to predict which E-box sites were likely to be functional MYC binding sites. Finally, the binding predictions were integrated with gene expression and gene annotation data to identify direct and indirect c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes. The performance of these tools was validated by comparison with multiple experimental datasets. Our method is able to successfully predict the occupancy of the binding sites as revealed by CHIP. Although this computational method was specifically built on c-<italic>MYC</italic> data, it also provides useful information on the binding of cAMP-response element-binding protein (CREB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b026">26</xref>], another transcription factor whose binding is sensitive to DNA methylation. After further integration with gene expression data from different tissues and datasets, and the Gene Ontology (GO) annotations for c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets, we identified 460 likely c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes. Of these genes, 215 have been previously identified as MYC bound or regulated and 245 are novel. Our study shows that integrating multiple data sources improved the prediction specificity of MYC binding site prediction. Similarly, using gene expression profiles from several independent studies improved the sensitivity for target gene prediction. Our analysis suggests that much of the variation between microarray-based gene expression assays may be due to limitations of the technology. In addition, there appears to be a significant tissue-specific component to the responses of some c-<italic>MYC</italic> target genes.</p></sec><sec id="s2"><title>Results</title><sec id="s2a"><title>Computational Prediction of Genome CpG Islands and Hypomethylation Regions</title><p>The performance of the fifth-order Markov model for genomic methylation status was tested using an independent dataset from the Human Epigenome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b027">27</xref>]. We found that 86.4% of these unmethylated sites fell within our predicted hypomethylation regions. In contrast, only 22% of the hypermethylated CpG sites were within the predicted hypomethylated regions (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e−16). We applied this model to predict the CpG islands and hypomethylation regions on the human genome. On the human repeat masked genome NCBI35, we found that 0.71% of the human genome sequences were CpG islands and 1.07% of the genome sequences were predicted to be hypomethylated regions, with 82% of the CpG islands falling within hypomethylated regions. As anticipated, promoter regions had much higher percentages of CpG islands and hypomethylated regions than the whole genome. Based on our prediction results, 43% of the human genes had CpG islands and 46% of the genes had hypomethylated regions within 5 Kb upstream of their transcription start sites. In the 5 Kb upstream of the transcription start sites, 4.4% of the sequence was covered by a CpG islands and 6.7% of sequences were predicted to be hypomethylated.</p></sec><sec id="s2b"><title>Computational Prediction of High Occupancy MYC Binding Sites</title><p>In this step we identified sites in the human genome where MYC is expected to bind in vivo with high occupancy. Candidate MYC binding sites were identified by scanning the complete human genome sequencing using the TRANSFAC MATCH algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b028">28</xref>] and the MYC–MAX position specific weight matrix (PSWM) MA0059 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b029">29</xref>] from the JASPAR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b031">31</xref>]. Sites that achieved a matrix score of 0.8 are referred to as motif matches. Four additional sources of data were used to define a subset of these motif matches that are likely to bind MYC in vivo: proximity to transcription start sites, proximity to CpG islands, predicted hypomethylation, and evolutionary conservation.</p><p>To train our algorithm, we began with the Fernandez et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b019">19</xref>] data for genomic Myc binding sites in live human cells. This study examined MYC binding to more than 700 E-box sequences in vivo by quantitative ChIP. The authors found that promoter E-boxes were distributed in two groups that bound MYC at distinct frequencies. In the Fernandez et al. dataset, we only used sites where the PCR primers and the associated E-box could be mapped back to the human genome as an exact sequence match. Further, sites were excluded when the dataset contained multiple contradictory assay results. This filtering process resulted in a set of 493 binding sites where ChIP was measured in either U937 or HL60 cell lines (for 40% of the sites, data is available and consistent across both cell lines). A high quality training dataset was defined using sites where ChIP results were consistent across more than one assay. The training set had 43 nonredundant high-occupancy sites and 90 nonredundant low-occupancy sites.</p><p>Using a Bayesian network classifier, we integrated this high quality training subset of the ChIP dataset with our hypomethylation analysis and genomic sequence conservation data. The resulting classifier predicts which sites in the genome are likely binding MYC with high occupancy. In the training process, we looked for the most important factors determining MYC binding to DNA. The Kolmogorov–Smirnov test showed that the following factors differed significantly (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01) between the high- and low-occupancy sites: distance to transcription start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030063-g001">Figure 1</xref>A), distance to nearest CpG island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030063-g001">Figure 1</xref>B), distance to nearest hypomethylation region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030063-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), phastCons scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030063-g001">Figure 1</xref>D), and distance to nearest chromatin acetylation island (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030063-g001">Figure 1</xref>E). The CpG islands and hypomethylation regions near or overlapping with the above MYC binding sites were predicted with our Fast Motif Analyzer (FMA), described in the Materials and Methods section. The acetylation island information was derived from the Roh et al. high-resolution genome-wide mapping of Lys 9 and Lys 14 diacetyl histone H3 in resting and activated human T cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b033">33</xref>]. PhastCons scores identify evolutionarily conserved elements using a multiple alignment of genomic sequence weighted using a phylogenetic tree. The PhastCons score is a base-by-base conservation score that can be interpreted as the probability that each base is in a conserved sequence element [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b032">32</xref>]. This score is chosen as a measurement of sequence conservation over other alternatives because it is available through the widely used University of California Santa Cruz Genome Browser, and could be readily incorporated into our model.</p><fig id="pcbi-0030063-g001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030063.g001</object-id><label>Figure 1</label><caption><title>Distribution of Sequence Attributes</title><p>Distribution of sequence attributes used as input for the Bayesian classification.</p><p>(A) Distribution of distances to transcription start site.</p><p>(B) Distribution of distances to nearest CpG islands.</p><p>(C) Distribution of distances to nearest hypomethylation region.</p><p>(D) Distribution of PhastCons scores from the UCSC genome database.</p><p>(E) Distribution of distances to nearest chromatin acetylation island.</p><p>Sequence distance is shown in base pairs.

We considered binding sites within ±3 Kb of transcription start sites, because almost all of the sites in the training data are within this region. We used the MYC–MAX matrix MA0059 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b029">29</xref>] from the JASPAR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b030">30</xref>] to identify putative MYC binding sites, and we applied the rules described above to sort these sites into groups predicted to bind MYC with high and low occupancy. Using TRANSFAC MATCH to analyze the complete human genome sequence, we identified 89,560 MYC sites within ±3 Kb of a transcription start site for 14,387 genes. From these candidate sites, our method classified 14,638 sites in 5,276 genes as likely to bind MYC with high occupancy.</p><p>We assessed the reliability of these predictions by comparing them with two independently published experimental datasets. One dataset is from Zeller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b035">35</xref>] using ChIP–PET to map genomic c-<italic>MYC</italic> binding sites in human B cells. This study the identified loci as PET sequence tag clusters with varying numbers of tags per cluster. More tags matching a cluster increases the reliability of binding site identification. Zeller's paper defined 964 PET-2+ clusters with two or more tags per cluster falling within 3 kb of a TSS. PET-2+ may contain a significant number of false positive identifications. Zeller et al. also defined 113 PET-3+ cluster with three or more tags per cluster and within 3 kb of a TSS. These are believed to be highly reliable identifications. For the second evaluation dataset, we used high-density oligonucleotide array ChIP–chip data from Cawley et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b036">36</xref>]. Looking only at Chromosomes 21 and 22, Cawley et al. defined 181 high-occupancy MYC binding segments within 3 kb of a TSS.</p><p>In the experimental datasets, MYC binding is localized to a segment of genome, but not necessarily a single E-box. We refer to these segments as “MYC binding loci” and compare these with our predictions at the gene level. Most of the experimentally defined MYC binding loci are associated with a single gene. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030063-t001">Table 1</xref> compares the experimentally defined MYC binding loci that are within 3 Kb of a transcription start site with those that were predicted by our methods. First, it is apparent that the different experimental assays yield markedly different results. Only one of the 113 Zeller PET-3+ loci was also scored as a high-occupancy binding site by Fernandez et al. Similarly, only one of six Zeller PET-3+ loci on Chromosomes 21 and 22 was identified as a high-occupancy site by Cawley et al., and only four of the 181 binding loci identified by Cawley et al. were scored as high occupancy in the Fernandez dataset. Comparing our predictions with the experimental datasets, we see higher levels of agreement than the experimental datasets show among themselves. This is in part a consequence of the fact that our method predicted a larger number of loci (5,276) than are observed in the experimental datasets. Interestingly, the fractional overlap between our predictions and the Zeller et al. dataset increases as we consider more confident clusters. Whereas only about a quarter of the PET-2+ clusters contain a predicted high-occupancy site, half of the PET-3+ cluster and all of the PET-4+ clusters do. One-third of the loci identified by Cawley et al. on Chromosomes 21 and 22 contain a site predicted to bind MYC with high occupancy, and more than a quarter of our predicted high-occupancy sites on these chromosomes are confirmed by Cawley et al.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030063-t001" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030063.t001</object-id><label>Table 1</label><caption><p>Comparison of Predicted MYC Binding Loci with Published Experimental Datasets</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030063.t001" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb1col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col2" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col3" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col5" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col6" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb1col7" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Dataset</td><td><hr/>Cawley (Chromosomes 21 and 22)</td><td><hr/>Zeller (PET-2&plus;)</td><td><hr/>Zeller (PET-3&plus;)</td><td><hr/>Zeller (PET-4&plus;)</td><td><hr/>Fernandez</td><td><hr/>Our Prediction</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>Cawley (Chromosome 21 and 22)</td><td>181<sup>a</sup></td><td>&ensp;&ensp;&hairsp;7<sup>a</sup></td><td>1<sup>a</sup></td><td>0<sup>a</sup></td><td>&ensp;&thinsp;&hairsp;4<sup>a</sup></td><td>&ensp;&ensp;&hairsp;58<sup>a</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Zeller (PET-2&plus;)</td><td></td><td>964 (45<sup>a</sup>)</td><td>113 (6<sup>a</sup>)</td><td>9 (2<sup>a</sup>)</td><td>&ensp;10</td><td>&ensp;&hairsp;262</td></tr><tr><td>Zeller (PET-3&plus;)</td><td></td><td></td><td>113 (6<sup>a</sup>)</td><td>9 (2<sup>a</sup>)</td><td>&ensp;&ensp;1</td><td>&ensp;&ensp;&hairsp;56</td></tr><tr><td>Zeller (PET-4&plus;)</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>9 (2<sup> a</sup> )</td><td>&ensp;&ensp;0</td><td>&ensp;&ensp;&ensp;&hairsp;9</td></tr><tr><td>Fernandez</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>183 (10<sup>a</sup>)</td><td>&ensp;&hairsp;130<sup>b</sup></td></tr><tr><td>Our prediction</td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td></td><td>5,276 (204<sup>a</sup>)</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- <table-wrap-foot><fn id="nt101"><p><sup>a</sup>Number of loci on Chromosomes 21 and 22 in corresponding dataset.</p></fn><fn id="nt102"><p><sup>b</sup>Fernandez dataset is used for training our model, so this is not an independent assessment.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot> --></table-wrap><p>To extend the analysis to more tissues and cell types, we used data from the MYC Target Gene Database. We compared predictions for genes annotated as c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets with predictions for a collection of genes selected at random from the human genome. The MYC Target Gene Database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b017">17</xref>] includes more than 1,000 putative MYC target genes reported to be either regulated or bound by Myc. These MYC target genes tend to have more MYC recognition sites than do randomly selected genes. <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030063-t002">Table 2</xref> shows the performance of our algorithm in the prediction of high-occupancy binding sites. Each gene in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030063-t002">Table 2</xref> contains at least one putative MYC site predicted by a motif match. The MYC target genes are compared with a set of 1,000 randomly selected genes containing 6,259 MYC sites, which served as the control group. Second, we chose 589 genes showing myc binding from the MYC Target Gene Database that were not in Fernandez's dataset. Third, we chose 417 genes showing Myc regulation for which no binding data was available. The fourth set consisted of 98 genes in MYC Target Gene Database showing both myc binding and myc regulation that were not in Fernandez's dataset. For each group of genes, we used our algorithm to predict the occupancy of each MYC recognition site. Statistical significance was assessed using Fisher's exact test on each test group against the control group. We found that each of the putative c-<italic>MYC</italic> target groups had a significantly higher percentage of high-occupancy binding sites than the genes in the randomly selected group. This demonstrates that our algorithm is able to discriminate biologically functional high-occupancy sites from low-occupancy, presumably nonfunctional binding-site motif matches.</p><table-wrap content-type="1col" id="pcbi-0030063-t002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030063.t002</object-id><label>Table 2</label><caption><p>Performance on MYC High-Occupancy Sites Prediction</p></caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.0030063.t002" xlink:type="simple"/><!-- <table frame="hsides" rules="none"><colgroup><col id="tb2col1" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/><col id="tb2col2" align="char" charoff="0" char="."/><col id="tb2col3" align="char" charoff="0" char="("/><col id="tb2col4" align="left" charoff="0" char=""/></colgroup><thead><tr><td align="left"><hr/>Test Dataset (All the Genes Have at Least One Motif That Matches Predicted MYC Site)</td><td><hr/>Predicted Low Sites</td><td><hr/>Predicted High Sites</td><td><hr/>Fisher Exact Test</td></tr></thead><tbody><tr><td>6,259 MYC sites on 1,000 random genes</td><td>5,361 (86&percnt;)</td><td>898 (14&percnt;)</td><td>Control</td></tr><tr><td>3,323 MYC sites on 589 MYC binding genes, but not in Fernandez's datasets</td><td>2,271 (68&percnt;)</td><td>1,052 (32&percnt;)</td><td><italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e-16</td></tr><tr><td>2,673 MYC sites on 417 genes showing MYC regulation and without binding data, but not in Fernandez's datasets</td><td>1,979 (74&percnt;)</td><td>694 (26&percnt;)</td><td><italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e-16</td></tr><tr><td>648 MYC sites on 98 genes showing binding and regulation by MYC, but not in Fernandez's datasets</td><td>406 (63&percnt;)</td><td>242 (37&percnt;)</td><td><italic>p</italic> &lt; 2.2e-16</td></tr></tbody></table> --><!-- --></table-wrap><p>We next asked what genes were associated with the high-occupancy binding sites.

CREB has a CpG dinucleotide in its binding sequence and its binding is sensitive to DNA methylation. We applied our method to the analysis of CREB sites and compared our predictions with a previous ChIP–chip study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b026">26</xref>] of 10,209 distinct promoters on the human genome that were predicted to have at least one cAMP-responsive element defined as a match to a simple cAMP-responsive element consensus-site algorithm. Forty of these sites were confirmed by manual ChIP assays. Applying our model to these 40 genes, we correctly classified 21 of the 23 high CREB occupancy genes with seven false positives (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030063-t004">Table 4</xref>).

By combining the myc binding probability, gene co-expression data, and functional annotations, we predicted 460 c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets among the genes presented on Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 platform. The list of predicted c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets contains many genes found previously in the literature, but also 245 genes not previously identified as c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets. Our method only predicts upregulated c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets because downregulated c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets are not generally mediated by E-box binding. Among the 67 predicted genes that have already been observed to be bound and regulated by MYC, 61 are upregulated by MYC, five genes are reported to be downregulated, and one has evidence for both downregulation and upregulation. Thus, the predicted MYC targets agree well with previous observations. In addition to these 67 independently validated predictions, we also identify 148 genes in the MYC Target Database, 68 of which are bound by MYC in vivo and 80 of which are MYC regulated (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030063-t006">Table 6</xref>). Among the 250 predicted novel targets, 27 correspond to MYC binding loci reported by Zeller et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b035">35</xref>] and 11 of these correspond to highly reliable binding loci with PET-3+ clusters.</p><p>Different from previous studies predicting c-<italic>myc</italic> targets, our study integrated four sources of data (genomic sequence, gene expression, ChIP, and functional annotation) to improve the specificity of predictions. Tools such as TRANSFAC or MatInspector, which rely on motif matches alone to predict myc binding, have very high false positive rates. The improved specificity obtained by our integrated approach emphasizes the importance of epigenetic factors in modulating c-<italic>MYC</italic> binding to DNA. Although epigenetic status does vary with tissue type and other factors, recent high throughput studies show that tissue-specific variation in genomic methylation is limited [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b027">27</xref>]. Adding genomic acetylation islands data obtained on T cells to the model improved the prediction precision from 0.81 to 0.88 and the recall from 0.88 to 0.98 in cross-validation. Among the attributes considered in the model, we found that the distance to the nearest hypomethylation region is the most informative; this attribute alone could correctly identify 80% of the high- and low-occupancy sites in the cross validation. However, adding the additional attributes does improve performance, and considering all five attributes allows the model to correctly identify 95% of all the cases in cross-validation.</p><p>MYC is not the only transcriptional factor whose binding is sensitive to the epigenetic factors such as DNA methylation or chromatin acetylation. Because the attributes used in our model are general and the epigenetic factors could influence DNA binding through similar mechanisms, elements of our model may also be useful for other transcription factors. As a validation we applied our MYC binding prediction model to another transcription factor, CREB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b026">26</xref>]. Like MYC, the CREB consensus binding sequence has a CpG dinucleotide and CREB binding is sensitive to DNA methylation. Our analysis shows that although our model was specifically built for the study of c-<italic>MYC</italic>, it is still able to correctly discriminate most of the high-occupancy binding sites and the majority of low-occupancy binding sites. Thus, our approach to modeling chromatin structure effects is transferable to other transcription factors. ChIP–chip technology can partially address the question of where transcription factors bind the genome, but with current technology the resolution of TF binding loci is limited and the data are error-prone. In addition, computational modeling can help to understand the complex transcriptional machinery. For example, adding or removing an attribute to the model and assessing the affects on performance is one way to evaluate the importance of this attribute on the regulation of the DNA binding by a transcription factor.</p><p>Combining different types of data offsets the shortcoming of each. Obviously, our predictions based on genome sequence alone cannot address tissue specific binding. However, by taking gene expression data of specific tissues into consideration, we restrict our identified targets to those functionally regulated by MYC in the context of certain tissues, which would be of real interest to the biological community. In addition, integration of different types of data also allows us to predict which DNA–protein binding sites are likely to trigger transcriptional regulation. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-0030063-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows that compared with the expression of all genes, a higher portion of genes from our MYC binding and function predictions are highly correlated with c-<italic>MYC</italic> expression. This demonstrates that our binding prediction and gene function analysis do identify bona fide c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets and are helpful in improving the specificity of prediction.</p><p>One of the limitations in our target gene analysis is that we only consider genomic sequences within 3 Kb of transcription start sites. This was done because almost all of the sites in our training data fall within this region, but there are some high-occupancy MYC target sites far from any known transcription start sites. It is possible that there are direct c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets where the only functional MYC sites are more than 3 Kb from the transcription start site. Increasing the search window for c-<italic>MYC</italic> recognition sites might improve the sensitivity of prediction, but such a change would also decrease specificity.</p><p>Another limitation of our method is that we only consider E-box–dependent MYC binding and regulation; MYC targets regulated through other mechanisms will not be identified. Transcriptional inhibition of MYC targets is often mediated by mechanisms unrelated to E-box binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b043">43</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b047">47</xref>]. Therefore, we only consider the MYC activation in our predictions and consider only the expression of target genes that is positively correlated with c-<italic>MYC</italic> expression. We do observe a minority of genes where there is a significant anti-correlation of gene expression with c-<italic>MYC</italic> expression. The analysis of these cases will be the subject of future work.</p><p>Distinguishing between direct and indirect targets of MYC is an important issue. In the co-expression analysis we found a large number of genes where expression levels showed positive correlations with c-<italic>MYC</italic> expression and yet lacked a high-occupancy MYC binding site, either predicted or experimental. We believe that many of the genes are not the direct targets of MYC, but it is difficult to exclude the possibility that they contain a functional MYC binding site not detected by our own or experimental methods.</p><p>MYC responses vary significantly between different tissues. Less than half of our predicted MYC targets show significant gene expression correlation with c-<italic>MYC</italic> in both B cells and prostate cancers. We analyzed seven additional independent microarray datasets (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030063-t006">Table 6</xref>) where the c-<italic>MYC</italic> gene was deregulated and its probe-set signals showed large variance across samples. In these studies, many predicted MYC targets, including genes that have been experimentally verified as direct MYC targets, failed to show a strong correlation of target gene expression with MYC expression. The differences between these datasets cannot be explained by tissue of origin alone. For example, datasets 2, 3, and 4 are all derived from the prostate, but the c-<italic>MYC</italic> correlated targets from these three datasets do not agree more than those from different tissues (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030063-sg003">Figures S3</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030063-sg005">S5</xref>). Some of this variation could be a result of technical variation in gene expression profiles between different laboratories and experiments.</p><p>This is one of the first studies to systematically analyze c-<italic>myc</italic> targets in multiple datasets and in multiple tissues; most previous studies focused on a single tissue or cell line. Our analysis confirms the well-known finding that c-<italic>MYC</italic> is deregulated in many cancers and has a direct influence on the expression of hundreds of other genes. One potential pitfall in using GO as a criterion for predicting MYC targets is the possibility of missing important groups of targets that do not fall into a specific GO category or are not annotated by GO at all. In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030063-st003">Table S3</xref> we also provide the list of 1,188 predicted targets without applying GO filtering in the prediction. A second concern is that it is difficult to define a test set that is totally independent of prior knowledge because we cannot exclude the possibility that GO annotators were aware of MYC regulation status in assigning gene annotations.</p><p>Looking at the target genes we predicted that were not in the Basso et al. prediction, we find variable levels of correlation with MYC expression across the different datasets that we have examined. Even genes that have been identified as c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets in published literature often have very different co-expression patterns with c-<italic>MYC</italic> in different microarray datasets. This is consistent with the view that many of the differences among these high throughput studies may result from experimental variation, the noise inherent in these approaches, and the effects of cell density or the number of culture passages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b048">48</xref>]. Whether this reflects tissue-specific responses or technical variation in microarray data, it is apparent that a study focusing on any single dataset will be insufficient. As is shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-0030063-t006">Table 6</xref>, using multiple datasets from different studies improved the power of the prediction.</p><p>Because the current study only predicted upregulated genes with MYC binding motifs close to the transcription start site, which are on the Affymetrix HG-U95Av2 array and which have GO annotations, we believe that the 460 targets identified here underestimate the number of direct MYC targets in the human genome. Our estimates for the number of MYC targets in the human genome are roughly consistent with the MYC database and the high-confidence Zeller [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b035">35</xref>] and Cawley [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b036">36</xref>] studies. They are not inconsistent with the larger numbers of c-<italic>MYC</italic> targets suggested by some other studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b015">15</xref>]. One explanation for this range of findings is that MYC binding in vivo is not a Boolean event and even strong MYC binding sites are unlikely to be occupied with unit stoichiometry. Thus, different studies may be applying different thresholds for defining a MYC target.</p></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Data sources.</title><p>All the genes in the paper and their Entrez Gene IDs can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030063-st001">Tables S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030063-st003">S3</xref>.</p><p>The HG17 build of the human genome sequence was downloaded from the University of California Santa Cruz (UCSC) genome database.

The hypomethylation score for a region is the sum of the log likelihood ratio scores for all overlapping hexamers in the region, expressed as log base 2. This score measures how similar the hexamer content of a region is to the hexamer frequencies in the hypomethylated sequences training set described below. The boundaries for a predicted hypomethylation region are chosen to maximize this log likelihood ratio score, with constraints that each predicted region must score at least 23.1 bits and must not contain any subregion whose score is more negative than −14.5 bits. An optimized hexamer score cutoff is determined as shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi-0030063-sg001">Figure S1</xref>.
				</p><p>This algorithm is implemented in the program FMA, a C++ program, which utilizes a hexamer model to predict hypomethylation regions. The output includes the exact locations of CpG islands, the fraction of CpG dinucleotides, and the exact location and score (log<sub>2</sub><italic>L<sub>nm</sub></italic>) of each hypomethylation region. FMA also implements an efficient indexed motif search. In the first phase of the FMA search, each PSWM in the query set is analyzed and the most informative contiguous six-nucleotide core segment is identified. Next, a branch-and-bound strategy is used to enumerate all hexamers matching this core segment and able to be extended over the full PSWM to achieve a specified log likelihood threshold for the full match. Hexamers in this set are stored in a suffix tree. During the search, the target sequence is first scanned using the suffix tree to find core segment matches. These matches are then extended over the full PSWM to see if they achieve the specified log likelihood threshold. Using this approach, we are able to exhaustively search large target sequence libraries for matches to large query sets of PSWM.</p><p>The training data for hypomethylated human genomic sequences were obtained by aligning the hypomethylated sequence tags collected by Cross et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b051">51</xref>] with the human genome sequence and extending to the nearest MseI site. These hypomethylated sequence tag sequences were obtained by digesting human genomic DNA from peripheral blood leukocytes with MseI, selecting fragments that failed to bind a methyl–CpG binding protein column, methylating these fragments in vitro, and subsequently selecting fragments that bound the methyl–CpG binding protein column. This yields a collection of genomic DNA fragments that were not methylated in vivo, but which contained a CpG dinucleotide that could be methylated in vitro. These fragments were subsequently cloned and subjected to end-sequence analysis. By aligning the end-sequence tag to genomic sequence and extending to the nearest MseI site, we reconstruct the sequence of the full hypomethylated DNA segment.</p><p>Validation data for hypomethylation predictions were obtained from the Human EpiGenome Project [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b027">27</xref>].</p></sec><sec id="s4d"><title>Genome-wide prediction of high-occupancy MYC binding sites.</title><p>TRANSFAC was used to scan the human genome sequence for putative c-<italic>MYC</italic> binding sites with the MYC–MAX position weight matrix [MA0059] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b029">29</xref>] from the JASPAR database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi-0030063-b030">30</xref>].</p><p>The sequence attributes for each putative binding site were inputted into the Bayesian network classifier (see above) to predict the probability of MYC binding for each site.
