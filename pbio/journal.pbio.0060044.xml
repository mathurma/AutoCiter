        <p>The translocation of single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) across membranes of two cells is a fundamental biological process occurring in both bacterial conjugation and <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> pathogenesis. Whereas bacterial conjugation spreads antibiotic resistance, <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> facilitates efficient interkingdom transfer of ssDNA from its cytoplasm to the host plant cell nucleus. These processes rely on the Type IV secretion system (T4SS), an active multiprotein channel spanning the bacterial inner and outer membranes. T4SSs export specific proteins, among them relaxases, which covalently bind to the 5' end of the translocated ssDNA and mediate ssDNA export. In <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</named-content>, another exported protein—VirE2—enhances ssDNA transfer efficiency 2000-fold. VirE2 binds cooperatively to the transferred ssDNA (T-DNA) and forms a compact helical structure, mediating T-DNA import into the host cell nucleus. We demonstrated—using single-molecule techniques—that by cooperatively binding to ssDNA, VirE2 proteins act as a powerful molecular machine. VirE2 actively pulls ssDNA and is capable of working against 50-pN loads without the need for external energy sources. Combining biochemical and cell biology data, we suggest that, in vivo, VirE2 binding to ssDNA allows an efficient import and pulling of ssDNA into the host. These findings provide a new insight into the ssDNA translocation mechanism from the recipient cell perspective. Efficient translocation only relies on the presence of ssDNA binding proteins in the recipient cell that compacts ssDNA upon binding. This facilitated transfer could hence be a more general ssDNA import mechanism also occurring in bacterial conjugation and DNA uptake processes.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>The importation of genetic material into cells is a common and fundamental mechanism occurring in bacterial conjugation, DNA uptake, and <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> plant infection and is, for instance, responsible for antibiotic resistance spread. Previous studies suggested that this process relied only on the activity of complex molecular machines pumping the single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into the recipient cell. Here, we show that proteins provided by the pathogenic organism and translocated prior to the arrival of ssDNA into the recipient cell also play a fundamental role. These proteins not only bind to ssDNA to protect it but also rearrange ssDNA into a compact helix, thus generating a contractile force that pulls the DNA into the host. Interestingly, the production of mechanical energy occurs solely through the free-energy gain during the binding of VirE2 to ssDNA without the need for an external source of energy, such as nucleotide hydrolysis.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p><named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Agrobacterium tumefaciens</named-content> is a Gram-negative pathogenic bacterium able to transfer and integrate up to 150,000-bases-long single-stranded DNA (ssDNA) into the infected cell nuclear genome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b001">1</xref>]. In <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> pathogenesis, the sequence of ssDNA to be transferred (T-DNA) and the genes encoding the virulence (Vir) proteins required for transfer of T-DNA into the host are localized on a large plasmid called the tumor-inducing plasmid [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b002">2</xref>]. Some virulence proteins have a function in the bacterium, namely the 11 VirB proteins and VirD4, which compose the Type IV secretion system (T4SS) machinery. T4SS exports T-DNA and effector proteins out of the bacterium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b005">5</xref>]. The effectors are proteins, which are synthesized in the bacterium but exert their function in the recipient cell. The export signal of the effector proteins is localized at their C terminus and is recognized by VirD4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b006">6</xref>]. Among the effectors, the relaxase VirD2 binds covalently to the 5′ end of the ssDNA. The combined action of the three NTP-binding/hydrolysing proteins VirB4, VirB11, and VirD4 has been proposed to energize the transfer of the proteins and VirD2-T-DNA through the T4SS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b007">7</xref>]. How the T-DNA then crosses the plasma membrane of the host remains unknown, but the effector protein VirE2 might be involved. In vitro, VirE2 was shown to form channels, which transport ssDNA, and VirE2 was hence proposed to mediate transfer of T-DNA through the eukaryotic plasma membrane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b010">10</xref>]. VirE2 is a necessary, multifunctional protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b011">11</xref>] and another important function of VirE2 is to bind cooperatively T-DNA in the host cytosol. The interaction of VirE2 with T-DNA mediates its import into the nucleus. As evidenced by scanning transmission electron microscopy (STEM), the VirE2–ssDNA complex consists of a helical structure in which 19 nucleotides are bound per VirE2 monomer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b012">12</xref>]. This structure prevents exonuclease degradation in vitro [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b013">13</xref>]. Moreover, recent in vitro experiments demonstrate the microtubule-guided transport of such DNA–VirE2 complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b014">14</xref>].</p>
      <p>Using single-molecule technology, we measured the binding properties of VirE2 to ssDNA, and we suggest here that VirE2 binds to ssDNA nucleotides in a zipper-like mode. This property was confirmed biochemically with the ability of the VirE2 protein to bind to a shorter oligonucleotide than its footprint of 19 nucleotides. We also show that cooperative VirE2 binding compacts the ssDNA against high loads (50 pN), which could, in vivo, help to actively pull the T-DNA into the recipient cell. Using cell biology detection techniques, VirE2 was localized at the plant cell periphery, an ideal localization for VirE2-mediated pulling of the incoming T-DNA. Altogether, a combination of very different techniques allowed the emergence of a completely new view on T-DNA transfer energetics upon translocation into the host plant cell.</p>

        <title>Force-Dependent Polymerization Kinetics on ssDNA</title>
        <p>Binding of VirE2 to ssDNA was studied using different optical tweezers modes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, inset). First, the VirE2 binding rate was determined at a pre-set force that was kept constant by a feedback system (force-feedback experiment, [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, inset]; VirE2 concentration of 20 μg/ml, 330 nM). Polymerization of VirE2 dramatically affected the length of the tethered ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). From a detailed analysis of the time traces [<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg001">Figure S1</xref>, showing a plot where the transition takes place; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sd001">Text S1</xref>, section: Rate of polymerization (experimental determination)], we found a value of (1510 ± 200) nm/s (<italic>n</italic> = 5) for the polymerization rate originating from a single nucleation site (5 pN). For the 4,502-bases-long DNA and taking 19 as the number of nucleotides bound per VirE2 monomers (as determined by scanning transmission electron microscopy) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b012">12</xref>], this yields a binding rate of ∼10 VirE2/ms at a VirE2 concentration of 20 μg/ml (5 pN). These force-feedback experiments were performed at different forces. For forces ≤22 pN, the normalized extension at full polymerization was found to be about 0.11 ± 0.02 (<italic>n</italic> = 21). Compaction also occurred even when the ssDNA was forced to remain in an extended form (50.5 pN; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). At this force, the polymerization rate was found to be considerably slower (∼ 50 nm/s, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Force-feedback experiments performed at high forces (&gt;22 pN) yield a normalized extension at full VirE2 coverage of 0.66 ± 0.05 (<italic>n</italic> = 11), much longer than the one observed at low force (about 0.1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). This 6-fold difference in normalized extension (observed at full coverage) indicates that VirE2 filaments adopt a different global structural arrangement depending on the preset force. This point will be discussed in details below (section: Global Structural Arrangement of ssDNA upon VirE2 Binding).</p>

From structural data, a value of 0.7 nm is found for <italic>L<sub>SS</sub></italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b016">16</xref>]. In a freely jointed chain (FJC) model, <italic>&lt;</italic>cos<italic>θ&gt;</italic> follows the Langevin formula [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b017">17</xref>], yielding an analytical expression for <italic>k</italic>(<italic>f</italic>). The local model gives a good description of the experimental data when the base-to-base distance of the VirE2-bound ssDNA <italic>L<sub>V</sub></italic> equals 0.41 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg003">Figure S3</xref>). This value (0.41 nm) is estimated from electron microscopy (EM) studies (assuming the ssDNA to lie concentrically within the protein helix [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b018">18</xref>], <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) and is in good agreement with a statistical analysis of the compaction steps (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg004">Figure S4</xref>, probability density function (PDF) analysis of the time trace at 50.5 pN). The good description of the experimental data by the local model suggests that VirE2 monomers bind one nucleotide at a time in a zipper-like motion and that the probability of binding a nucleotide is site-independent, a prerequisite for the local model. Such a model predicts that VirE2 could bind stably to less than 19 nucleotides. Experimental proof was provided by a gel-shift assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), which demonstrated that VirE2 can bind a 12-bases-long oligonucleotide. Finally, the good description of the force-feedback measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>B) by the local model suggests that the base-to-base distance of ssDNA bound to VirE2 is force independent<bold>. </bold></p>

Only three individual VirE2 monomers are shown. The approximate location of the ssDNA helix is shown in red (dots). The overall VirE2-ssDNA structure is stiffened up by strong axial interactions between the VirE2 proteins (pink circles). The binding of VirE2 monomers to ssDNA is such that the distance between adjacent ssDNA-phosphates of the backbone is 0.41 nm projected along the long axis of the protein (thick red line).</p>
            <p>(B) The formation of nucleoprotein complex between VirE2 and 5 pmoles of a 12-mer oligonucleotide was analyzed by radioactive gel shift assay. Lane 1: 12-mer without VirE2. Lanes 2 and 3: 12-mer with, respectively, 5 μg and 10 μg of VirE2. Upon interaction of VirE2 with the 12-mer, a higher-mass complex can be detected in the upper part of the gel (lanes 2 and 3). This indicates the binding of VirE2 to the 12-mer. The addition of double the amount of VirE2 leads to the formation of double the amount of complex (lane 3), showing that the formation of the higher mass complex is VirE2 dependent.</p>

        <title>Coverage of ssDNA in the Presence of VirE2</title>
        <p>Standard force-versus-extension curves (pulling and relaxing the tethered DNA molecule without any feedback; “pull and relax”) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>B, inset) at lower protein concentration (6 μg/ml, 100 nM) were recorded (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). These curves show the progressive compaction of bare ssDNA (red) as coverage with VirE2 proteins occurs, up to a state where the filament adopts a stable conformation (black). This final conformation (for which subsequent pulls did not noticeably change the shape of the force-versus-extension curves) yields an average compaction factor of 9.7 ± 2.0 (<italic>n</italic> = 15). Previous EM studies have reported a compaction factor of 11.9 for a perfect VirE2-ssDNA helical structure (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sd001">Text S1</xref>, section: Length reduction upon protein binding). This suggests that the final state we observe (also confirmed by distance-clamp experiments, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg006">Figure S6</xref>) corresponds to a conformation where the VirE2 proteins rearrange into a helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, the final state (black curve) is extremely stiff (as compared to ssDNA). Curves recorded at intermediate stages of polymerization (green, blue) can be fitted with a FJC model considering the ssDNA compaction factor upon VirE2 binding of 11.9, the persistence length of bare ssDNA and a normalized contour length <italic>l</italic> = λ<italic>l<sub>ssDNA</sub> +</italic> (<italic>1 -</italic> λ)/11.9 (0 &lt; λ &lt; 1), where <italic>l<sub>ssDNA</sub></italic> is the normalized contour length of ssDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, gray lines).

        <p>Through the sequential binding and subsequent release of VirE2 proteins from bare ssDNA molecule (red curve), the final helical conformation is obtained (black curve). In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, the intermediate state of polymerization (blue curve, normalized extension of about 0.2) shows the detachment of a large amount of VirE2 proteins at ∼50 pN (yielding a decrease in the VirE2 coverage, i.e., an increase in the fraction of bare ssDNA in the filament from λ = 0.27 to λ = 0.46). When the force applied to ssDNA was relaxed, VirE2 molecules bound to ssDNA again, achieving a more stable coverage, since almost no VirE2 was driven off upon restretching of the DNA–protein complex up to 70 pN (green curve). These findings correlate nicely with the binding mode of VirE2. VirE2 is a non–sequence specific ssDNA binding protein, and the interaction of VirE2 with ssDNA (at a low protein concentration of 6 μg/ml) leads to multiple nucleation sites. This yields a number of different VirE2-ssDNA helical domains, which might not be in register (i.e., yielding a nonperfect helical structure over the whole length of the ssDNA, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). When the VirE2-ssDNA filament is pulled, short VirE2 domains seem to progressively detach from the ssDNA molecule. When the tension is relaxed, VirE2 proteins bind again. Subsequent pulls yield an increase in the average length of VirE2 helical domains, which then resist higher forces (green curve). The final state therefore corresponds to an extremely stable conformation in which no VirE2 release from the filament is observed when proteins were removed from the fluid chamber.</p>

        <p>The fully polymerized nucleoprotein complex was unusually stiff (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, black curve). From the critical force for buckling |<italic>F</italic><sub>B</sub>| ∼ 3.5 pN (obtained while compressing the filament; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g003">Figure 3</xref>A, arrow), we estimate a persistence length (|<italic>F</italic><sub>B</sub>|<italic>l</italic><sup>2</sup>/4π<sup>2</sup><italic>k</italic><sub>B</sub><italic>T</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b019">19</xref>] of ∼14 μm, about 4 orders of magnitude larger than that of bare ssDNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b020">20</xref>]. Because binding of ssDNA to VirE2 in a zipper-like way requires some initial protein flexibility, the high stiffness measured in the final (fully covered) VirE2-ssDNA filaments suggests that VirE2, the DNA, or both are stiffened by their interaction. A similar increase in stiffness upon DNA binding has been observed for other ssDNA binding proteins such as RecA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b021">21</xref>]. As mentioned in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sd001">Text S1</xref> (section: Mechanical properties of ssDNA-VirE2 filaments: Helix model), a mechanical model consisting of a pure helical structure gives a value of 110–2,200 nm for the persistence length, much lower than reported here. This difference could be attributed to the presence of axial interactions along the protein helix (reported by EM studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b018">18</xref>]) that could considerably stiffen the structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A, circles).</p>

        <title>Global Structural Arrangement of ssDNA upon VirE2 Binding</title>
        <p>For force-clamp experiments performed at low forces (≤22 pN, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>), the value for the normalized extension at full coverage was estimated to be at 0.11 ± 0.02 (value obtained from a total of 21 experiments performed between 2 and 22 pN). This value for the normalized extension is in good agreement with that of EM studies for a perfect helical arrangement (0.084 or 1/11.9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b018">18</xref>]), suggesting that the helical VirE2-ssDNA structure can even form against loads up to ∼20 pN.</p>
        <p>This helical conformation was not achieved when performing force-feedback experiments at &gt;22 pN. For these forces and at full coverage, the normalized extension was found to be 0.66 ± 0.05 (estimated from a total of eight experiments performed at 30, 36, 45, and 50.5 pN). This normalized extension corresponds to an average base-to-base distance of ssDNA (projected along the direction of the applied force) of 0.46 ± 0.04 nm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg005">Figure S5</xref>, showing typical force versus extension curves of both ss- and double-stranded (ds) DNA), in close agreement with that found from EM studies (0.41 nm, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b018">18</xref>]. From this result, we deduce that the rearrangement of the VirE2-ssDNA filament into a helix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) cannot proceed against large forces and that the normalized extension reduction observed at forces &gt;22 pN corresponds to the sole binding of VirE2 on ssDNA.</p>
        <p>The small discrepancy between the expected value and the experimental observation, although significant, can be attributed to the large footprint of VirE2 (19 nucleotides) as well as the possible loss of cooperativity at high forces.</p>
        <p>The local model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g001">Figure 1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg003">Figure S3</xref>) was shown to give a good description of the force dependence of the rate of polymerization. However, this model only considers the zipper binding mode of VirE2 to ssDNA and does not take into account the rearrangement into a helical structure. This suggests that the helical rearrangement is much faster than the local binding of VirE2 to ssDNA. Hence, the binding of VirE2 to ssDNA is the rate-limiting step of the overall polymerization process and dominates the kinetics.</p>
        <p>Note finally that we did not observe any compaction of the ssDNA molecule for force-clamp experiments performed at low protein concentrations (&lt;1 μg/ml). This correlates with gel-shift retardation experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sg007">Figure S7</xref>), which demonstrate that binding of VirE2 to 170-bases-long ssDNA occurs over a small range of protein concentration without intermediate bands.</p>

        <title>Localization of VirE2 in the Plant Cell</title>
        <p>In vivo, the VirE2 protein exerts its role in the plant. It is sufficient to express the VirE2 protein in the plant to restore full virulence: transgenic plants expressing VirE2 allow efficient T-DNA transfection by nearly avirulent <italic>virE2</italic>-null-<italic>Agrobacterium</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b022">22</xref>]. If the VirE2 proteins accumulate at the periphery of the plant, then the interaction of VirE2 and ssDNA would not only protect the T-DNA from exonuclease degradation but also greatly facilitate the import of the T-DNA thanks to the capability of VirE2 to work against large forces when binding to ssDNA (see above).</p>
        <p>Because localization of VirE2 protein originating from the bacterium has proven to be extremely challenging and has so far not yielded a usable result, we chose to use the fact that, when VirE2 is expressed in the plant, it is active. Hence, we transiently expressed VirE2HA in tobacco BY-2 cells. VirE2HA is a biologically active fusion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g004">Figure 4</xref>A) and was used to perform immunofluorescence experiments. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g004">Figure 4</xref>B demonstrates the localization of VirE2 around the nucleus, at the cell periphery, in cytosolic strands, and in a few cytoplasmic spots. This non-nuclear cytoplasmic localization is supported by VirE2-GFP localization (also an active fusion protein when expressed in plant cells<bold>,</bold> S. Gelvin, personal communication). On the contrary, β-glucuronidase (GUS)-VirE2 fusion protein was reported to localize in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b022">22</xref>]. This controversial results might be explained by the fact that the GUS-VirE2 fusion protein mimics the conformation of VirE2 when bound to ssDNA and hence get imported into the nucleus (V. Citovsky, personal communication). Also, it is widely accepted by the community that the VirE2-ssDNA complex already forms in the host cytoplasm, allowing subsequent nuclear import of the nucleo-protein complex into the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b002">2</xref>]. Hence, there must be some free VirE2 proteins in the host cytosol, which is consistent with our localization data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g004">Figure 4</xref>B).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> pathogenesis mechanism allows for the efficient transfer of long ssDNA molecules into eukaryotic cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b002">2</xref>]. The VirE2 protein is involved in this process by protecting the ssDNA from nuclease degradation and by mediating nuclear import [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b002">2</xref>]. Here, based on new experimental findings, we propose that VirE2 is an effector that is transported into the host cytoplasm at an early stage to actively pull the T-DNA into the host and protect it from nuclease degradation from the very first moment it enters the cell. In a first step, a single VirE2 protein binds to T-DNA as it enters the plant cell. This binding, occurring in a zipper-like motion, is mainly limited by thermal fluctuations of T-DNA. In a second step, the fast cooperative binding of VirE2 facilitates the formation of a helical structure and actively pulls T-DNA into the plant cytosol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This model has indirect assumptions. First, VirE2 and T-DNA should not interact in the bacterium, even though they are both synthetized there. Indeed, in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>'s cytoplasm, VirD2-T-DNA and VirE2 do not interact, and VirE2 only binds to the T-DNA once it is in the plant cytosol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b023">23</xref>]. Second, the VirE2 protein should be present at the site of entry of the T-DNA, namely at the periphery of plant cells. This was evidenced by immunofluorescence experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060044-g004">Figure 4</xref>B), suggesting that VirE2 is properly localized to assist T-DNA pulling as it enters the plant cytosol. Finally, the interaction between VirE2-bound ssDNA and the rigid microtubule network could provide an anchor point that would facilitate the VirE2 mediated-force transduction at an early stage of the translocation process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b014">14</xref>].</p>

Additionally, the large speed of polymerization (∼1 μm/s) mediates a fast protection of the T-DNA at the very moment it enters the host cytosol.

      <p>According to our model, which identifies VirE2 as an essential factor that pulls T-DNA into the plant cytoplasm, the free energy released upon the formation of the nucleoprotein complex allows VireE2 proteins to work against large forces, which might be required to translocate T-DNA into the host (see below). The production of mechanical energy occurs solely through the free energy gain during the binding of VirE2 to ssDNA without the need for an external source of energy, e.g., nucleotide hydrolysis. To our knowledge, this is the first time that a glimpse at forces involved in ssDNA translocation into the recipient cell is obtained. Their magnitude compares to forces produced by dsDNA translocating molecular motors (see, e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b024">24</xref>]). Other competing mechanisms might tend to pull the DNA back out of the host cytosol. For instance, during conjugation, pili can retract after binding to the host cell [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b025">25</xref>]. Moreover, during DNA transfer into the host, the Type IV pilus of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Neisseria gonorrhoeae</named-content> can undergo a series of extension and retraction cycles, generating retraction forces up to a few tens of pN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b025">25</xref>]. Thus, binding of a protein to the transferred ssDNA to form a complex that prevents recoiling of the ssDNA in the T4SS by such forces would be a great advantage.</p>
      <p>Tato et al. have proposed that the coupling protein TrwB of the <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Escherichia coli</named-content> R388 conjugative system acts as an ATP-driven ssDNA transporting molecular motor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b026">26</xref>]. This analogue to VirD4 is located at the bacterial inner membrane and is thought to pump ssDNA through the Type IV secretion channel. Considering the short persistence length of ssDNA (∼0.7 nm) and the large distance between the coupling protein and the host membrane (at least 30 nm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b027">27</xref>]), just pushing the flexible ssDNA through the T4SS would be inefficient. Transfer would be facilitated if it were also actively pulled through by VirE2 present in the host.</p>
      <p>Single-molecule experiments have shown that the “final” VirE2-ssDNA helical filament obtained is a very stable and stiff structure. Washing the complex with buffer without VirE2 protein does not destabilize the complex. But in vivo, the uncoating of the filament is necessary for the integration of the T-DNA into the nuclear genome of the recipient cell. Hence, the question is how the rigid VirE2-ssDNA complex is freed from VirE2. Indeed the very tight interaction between VirE2 and the ssDNA and between VirE2 molecules seem to need a specific mechanism of degradation to remove the VirE2 protein. It was shown recently that VirE2 is specifically targeted for degradation by the VirF-containing Skp1-Cdc53-cullin-F-box complex for proteolysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b028">28</xref>]. The critical role of proteasomal degradation in <italic>Agrobacterium</italic>-mediated genetic transformation was also evident from the inhibition of T-DNA expression by a proteasomal inhibitor. In summary, our findings and these data correlate nicely and explain why such a specific degradation mechanism would be needed.</p>
      <p>The unique mechanism that <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> exploits to translocate any ssDNA molecule has paved the way for genetic engineering of plants and fungi but also offers novel possibilities for gene transfer into mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b002">2</xref>]. However, the <italic>Agrobacterium</italic> pulling mechanism proposed here might be more general. It does not rely on VirE2 but needs the following: (i) an ssDNA binding protein compacting ssDNA upon interaction and (ii) occurrence of this single-strand binding (SSB) activity only in one compartment. In bacterial conjugation and DNA-uptake processes, SSB proteins are also present and might have an important funtion. For instance, the SBB homologs (YwpH) accumulate preferentially at the cell poles of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. subtilis</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b029">29</xref>]. Hence these proteins could be, as is VirE2, capable of generating a force without external source of energy and pull the ssDNA into the recipient compartment.</p>

        <p>The experimental apparatus for optical tweezers experiments has been described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b031">31</xref>]. DNA beads were trapped by the laser and the free biotinylated DNA end was attached to a 2.20-μm streptavidin bead (Spherotech), which was held by suction on a micropipette. The bead-to-bead distance was determined from both the movement of the micropipette (controlled with a closed-loop piezoelectric element) and the deflection of the laser producing the optical trap (monitored by a two-dimensional, position-sensitive detector). The pipette bead was moved away from the trapped bead at a constant velocity of 0.8 nm/ms. At this rate, complete force-extension curves were recorded within a few seconds. Forces were obtained from the direct measurement of the change in light momentum flux [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060044-b031">31</xref>]. All signals (distance, force) were low-pass filtered at 159 Hz. Force curves were measured in assembly buffer (50 mM NaH<sub>2</sub>PO<sub>4</sub>, pH 8.0, 150 mM NaCl, and 5% w/v glycerol). To obtain ssDNA molecules, dsDNA was exposed to 150 mM NaOH. Subsequently, the chamber was rinsed with assembly buffer and VirE2 proteins were injected. Prior to injection, proteins were centrifuged at 14,000<italic>g</italic> for 20 min. The supernatant was kept at 4 °C and injected at a protein concentration ranging from 6 to 20 μg/ml in assembly buffer. Forces were monitored in a constant VirE2 flow.

        <title>Force-clamp operation mode.</title>
        <p>The force-clamp mode uses a digital “P”(proportional gain)-like feedback that runs at 150 Hz (taking into account the time for the acquisition, some CPU time for the calculations, and communication with the different instruments). In details, the feedback works as follows: if the change in force |Δ<italic>f</italic>| is smaller than 0.7 pN, we do not feedback at all; for larger changes in force, the pipette if moved by ±5 nm (|Δ<italic>f</italic>|≤ 2 pN) or Δ<italic>f</italic> × 7 nm (|Δ<italic>f</italic>| &gt; 2 pN). During a force-clamp operation, the data are only recorded and plotted when |Δ<italic>f</italic>|≤ 0.7 pN. In that case, an additional ∼6 ms is required to process the different routines of the software.</p>

          <p>Time versus extension traces recorded in a force-clamp operation mode at 12, 36, and 50.5 pN. Shown are zooms in the region where the transition (e.g., coverage of ssDNA by VirE2) occurs. At low forces (&lt; ∼20 pN), the curves show first a fast decay that originates from multiple polymerization fronts running in parallel (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sd001">Text S1</xref>, section: Rate of polymerization (experimental determination)]. This transition occurs so fast (up to 10 μm/s) that the feedback loop cannot follow in real time the polymerization. At high coverage, the probability of having multiple fronts is considerably reduced (due to the lack of free available VirE2 binding sites). As such, the time traces show clearly distinct linear regimes from which the polymerization rate originating from a single polymerization front can be determined (red line). At higher forces (36 and 50.5 pN) and even at low coverage, the probability of having polymerization fronts growing in parallel is greatly reduced due to the typical conformation of bare ssDNA found at high force (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060044-sd001">Text S1</xref>, section: Rate of polymerization (theory)].
