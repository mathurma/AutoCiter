        <p>The ion transporter NKCC1 determines brain tumor cell migration by regulating the interplay between cell adhesion and growth factor signaling, and is a potential therapeutic target to treat brain cancer.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Glioblastoma (GB) is a highly invasive and lethal brain tumor due to its universal recurrence. Although it has been suggested that the electroneutral Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporter 1 (NKCC1) can play a role in glioma cell migration, the precise mechanism by which this ion transporter contributes to GB aggressiveness remains poorly understood. Here, we focused on the role of NKCC1 in the invasion of human primary glioma cells in vitro and in vivo. NKCC1 expression levels were significantly higher in GB and anaplastic astrocytoma tissues than in grade II glioma and normal cortex. Pharmacological inhibition and shRNA-mediated knockdown of NKCC1 expression led to decreased cell migration and invasion in vitro and in vivo. Surprisingly, knockdown of NKCC1 in glioma cells resulted in the formation of significantly larger focal adhesions and cell traction forces that were approximately 40% lower than control cells. Epidermal growth factor (EGF), which promotes migration of glioma cells, increased the phosphorylation of NKCC1 through a PI3K-dependant mechanism. This finding is potentially related to WNK kinases. Taken together, our findings suggest that NKCC1 modulates migration of glioma cells by two distinct mechanisms: (1) through the regulation of focal adhesion dynamics and cell contractility and (2) through regulation of cell volume through ion transport. Due to the ubiquitous expression of NKCC1 in mammalian tissues, its regulation by WNK kinases may serve as new therapeutic targets for GB aggressiveness and can be exploited by other highly invasive neoplasms.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Treatment of many cancers has been hampered by the invasive ability of tumor cells. A notable example is brain cancer, which is incurable due to its invasiveness and resulting high tumor recurrence after surgical resection. Here, we analyze further the function of NKCC1, an ion transporter that is known to regulate cell volume and intracellular chloride concentration, and to play an important role in brain tumor cell invasion. Our findings suggest that in addition to its conventional function as an ion transporter, NKCC1 may also interact with the cytoskeleton and affect brain tumor cell migration by acting as an anchor that transduces contractile forces from the plasma membrane to the extracellular matrix en route to cell migration. Moreover, we show that regulation of NKCC1 by a family of unconventional enzymes, the WNK kinases, is an important factor that affects the activity of NKCC1 and may determine the invasive ability of brain tumor cells. We postulate that NKCC1 has multiple functions in brain tumor cell migration and that together with its regulatory enzymes may be therapeutic targets in the treatment of brain tumors or other types of cancer, given the wide expression of these proteins throughout the body.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Glioblastoma (GB) is the most common malignant primary brain tumor. GBs are aggressive and display key features of invasion and infiltration of healthy brain tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-QuinonesHinojosa1">[1]</xref>. Due to its invasive nature, GB is not curable through surgical resection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Filippini1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-McGirt1">[3]</xref>. The surgical and medical treatment for patients with this disease has evolved in the last 20 years, however the prognosis remains dismal due to tumor recurrence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Stupp1">[4]</xref>. Thus, understanding the mechanisms that GB cells utilize during migration and invasion into normal brain tissue is paramount in the development of novel, effective therapies.</p>
      <p>Volume regulation, cytoskeletal rearrangements, and adhesion dynamics are major determinants of cell migration and are essential processes in invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Lang1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Lauffenburger1">[6]</xref>. Migration of mammalian cells is accompanied by volume changes. For instance, neutrophils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Rosengren1">[7]</xref> and dendritic cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Rotte1">[8]</xref> undergo cell volume increases when exposed to signals leading to migratory responses. Indeed, it has been hypothesized that inhibition of cell volume regulation impairs cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Klein1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Sontheimer1">[10]</xref>. NKCC1, a transporter that belongs to the SLC12A family of cation-chloride cotransporters, is a fundamental transporter utilized in the regulation of intracellular volume and in the accumulation of intracellular Cl<sup>−</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Gamba1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Lytle1">[12]</xref>. NKCC1 mediates the movement of Na<sup>+</sup>, K<sup>+</sup>, and Cl<sup>−</sup> ions across the plasma membrane using the energy stored in the Na<sup>+</sup> gradient, generated by the Na<sup>+</sup>/K<sup>+</sup> ATPase. Recent work supports the notion that intracellular volume regulation by NKCC1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Watkins1">[14]</xref>, as well as aquaporin 4 (AQP4) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-McCoy1">[15]</xref>, may indeed promote glioma cell invasion. However, whether cell volume regulation is the only or primary mechanism mediating NKCC1 effects is unclear. It is equally unclear if NKCC1 is differentially regulated in invasive cells.</p>
      <p>In addition to cell volume regulation, ion transporters can participate in anchoring the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane by binding to ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker2">[17]</xref>. ERM proteins associate directly with actin and integral membrane proteins, which connect the cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Chishti1">[18]</xref>. Anion exchangers (AE) 1, 2, and 3, Na<sup>+</sup>/H<sup>+</sup> exchanger 1 (NHE1), and a Na<sup>+</sup>/Ca<sup>++</sup> exchanger are all able to act as cytoskeletal anchors by interacting with ERM proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker3">[19]</xref>. It has been shown that ERM proteins bind to clusters of positive amino acids in the juxtamembranous domain of NHE1, CD44, CD43, and ICAM-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Yonemura1">[20]</xref> and that these interactions regulate cell migration and contractility, as well as focal adhesion turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Beningo1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Broussard1">[22]</xref>. The interaction between ion transporters, as integral membrane proteins, and the cytoskeleton mediates the transduction of contractile forces generated from within the cell to the extracellular matrix and promotes migration. However, the mechanistic action of NKCC1 on cell contractility and focal adhesion dynamics in the context of GB cell migration and invasion are entirely unknown.</p>
      <p>Activation of NKCC1 transport activity requires phosphorylation of key threonine residues in the NKCC1 N-terminal domain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Flemmer1">[23]</xref>. Phosphorylation of NKCC1 is mediated by at least three members of a novel family of unusual kinases that lack a key lysine in their catalytic domain, the WNK kinases (<underline>W</underline>ith <underline>N</underline>o <underline>K</underline>-lysine) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Moriguchi1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Vitari1">[25]</xref>. These kinases have been implicated in the pathogenesis of hypertension and epilepsy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle2">[27]</xref>. Of these, WNK3 is the most abundantly expressed in the brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Holden1">[28]</xref>. Interestingly, WNK1 is a substrate for Akt-mediated phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Jiang1">[29]</xref>. Hence, it is possible that Akt may regulate NKCC1 activity through the regulation of the WNK kinases. Intracellular signaling pathways, such as phosphoinositide 3-kinase (PI3K)-Akt, are frequently altered in GBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Parsons1">[30]</xref>. Akt is able to regulate various cellular functions through phosphorylation of a conserved substrate sequence, and altered regulation of this pathway can lead to aberrant cell behavior, such as increased proliferation and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Luo1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Feng1">[33]</xref>. Importantly, intracellular signaling pathways of promigratory factors such as epidermal growth factor (EGF) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-GonzalezPerez1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kim1">[36]</xref>, and integrin signaling pathways converge on Akt, modulating cell processes such as cell cycle, apoptosis, and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Hay1">[37]</xref>. PI3K, the activator of Akt, is thought to be critical in mediating both chemotactic and random cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kolsch1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, the regulation of NKCC1 by the interaction between Akt signaling and WNK kinases may be important in determining the invasive properties of GB cells.</p>
      <p>To further our understanding of the role of NKCC1 in GB cell migration and invasion, we investigated (1) whether the expression of NKCC1 in human tumors correlates with tumor grade, (2) whether NKCC1 affects cell contractility and migration, (3) whether NKCC1 can have an effect on the interaction between the cells and the cells' adhesion substratum, and (4) whether a signaling mechanism involved in the regulation of NKCC1 by promigratory factors exists in GB cells. We found that NKCC1 expression indeed correlates with in vivo glioma aggressiveness and that the transporter activity modulates migration speed and invasiveness of cells derived from various human GBs. Furthermore, we show that NKCC1 expression affects GB cell traction forces, possibly by regulating focal adhesion dynamics. Moreover, the regulation of NKCC and KCC transport by WNK3 may determine the invasive behavior of GB cells. Additionally, we show evidence of NKCC1 phosphorylation regulation by Akt through WNK3 phosphorylation upon stimulation with a promigratory factor, EGF. This suggests an important link between the activation of WNK3 by Akt as well as changes in the activity of ion transport systems in glioma cells. Taken together, these findings strongly suggest that ion transport regulation might be integrated into the control of glioma cell invasiveness in a complex fashion that extends beyond regulation of cell volume and involves the interplay between cell adhesion and growth factor signaling. The understanding of these complex interactions may assist in the design of novel therapeutic strategies.</p>

        <p>Prior data implicating NKCC1 in GB invasiveness were based on established, model GB cell lines, rather than primary cells or tissues. We therefore first evaluated and characterized whether primary cells isolated from human GB indeed supported the role of NKCC1 in invasiveness as suggested previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas1">[13]</xref>. We assayed invasiveness using the transwell invasion assay in the presence or absence of the NKCC1 inhibitor bumetanide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas2">[39]</xref>. Inhibition of NKCC1 transport in various primary human glioma cells exposed to 25 and 50 µM of bumetanide led to a dose-dependent decrease in the number of invasive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Significant inhibition of invasion was seen in GB cells tested at a concentration of 50 µM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), a concentration at which bumetanide does not exhibit considerable non-specific effects on other cation-chloride transporters <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Mercado1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Song1">[41]</xref>. To further examine whether the effect of bumetanide on cell invasion is due to inhibition of NKCC1, we performed stable knockdown of NKCC1 using lentiviral particles carrying NKCC1 shRNA. Knockdown of NKCC1 in GB cells (NS561, NS567, NS501, and NS318) was successfully established in 4 GB cell lines and the efficiency of knockdown was assessed by immunoblot of whole cell lysates of these GB cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). We confirmed that, as previously shown by Haas and colleagues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas1">[13]</xref>, knockdown of NKCC1 significantly reduced the invasiveness of all these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g001">Figures 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s001">S1D</xref>).

Therefore, in addition to invasiveness of primary GB cells in vitro, we explored the role of NKCC1 in the invasion of primary brain tumor stem cells (BTSC) in vivo. Tumor area and area of invasion in the corpus callosum were then quantified to evaluate differences in tumor size and invasive ability of BTSCs carrying the control shRNA as well as BTSCs carrying NKCC1 shRNA. We found that tumors generated after the implantation of BTSCs with control shRNA were significantly smaller than tumors generated with the NKCC1 shRNA harboring BTSC line (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Consistent with previous results by Haas and colleagues using commercial GB cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas1">[13]</xref>, the invaded area in the corpus callosum of mice that were implanted with BTSCs carrying the control shRNA was significantly larger than that of mice implanted with BTSCs carrying NKCC1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).

        <p>To evaluate the potential clinical importance of NKCC1 in glioma invasion in vivo, we characterized NKCC1 expression in a large array of glioma tissue samples using a tissue microarray (TMA) containing several tumors of different grades ranging from World Health Organization (WHO) Grade II to WHO Grade IV (Table S1). The results revealed that NKCC1 protein expression was significantly higher in GB and anaplastic astrocytoma (AA) tissue samples compared with expression in Grade II astrocytomas and normal brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>). Epithelial tissues included in the TMA were used as positive controls (intestinal mucosa and tissue from the distal collecting duct in the kidney) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As a corollary to this analysis and a complement to the results in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g001">Figure 1</xref>, we characterized the expression levels of NKCC1 protein in multiple primary human GB cells and found that all cell lines tested showed substantial expression of NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The data obtained from this set of samples showed that NKCC1 protein expression indeed correlates with glioma grade, in that tissues from GB and AA expressed higher NKCC1 protein levels than low-grade astrocytomas and normal brain. This correlation between NKCC1 expression with glioma grade suggests that NKCC1 may contribute to the increased invasiveness of high-grade tumors.</p>

        <p>Our results so far strongly suggest that NKCC1 may indeed be an important determinant of GB cell invasion. While all prior analyses attempted to link the role of NKCC1 in cell migration to its role as a cell volume regulator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Gamba1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Watkins1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas3">[45]</xref>, we examined whether NKCC1 plays an essential role in the regulation of polarization of cell morphology and migration of GB cells. We were particularly interested in whether NKCC1 might affect cell migration and how this migratory behavior may depend on the mechanical cues mimicking the extracellular matrix components. In this study we employed nanoscale grooves to analyze the migratory behavior of glioma cells. Our substrate mimics ECM features, such as myelinated fiber tracts, upon which brain cancer cells have been shown to migrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kim2">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Bellail1">[47]</xref>.

We found a significant reduction in the cell migration speed of human primary GB cells stably transduced with NKCC1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g003">Figure 3A–B</xref>). Similarly, a significant decrease in migration speed was observed when GB cells were treated with bumetanide (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). Migration directionality was quantified by measuring the ratio of cell movements parallel to the ridges on the pattern versus those that were perpendicular to the pattern. This metric tended to correlate with the speed of migration, showing significant decreases in directionality for cells expressing NKCC1 shRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g003">Figure 3C–D</xref>). Overall, GB cells stably transduced with NKCC1 shRNA displayed a lower speed of migration and showed more random migration as demonstrated by the decrease in directionality.</p>

Focal adhesions were stained with an antibody against vinculin and paxillin, cytoskeletal proteins that are part of focal adhesions that also regulate mechanical coupling of the cytoskeleton to the extracellular matrix (ECM). We observed small, thin, and elongated focal adhesions primarily in the extending processes in control virus shRNA cells, whereas in NKCC1 shRNA cells, focal adhesions were much larger (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g004">Figure 4B–C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s004">Figure S4</xref>), indicative of focal adhesion maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Broussard1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Webb1">[48]</xref>.

We found that the net contractile movements of cells expressing the Ezrin-binding null NKCC1 were significantly lower than cells expressing wild type-NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). Furthermore, cells expressing the Ezrin-binding null-NKCC1 had a lower projected cell area than cells expressing wild-type NKCC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g006">Figure 6D</xref>).</p>
        <p>Thus, the absence of NKCC1 expression may lead to the formation of more mature focal adhesions. In turn, these mature focal adhersions may further enhance the adhesion of cells to the substratum, which decreaces the migration speed of NKCC1 shRNA cells, as observed above. Mature focal adhesions do not participate in the generation of contractile forces in migrating cells; rather, they participate in anchoring cells to the substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Beningo1">[21]</xref>. On the other hand, nascent adhesions apply forces to the substratum to drive cell movement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Beningo1">[21]</xref>. Hence, our results suggest that NKCC1 affects cell-ECM interactions by stimulating higher traction force generation and lower substratum adhesion, thus enhancing cell motility in a synergistic fashion.</p>

        <title>NKCC1 Is Expressed at the Distal Edge of Extending Processes of Primary Human GB Cells</title>
        <p>The pronounced effect of NKCC1 expression on focal adhesion formation and cell migration suggests the importance of its partial intracellular localization. We initially approached this issue by performing immunocytochemistry experiments on multiple GB cells. We found that all GB cells had a polarized subcellular expression of NKCC1. In cells that appeared to have a more stationary phenotype with multiple projections, the expression of NKCC1 was primarily correlated with these projections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Specifically, NKCC1 was localized either to the apparent leading edge of a moving cell or to its rear, frequently in a mutually exclusive pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g007">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Expression of NKCC1-EGFP fusion protein in GB cells supported that NKCC1-EGFP expression was mainly localized to the plasma membrane of the extending processes confirming the results obtained by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s007">Figure S7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s011">Video S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s012">Video S2</xref>). In cells spreading on nano-structured substrata, NKCC1-EGFP localization oscillated between the two transiently existing edges, before a prominent single edge was formed. Furthermore, when using immunocytochemistry, we examined the sub-cellular localization of WNK3, a serine/threonine kinase that regulates the transport activity of NKCC1 through phosphorylation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle3">[50]</xref>. We observed partial co-localization of WNK3 immunoreactivity with NKCC1 immunoreactivity in the edges of extending processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g007">Figure 7A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001320.s006">Figure S6</xref>). These findings suggest that the cellular localization of NKCC1 is spatially heterogeneous during GB cell migration. Although the localization patterns were diverse in different cell states, the overall pattern that emerged from this analysis was that NKCC1 is associated with extending processes of the cell. This finding correlates with the suggestion that NKCC1 is important in the formation of new focal adhesions and controlling existing focal adhesions and active cytoskeletal components.</p>

        <title>NKCC1 Is Activated by EGF Through Akt-Mediated WNK3 Phosphorylation</title>
        <p>The aforementioned data suggest that NKCC1 transport activity is important for glioma cell migration and invasion, at least in part through direct regulation of the cytoskeletal and ECM-cell adhesion dependent processes.

To gain insight into the regulation of phosphorylation of NKCC1 in an unbiased cellular system, we stimulated HEK-293 cells with EGF in the presence or absence of wortmannin (WM), a PI3K inhibitor. After exposure of HEK-293 cells to EGF, NKCC1 phosphorylation increased significantly. However, in the presence of WM, EGF-induced NKCC1 phosphorylation was blocked (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). These findings together demonstrate that the EGF-induced increase in phosphorylation of NKCC1 requires activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway.</p>

We immunoprecipitated total WNK3 from HEK-293 cells exposed to serum-free media, and we stimulated with EGF, or EGF in the presence of the PI3K inhibitor WM. Samples were immunoblotted with an antibody that recognizes phosphorylated Akt substrates (αPAS antibody) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). Data obtained from this experiment showed a basal phosphorylation level of WNK3, which increases with exposure to EGF. This increase in phosphorylation is repressed by inhibition of PI3K with WM, suggesting that Akt phosphorylates WNK3. The same samples were immunoblotted against phosphorylated Akt, and as expected, we found that WM also inhibited the phosphorylation of Akt (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). In silico analysis of the protein sequence of WNK3 revealed that two putative Akt phosphorylation motifs are present and are conserved in available WNK3 protein sequences of the human and rat, as previously found in WNK1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001320-g008">Figure 8E</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Vitari2">[54]</xref>.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The nearly universal recurrence of GB after surgical resection is largely due to invasion of glioma cells into healthy brain tissue and presents a major impediment in the improvement of GB patient survival. In this study, we tested the hypothesis that NKCC1 expression and transport activity are crucial elements of cell migration and invasion in primary human GB cell lines. Here we provide evidence for the participation of NKCC1 in the migration and invasion of primary human glioma cells, highlighting its possible role in anchoring the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane. Additionally, through this anchoring, NKCC1 mediates transduction of the cellular contractile forces to focal adhesions that interact with the extracellular matrix. These in vitro findings were confirmed functionally in an in vivo model using primary human BTSCs, where their invasion was decreased significantly after NKCC1 knockdown. Given these findings, NKCC1 inhibition could potentially be used in the clinic to improve glioblastoma treatment, given that Bumetanide (a commonly used diuretic, FDA-approved) decreases the invasive potential of glioma cells in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas1">[13]</xref>. This could potentially improve surgical resection of the tumor mass, as tumor cells lacking NKCC1 activity would form less invasive tumors.</p>
      <p>Our work shows that NKCC1 protein expression in multiple glioma samples is higher in high-grade gliomas such as GB and anaplastic astrocytomas. Inhibition of NKCC1 transport pharmacologically, as well as genetic inhibition of NKCC1 expression, decreases invasion of multiple primary human GB cell lines. These results are in accordance with previous findings using commercial human glioma cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas1">[13]</xref>. Our data further indicate that migration speed of GB cell lines in a 2-D nanopatterned substrate is decreased by pharmacological inhibition and by shRNA-based silencing of NKCC1 expression. Interestingly, pharmacological and genetic inhibition of the K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> cotransporters leads to a more invasive behavior of GB cells in vitro. Moreover, our results suggest that NKCC1 may affect the morphology of focal adhesions, perhaps due to a putative ERM binding motif in the cytoplasmic domain of NKCC1. We also found that NKCC1 is located at the extending processes of GB cells and that NKCC1 polarization may precede migration towards the direction of this pole. Furthermore, exposure of GB cells to EGF, a factor that promotes migration and invasion of normal and tumor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-GonzalezPerez1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kim1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Boockvar1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Lal1">[56]</xref>, induces phosphorylation (activation) of NKCC1 through PI3K-Akt-WNK3 pathway.</p>
      <p>The concerted action of local anchoring of the actin microfilaments to the plasma membrane and volume regulation may be important for the polarization of cells during migration. Coupling the actin cytoskeleton to the plasma membrane is essential for the regulation of cell morphology and migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Lauffenburger1">[6]</xref>. Our immunocytochemistry and live cell imaging experiments using a GFP-NKCC1 fusion protein demonstrate that NKCC1 is localized to the extending processes of migrating GB cells. During the migratory process, cells acquire a polarized morphology where actin, integrin receptors, and ion transporters among other proteins, become asymmetrically distributed in the cell. Some examples of ion transporters that show a polarized localization to the leading edge of the cell include NHE1 and AE2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Klein1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker2">[17]</xref>, which also have K<sup>+</sup> channels that are polarized to the rear end of the cell <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Schwab1">[57]</xref>. Ezrin-radixin-moesin (ERM) proteins bind actin filaments and anchor them to integral plasma membrane proteins. Some of these integral membrane proteins include NHE1, CD44, and intercellular cell adhesion molecule 2, which have ERM binding motifs (ICAM-2) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Chishti1">[18]</xref>. The ERM binding motif consists of clusters of positive amino acids, such as lysine and arginine residues in juxtamembranous intracytoplasmic domains of these proteins. By analyzing the peptide sequence of NKCC1, we found clusters of lysine and arginine residues in the N-terminal cytoplasmic domain that are conserved across mammalian species, which may bind ERM proteins. Indeed, we found that NKCC1 is able to bind to Ezrin and actin with our co-immunoprecipitation assay. The generation of advancing membrane protrusions is necessary for migrating cells to achieve cell translocation. ERM protein binding to NHE1 is necessary during migration to promote extension of advancing processes to anchor the cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker2">[17]</xref>. Our results show that NKCC1 is polarized to the extending processes of migrating glioma cells; therefore, it is likely that NKCC1 is necessary during migration to anchor the cytoskeleton, aiding in the extension of lamellipodia, and mediate local volume changes at the same time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Watkins1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>NKCC1 expression may be an important determinant of the response of migrating cells to external physical cues. The extracellular matrix surrounding cells presents topographical features ranging from nanometers (nm) to microns (µm) and affects cell behavior. For example, collagen fibrils form with diameters from 20–200 nm and influence cell polarity and migration through “contact guidance” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Birk1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Wang1">[65]</xref>. Recent studies have employed more intricate substrates presenting nanoscale features (e.g., grooves, ridges, bumps, and pillars) to more closely model the cellular microenvironment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Bettinger1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Lim1">[68]</xref>. In this study, we have employed nanoscale features mimicking the ECM found in the brain. These features include myelinated fiber tracts, upon which brain cancer cells have been shown to migrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Bellail1">[47]</xref>. It is known that cell migration is governed by many molecular processes, including attachment to the cell substrate. Our nanopattern provides a quasi-3-D platform that can examine these interactions with ECM by examining speed, direction, and morphologies of migrating cells. While cells move in 2-D, they respond to topographical cues from the substrate presented in 3-D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kim2">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kim3">[69]</xref>.</p>
      <p>By examining cell migration after genetic changes to NKCC1 expression, we sought changes that might inhibit the overall motility of glioma cells. Our observed changes in migratory behavior upon simulated ECM suggests that these cells will be less migratory and invasive, eventually leading to improved medical outcomes. These changes in migratory behavior were further supported by our experiments employing more classical techniques (e.g., transwell).</p>
      <p>It has been shown that formation of actin stress fibers precedes the formation of nascent focal adhesions in the lamellipodium of fibroblasts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Izzard1">[70]</xref>. However, stress fiber formation depends on the anchorage of actin bundles to the plasma membrane, which has been shown in the interaction of NHE1 with ERM proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Denker1">[16]</xref>. Nascent adhesions are present at the front of the cell and exert traction forces that lead to cell repositioning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Beningo1">[21]</xref>. As focal adhesions increase in size, they mature and the traction forces that they exert decrease considerably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Beningo1">[21]</xref>. In migration studies of cells that do not express focal adhesion kinase (FAK), a major regulator of focal adhesion turnover, it was shown that these cells possess larger focal adhesions and display lower cell spreading <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Ilic1">[71]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Schober1">[72]</xref>. In fact, these observations were also seen in GB cells when NKCC1 is knocked down; NKCC1 knockdown cells display larger focal adhesions and smaller projected cell area than control shRNA cells. These changes in focal adhesion size were accompanied by a decrease in the generation of contractile forces by GB cells. These findings suggest that the localized distribution of NKCC1 to the extending processes plays a role in the modulation of focal adhesion turnover and generation of nascent focal adhesion to maintain cell contractility and traction for efficient migration.</p>
      <p>Cell volume changes are expected in migrating cells since alterations in shape during extension and retraction occur throughout migration. Multiple ion transport mechanisms are responsible for regulating and maintaining cellular volume in response to changes in extracellular osmolarity and during cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Lang1">[5]</xref>; in addition, ion gradients and local volume changes have been described in migrating cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Schneider1">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Schwab2">[74]</xref>. These mechanisms include ion transporters such as NKCC1, NHE1, KCC transporters, and also ion channels. For instance, neutrophils undergo an increase in intracellular volume in response to the chemotactic factor N-formylmethionyl-leucyl-phenylalanine; this increase in cell volume and increased migration is blunted by NHE1 transport inhibitors and by exposure to hyperosmolar solutions, suggesting that NHE1-mediated volume increase is necessary for neutrophil migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Rosengren1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Worthen1">[75]</xref>. Na<sup>+</sup>-K<sup>+</sup>-Cl<sup>−</sup> transport inhibition has also shown to decrease Madin-Darby canine kidney cell migration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Schwab2">[74]</xref>. Our results are in accordance with the findings discussed above where inhibition of NKCC transport decreases migration. We also show that NKCC1 knockdown decreases GB cell migration, confirming the effects of pharmacologic inhibitors. Pharmacological inhibitors and shRNA-based approaches may have off-target effects, but the fact that the effect of both on GB cell migration is the same confirms that the results seen by manipulating NKCC1 expression/transport are consistent.</p>

EGF mediates its effects on cell migration and proliferation through activation of its receptor-tyrosine kinase and the various downstream signaling pathways, which include the PI3K-Akt pathway. NKCC1 phosphorylation by WNK3 after activation of the PI3K-Akt pathway supports the hypothesis that NKCC1 activity is necessary for GB cell migration. Furthermore, WNK3 activation after EGF stimulation suggests that phosphorylation and activation of NKCC1 and phosphorylation and inhibition of KCC transporters may result in GB cell migration. Therefore it seems this balance between these opposing transport activities is important in the determination of GB cell invasion.</p>
      <p>The PI3K-Akt signaling pathway, among many other cell functions, is central in the control of cell motility and polarization. PI3K is activated by receptor tyrosine kinases and Ras <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Vanhaesebroeck1">[85]</xref>. It modulates these functions by bringing diverse proteins that are able to bind phosphatidyl-inositol triphosphate (PIP3) close to the membrane. A notable example of the proteins that are recruited to the membrane is Akt, which is activated after binding to PIP3 and phosphorylated by 3′-phosphoinositide-dependent kinase 1 (PDK1); AKT is recruited in a polarized manner to the leading edge of the migrating cell membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Servant1">[86]</xref>. It is well known that PI3K activation mediates cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell polarization through the action of the guanine nucleotide exchange factors (GEFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Innocenti1">[87]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Welch1">[88]</xref>. Moreover, PI3K modulates actin polymerization and membrane insertion at the leading edge of a cell by regulating the activity of Arf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Stephens1">[89]</xref>. Its activation also promotes cell polarization through Rac regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Inoue1">[90]</xref>. It is still necessary to assess if the cytoskeletal rearrangements and cell polarization mediated by PI3K are important in the generation of the partial distribution of NKCC1 to the extending processes of GB cells.</p>
      <p>WNK3 regulates ion transport through phosphorylation: it phosphorylates and activates NKCC1 and phosphorylates and inhibits transport of the KCC transporters in a reciprocal manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle3">[50]</xref>. Furthermore, Haas et al. have shown that following a hyperosmotically induced decrease in cell volume, WNK3 may regulate NKCC1. Also, the reduced expression of WNK3 by shRNA diminished the ability of glioma cells to migrate in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Haas4">[91]</xref>. Our results show that inhibition of NKCC and KCC transport result in opposite effects in GB cell migration. Similar to WNK1, our immunoprecipitation experiments show that EGF induces phosphorylation of WNK3 through Akt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Jiang1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Vitari2">[54]</xref>. When phosphorylated, WNK3 then phosphorylates NKCC1 and possibly KCC transporters. This mechanism is similar to the mechanism proposed for increased excitability of neurons, where WNK3 signaling is impaired, resulting in GABA-mediated excitation of neurons and seizure activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001320-Kahle2">[27]</xref>. Therefore, it is conceivable that WNK3 activation results in activation of NKCC1 and inhibition of KCC transport, causing increased migration of GB cells.</p>
      <p>In this study, we show that NKCC1 transport expression and activity are necessary for GB cells to migrate and invade. The mechanism affecting cell contractility that we report in this article may be independent from regulation of volume changes and may be due to regulation of focal adhesion formation and turnover. We also show that EGF regulates NKCC1 phosphorylation through an Akt-WNK3 pathway, linking the PI3K-Akt pathway to the WNK3 kinase. This suggests that WNK3 may have a role in determining GB cell migratory properties. Furthermore, given that NKCC1 is ubiquitously expressed, it is possible that it plays a very similar role in physiological migration such as inflammatory cell diapedesis or neural precursor migration during development, as well as in the process of metastasis of other highly aggressive cancers.</p>
