        <p>Epac2 disruption impairs basal (but not apical) dendrite complexity in cortical neurons, and an autism-associated mutation in Epac2 implicates a Ras/Epac2 signaling pathway in the active maintenance of basal dendritic arbors.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The architecture of dendritic arbors determines circuit connectivity, receptive fields, and computational properties of neurons, and dendritic structure is impaired in several psychiatric disorders. While apical and basal dendritic compartments of pyramidal neurons are functionally specialized and differentially regulated, little is known about mechanisms that selectively maintain basal dendrites. Here we identified a role for the Ras/Epac2 pathway in maintaining basal dendrite complexity of cortical neurons. Epac2 is a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Ras-like small GTPase Rap, and it is highly enriched in the adult mouse brain. We found that in vivo Epac2 knockdown in layer 2/3 cortical neurons via in utero electroporation reduced basal dendritic architecture, and that Epac2 knockdown in mature cortical neurons in vitro mimicked this effect. Overexpression of an Epac2 rare coding variant, found in human subjects diagnosed with autism, also impaired basal dendritic morphology. This mutation disrupted Epac2's interaction with Ras, and inhibition of Ras selectively interfered with basal dendrite maintenance. Finally, we observed that components of the Ras/Epac2/Rap pathway exhibited differential abundance in the basal versus apical dendritic compartments. These findings define a role for Epac2 in enabling crosstalk between Ras and Rap signaling in maintaining basal dendrite complexity, and exemplify how rare coding variants, in addition to their disease relevance, can provide insight into cellular mechanisms relevant for brain connectivity.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A fundamental feature of a neuron is the morphology of its dendrites, which are the processes that receive and integrate synaptic signals from other neurons. Neurons in the mammalian cortex exhibit two distinct dendritic arbors: apical dendrites, which extend far from the cell body, and basal dendrites, which elaborate locally around the cell body. After development, neurons must actively maintain each of these dendritic arbors to sustain their specific connectivity. Because several neurological and neurodevelopmental disorders are associated with disruptions in dendritic morphology, it is crucial to understand the molecular mechanisms that regulate the process of active maintenance of dendritic arbors. We find that disruption of a particular molecular pathway, the Ras-Epac2 pathway, can result in dramatic simplification of basal, but not apical, dendritic arbors in both cultured neurons and in the intact mouse brain. We show that a mutant form of Epac2, identified in patients with autism, also impairs basal dendrite maintenance and disrupts its interaction with Ras. Our findings suggest that specific molecular pathways can regulate distinct dendritic regions, and that disease-related mutations can inform our understanding of the molecules that regulate important biological processes.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Dendritic structure is critical for neuronal function, as the size and shape of the dendritic arbor defines the neuron's receptive field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Jan1">[1]</xref>. Generating and maintaining proper arborization is therefore crucial for neural circuit function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Parrish1">[2]</xref>. The importance of maintaining dendritic arborization is illustrated by observations of loss of dendritic complexity in patients with neuropsychiatric disorders. Reduced dendritic arborization occurs in patients with psychiatric disorders with delayed onset, including schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Broadbelt1">[3]</xref>, as well as in autism spectrum disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-MukaetovaLadinska1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Raymond1">[5]</xref>, and disorders comorbid with autism, such as Rett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Armstrong1">[6]</xref> and Down syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Becker1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Kaufmann1">[9]</xref>. Thus, the maintenance of dendritic arbor complexity for extended periods of time during development and into adulthood is likely to be crucial for the preservation of functional circuitry and connectivity relevant for learning and complex behaviors.</p>
      <p>Patterns of dendritic branching are integral to the computational ability of the neuron <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-London1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Spruston1">[11]</xref>. An increasing body of evidence suggests that the apical versus basal regions of the dendritic arbor are functionally specialized. These distinct dendritic compartments receive different inputs, integrate distinct signals, and are selectively regulated in physiological and pathological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Milojkovic1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Petreanu1">[13]</xref>. Recent work probing the subcellular location of thalamocortical and intracortical connections has revealed tight spatial restriction of synapses to various somatic and dendritic compartments. Laminar positioning of target cells in the cortex and afferent cell type are critical determinants of synaptic positioning along the dendritic arbor. For example, ascending inputs target basal dendrites in layer 2/3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Petreanu1">[13]</xref>. Basal dendrites are also the target of substantial inhibitory innervation by interneurons, allowing for the tight regulation of excitability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Markram1">[14]</xref>. From a computational perspective, even very small basal dendrites are capable of large effects on cell output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Milojkovic1">[12]</xref>. Thus, subtle morphological alterations to the basal dendritic arbor may have large consequences for cellular and circuit function.</p>
      <p>Consistent with the selective function of dendritic compartments, there is evidence for the selective regulation and maintenance of apical versus basal dendritic compartments. Environmental enrichment appears to have region- and cell-specific effects on dendrites, but preferentially enhances basal arborization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Bose1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Gelfo1">[16]</xref>, and sensory deprivation during a critical developmental period can prevent normal basal dendritic elaboration in the barrel cortex of rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Maravall1">[17]</xref>. While a few molecular alterations selectively affect distinct dendritic compartments, including PTEN or dopamine receptor D1 loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Chow1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Wang1">[19]</xref>, the molecular mechanisms that specifically govern basal dendrite maintenance in cortical neurons remain unclear.</p>
      <p>Regulators of Ras-like small GTPases have been extensively implicated in neuronal morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Ye1">[20]</xref>. The EPAC2 gene encodes Epac2 (<underline>e</underline>xchange <underline>p</underline>rotein directly <underline>a</underline>ctivated by <underline>c</underline>yclic AMP 2), a guanine nucleotide exchange factor (GEF) for the Ras-like small GTPase Rap, which is highly enriched in the adult brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Kawasaki1">[21]</xref> and dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>. Previous studies utilizing an Epac-specific agonist have found that Epac activation can modulate synaptic plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Gelinas1">[23]</xref> as well as memory retrieval in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Kelly1">[24]</xref>, and EPAC null mice exhibit deficits in spatial reference memory and social interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Yang1">[25]</xref>, implicating Epac in brain function. Epac2 has been implicated in the outgrowth of neuronal processes in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Mironov1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Kiermayer1">[27]</xref>, but its role in dendritic morphogenesis within the cortex is not known. In the present study we observed that Epac2 knockdown robustly and selectively impaired basal dendrite maintenance in cortical pyramidal neurons in vivo and in culture.</p>
      <p>Recent genetic studies have detected numerous rare coding mutations in subjects with neurodevelopmental disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-McClellan1">[28]</xref>. While their significance for disease etiology remains to be elucidated, such mutations might provide insight into a protein's functional role in important cellular processes. Previously, four rare amino acid coding variants had been identified in EPAC2 in subjects with autism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Bacchelli1">[29]</xref>. In the present study we observed that expressing one of these rare coding variants robustly and selectively reduced basal dendrite complexity in cortical pyramidal neurons and impaired Epac2's interaction with Ras. The use of a disease-associated point mutation as a method of probing molecular function revealed that Epac2 mediates crosstalk between Ras and Rap to specifically regulate basal dendritic complexity in cortical neurons. This approach exemplifies a more general “reverse translational” strategy for discovery of basic cellular mechanisms.</p>

        <title>Epac2 Is Selectively Required for the Maintenance of Basal Dendrite Complexity In Vivo</title>
        <p>Epac2, an upstream regulator of Rap activity, is involved in regulating synapse morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>, but its role in regulating the architecture of the dendritic tree in cortical neurons is unknown. We first tested whether altered expression of Epac2 affected the maintenance of dendritic arbors in vivo, using in utero electroporation (IUEP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Taniguchi1">[30]</xref> to knock down protein expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Using a previously characterized RNA interference (RNAi) construct selective for Epac2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>, we coinjected either Epac2-RNAi, or control (pGSuper), with pCAG-eGFP into the subventricular zone of E16.5 mouse embryos to specifically target layer 2/3 neurons. Electroporated constructs were allowed to express until brain harvesting and sectioning on postnatal day 28 (P28). In vivo knockdown of the Epac2 protein via Epac2-RNAi was confirmed at P28 by immunohistochemistry of cortical sections. Quantification of GFP-positive cells revealed that Epac2 was knocked down by ∼75% compared to GFP-negative cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s001">Figure S1B</xref>–C). Electroporated neurons were specifically found in layer 2/3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). When we analyzed dendritic morphology by measuring apical and basal dendritic number and length in GFP-positive cells, we observed that long-term knockdown of Epac2 expression specifically reduced basal dendrites. Examination of basal arbors of layer 2/3 neurons from P28 mice expressing GFP and Epac2-RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g001">Figure 1B–F</xref>) revealed a ∼42% reduction in basal dendritic branches and a ∼54% reduction in basal dendritic length (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g001">Figure 1E–F</xref>) compared to cells from P28 mice expressing GFP and control construct.

        <p>To eliminate the possibility of inter-individual and reporter expression variability, we took advantage of the sparse nature of IUEP gene transfer to directly compare dendritic morphology between neighboring non-Epac2-RNAi-expressing cells versus Epac2-RNAi-expressing cells within the same layer and cortical region from the same mice. Epac2-RNAi-expressing cells could be easily identified by the coexpression of pCAG-eGFP, while neighboring control cells not expressing Epac2-RNAi were identified by the lack of GFP expression. Pairs of GFP- and non-GFP-expressing neurons were filled with biocytin and stained with streptavidin-568 conjugated fluorescent probe to visualize dendritic morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Using 2-photon laser scanning microscopy, we imaged paired layer 2/3 cells in the anterior frontal cortex, an area previously described to display abnormal circuitry in disease-related animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Qiu1">[31]</xref>. Cortical slices were cut at a thickness of 300 µm to allow reconstruction of the majority of the apical and basal dendritic fields of these cells. This approach further confirmed that loss of Epac2 resulted in a specific reduction of basal dendrite complexity: Epac2-RNAi-expressing cells displayed an overall decrease in basal dendritic branch number (∼47%) and basal dendritic length (∼53%) (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 0.01; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g002">Figures 2B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s002">S2A</xref>–B).

This effect was driven by the absence of high order branches (tertiary branches and beyond; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g002">Figure 2D–F</xref>). No effect on apical dendrite complexity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s002">Figure S2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s009">Table S2</xref>) or length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s002">Figure S2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s010">Table S3</xref>) was observed. Together, these data demonstrate that Epac2 signaling is required for maintaining higher order branching of basal dendrites in vivo.

        <title>Knockdown of Epac2 Impairs Basal Dendrite Maintenance in Cultured Neurons</title>
        <p>Epac2 knockdown by in utero electroporation reduced Epac2 expression throughout development; however, it is not clear when Epac2 expression is required for normal dendritic morphology. To directly test the role of Epac2 in dendritic maintenance, we used an RNAi approach in mature cultured neurons, allowing perturbations in Epac2 expression levels after the dendritic arbor has already been established. This system has also been extensively used for mechanistic studies of structural plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Xie1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Horton1">[34]</xref> and allows examination of the potential molecular underpinnings of dendritic architecture. A number of studies have demonstrated that mature cultured pyramidal neurons develop pyramidal morphologies with primary (classified as “apical”) and non-primary (classified as “basal”) dendrites that resemble morphologies observed in vivo (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for description of criteria used for identifying apical and basal dendrites of cultured neurons) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Horton1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Threadgill1">[36]</xref>. We knocked down Epac2 expression in mature (DIV 23–28) cultured cortical neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), and used Sholl analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Sholl1">[37]</xref> as well as dendritic length measurements to assess the complexity and morphology of basal or apical dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–D). Consistent with our in vivo data, reduced Epac2 expression selectively decreased dendritic complexity in an asymmetric manner. Epac2 knockdown reduced basal dendritic intersections 25–175 µm from the soma, as well as basal dendrite length, without affecting apical dendrite length or complexity (basal dendritic length: length (µm), control: 956±164; Epac2-RNAi: 273±100; rescue: 647±124, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g003">Figure 3B–C</xref>). Importantly, this deficit was rescued by overexpressing an RNAi-resistant mutant of Epac2 (“Epac2-rescue”) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>. Epac2-rescue overexpression did not significantly alter basal or apical complexity compared to control, but significantly increased basal complexity 25–100 µm from the cell body and basal dendrite length compared to Epac2-RNAi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g003">Figure 3B–C</xref>). Similar to the effect of Epac2 knockdown in in utero electroporated neurons, Epac2 expression levels were reduced down by similar degrees (∼75%) in both apical and basal dendritic compartments in cultured cells overexpressing Epac2-RNAi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). Given that Epac2 knockdown occurred in mature neurons after their dendritic arbors had been established, these data suggest that Epac2 plays a role in maintenance of the basal dendritic arbor.</p>

Expression of Epac2-G706R (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), followed by Sholl analysis, revealed a robust selective decrease in basal dendrite complexity 50–100 µm from the soma, compared to Epac2-WT, with no effect on apical dendrites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).

        <p>We next reasoned that the location of the single amino-acid mutation in the Epac2 protein might offer insight into the mechanisms of asymmetric maintenance of dendritic compartments. The small GTPase Ras and its signaling partners have been implicated in neuronal morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Ye1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Chen1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Alpar1">[42]</xref>. Given that the G706R mutation is within Epac2's Ras-association (RA) domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), we hypothesized that this mutation might alter Epac2's interaction with Ras and that abnormal association with Ras could underlie the dendritic effects induced by Epac2-G706R. Epac2 has been shown to interact with Ras in non-neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Li1">[43]</xref>, but this interaction has not yet been established in cortical neurons. We therefore tested whether Epac2 interacted with Ras in rat cortical neurons by coimmunoprecipitation. We found that Ras coimmunoprecipitated with Epac2 in mature cortical neurons (DIV 25) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This interaction was dependent on the activation state of Ras: Ras activation by incubation with GTPγS enhanced the interaction between Ras and Epac2, whereas Ras inhibition by treatment with GDP reduced the interaction (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, 0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). This interaction was further confirmed by ectopic expression of HA-tagged Epac2-WT alone or with YFP-Ras in hEK293 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). We then tested the ability of Epac2-G706R to interact with Ras by coexpressing YFP-Ras with HA-Epac2-WT or HA-Epac2-G706R in hEK293 cells, and immunoprecipitating with YFP-Ras (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g004">Figure 4G</xref>). Indeed, quantitative analysis of coimmunoprecipitation revealed that Epac2-G706R displayed significantly impaired Ras interaction (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). These results demonstrate that a naturally occurring Epac2 variant specifically alters basal dendritic architecture, and that interaction with Ras may be a key feature of Epac2's role in regulating basal dendritic maintenance.</p>

        <p>The findings that Epac2 is required for the maintenance of basal (non-primary) dendrites, and that a rare coding variant that specifically disrupts Epac2's interaction with Ras mimics this selective morphological phenotype but has no affect on Epac2's basal Rap-GEF function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>, suggest a role for Epac2 and Ras signaling in the maintenance of basal dendrite complexity.

        <p>Thus, we tested whether disruption of endogenous Ras activity by the farnesyl transferase inhibitor II (FTaseII) could affect either apical or basal dendrite maintenance. We used time-lapse imaging of live mature (DIV 25) cultured cortical pyramidal neurons, expressing GFP and treated with either vehicle or FTaseII (200 nM) and measured dendritic complexity and length before and after treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g005">Figure 5A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">S5A</xref>). Imaging of neurons for 2 h prior to treatment revealed a remarkable stability of the dendritic arbor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g005">Figure 5A–E</xref>) with an almost equal gain and loss of apical and basal dendrites.

In contrast, incubation with FTaseII resulted in a robust retraction of basal dendrites over 6 h, as demonstrated by a reduction of basal complexity (normalized basal dendrite intersections: 0 h: 1.04±0.03 versus 0.95±0.05; 6 h 1.02±0.5 versus 0.56±0.08; control versus FTaseII, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g005">Figure 5A–B</xref>), and a loss of dendritic length (normalized basal dendrite length: 0 h: 1.06±0.02 versus 1.01±0.04; 6 h: 1.02±0.4 versus 0.54±0.06; control versus FTaseII, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g005">Figure 5A,C</xref>).

Sholl analysis revealed that FTaseII treatment specifically reduced basal complexity 25–100 µm from the soma (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">Figure S5C</xref>) and basal dendritic length (basal dendrite length (µm); control, 1,405±221; FTaseII, 602±155, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s003">Figure S3D</xref>) with no effect on apical dendrite complexity or length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">Figure S5C</xref>–D). The very specific effect of short-term FTaseII treatment on the dendritic tree is quantitatively similar to that of Epac2 knockdown or Epac2-G706R overexpression (which displays impaired Ras binding), suggesting that interference with Ras signaling, but not other potential targets of FTaseII, in cortical neurons results in a selective reduction of basal complexity.</p>
        <p>To further investigate the impact of interference with Ras signaling on dendritic architecture, we mimicked Ras inhibition by expression of a dominant-negative Ras mutant (Ras S17N; RasDN). Expression of RasDN alone (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">Figure S5E</xref>–F), followed by Sholl analysis, revealed a robust selective decrease in basal dendrite complexity 50–100 µm from the soma, compared to GFP (control), with no effect on apical arbors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">Figure S5F</xref>), paralleling the effects seen following short-term FTaseII treatment. Furthermore, overexpression of RasDN reduced basal dendrite length relative to control (basal dendrite length (µm); GFP, 1,704±122; RasDN, 987±198, RasDN+Epac2-WT 1,519±160, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">Figure S5</xref>E–F), but did not affect apical dendritic length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">Figure S5G</xref>). Importantly, co-expression of Epac2-WT was sufficient to rescue RasDN-induced loss of basal dendrites and basal dendritic length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s005">Figure S5E</xref>–G). These data provide further support for the role of the Ras/Epac2 pathway in the maintenance of basal, but not apical, dendrites.</p>

        <p>The distribution of the Ras, Epac2, and Rap proteins across the dendritic tree of cortical neurons has not yet been examined. We thus compared the relative amounts of Epac2, Ras, and Rap immunostaining intensity in basal versus apical dendrites of cortical neurons in culture.

        <p>Because we observed asymmetry in the levels of Epac2/Ras/Rap across dendritic compartments of cortical neurons, we wondered if perturbations of this pathway might lead to differential signaling output in basal versus apical dendrites. To address this question, we specifically inhibited Ras signaling or reduced Epac2 expression by RNAi throughout the neurons, and examined p-BRaf immunofluorescence in individual dendritic compartments. Inhibition of Ras using FTaseII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g007">Figures 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s007">S7A</xref>) resulted in a ∼22% reduction in p-BRaf levels in apical dendrites compared to control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g007">Figures 7A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s007">S7A</xref>), but produced a more profound reduction in p-BRaf levels in basal dendrites (∼45% compared to control basal levels), which was significantly different to both control and FTaseII-induced apical p-BRaf levels (mean p-BRaf intensities relative to control levels: FTaseII; apical 0.76±0.04; basal 0.55±0.01; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001350-g007">Figures 7B–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s007">S7B</xref>–C).

Moreover, comparison of Epac2 immunofluorescence in apical or basal compartments in control versus Epac2-RNAi-expressing neurons, relative to Epac2 levels in control apical dendrites, revealed that Epac2 expression in apical dendrites of Epac2-RNAi cells was not significantly different from Epac2 levels in control basal dendrites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s007">Figure S7E</xref>), suggesting that apical dendrites may contain enough Epac2 even in the knockdown condition to preserve apical dendrite morphology.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here we showed that Epac2 is important for the selective maintenance of basal dendrite complexity in cortical neurons. Utilizing a rare coding variant of Epac2, found in human patients, to probe the molecular and cellular functions of Epac2 in the context of dendritic complexity of cortical pyramidal neurons, we identified Ras as a signaling partner of Epac2 in this pathway. Our findings support a model in which Epac2, as a Rap-GEF, enables crosstalk between two morphogenic GTPase signaling pathways to maintain basal dendrites.</p>
      <p>The importance of maintaining dendritic architecture is illustrated by observations of dendritic complexity in pathological analysis of patients with neuropsychiatric and neurodevelopmental disorders. Reduced dendritic arborization occurs in patients with psychiatric disorders with delayed onset, including schizophrenia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Broadbelt1">[3]</xref>, autism spectrum disorders <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-MukaetovaLadinska1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Raymond1">[5]</xref>, and disorders comorbid with autism, such as Rett <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Armstrong1">[6]</xref> and Down syndromes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Becker1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Kaufmann1">[9]</xref>. In Down syndrome, loss of dendritic arbors occurs in a progressive manner: prior to 2 y of age, dendritic hypertrophy was observed in the cortex of subjects with Down syndrome; thereafter, dendritic arbors were reduced in complexity relative to controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Becker1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Kaufmann1">[9]</xref>, suggesting an initial period of dendritic overgrowth followed by a later stage in which maintenance mechanisms are potentially disrupted or lost. An early study of visual cortex from subjects with Down syndrome revealed a selective loss of basal dendrite complexity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Takashima1">[47]</xref>, though subsequent studies have also detected apical deficits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Becker2">[8]</xref>. Rett syndrome, a monogenic disorder frequently accompanied by an autistic phenotype, features dendritic deficits, usually in basal dendrites and occasionally in apical dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Armstrong1">[6]</xref>. Individuals with autism exhibited reduced dendrite numbers and dendritic cytochemical markers in the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-MukaetovaLadinska1">[4]</xref> and hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Raymond1">[5]</xref>. Thus, a more complete understanding of molecular mechanisms that contribute to the maintenance of specific aspects of the dendritic arbor may hasten the development of therapeutic strategies that aim to prevent the apparent progressive loss of dendritic complexity and to preserve functional cortical circuits in patients with neurodevelopmental and neuropsychiatric disorders in which dendritic structure is affected.</p>
      <p>Several lines of evidence support the selective regulation of apical versus basal dendritic compartments. Environmental enrichment has been shown to selectively increase basal dendrite length, while stress can reduce basal dendritic length, in layer 2/3 cells of the auditory cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Bose1">[15]</xref>. Sensory deprivation by whisker trimming during a critical developmental window, between P9 and P15 in rats, delayed normal basal dendritic elaboration of layer 2/3 pyramidal cells in the barrel cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Maravall1">[17]</xref>. PTEN knockout results in selective outgrowth of apical dendrites, demonstrating that inhibition of mTOR blocks continued apical but not basal dendrite growth under stable conditions in mature animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Chow1">[18]</xref>. Particularly relevant to Epac2 signaling is the recent report that knockout of dopamine receptor D1 in mouse cortex results in selective basal dendrite loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Wang1">[19]</xref>, as Epac2 is also regulated by D1/cAMP signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>. Given the ability of Epac2 to selectively regulate the basal arbor, signaling through Epac2 may be a key mechanism for control of select dendritic compartments. A current hypothesis is that the establishment and elaboration of apical and basal arbors occur at distinct time points, with basal dendrites developing after apical dendrites, and thus may involve distinct regulatory mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Romand1">[48]</xref>. Our knockdown data indicate that Epac2 is required for the maintenance of higher order basal dendrite branches. Elaboration of higher order basal dendrite branching, which increases basal dendrite complexity, occurs subsequent to the formation of the primary proximal basal arbor and the apical arbor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Romand1">[48]</xref>. Interestingly, this time point (3 wk postnatal) coincides with a dramatic increase in Epac2 expression in cortical neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>. Thus, our findings support a role for Epac2 in regulating the maintenance of basal dendritic complexity once these complex arbors have been initially established.</p>
      <p>Here we were guided by a rare coding mutation, naturally occurring in human subjects with autism, to identify the Ras/Epac2 interaction as important for the control of basal dendrite complexity in cortical neurons. Interestingly, a different point mutation in the RA domain of Epac2, identified through sequence analysis rather than occurrence as a rare variant in human patients, has also been shown to disrupt the interaction with Ras in COS cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Liu1">[49]</xref>, suggesting that single-residue sites in this domain of Epac2 may be crucial for its function in response to Ras, and that even single amino acid mutations occurring as rare variants may have functional or pathological consequences. Our strategy exemplifies how mutations identified in humans with neurodevelopmental or psychiatric disorders, beyond their relevance for disease, could provide functional insight into novel mechanisms underlying brain development and connectivity. A growing number of rare single amino acid mutations have been identified in neuropsychiatric disorders by recent genetic studies, and with the advent of whole exome or genome sequencing, their numbers are expected to increase dramatically <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-McClellan2">[50]</xref>. While their significance for disease etiology remains to be elucidated, our approach taken in this study shows that such mutations might help identify cellular mechanisms that control crucial cellular processes, including dendrite arborization. About 20% of single amino acid mutations are thought to be damaging, with another 53% being mildly deleterious <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Kryukov1">[51]</xref>. Given that rare mutations are thought to make up a significant fraction of the genetic architecture of complex diseases, functional characterization of such mutations may provide novel insight into both physiology and pathophysiology.</p>
      <p>In this study, we show that a pathway involving Ras/Epac2/Rap contributes to the maintenance of basal dendrite complexity. The G706R point mutation disrupted the Ras-Epac2 interaction and reduced basal complexity, and Ras inhibition experiments using FTaseII or RasDN overexpression specifically affected basal dendrite maintenance, suggesting that this pathway exerts specific control over basal dendritic complexity in pyramidal neurons. Our results establishing a role for Epac2 in linking Ras and Rap signaling to dendrite maintenance in mature cortical neurons are consistent with a number of previous findings. Dominant-negative Rap1-expressing layer 5 pyramidal neurons exhibit deficits in basal dendrite arborization during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Chen1">[38]</xref>. In non-neuronal cells, activated Ras has been shown to recruit Epac2 to the plasma membrane, thereby activating membrane-associated pools of Rap <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Li1">[43]</xref>. In adrenally derived PC12 cells, Ras activation can recruit Epac2 to the plasma membrane, activate membrane-associated pools of Rap1, and induce the outgrowth of neurite-like structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Liu1">[49]</xref>. Recent characterizations of EPAC null mice reveal cognitive and behavioral phenotypes, illustrating the importance of Epac in complex behavior and brain function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Yang1">[25]</xref>; however, dendritic architecture of cortical neurons was not measured in this mouse model. Our data implicating Epac2 in the maintenance of basal arbors of cortical neurons provide a potential mechanism for the disruption of neuronal circuitry upon perturbations of this pathway. Our observation of asymmetric distribution of Epac2, Ras, and Rap proteins is consistent with the selective effect of reduced Ras/Epac2 signaling on the maintenance of basal dendrites. Indeed, it is reasonable to expect that other redundant mechanisms are employed for the active maintenance of apical dendritic architecture, which may require more stability during the life of the neuron. Our data showing that disruption of a single pathway can alter basal maintenance are consistent with the intrinsic dynamism of basal dendrites, due to the higher demands for plasticity driven by sensory and inhibitory inputs to this compartment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Spruston1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Petreanu1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Markram1">[14]</xref>. Taken together, our data support a model in which Epac2 couples with Ras signaling and actively maintains basal dendrites in cortical pyramidal neurons.</p>

DNA solution was loaded into beveled glass micropipettes (100 µm oblique opening), and 0.26 µl was injected into the lateral ventricle through the uterus wall (4 injections; 65 nL/injection) using a nanojector (Drummond Nanoject II). DNA was electroporated into the neural precursor populations that reside on the ventricular zone by directed electroporation, by placing the (+) end of the electrode toward the developing neocortex. Unipolar electric pulse of 40 V was generated (BTX ECM830), and a total of five 50 ms pulses at an interval of 100 ms were applied to the cerebral wall. After electroporation, embryos were placed back into the abdominal cavity, and the rectus abdominis and abdominal oblique muscles were sutured with 5-0 coated vicryl suture for quick absorption and fast recovery. The skin was closed with LiquiVet tissue adhesive. Mice were allowed to recover and give natural birth. Injected animals were collected at P28 for further investigations. A preparation of DNA 3∶1 molar ratio was used to mix pCAG-EGFP construct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Niwa1">[52]</xref>, which expresses EGFP under the chicken beta actin promoter, and Epac2-RNAi cloned into pGSuper expression vector <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Woolfrey1">[22]</xref>. 0.05% FastBlue was added to visualize DNA. In control experiments, pGSuper was mixed with pCAG-eGFP construct.</p>

They were then maintained at room temperature for the remainder of the intracellular labeling procedure. To maximize the amount of dendritic arbor, we selected neighboring pairs of GFP-positive, Epac2-RNAi-expressing, and non-fluorescent control neurons with somata deeper than 60 µm from the surface of the brain slice (average depth = 89±3.9 µm). Using a micropipette filled with biocytin intracellular solution (in mM: 10 biocytin, 126 K-methylsulfate, 4 KCl, 10 HEPES, 4 ATP, 0.3 GTP, and 10 phosphocreatine), we dialyzed the neurons for at least 15 min and then allowed the cells to recover for at least 30 min before fixing the slices in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M sodium phosphate buffer (pH 7.4). Slices were then immunostained with a fluorescent streptavidin-568 conjugate (Invitrogen) and chicken anti-GFP polyclonal antibody (Abcam) as floating sections. Sections were mounted under a #1.5 coverslip with 2 #1 coverslips (∼150 µm thickness) placed either side of the section to avoid damage to the tissue.</p>

The objective lens lateral resolution was defined to be 0.43 µm with 795 nm and NA = 0.8 and captured with pixels of 0.22 µm (2,048×2,048, 440 µm field of view), 4 µs pixel dwell time. Best performance was achieved with Cargill Type FF immersion oil, an index of 1.479, and using the glycerol with cover slip objective lens correction collar setting. Only pairs of cells exhibiting intact healthy secondary and tertiary apical and basal dendrites were imaged and used for quantification.

        <title>Dendrite Visualization and Quantitative Morphometric Analysis</title>
        <p>To quantify dendritic morphology in vitro, cultured neurons expressing GFP were imaged using a 10× objective (NA = 0.17), and micrographs were acquired using a Zeiss AxioCam MRm CCD camera. Dendrites were traced and binarized in ImageJ. The axon was identified by its distinct morphology and was eliminated from quantification. The following criteria for identifying apical and basal dendrites in cultured neurons were used. “Apical” dendrites were defined as the longest single protrusion, also referred to as the primary dendrite, which has the largest diameter proximal to the cell body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Horton2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Threadgill1">[36]</xref>, whereas “basal” dendrites were identified as smaller and shorter protrusions, with a smaller diameter proximal to the cell body, compared to the primary dendrite (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001350.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–B). Examination of Golgi outposts in vitro and in vivo has demonstrated that the longest dendritic protrusions (primary dendrite) contain Golgi complexes in cultured neurons, and that in vivo, Golgi complexes are found in apical dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Horton1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001350-Horton2">[35]</xref>.

Dendritic length was measured in MetaMorph.
