        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>A large proportion of age-related hearing loss is caused by loss or damage to outer hair cells in the organ of Corti. The organ of Corti is a highly specialized structure in the inner ear that is composed of inner hair cells, outer hair cells, and associated supporting cells. Although we understand some of the mechanisms that regulate hair cell versus supporting cell differentiation, the mechanisms that regulate differentiation of inner versus outer hair cells are not known. One potential candidate is fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling, which is known to regulate the morphogenesis of many sensory organs, including the organ of Corti. In this study, we find that FGF20 signaling is required at a specific time during development to initiate differentiation of cells in the mouse lateral cochlear compartment (which contains outer hair cells and supporting cells, but not inner hair cells). In the absence of FGF20, mice are deaf, and lateral compartment cells remain undifferentiated and unresponsive to mechanisms that regulate the final stages of differentiation. These findings are significant given the importance of outer hair cells during age-related hearing loss. Our studies also suggest that genetic mutations in FGF20 may result in deafness in humans and that FGF20 may be an important factor for the repair or regeneration of sensory cells in the inner ear.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Congenital hearing loss is one of the most common hereditary diseases, affecting 2–3 infants per 1,000 live births <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Vohr1">[1]</xref>. Acquired age-related hearing loss affects one-third of people over the age of 65 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Desai1">[2]</xref>. A large proportion of age-related hearing loss is sensorineural and is caused by loss or damage to outer hair cells (OHC) in the organ of Corti (OC) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Saunders1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Dallos1">[4]</xref>. The OC is the sensory transducing apparatus in the cochlea and is composed of one row of inner hair cells (IHC) and three rows of OHCs that are separated by two pillar cells (PCs) that form the tunnel of Corti. Each sensory hair cell is associated with an underlying supporting cell (SC). Although there has been progress in understanding mechanisms of hair cell (HC) and SC differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Kelley1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Whitlon1">[6]</xref>, the cellular signals that specify the distinct phenotypes of cochlear IHCs and OHCs are not known <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Fritzsch1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Fibroblast growth factor (FGF) signaling has essential functions at several stages of inner ear development. In the embryonic day 9–10 (E9–E10) developing mouse, FGF3, FGF8, and FGF10 are essential for development of the otic vesicle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Schimmang1">[8]</xref>. These ligands signal through FGF receptor (FGFR) 2b in otic epithelium, and mice lacking <italic>Fgfr2b</italic> show impaired otic vesicle development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Pirvola1">[9]</xref>. At later stages of development, FGF signaling is required for morphogenesis of the organ of Corti. At E11.5, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> is expressed in the ventromedial wall of the otocyst, the region that will give rise to the cochlea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Pirvola2">[10]</xref>. At E15, <italic>Fgfr1</italic> expression is observed in the sensory epithelium of the developing cochlea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hayashi1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hayashi2">[12]</xref>. Conditional disruption of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> in sensory epithelial progenitor cells (with <italic>Foxg1<sup>cre</sup></italic>) resulted in a severe reduction in HC number, possibly due to reduced proliferation of progenitor cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Pirvola2">[10]</xref>. A similar phenotype was also observed in organ cultures treated with FGFR inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hayashi1">[11]</xref>. <italic>Fgf20</italic> is expressed in the presumptive epithelial domain of the developing cochlea at E13.5 and antibody inhibition of FGF20 in cochlear organ culture resulted in fewer SCs and HCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hayashi1">[11]</xref>. These studies suggest that FGF20 might be the ligand for FGFR1 during the early growth and differentiation stages of cochlear development.</p>
      <p>At later stages of organ of Corti development (after E15), inhibition of FGF signaling results in loss of PCs, suggesting an additional stage-specific role for FGF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Mueller1">[13]</xref>. Genetic and gene expression data suggest that this function is mediated by FGF8 signaling to FGFR3. <italic>Fgfr3</italic> is expressed after E15.5 in undifferentiated postmitotic progenitor cells that are thought to have the capacity to form OHCs, Deiters' cells (DCs), PCs, and Hensen's cells (HeCs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hayashi2">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hayashi3">[15]</xref>. Genetic disruption of <italic>Fgfr3</italic> prevents the differentiation of PCs and the formation of the tunnel of Corti and results in deafness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Mueller1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hayashi3">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Colvin1">[16]</xref>. FGF8 is expressed in IHCs where it induces differentiation of PCs and formation of one row of OHCs through signaling to FGFR3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Pirvola2">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Shim1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Jacques1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The mechanisms that regulate the formation of OHCs are particularly significant, given the importance of OHCs for hearing function and age-related hearing loss. Although mouse mutants lacking FGFR1 suggest a role for FGF signaling in OHC development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Pirvola2">[10]</xref>, the underlying mechanisms regulating OHC development are not known. Here we generated mice lacking FGF20 (<italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic>). We show that <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice are viable, healthy, and congenitally deaf, specifically lack OHCs and outer supporting cells, and have patterning defects throughout most of the cochlear sensory epithelium. These studies show that the organ of Corti can be subdivided into developmentally distinct medial (IHCs and inner SCs) and lateral (OHCs and outer SCs) compartments that are under the control of distinct developmental programs. This model posits the existence of distinct progenitor cells that give rise to medial and lateral compartments of the OC.</p>

        <p>To study the function of <italic>Fgf20</italic> in vivo, we generated <italic>Fgf20</italic> null mice in which exon 1 was replaced with a β-galactosidase gene (<italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Homozygous <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice were viable, fertile, and healthy. However, <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice lacked auditory perception (no ear twitch response to loud noise) and had auditory brainstem response (ABR) thresholds greater than 40 db above controls in the 5–20 kHz range (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Histological sections of the adult inner ear of <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice showed normal gross morphology of the temporal bone and cochlea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s001">Figure S1E–G</xref>); however, the OC showed significant dysmorphology, with variability in the degree of disorganization along the length of the cochlea (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Some sections showed almost complete absence of sensory HCs and SCs, while other sections showed loss of OHCs and DCs. In contrast, wild type and heterozygous littermates showed normal cochlear organization, with one IHC, three OHCs, one inner and outer pillar cell (IPC, OPC), and three DCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g001">Figure 1B</xref>).</p>

        <p>To further analyze the hair cell phenotype in the cochlea, we isolated whole cochleae at P0 and stained with phalloidin, as well as with antibodies against Myo6 and Calretinin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s003">Figure S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Hasson1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Dechesne1">[21]</xref>.

However, in the cochlea of <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> newborn pups, the proximal base region contained only two rows of OHCs and one row of IHCs. In the middle and apical regions, patches of HCs were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Such patches typically contained three rows of OHCs and two rows of IHCs, and there were no HCs in the regions between the patches. Finally, no distinct phalloidin or Myo6 positive HCs were present in the most apical region. Because HC differentiation progresses from the base to the apex of the cochlea, we sought to determine whether differentiation of HCs in the distal apex region of <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea was delayed or whether HCs were lost.

        <p>To identify whether SCs were properly formed, we stained P0 cochlea with antibodies against Prox1 and p75. At P0, Prox1 is expressed at high levels in DCs and PCs, while p75 labels PCs and HeCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-vonBartheld1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-BerminghamMcDonogh1">[23]</xref>. In <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochleae, there were two rows of PCs, three rows of DCs, and one row of HeCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s003">Figure S3G</xref>). Immunolabeling of <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochleae showed that all the SC types existed, although with dysmorphology. Similar to HC patterns, two rows of DCs and two rows of PCs were formed at the base region of <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s003">Figure S3H</xref>). In the middle region, where HCs were clustered in patches, SCs were formed in accordance with the hair cell pattern (three rows of DCs and two rows of PCs). No SCs were observed in the space between the sensory patches. Interestingly, within a patch, OHCs were surrounded by PCs and HeCs, as indicated by continuous p75 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s003">Figure S3J</xref>). Unlike HCs, apical SCs were differentiated, as indicated by Prox1 staining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s003">Figure S3G,H</xref>), suggesting that apical SCs may develop normally in the absence of FGF20.</p>
        <p>Because of the delay in HC differentiation and patch formation, the total numbers of cochlear HCs were quantified at P4, a time when both <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea appeared fully differentiated (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001231.s003">Figure S3K</xref>). Surprisingly, although there were two rows of IHCs in patches and no IHCs in the region between patches, the total number of IHCs was the same in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea (680±18, <italic>n</italic> = 4 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and 685±58, <italic>n</italic> = 3 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.4). However, the number of OHCs was decreased by 70% in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea (2035±42 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and 601±60 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In addition, cochlear length was decreased by 10% in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). We also counted the number of SCs (DCs, OPCs, and IPCs) normalized to 100 µm intervals. Similar to the large decrease in the number of OHCs, the number of DCs+OPCs was decreased by 52% in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea (55±3, <italic>n</italic> = 6 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and 26±4, <italic>n</italic> = 8 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> per 100 µm, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). In contrast, the number of IPCs was decreased by only 15% in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea (19±1 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and 16±1 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> per 100 µm, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Next, we compared the ratio of different cell types in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> and <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea. In <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea, the ratio of OHC/IHC was 3.4±0.3. However, in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea this ratio was decreased (by 62%) to 1.3±0.6 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Additionally, the ratio of DC+OPC/IPC in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea was 2.9±0.1, but was decreased (by 45%) to 1.6±0.2 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Interestingly, within the lateral and medial compartments, the ratio of DC+OPC/OHC (1.4±0.0 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and 1.5±0.1 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01) and IPC/IHC (1.6±0.1 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> and 1.2±0.1 in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic>, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) was slightly increased (by 7%) or decreased (by 25%), respectively, in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> compared to <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea. These ratios indicate that absence of FGF20 primarily affects lateral compartment cells (i.e., OHCs and DCs).</p>

Next, we hypothesized that FGF20 may play a role in lateral compartment differentiation. To test this, we isolated E13.5 or E14.5 cochlea and treated explants with 1 µM FGF9 (which shows similar biochemical activity in vitro compared to FGF20) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Zhang1">[26]</xref> beginning at E13.5, E14.5, E15.5, and E16.5.

At P0, Sox2 labels all supporting cells, but at earlier stages of sensory domain formation (E14.5), Sox2 labels undifferentiated sensory cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Kiernan1">[24]</xref>. We observed normal patterns of Sox2 expression in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> cochlea. However, in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea, Sox2 was expressed both in supporting cells and in the regions between the sensory patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g005">Figure 5B</xref> arrows). We also examined the expression of p27, a marker of SCs and undifferentiated sensory progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Chen2">[28]</xref>. The expression pattern of p27 was similar to that of Sox2, with high expression in cells in the region between the sensory patches (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Although the identity of the cells within these gaps in the sensory epithelium is not known, these expression studies suggest that these cells may be an arrested progenitor-like cell or a differentiated non-sensory cell. To determine whether the lineage precursors of these cells could be rescued, E14.5 <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea explants were treated with or without FGF9 and co-stained for Sox2 and Prox1 expression after 5 d in culture. In explants not exposed to FGF9, the region between the patches was Sox2+; Prox1− (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, left). However, following exposure to FGF9, these cells became Sox2+; Prox1+ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, right), indicating that the lineage precursors of these cells are undifferentiated sensory cells and that exposure to FGF9 induced their differentiation into lateral HCs and SCs, such as OHCs and DCs. This finding indicates that FGF signaling is required to induce differentiation of cells in the lateral cochlear compartment.</p>

        <title>Undifferentiated Sensory Cells Are Not Influenced by Notch Mediated Lateral Inhibition</title>
        <p>Next, we asked whether FGF20 functions to induce differentiation of a specific cell phenotype in the lateral compartment versus functioning as a gate to permit lateral compartment differentiation. To answer this question, we treated E14.5 cochlea explants with DAPT, a γ-secretase inhibitor, which inhibits the Notch signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Geling1">[29]</xref>. At this stage of development, the Notch pathway functions to prevent SC differentiation into HCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Lanford1">[30]</xref>. In <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> explants treated with DAPT, the domain of IHCs and OHCs expanded at the expense of SCs, compared to untreated explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>). In <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> explants, treatment with DAPT also expanded the IHC domain, similar to heterozygous explants treated with DAPT. However, the domain of OHCs in DAPT-treated <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> explants was still smaller than the OHC domain of DAPT-treated <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/+</sup></italic> explants and also contained patches of undifferentiated sensory progenitor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g006">Figure 6C and D</xref>). This finding indicates that DAPT treatment did not induce differentiation of otherwise FGF20-dependent precursor cells. Also, we observed a dramatic reduction of SCs following DAPT treatment of either genotype, indicating that all SCs were converted into HCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g006">Figure 6F and H</xref>). Together, these data support a model in which FGF20 functions as a permissive factor that is required to initiate lateral compartment differentiation before E14.5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g007">Figure 7</xref>).

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>The mechanisms that differentially regulate formation of inner versus outer hair cells are poorly understood. In this study, we show that <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice have a specific deficiency in the formation of OHCs and outer supporting cells that make up the lateral compartment of the organ of Corti. These observations suggest that FGF signaling may regulate the growth or differentiation capacity of a progenitor cell that gives rise to lateral compartment cells and that medial (IHCs and inner SCs) and lateral compartment development may be controlled by distinct mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Additionally, since <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice are viable and healthy, but are congenitally deaf, <italic>FGF20</italic> is likely a candidate gene for hereditary deafness in humans. Interestingly, the <italic>FGF20</italic> gene is located on human chromosome 8p22–21.3 within the autosomal recessive non-syndromic hearing impairment locus, DFNB71 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Chishti1">[31]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Timing of FGF Signaling and Sensory Cell Differentiation</title>
        <p>To identify the developmental time when FGF20 functions to regulate lateral compartment differentiation, rescue experiments were performed in which <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> cochlea were placed in culture prior to differentiation (E13.5) and then FGF9 was added to the culture at different time points. These experiments showed that the lateral compartment differentiation defects in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic>mice could only be rescued if FGF9 was added at or before E14.5. However, treatment with FGF9 at or after E15.5 failed to rescue the phenotype of <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice. This is interesting because E14.5–15.5 corresponds to the time when sensory cell specification is completed and HC and SC differentiation begins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Kelley1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Kwan1">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The changes in the cochlear epithelium that renders it non-responsive to FGF signaling after E14.5 are not known. Possibilities include loss of FGFR1 expression, uncoupling of FGFR1 to cellular signal transduction pathways, or loss of cofactors required for ligand activation of FGFR1. In lung development, a feed forward signaling loop couples FGF9 with Wnt/β-catenin signaling and maintenance of FGFR expression. Loss of <italic>Fgf9</italic> resulted in loss of <italic>Fgfr1</italic> and <italic>Fgfr2</italic> expression and subsequent loss of responsiveness of explanted lung to exogenous FGF9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Yin1">[33]</xref>. If a similar feed forward loop functions in the inner ear prosensory epithelium, loss of FGFR expression in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice could explain the loss of responsiveness to exogenous FGF after E14.5. However, in the inner ear, FGF20 continues to be expressed in IPhCs and at low levels in PCs until early postnatal ages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This suggests that FGF20 signaling may have additional roles in cochlear development. At P0, βGal staining indicates that <italic>Fgf20</italic> is expressed at highest levels in the cochlear apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g002">Figure 2</xref>). Since differentiation of the apical cochlea is delayed in <italic>Fgf20<sup>βGal/βGal</sup></italic> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001231-g003">Figure 3</xref>), FGF20 may function at later stages of development to promote sensory cell maturation.</p>
        <p>Because damage or loss of OHCs is thought to be a major cause of sensorineural hearing loss, efforts to restore hearing in some patients with sensorineural hearing loss will require regeneration of OHCs. Understanding the changes that occur in sensory progenitor cells between E14.5 and E15.5 is important because they may provide clues about pathways required for reactivation of OHC progenitors in the adult or protecting OHCs from ototoxic damage. Although FGF20 signaling alone may not be sufficient to induce regeneration of OHCs, it may be required in combination with other signaling molecules. For example, in lung development, responsiveness of lung tissue lacking FGF9 can be restored by simultaneously treating <italic>Fgf9</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> explants with activators of Wnt/β-catenin signaling and with FGF9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Yin2">[34]</xref>.</p>

        <title>FGF Signaling and Hair Cell Regeneration</title>
        <p>The sensory epithelium of the mammalian cochlea cannot regenerate following ototoxic or noise damage; however, the avian and amphibian inner ear responds to ototoxic or noise-induced injury with a robust regenerative response that results in complete functional recovery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Stone1">[36]</xref>. The underlying mechanisms accounting for this difference in regenerative capacity are not understood. However, in principal, therapeutic reactivation of appropriate signaling pathways in the mammalian inner ear should be able to recapitulate the avian response, resulting in both functional repair and prevention of further pathology. Our observation that FGF20 functions as a permissive factor for lateral compartment differentiation suggests that FGF signaling may be a necessary factor for promoting inner ear regeneration. Additionally, zebrafish lacking FGF20 are viable and healthy, but have defects in their ability to regenerate damaged fins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001231-Whitehead1">[37]</xref>. These observations suggest that FGF signaling, and specifically FGF20 or related FGFs, may be important factors for regeneration of a variety of tissues, including the inner ear. Inducible genetic systems in the mouse and the identification of signaling pathways that interact with FGF20 will be required to test the protective or regenerative potential of FGF20 in noise or ototoxic damaged mammalian inner ear.</p>
