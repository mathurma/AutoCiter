<p>A fundamental challenge in human health is the identification of disease-causing genes. Recently, several studies have tackled this challenge via a network-based approach, motivated by the observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a network of protein-protein or functional interactions. However, most of these approaches use only local network information in the inference process and are restricted to inferring single gene associations. Here, we provide a global, network-based method for prioritizing disease genes and inferring protein complex associations, which we call PRINCE. The method is based on formulating constraints on the prioritization function that relate to its smoothness over the network and usage of prior information. We exploit this function to predict not only genes but also protein complex associations with a disease of interest. We test our method on gene-disease association data, evaluating both the prioritization achieved and the protein complexes inferred. We show that our method outperforms extant approaches in both tasks. Using data on 1,369 diseases from the OMIM knowledgebase, our method is able (in a cross validation setting) to rank the true causal gene first for 34% of the diseases, and infer 139 disease-related complexes that are highly coherent in terms of the function, expression and conservation of their member proteins. Importantly, we apply our method to study three multi-factorial diseases for which some causal genes have been found already: prostate cancer, alzheimer and type 2 diabetes mellitus. PRINCE's predictions for these diseases highly match the known literature, suggesting several novel causal genes and protein complexes for further investigation.</p>

<p>Understanding the genetic background of diseases is crucial to medical research, with implications in diagnosis, treatment and drug development. As molecular approaches to this challenge are time consuming and costly, computational approaches offer an efficient alternative. Such approaches aim at prioritizing genes in a genomic interval of interest according to their predicted strength-of-association with a given disease. State-of-the-art prioritization problems are based on the observation that genes causing similar diseases tend to lie close to one another in a network of protein-protein interactions. Here we develop a novel prioritization approach that uses the network data in a global manner and can tie not only single genes but also whole protein machineries with a given disease. Our method, PRINCE, is shown to outperform previous methods in both the gene prioritization task and the protein complex task. Applying PRINCE to prostate cancer, alzheimer's disease and type 2 diabetes, we are able to infer new causal genes and related protein complexes with high confidence.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Associating genes with diseases is a fundamental challenge in human health with applications to understanding disease mechanisms, diagnosis and therapy. Linkage studies are often used to infer genomic intervals that are associated with a disease of interest. Prioritizing genes within these intervals is a formidable challenge and computational approaches are becoming the method of choice for such problems.</p>
<p>When one or more genes were already implicated in a given disease, the prioritization task is often handled by computing the functional similarity between a given gene and the known disease genes. Such a similarity can be based on sequence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-George1">[1]</xref>, functional annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-PerezIratxeta1">[2]</xref>, protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Oti1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Franke1">[4]</xref> and more (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Oti2">[5]</xref> for a comprehensive review of these methods). When no causal genes are known, the prioritization is done by exploiting the modular view described above, comparing a candidate gene to other genes that were implicated in similar diseases.</p>
<p>Approaches in the latter category are often based on a measure of phenotypic similarity (see, e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-vanDriel1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Lage1">[7]</xref>) between the disease of interest and other diseases for which causal genes are known. This is motivated by the observation that genes causing the same or similar diseases often lie close to one another in a protein-protein interaction network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Oti1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Oti2">[5]</xref>. Lage et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Lage1">[7]</xref> score a candidate protein with respect to a disease of interest based on the involvement of its direct network neighbors in a similar disease. The protein and its high-confidence interactors are also suggested to form a putative protein complex that is related to the disease. Kohler et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Kohler1">[8]</xref> group diseases into families. For a given disease, they employ a random walk from known genes in its family to prioritize candidate genes. Finally, Wu et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Wu1">[9]</xref> score a candidate gene <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for a certain disease <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> based on the correlation between the vector of similarities of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to diseases with known causal genes, and the vector of closeness in a protein interaction network of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and those known disease genes. A recent follow-up work by Wu et al. introduces AlignPI, a method that exploits known gene-disease associations to align the phenotypic similarity network with the human PPI network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Wu2">[10]</xref>. The alignment is used to identify local dense regions of the PPI network and their associated disease clusters. The authors show the utility of their framework in causal gene prediction.</p>
<p>Most of these methods focus on prioritizing independent genes; however, in many cases, mutations at different loci could lead to the same disease. This genetic heterogeneity may reflect an underlying molecular mechanism in which the disease-causing genes form some kind of a functional module (e.g., a multi-protein complex or a signaling pathway) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Lage1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Brunner1">[11]</xref>. For example, Fanconi anemia is a heterogeneous syndrome for which seven of its causing genes are known to form a protein complex which functions in DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-DAndrea1">[12]</xref>. Thus, good prioritizations could potentially lead to the inference of larger disease-related machineries, revealing important mechanistic insights on the disease of interest.</p>
<p>While the above methods that integrate protein-protein interaction (PPI) information with a phenotypic similarity measure have been shown to outperform previous prioritization approaches, they are limited in their application. Specifically, both AlignPI and the method of Lage et al. consider only small localized regions of the PPI network and do not capture global network signals. The methods of Kohler et al. and Wu et al. tackle the prioritization task only, and do not suggest ways to reveal the protein modules that are affected in a given disease.</p>
<p>In this work we tackle both challenges. We present a novel network-based approach for predicting causal genes and protein complexes that are involved in a disease of interest. The method, which is called PRINCE (PRIoritizatioN and Complex Elucidation), generalizes the network-based approaches above by both considering the network signal in a global manner and going beyond single genes to the modules that are affected in a given disease. It receives as input a disease-disease similarity measure and a network of protein-protein interactions. It uses a propagation-based algorithm, a preliminary version of which appeared in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Vanunu1">[13]</xref>, to infer a strength-of-association scoring function that is smooth over the network (i.e., adjacent nodes are assigned similar values) and exploits the prior information on causal genes for the same disease or similar ones. This process is illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000641-g001">Figure 1</xref>. This scoring is then used in combination with a PPI network to infer protein complexes that are involved in the given disease.</p>

<p>A query disease, denoted <italic>Q</italic>, has varying degrees of phenotypic similarity with other diseases, denoted <italic>d1</italic>–<italic>d5</italic> (marked with maroon lines, where thicker lines represent higher similarity).

A scoring function that is smooth over the network is computed using an iterative network propagation method. At every iteration of the algorithm, each protein pumps flow to its neighbors and receives flow from them. Protein colors correspond to the flow they receive in a specific iteration, the darker the color the higher the flow. (A): the flow after the first iteration, representing the prior information. Only proteins <italic>p2</italic>, <italic>p4</italic> &amp; <italic>p9</italic>, which are directly associated with similar diseases, have a positive incoming flow. (B): After several iterations, the amount of flow to each node converges, and the resulting flow, used to score the proteins, appears to be smooth over the network. <italic>p5</italic> emerges as the best causal gene candidate for disease <italic>Q</italic>, as it interacts with both <italic>p2</italic> and <italic>p4</italic>.</p>

<p>We apply our method to analyze disease-gene association data from the Online Mendelian Inheritance in Man (OMIM) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Hamosh1">[14]</xref> knowledgebase. We test, in a cross-validation setting, the utility of our approach in prioritizing genes for all diseases with at least one known gene. We compare the performance of our method to two state-of-the-art, recently published methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Kohler1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Wu1">[9]</xref>. In all of our tests PRINCE outperforms the other methods by a significant margin. We then use our method to associate protein complexes with disease. The complexes that we recover are shown to be highly coherent in terms of the function, expression and conservation of their member proteins. According to these measures the collection of protein complexes we infer significantly outperforms a previous collection suggested by Lage et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Lage1">[7]</xref>, in which each complex was limited to a protein and its direct interactors. Our complete set of predictions of gene- and protein-complex associations is available in the Supplementary Material (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s010">Datasets S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s011">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s012">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>We demonstrate the power of PRINCE by studying in detail three multi-factorial diseases for which some causal genes have been mapped already: Prostate Cancer, Alzheimer Disease and Non-insulin-dependant Diabetes Mellitus (Type 2). For each disease we investigate PRINCE's top-10 predictions when considering the entire network, and when limiting the search to genomic intervals that have been associated with the disease. 69% of these predictions are validated in the literature (using independent data), leaving 18 suggestions for novel causal genes.</p>

<title>Results/Discussion</title>
<p>We designed a novel gene prioritization function, which integrates protein-protein interaction (PPI) information with a disease similarity metric to score the strength-of-association of proteins with a disease of interest. The scoring is designed to be smooth over the PPI network, meaning that adjacent nodes are assigned with similar values, and to exploit prior information on the involvement of proteins in the same or similar diseases. As further detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref> section, the scoring is done by simulating an iterative process where proteins for which prior information exist, pump flow to their network neighbors. In addition, every protein propagates the flow received in the previous iteration to its neighbors. The final score of each protein is determined by the amount of flow it has, which is guaranteed to converge.</p>
<sec id="s2a">
<title>Comparison to other methods</title>
<p>In order to perform a comprehensive comparison of our approach to extant ones on the same input data, we reimplemented two state-of-the-art global approaches for gene prioritization introduced earlier: the random-walk based method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Kohler1">[8]</xref> and the Cipher algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Wu1">[9]</xref>. We could not reimplement the method of Lage et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Lage1">[7]</xref>, as it has many parameters that had to be returned to fit our data, and a code for this method was not readily available.</p>
<p>To evaluate the performance of the different methods, we used a leave-one-out cross validation procedure. In each cross-validation trial, we removed a single disease-protein association from the data, and each algorithm was evaluated by its success in reconstructing the hidden association, i.e., by the rank it assigned to a protein when querying the disease it is associated with (for further details on the cross-validation process see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). To simulate the case of prioritizing proteins encoded by genes inside a linkage interval, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Kohler1">[8]</xref> and artificially constructed for each protein associated with a disease an interval of size 100 around it. We evaluated the performance of an algorithm in terms of overall precision versus recall when varying the rank threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. <italic>Precision</italic> is the fraction of true gene-disease associations that ranked within the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the corresponding trial of the cross validation procedure. <italic>Recall</italic> is the fraction of trials in which the hidden association was recovered as one of the top <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scoring ones.</p>
<p>We tested our method on all 1,369 diseases with a known causal gene in the OMIM database. The results of applying the different methods are depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000641-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Our algorithm achieved the best performance, ranking the correct gene as the top-scoring one in 34% of the cases. Random-walk and Cipher methods achieved inferior results with 28.8% and 24.7% success rates, respectively. This trend was maintained when performing 2-fold, 5-fold and 10-fold cross validation (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Interestingly, even though our score does not directly indicate the probability of a successful prediction, we noticed a significant difference in the score distribution of top-1 correct predictions and top-1 incorrect prediction in the cross validation setting (see Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Namely, about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of our correct top-1 predictions received a score higher than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas about <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of our incorrect top-1 predictions received a score lower than that value. In the top-1 case, if all of the predictions with a score lower than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are discarded, PRINCE's precision is boosted to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas the recall decreases to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To further validate the predicted associations, we collected recently published gene-disease associations that were not part of our original data set. We obtained 51 new associations for 47 diseases with previously known causal genes, and 10 new associations for diseases where the causal gene was unknown at the time of the original data collection. On the first association set, PRINCE ranked one of the newly associated genes as the top scoring one in 20 of the 47 diseases (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). On this set, PRINCE significantly outperforms CIPHER and compares favorably to Random Walk (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s003">Figure S3</xref>), providing higher precision and recall for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. On the second association set, PRINCE ranked the newly associated gene as the top scoring one in two of the ten diseases, and ranked the true causal gene higher than or equal to the other methods in four additional cases, thus providing the best average ranking (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s007">Table S1</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2b">
<title>Inferring novel causal genes for Prostate Cancer, Alzheimer and Diabetes</title>
<p>Having validated our method, we proceeded to execute our algorithm on specific multifactorial diseases that are linked to multiple genomic regions. We selected Prostate Cancer (MIM: 176807), Alzheimer's disease (MIM: 104300) and Diabetes Mellitus, type 2 (MIM: 125853) as our three case studies. We ranked candidate genes both over the entire PPI network, and over genomic intervals to which the phenotype has been mapped but no causal gene was identified, and analyzed our top-10 predictions in each case (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s008">Table S2</xref>).</p>
<p>We checked whether our predicted genes were already found to be involved with their query disease by searching online databases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Hamosh1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Becker1">[16]</xref> and scientific publications. In all of the three test cases, the vast majority of top candidate genes over the entire network were already known to be involved with the disease. These often included the ‘usual suspects’ for the relevant disease family. For example, the top predictions for Prostate Cancer included <italic>BRCA1</italic>, <italic>TP53</italic> and <italic>NBN</italic>, which are tumor suppressors involved in several types of cancer. Over half of the top candidates from the associated intervals were already implicated in the corresponding diseases. Our ranking provides further support for their involvement in the investigated diseases. In addition, PRINCE yields several top scoring candidates that were not previously associated with these diseases, providing viable candidates for further research.</p>
<p>Going beyond the above three test cases, we applied our algorithm to all 916 disorders in OMIM with an associated interval and for which no causal gene is known. The complete set of results is provided in the Supplementary Material (Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s010">Datasets S1</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>Associating protein complexes with disease</title>
<p>Often, as alluded to above, mutations in multiple proteins that form a protein complex or a pathway may lead to the same disease. Thus, we sought to exploit the prioritization function we have developed for the complex inference task. To this end, starting with the set of proteins whose prioritization score is above a threshold, we look for densely connected subsets that may form a protein complex. The search is aided by a likelihood-based scoring of protein complexes that takes into account the reliability of the PPI interactions and the degrees of the network proteins (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). As we show in Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s005">S5</xref>, this score correlates well with the coherency of the identified complexes (see below). Applying this scheme to the OMIM diseases we predicted 566 complexes for diseases in which a causal gene is known and 137 complexes for diseases for which only an associated genomic interval is known.</p>
<p>To test the biological plausibility of the identified complexes we evaluated their coherency with respect to several attributes of their member proteins (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). These measures quantify the extent to which proteins in a complex share the same functional annotation, have similar expression patterns under multiple conditions, and have similar phylogenetic profiles, respectively. As a baseline, we compared these measures with those computed for: (i) a set of manually annotated protein complexes obtained from the Gene Ontology (GO) annotation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-TheGeneOntologyConsortium1">[17]</xref>; (ii) a set of protein clusters that are not necessarily disease-related, obtained by applying the MCL algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Enright1">[18]</xref> to the PPI network; and (iii) a set of predicted disease-related complexes (Lage et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Lage1">[7]</xref>)(<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>).</p>
<p>To allow a fair comparison between our results and those of Lage et al., we focused on a subset of the identified complexes of the same size as that provided by Lage et al. (80 for the case of a known causal gene, and 59 for the case of a known locus; <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Methods</xref>). The subset was constructed by computing the likelihood score of each complex and choosing the highest ranking complexes.</p>
<p>We found that the complexes predicted using our propagation approach exhibited higher coherencies than the collection of Lage et al. with respect to most measures (with the exception of conservation coherency in the known-locus case). Notably, both our collection and that of Lage et al. outperformed the PPI-based collection produced by MCL, demonstrating the importance of the disease association data in the protein complex inference process. Moreover, our results were comparable to, and in some cases better than, the manually curated collection, again testifying to its high quality. These results are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000641-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>As a further validation of the complexes inferred by PRINCE, we searched OMIM for evidence for the possible involvement of the proteins of a complex in the diseases associated with it. Specifically, for each complex, we scanned the OMIM entries of the diseases associated with at least one complex member. For each such disease, we checked whether any complex member that is not known to be associated with that disease, is mentioned in its entry. We found such support for 61% of the predicted complexes, with an average of 3.6 genes per complex whose involvement was corroborated in this manner. For comparison purpose, we permuted the gene names and repeated the analysis on the resulting random complexes. Only 7% of these random sets were supported by OMIM, with an average of 1.6 evidences per set.</p>
<p>Three example putative protein complexes and their associated diseases are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000641-g003">Figure 3</xref>. The first putative protein complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000641-g003">Figure 3(a)</xref>) was generated for the query disease Ataxia-Telangiectasia (MIM:208900), which is associated with the gene <italic>ATM</italic>. The putative complex contains 11 proteins which are all known to be involved in response to DNA damage stimulus. Except for <italic>CHEK2</italic>, all of them are directly involved in DNA repair. All 7 diseases associated to those genes (among them are Breast Cancer, Li-Fraumeni syndrome and Fanconi Anemia) are known to be tightly coupled with mutations in DNA-repair related genes. In this specific case it may be that these proteins do not form a single complex in-vivo, but rather span a dense region of the PPI network due to their central role as master regulators (especially ATM and TP53) of reactions to DNA damage.</p>

<p>The second complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000641-g003">Figure 3(b)</xref>) was generated for the query disease Hereditary Prostate Cancer type 8 (HPC8, MIM:602759), for which the causal gene is presently unknown. The complex's proteins are associated with several Colorectal Cancer variants and Endometrial cancer. The genes associated with the Colorectal and Endometrial cancers are from the <italic>MLH</italic> (MutL analog) and <italic>PMS</italic> families which are involved in DNA mismatch repair. <italic>MLH1</italic> and <italic>PMS2</italic> form a Heterodimer, which interacts via <italic>MLH1</italic> with <italic>EXO1</italic> (Exonuclease1), which also participates in DNA mismatch repair. The gene coding for <italic>EXO1</italic> is located at genetic locus 1q43, which lies within the region associated with HPC8 (1q42.2–q43). Moreover, <italic>EXO1</italic> was ranked first by PRINCE in this interval. In this case, the inferred protein complex provides support also to the prediction that <italic>EXO1</italic> is a causal gene for prostate cancer (MIM: 176807) discussed in the previous subsection.</p>
<p>The last complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000641-g003">Figure 3(c)</xref>) was generated for the query disease Microcephalic Osteodysplatic Primordial Dwarfism (MOPD-I, MIM:210710), which has no known causal genes. Two of the predicted complex's genes are associated with two hereditary diseases characterized by developmental delay and physical deformations: <italic>ERCC5</italic> with Cockayne Syndrome type A, and <italic>ERCC2</italic> with Cerebrooculofacioskeletal Syndrome 1. The genes in the complex are all involved in DNA damage repair: <italic>ERCC2</italic>, <italic>ERCC3</italic>, <italic>GTF2H1</italic> and <italic>GTF2H2</italic> are subunits of the core-TFIIH basal Transcription Factor, and <italic>ERCC5</italic> forms a stable complex with TFIIH enabling recruitment of the Transcription Factor for repairing UV damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Thorel1">[19]</xref>. <italic>ERCC3</italic>, one of the predicted complex's members, lies within the genetic locus associated with MOPD-I, and is ranked as the best causal gene candidate for MOPD-I among the genes at that locus by PRINCE.</p>

<title>Conclusions</title>
<p>PRINCE is a powerful method for prioritizing genes and protein complexes for a disease of interest. We have demonstrated its power both in a cross validation setting and by closely examining its predictions over complex, polygenic hereditary diseases. Key to its successful application is its global network approach, combined with a novel normalization of protein-protein interaction weights and disease-disease similarities.</p>
<p>While the results of PRINCE are promising, several of its limitations should be acknowledged. First, PRINCE relies on prior phenotypic information, which limits its application to diseases that are phenotypically similar to diseases with known causal genes. Second, PRINCE uses known gene-disease associations in its computation, but other relevant data, such as genes that are differentially expressed in the disease state, are not taken into account. Combining such data into the prioritization process, e.g., using the method of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Karni1">[20]</xref>, could increase the prediction power. Last, PRINCE depends on accurate and comprehensive protein-protein interaction data. As such data accumulate, the applicability and accuracy of PRINCE are expected to grow.</p>

<title>Computing the prioritization function</title>
<p>The input to a gene prioritization problem consists of a set <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of gene-disease associations; a query disease <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; and a protein-protein interaction network <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the set of proteins, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the set of interactions and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a weight function denoting the reliability of each interaction.

<p>Intuitively, we wish to compute a function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that is both smooth over the network, i.e., adjacent nodes are assigned with similar values, and also respects the prior knowledge, i.e., nodes for which prior information exists should have similar values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Formally, we express the requirements on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as a combination of these two conditions:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e041" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a normalized form of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (described below).

<p>The requirements on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> can be expressed in linear form as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e046" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> matrix whose values are given by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are viewed here as vectors of size <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We require the eigenvalues of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the eigenvalues of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are positive and, hence, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> exists.</p>
<p>While the above linear system can be solved exactly, for large networks an iterative propagation-based algorithm works faster and is guaranteed to converge to the system's solution. Specifically, we use the algorithm of Zhou et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Zhou1">[21]</xref> which at iteration <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> computes<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This iterative algorithm can be best understood as simulating a process where nodes for which prior information exists pump information to their neighbors. In addition, every node propagates the information received in the previous iteration to its neighbors.</p>
<p>We chose to normalize the weight of an edge by the degrees of its end-points, since the latter relate to the probability of observing an edge between the same end-points in a random network with the same node degrees. Formally, define a diagonal matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> such that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e062" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the sum of row <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e063" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e064" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We set <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e065" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> which yields a symmetric matrix where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e066" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Note that <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is similar to the stochastic matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Since similar matrices have the same eigenvalues, and since a stochastic matrix's eigenvalues are in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (according to the Perron-Frobenius theorem), the eigenvalues of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are indeed in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

This metric spans <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> diseases in the OMIM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Hamosh1">[14]</xref> knowledgebase and is based on their medical subject headings description.</p>
<p>van Driel et al. tested the predictive power of different ranges of similarity values by calculating the correlation between the similarity of two diseases and the functional relatedness of their causal genes. According to their analysis, similarity values in the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are not informative, while for similarities in the range <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the associated genes show significant functional similarity.</p>
<p>These empirical findings motivated us to represent our confidence that two diseases are related using a logistic function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, such that for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e077" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e078" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e079" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e080" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The interactions were assigned confidence scores based on the experimental evidence available for each interaction using a logistic regression model adapted from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Sharan1">[26]</xref>. We used the obtained scores to construct the adjacency matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
<p>To simulate the case of prioritizing proteins encoded by genes inside a linkage interval, we followed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Kohler1">[8]</xref> and artificially constructed for each protein associated with a disease an interval of size 100 around it. We used the protein scores obtained from the output of the algorithm to prioritize proteins residing in that interval.</p>
<p>To evaluate the performance of the different methods in predicting gene-disease association, we used a leave-one-out cross validation procedure. In each cross-validation trial, we removed a single disease-protein association <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the data, and in addition all other disease-protein associations involving protein <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

<title>Parameter tuning for gene prioritization</title>
<p>Our algorithm has three parameters that should be tuned: (i) <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> – the parameter controlling the logistic regression transformation; (ii) <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> – controlling the relative importance of prior information in the association assignment; and (iii) the number of propagation iterations employed. We tested the effect of these parameters on the performance of the algorithm in a cross validation setting. The precision-recall plots for the general disease case are depicted in Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s006">Figure S6</xref>. By this figure, the optimal regression coefficient is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, implying that similarity values below 0.3 are assigned with very low probability (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), in accordance with the analysis of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-vanDriel1">[6]</xref>.

<title>Implementation of random-walk and Cipher</title>
<p>The random-walk based approach requires disease grouping information. To allow it to run on the more comprehensive disease similarity data we had, we generalized the approach to use these similarities (transformed by the logistic function <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) as initial probabilities for the random walk. The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the method, which controls the probability for a restart, as well as our transformation parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, were optimized using cross-validation (as in the Parameter Tuning Section above). Note that Kohler et al. suggested a second, diffusion-kernel based approach, which was shown to be inferior to the random walk one, hence we did not include it in our comparison. Also note that our propagation-based method reduces to a random walk under appropriate transformations of the edge weights and prior information.</p>
<p>The Cipher method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Wu1">[9]</xref> is based on computing protein closeness in a PPI network. Two variants of the algorithm were suggested: Cipher-DN, which considers only direct neighbors in the closeness computation, and Cipher-SP, which is based on a shortest path computation. The former was shown to outperform the latter, and hence we implemented this variant (Cipher-DN) only.</p>

<title>Identifying protein complexes</title>
<p>Given a disease and a prioritization score for all the network proteins, we aim at inferring densely connected protein complexes that contain high scoring proteins. To this end, we start with the top 100 scoring proteins within the entire network as complex seeds (The method is not sensitive to the number of initial top scoring proteins, and produces similar results for numbers in the range 50–150; data not shown). We filter all seeds whose score is below a prespecified threshold <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or that were already associated with the disease in a previously detected complex. To each seed we iteratively add a neighboring protein with the highest score, as long as this score is greater than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and up to 20 proteins per seed (about twice the average size of known protein complexes; a similar bound was used in previous works <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Sharan1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Sharan2">[27]</xref>). At this stage, in the case that the query disease has no known gene, but has an interval associated to it, the computed complex is discarded if it contains no member from that interval.</p>
<p>After an initial list of putative complexes is formed, a refinement phase takes place where proteins are removed from a putative complex to ensure that not only is the suggested complex disease-related but also its member proteins are densely interacting and, thus, constitute a good candidate for a complex. To this end, we use the following likelihood-based scoring scheme taken from <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Sharan3">[28]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a putative complex and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are its edges. Briefly, the score is the log likelihood ratio between a protein complex model (assuming that every two proteins in a complex should interact with a high probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, independently of all other pairs) and a random set model (where connections in the sub-network arise at random, with a probability proportional to the proteins' degrees). This score was further enhanced, as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000641-Sharan3">[28]</xref> to accommodate for information on the reliability of interactions. In brief, the interaction status of every protein pair was treated as a noisy observation, and its reliability was combined into the likelihood score. The <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter of the scoring scheme was set to 0.9, although results were not sensitive to the actual parameter used as shown in Suppl. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000641.s009">Table S3</xref>.</p>
<p>At each refinement step, we search for a protein whose removal increases the score the most while maintaining the connectivity of the candidate complex. The refinement is done until no score increase is possible (while maintaining connectivity). We filter candidate complexes with less than four proteins (to ensure statistical significance) or with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> overlap with higher-scoring candidates.</p>
<p>For identifying complexes we use the same <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values we used for prioritization, which were tuned using cross-validation. An additional parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, is used as a threshold that defines the minimal score (computed using propagation) needed for a protein to be included in any identified complex. This parameter was tuned separately for the case in which a causal gene for the query disease is known and for the case that no causal gene is unknown. The tuning aimed to obtain a collection of complexes whose average size is similar to that of the manually curated GO complexes (8.85 after filtering complexes with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The resulting value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000641.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 0.1 (average size of 8.3) for the case where a causal gene is known, and 0.015 (average size of 8.5) for the case where no causal gene is known.</p>
