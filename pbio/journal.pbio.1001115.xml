        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Natural selection typically favors only those genetic variants that increase the overall fitness of the organism. Occasionally, however, variants arise that are able to increase their representation in future generations, while simultaneously reducing the fertility or fecundity of their hosts. Although such variants occur in a wide variety of taxa, their genetic bases and molecular mechanisms remain poorly understood. Here we demonstrate that one such variant in the roundworm <italic>C. elegans</italic> is composed of two adjacent genes: a sperm-delivered toxin and an embryo-expressed antidote. The toxin protein is expressed in sperm and delivered to the embryo upon fertilization. In the presence of the toxin, embryos that don't inherit the antidote gene die during late embryogenesis, whereas those that do develop normally. Both the toxin and the antidote genes encode transmembrane proteins, and both are evolutionarily novel. Our results imply that the tight physical linkage between these two novel genes has facilitated their evolution into a co-adapted gene complex capable of promoting its own transmission to the detriment of host fitness.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The evolutionary fate of an allele ordinarily depends on the reproductive fitness of the organisms carrying it. In some cases, however, alleles are able to increase their representation in future generations while being neutral or detrimental to the fitness of their bearers. These elements, sometimes termed “selfish” or “parasitic” genes, influence transmission probabilities in a variety of ways. Some self-replicate and insert themselves into new genomic locations (e.g., transposons) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Hurst1">[1]</xref>. Others act during meiosis to preferentially segregate into the oocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Dawe1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-PardoManueldeVillena1">[4]</xref> or to reduce the viability of sperm or spores inheriting alternate alleles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Jaenike1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Turner1">[8]</xref>. Still others act at the level of the zygote to destroy progeny not inheriting them. <italic>Medea</italic>-factors in <italic>Tribolium</italic> destroy non-carrier animals through a combination of maternal-effect killing and zygotic self-rescue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Lorenzen1">[9]</xref>. An analogous phenomenon occurs in organisms infected by the maternally transmitted bacteria, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> or <italic>Cardinium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Serbus1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Hunter1">[12]</xref>, which modify the sperm of infected males to cause lethal defects when paired with the oocytes of uninfected females.</p>
      <p>Previously, we discovered a nuclear-encoded element in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> that kills non-carrier animals in a novel way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. This element, referred to as the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element, is polymorphic within the species, and when animals carrying the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element are crossed to animals lacking it, the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element acts in the F1 heterozygote via paternal effect to kill F2 or backcross embryos not inheriting it. This lethality acts independently of maternal genotype and causes the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element to become over-represented among the viable progeny of heterozygous sires, even while incurring a substantial fitness cost to these animals.</p>
      <p>Paternal-effect loci are extremely rare in all of biology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Browning1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Fitch1">[15]</xref>, and the observed combination of nuclear-encoded, paternal-effect killing and zygotic self-rescue is unprecedented. In <italic>C. elegans</italic>, moreover, a paternal-effect locus whose effects can be rescued zygotically is mechanistically surprising because in this species, sperm-supplied factors are thought to act only during fertilization and first cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-LHernault1">[16]</xref>, whereas zygotic transcription does not begin until the four-cell stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seydoux1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Although the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element is capable of promoting its own transmission, it rarely has the opportunity to do so in natural populations. <italic>C. elegans</italic> is an androdioecious species that reproduces primarily through self-fertilizing hermaphrodites. Because inbreeding is high <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Barriere1">[18]</xref>, the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element normally exists in the homozygous state, where no opportunity for self-promotion exists.</p>
      <p>High inbreeding notwithstanding, out-crossing events in <italic>C. elegans</italic> between hermaphrodites and males do occur, albeit rarely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Barriere1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Rockman1">[20]</xref>. And because the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element is globally distributed and confers no apparent fitness disadvantage in the homozygous state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, this element is expected to drive itself to fixation faster than a neutrally evolving locus. Consistent with this prediction, in laboratory populations where out-crossing is forced, the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element fixes rapidly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. In natural populations, however, the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element has remained polymorphic for an estimated 8 million generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, much longer than expected under neutrality. One likely explanation for this paradox is that the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element is tightly linked to a polymorphism maintained by balancing selection, and the tightness of this linkage maintains the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element in the polymorphic state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Given the unusual genetics of the <italic>peel-1</italic>/<italic>zeel-1</italic> element, we sought to understand its mechanism of action. We previously identified one component of the <italic>peel-1/zee1-1</italic> element as the gene <italic>zeel-1</italic> (<italic>Y39G10AR.5</italic>), which acts zygotically to rescue the paternal-effect killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. Here we demonstrate that <italic>zeel-1</italic> is fully separable from the paternal-effect killing, and that this killing activity is encoded by a second gene, <italic>peel-1</italic> (<italic>Y39G10AR.25</italic>). We show that PEEL-1 acts as a sperm-supplied toxin, and ZEEL-1 an embryo-expressed antidote. We characterize the developmental defects caused by sperm-supplied PEEL-1, and we report a dose-dependent relationship between the severity of these defects and the quantity of PEEL-1 delivered to the embryo. We analyze the phylogenetic origins and functionality of each domain of <italic>zeel-1</italic>, and we test the tissue-autonomy of <italic>zeel-1</italic> rescue. Finally, in order to determine whether <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> can function outside of embryogenesis, we express both genes ectopically in adults.</p>

        <title><italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> Are Genetically Distinct</title>
        <p>The genetics of the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element are consistent with it being composed of two interacting loci: a dominant-lethal, paternal-effect “toxin,” <italic>peel-1</italic>, and a zygotically acting “antidote,” <italic>zeel-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. The activities of <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> are present in the reference strain, Bristol (N2), and in approximately two-thirds of wild isolates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. These strains are said to carry the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element. The commonly used wild strain, collected from Hawaii (CB4856), and all but two of the additional wild strains lack the activities of both <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. The two remaining strains, one collected from Germany (MY19) and one collected from Utah (EG4348), exhibit the activity of <italic>zeel-1</italic> but are unable to induce the paternal-effect killing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s001">Figure S1A</xref>).</p>
        <p>We previously mapped the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element in the Bristol strain to a 62 kb interval on the left arm of chromosome I <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. Within this interval, we identified a single gene capable of providing antidote activity. This gene, which we named <italic>zeel-1</italic>, encodes a 917-amino acid protein whose <italic>N</italic>-terminus is predicted to form a six-pass transmembrane domain and whose <italic>C</italic>-terminus exhibits sequence similarity to ZYG-11, a substrate-recognition subunit of an E3 ubiquitin ligase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Vasudevan1">[21]</xref>. The Hawaii strain carries a 19 kb deficiency (<italic>niDf9</italic>) spanning <italic>zeel-1</italic>, and this deficiency is shared by all other wild isolates lacking the activities of both <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. This deficiency is not shared by wild strains carrying the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element, nor by MY19 or EG4348 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, unpublished data).</p>
        <p>The phenotype of MY19 and EG4348 demonstrates that the <italic>zeel-1</italic> gene is not sufficient for <italic>peel-1</italic> activity. Conversely, a deletion allele of <italic>zeel-1</italic> in the Bristol background demonstrates that <italic>zeel-1</italic> is also not required for it. This deletion, <italic>tm3419</italic>, removes 221 base pairs spanning the start codon of <italic>zeel-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). As expected, this deletion abolishes antidote activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s001">Figure S1B</xref>); however, this deletion does not abolish the paternal-effect killing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s001">1B</xref>). <italic>zeel-1</italic> is therefore genetically separable from a second, paternal-effect locus, <italic>peel-1</italic>. As a consequence of this separability, <italic>zeel-1</italic> deletions in the Bristol and Hawaii backgrounds have opposite phenotypic effects: The <italic>niDf9</italic> deficiency is perfectly viable, whereas the <italic>tm3419</italic> deletion behaves as a conventional recessive-lethal mutation.</p>

To test for <italic>peel-1</italic> activity, transgenic animals were crossed to the Hawaii strain, and embryo lethality was scored from self-fertilizing F1 hermaphrodites (self-cross) and F1 males backcrossed to Hawaii hermaphrodites (backcross). Nine independent extra-chromosomal arrays and five independent single-copy genomic insertions were tested. For each array or insertion, 200 to 650 embryos were scored per self-cross or backcross. Ten control replicates were performed in parallel, each including 200 to 400 embryos. The global mean of these replicates is shown by the “no transgene” bars, and lethality for each individual replicate was less than 1.5%.

        <title><italic>peel-1</italic> Encodes a Novel, Four-Pass Transmembrane Protein of Unknown Function</title>
        <p>In MY19 and EG4348, absence of <italic>peel-1</italic> activity is tightly linked to the 62 kb <italic>peel-1</italic> interval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s001">Figure S1C</xref>), suggesting that these strains carry loss-of-function alleles of <italic>peel-1</italic>, rather than extra-genic suppressors. In addition, sequence analysis of the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval in MY19 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref> and EG4348 (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) indicates that absence of <italic>peel-1</italic> activity in these strains is not caused by recombination breaking apart the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element. We hypothesized, therefore, that MY19 and EG4348 carry secondary, loss-of-function mutations in <italic>peel-1</italic> We reasoned that by identifying these mutations, we would be able to identify <italic>peel-1</italic> itself.</p>
        <p>To accomplish this goal, we crossed MY19 and EG4348 to a strain of the Bristol background and generated recombinant chromosomes across the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval. Using these recombinants, we mapped the causative mutations in MY19 and EG4348 to regions of less than 10 kb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We then sequenced these regions to identify all sequence changes relative to Bristol. After excluding those sequence changes shared by one or more wild strains having intact <italic>peel-1</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s002">Figure S2</xref>), we defined six candidate mutations in MY19 and a single candidate mutation in EG4348.</p>
        <p>The candidate mutations in MY19 and EG4348 reside in the intergenic interval immediately downstream of <italic>zeel-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). We searched for genes in this interval using targeted RT-PCR on Bristol animals, and we discovered a previously unannotated transcript. This transcript encodes a 174-amino acid protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1A,D</xref>), and three observations confirm this gene to be <italic>peel-1</italic>. First, the single candidate mutation in EG4348 and one of the candidate mutations in MY19 produce nonsense mutations in this transcript, consistent with the phenotype of these strains (frameshift in MY19; glycine to stop codon in EG4348) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1A,D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Second, this gene resides within the 19 kb deficiency carried by the Hawaii strain and in all other wild isolates lacking the activities of both <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). Third, when we expressed the Bristol allele of this gene transgenically in a strain carrying the nonsense mutation found in EG4348, <italic>peel-1</italic> activity was restored (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1B–C</xref>).</p>
        <p>PEEL-1 is a hydrophobic protein containing four predicted transmembrane helices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Neither the peptide nor the nucleotide sequence of <italic>peel-1</italic> has any detectable sequence similarity to any other gene in <italic>C. elegans</italic> or in the GenBank sequence database. Although <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> are located adjacent to one another in the genome and oriented in the same direction, we were unable to recover transcripts carrying both genes (unpublished data), demonstrating that <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> are not isoforms of a single transcript or cistrons in an operon. We conclude that the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element is composed of a 19 kb insertion carrying two distinct genes: <italic>peel-1</italic>, which kills embryos via paternal-effect, and <italic>zeel-1</italic>, which acts zygotically to rescue this lethality.</p>
        <p>Henceforth we refer to the Bristol alleles of <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> as <italic>peel-1(+)</italic> and <italic>zeel-1(+)</italic> and the Hawaii alleles as <italic>peel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)</italic> and <italic>zeel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)</italic>. We use the term “<italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos” to refer to <italic>zeel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)</italic> embryos fathered by a <italic>peel-1(+)</italic> animal.</p>

        <title><italic>peel-1</italic> Is Expressed in Spermatocytes, and the Protein Localizes to Fibrous Body-Membranous Organelles</title>
        <p>As expected for a paternal-effect gene, <italic>peel-1</italic> is expressed exclusively in sperm. In both males and hermaphrodites, a GFP reporter driven by the <italic>peel-1</italic> promoter was expressed strongly in spermatocytes but not in any other tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In <italic>fem-1(ts)</italic> mutants, which lack sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Nelson1">[22]</xref>, <italic>peel-1</italic> expression via quantitative RT-PCR was undetectable in hermaphrodites and over 100-fold reduced in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Residual expression in males probably reflects incomplete penetrance of the <italic>fem-1(ts)</italic> allele, because <italic>fem-1(ts)</italic> males occasionally produce a small number of sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Nelson1">[22]</xref>, and another sperm-specific gene, <italic>spe-9</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Singson1">[23]</xref>, also showed residual expression in males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g002">Figure 2C</xref>).</p>

        <p>The sperm-specific expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> suggested that the paternal-effect killing occurs through delivery to the embryo of either sperm-supplied <italic>peel-1</italic> transcripts or sperm-supplied PEEL-1 protein. To distinguish between the two, we searched for <italic>peel-1</italic> transcripts in mature sperm via single-molecule fluorescence in situ hybridization (FISH). <italic>peel-1</italic> transcripts were observed in spermatocytes but not in mature sperm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s003">Figure S3</xref>), thus excluding such transcripts as the likely mediators of <italic>peel-1</italic> toxicity.</p>
        <p>Next, we searched for PEEL-1 protein both by tagging PEEL-1 with GFP and by staining sperm with an antibody raised against the <italic>C</italic>-terminal 15 amino acids of PEEL-1. Both experiments demonstrate that PEEL-1 protein is packaged into sperm, and this packaging is mediated by localization of PEEL-1 to sperm-specific vesicles called fibrous body-membranous organelles (FB-MOs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). PEEL-1::GFP was visible in mature sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3E–F</xref>), and at each stage of spermatogenesis, its localization matched the pattern expected for a protein located in the membranes of FB-MOs: In early spermatocytes, PEEL-1::GFP localized to cytoplasmic puncta (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), but after the pachytene stage, these puncta dissociated into a mesh-like web (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3B–D</xref>); after the completion of spermatogenesis, PEEL-1::GFP re-condensed into puncta located at the spermatid cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3E</xref>); and after sperm activation, these puncta localized opposite the newly formed pseudopod (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). This localization pattern was replicated by the anti-PEEL-1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3G</xref>), and staining with this antibody overlapped perfectly with a marker of FB-MOs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">Figure 3H–I</xref>).</p>

FB-MOs develop in pachytene spermatocytes as membrane-bound organelles having a head region separated by a collar-like constriction from a set of membrane folds (lower panel; red). As spermatogenesis proceeds, the membrane folds grow and extend into arm-like protrusions, enveloping bundles of polymerized Major Sperm Protein, referred to as fibrous bodies (hatched region). Coincident with budding of spermatids from the residual body, the membrane folds of FB-MOs retract, and the fibrous bodies depolymerize into the cytoplasm. The FB-free MOs then move to a position just inside the plasma membrane, and upon sperm activation, they fuse with the plasma membrane opposite the pseudopod.

        <p>We also discovered that the leader peptide of PEEL-1 can act as a sperm-localization signal. Our <italic>Ppeel-1::GFP</italic> reporter, which expressed untagged GFP, showed diffuse localization in spermatocytes and was excluded from sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). This exclusion was not surprising because GFP is a heterologous protein, and trafficking of cellular components into sperm is tightly regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-LHernault1">[16]</xref>. Nevertheless, when we tagged GFP with the <italic>N</italic>-terminal 12 amino acids of PEEL-1 (MRFDFQNLKFSM), its localization changed dramatically. The tagged version of GFP localized to a reticulated structure within spermatocytes, and this structure was trafficked into sperm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). To our knowledge, this result represents the first identification of a sperm localization signal in <italic>C. elegans</italic>.</p>

        <p>The defects observed in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos indicate severe malfunction of muscle and epidermal tissue. The phenotype of paralysis and 2-fold arrest is characteristic of a complete absence of the function of body-wall muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Moerman1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Williams1">[25]</xref>. The shape changes observed after the 2-fold arrest indicate detachment of body-wall muscle fibers from the overlying epidermis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Bosher1">[26]</xref>. Epidermal leakage and distention of the excretory cell, the only epidermal cell located in the interior of the animal, indicate further deterioration of both external and internal epidermis. These four defects—paralysis and 2-fold arrest, muscle-epidermal detachment, epidermal leakage, and excretory cell distention—are not known to occur as side-effects of one another <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Williams1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Labouesse1">[27]</xref>, suggesting that sperm-supplied PEEL-1 may affect each tissue independently.</p>
        <p>Paralysis and 2-fold arrest have only two known causes: defective sarcomere assembly and lack of muscle contraction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Moerman1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Williams1">[25]</xref>. To distinguish between the two, we examined (<italic>i</italic>) the localization of perlecan, a basement membrane protein required for sarcomere recruitment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Williams1">[25]</xref>, and (<italic>ii</italic>) the structure of actin and myosin myofilaments, which assemble downstream of all other sarcomere proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Moerman1">[24]</xref>. In <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos, perlecan localized normally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g004">Figure 4I–J</xref>). Likewise, actin and myosin filaments assembled correctly, except for slight abnormalities in regions of muscle detachment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g004">Figure 4K–N</xref>). We conclude that in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos, the phenotype of paralysis and 2-fold arrest results from a defect in muscle contraction, not sarcomere assembly.</p>
        <p>Next, to determine the cause of muscle-epidermal detachment, we examined trans-epidermal attachments, the specialized structures that span the epidermal syncytium and anchor it to underlying muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Labouesse1">[27]</xref>. A weakening of these structures is known to cause muscle-epidermal detachment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Chisholm1">[28]</xref>, and consistent with this causality, in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos these structures were highly disorganized. As visualized by VAB-10A and intermediate filaments, trans-epidermal attachments did not organize into evenly spaced, circumferentially oriented bands. Instead, these bands were clumpy, disordered, and non-uniform in width (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g004">Figure 4O–R</xref>). This disorganization occurred even in areas where muscles remained attached, suggesting it to be the cause of muscle detachment, rather than an effect of it. In addition, in areas of highest stress, such as the mid-embryo bend, staining in post-arrest embryos (but not pre-arrest embryos) was often absent altogether (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g004">Figure 4P</xref>). This absence implies that trans-epidermal attachments in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos are so weak that in areas of highest stress, they rupture entirely.</p>

        <p>Although the majority of <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos display the aforementioned defects in muscle and epidermal tissue, the severity of these defects is variable and depends on the sex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref> and age of the sperm parent. Male-sired embryos always arrest paralyzed at the 2-fold stage, always exhibit epidermal leakage, and never hatch (<italic>n</italic>&gt;2,000).

The results for 10 randomly selected broods are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s004">Figure S4</xref>. To generate embryos sired by partially mated animals, 130 hermaphrodites were briefly mated to males following the L4 molt, and embryos were collected during days 3 to 5 from the 35 hermaphrodites that produced a mixture of self- and cross-progeny. Self- and cross-progeny were distinguished by the use of an integrated GFP marker carried by the male, and cross-progeny were excluded from analysis. χ<sup>2</sup> tests were used to compare the unmated and partially mated <italic>“3–5d”</italic> age classes, as well as all pair-wise combinations of age classes within the unmated experiment. <italic>n/s</italic>, <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05. * and all unlabeled pairs within the unmated experiment, <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>.

        <p>One explanation for the decreased phenotypic severity of hermaphrodite- versus male-sired embryos is PEEL-1 dosage. Male sperm are up to 5-fold larger than hermaphrodite sperm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-LaMunyon1">[29]</xref>, and as such, they may deliver more PEEL-1 protein to the embryo. In support of this hypothesis, we were able to alter the phenotype of <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos, independent of sperm origin, by varying <italic>peel-1</italic> dosage. Among hermaphrodite-sired embryos, doubling <italic>peel-1</italic> copy number resulted in earlier onset of epidermal leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Among male-sired embryos, expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> exclusively from extra-chromosomal arrays, which are subject to germline silencing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Kelly1">[30]</xref>, had the opposite effect. For three of the <italic>peel-1</italic> arrays shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g003">3</xref>%–10% of male-sired embryos elongated past the 2-fold stage and hatched into deformed larvae (<italic>n</italic>&gt;150 embryos per array). When the same <italic>peel-1</italic> transgene was expressed from a single-copy genomic insertion, which is not silenced, no hatching was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g001">Figure 1C</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given the relationship between PEEL-1 dosage, sperm size, and phenotypic severity, we suspected that the age-related decrease in phenotypic severity among hermaphrodite-sired embryos might reflect underlying size differences and size-based competition among hermaphrodite sperm. Hermaphrodite sperm vary approximately 2-fold in size (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-LaMunyon1">[29]</xref>, personal observations) and are produced in a single bout of spermatogenesis at the onset of adulthood. Larger sperm in <italic>C. elegans</italic> experience a competitive advantage because they are able to crawl faster to reach the oocyte <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-LaMunyon1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Singson2">[31]</xref>. One explanation for the age effect, therefore, is that larger-than-average sperm monopolize fertilization events early in life, leaving smaller, less toxic sperm to dominate fertilizations later on. In support of this hypothesis, we were able to reduce the age effect among hermaphrodite-sired embryos by delaying the hermaphrodite's use of self-sperm via partial mating to a male (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). This result demonstrates that the age effect arises from a correlation between the competitive ability of each sperm and its toxicity to the embryo. Given the known biology of <italic>C. elegans</italic> sperm, the most parsimonious explanation for this correlation is that larger hermaphrodite sperm both are more competitive and carry more PEEL-1 protein. This correlation might also arise from PEEL-1 having a direct effect on the competitive ability of each sperm, although we have no evidence for such an effect.</p>
        <p>To our knowledge, the above results represent the first evidence of competition among hermaphrodite sperm in vivo, as well as the first evidence of naturally occurring differences in sperm size affecting embryonic development. Insofar as PEEL-1 levels scale with sperm size, the wide phenotypic variability among hermaphrodite-sired embryos implies that for low levels of PEEL-1, phenotypic severity is acutely sensitive to PEEL-1 dosage. By the same logic, however, the phenotypic homogeneity among male-sired embryos implies that above a certain threshold level of PEEL-1, phenotypic severity ceases to increase. In support of this threshold effect, doubling or tripling <italic>peel-1</italic> copy number among male-sired embryos did not produce a more severe phenotype, at least as measured by the onset of epidermal leakage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g005">Figure 5D</xref>).</p>

        <p>Ubiquitous <italic>zeel-1</italic> expression is consistent with <italic>zeel-1</italic>'s ability to rescue the seemingly independent muscle and epidermal defects observed in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos. To test the tissue-autonomy of <italic>zeel-1</italic> rescue, we expressed <italic>zeel-1</italic> only in muscle and only in epidermis. We used the promoters of <italic>hlh-1</italic> and <italic>lin-26</italic>, respectively, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Krause1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Landmann1">[33]</xref>, which initiate expression at the 80- to 100-cell stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Labouesse2">[34]</xref>. Consistent with sperm-supplied PEEL-1 affecting muscle and epidermis independently, tissue-specific expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic> produced tissue-specific rescue.

(Muscle detachment and excretory cell distention could not be assayed because muscle movement, combined with epidermal leakage, ripped embryos apart entirely.) Conversely, expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic> only in the epidermis rescued the epidermal defects, but it did not rescue paralysis and 2-fold arrest (<italic>n</italic> = 69 embryos; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). In hermaphrodite-sired embryos, both constructs fully rescued a subset of embryos, and rescue activity increased with hermaphrodite age (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This result is consistent with the age effect among hermaphrodite-sired embryos and the fact that hermaphrodite-sired embryos do not always exhibit defects in both muscle and epidermal tissue.</p>

For each type of transgene, 4 to 13 independent extra-chromosomal arrays were tested. For each array, 100 to 600 embryos were scored per self-cross or backcross. Ten control replicates were performed in parallel, each including 100 to 400 embryos (“no transgene” bars).

Each transgene was tested for a reduction in lethality compared to the control replicates (Student's <italic>t</italic> tests, <italic>p</italic> values indicated by shading).

        <p>Analysis of gene order and sequence data suggests that <italic>zeel-1</italic> arose through duplication of the <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> locus. <italic>zeel-1</italic> and <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> are one another's closest paralogs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g007">Figures 7A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s006">S6</xref>), and the two genes are 55% identical at the amino acid level. <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> is located 12 Mb from <italic>zeel-1</italic> in a tandem array of three additional <italic>zyg-11</italic> family members, none of which contain the <italic>N</italic>-terminal transmembrane domain. Assuming that <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> and its neighbors originated in their current genomic location via repeated tandem duplication, then two scenarios for the origin of <italic>zeel-1</italic> and <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> are possible. First, <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> may have originated via duplication of another gene in the tandem array, gained its transmembrane domain during or after duplication, and later been duplicated again to produce <italic>zeel-1</italic>. Alternatively, the tandem array may have arisen through partial duplication of <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic>. The second scenario is less parsimonious than the first, because it requires secondary loss of the transmembrane domain during creation of the tandem array. However, the second scenario still implies that the <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> locus predates <italic>zeel-1</italic>, because if the opposite were true, then <italic>zeel-1</italic> would form an out-group to the tandem array, and it does not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>
        <p>Given the chimeric structure of ZEEL-1, we tested whether either domain alone could rescue the lethality of <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos. The <italic>C</italic>-terminal ZYG-11-like domain, ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub>, provided no rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). The transmembrane domain, ZEEL-1<sub>TM</sub>, provided full rescue to hermaphrodite-sired embryos, but only partial rescue to male-sired embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g007">Figure 7B–C</xref>). In contrast, the positive control transgene, full-length ZEEL-1 tagged with GFP, provided full rescue to both male- and hermaphrodite-sired embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g007">Figure 7B–C</xref>). We conclude that the transmembrane domain of ZEEL-1 is required for antidote activity, and that this domain alone is able to neutralize the low doses of PEEL-1 delivered by hermaphrodite sperm but not the higher doses delivered by male sperm.</p>
        <p>The partial rescue activity of ZEEL-1<sub>TM</sub> demonstrates that ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub> does contribute to the antidote activity of full-length ZEEL-1. To examine this contribution more carefully, we tested whether ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub> could rescue the lethality of <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos when fused to the transmembrane domain of <italic>zeel-1</italic>'s closest relative, <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic>. Like ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub>, the chimeric transgene, Y71A12B.17<sub>TM</sub>::ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub>, provided no rescue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Assuming that this transgene was stably expressed, this result demonstrates that ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub> cannot confer antidote activity to a related transmembrane domain. Additionally, this result demonstrates that the transmembrane domains of <italic>zeel-1</italic> and <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> have diverged functionally since their common ancestor. The molecular basis of this divergence remains unclear, however, because the transmembrane domains of <italic>zeel-1</italic> and <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> are only 35% identical at the amino acid level, with substitutions distributed throughout their length (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s007">Figure S7</xref>).</p>

        <title>Heat-Shock Expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> Kills Adult Animals, and Heat-Shock Expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic> Rescues This Lethality</title>
        <p>To determine whether PEEL-1 can function as a toxin outside of embryos, we expressed <italic>peel-1</italic> ectopically in larvae and adults. <italic>pee1-1</italic> was expressed using each of two heat-shock promoters, <italic>Phsp-16.2</italic> and <italic>Phsp-16.41</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Jones1">[35]</xref>. For each promoter construct, we generated both single-copy genomic insertions and extra-chromosomal arrays, which typically contain tens to hundreds of copies of a transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Mello1">[36]</xref>. Both types of animals grew normally under standard laboratory conditions, but a 1-h heat shock at 34°C was lethal to all: array-carrying adults died within 2 h after the start of heat-shock, and insertion-carrying animals within 4.5 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Faster killing of array-carrying animals is consistent with their higher <italic>peel-1</italic> dosage, and similar results were observed for heat-shocked larvae (unpublished data). In addition, aside from the gross phenotype of death, the heat-shocked animals showed defects in most, if not all, tissues. Beginning approximately 30 to 45 min before death, the body-wall and male-tail muscles hyper-contracted; vacuoles formed in many tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s008">Figure S8K</xref>); the lumen of the excretory cell distended (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s008">Figure S8L</xref>); the gonad appeared to disintegrate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s008">Figure S8M</xref>); and in hermaphrodites, the gonad and intestine occasionally exploded through the vulva. We conclude that PEEL-1 is a nearly universal toxin, affecting many developmental stages and cell types.</p>

        <title>Sperm-Supplied PEEL-1 May Act Directly During the Two-Fold Stage</title>
        <p>The fact that <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos do not exhibit defects until late in development—at 2-fold stage—is surprising because sperm-supplied factors are thought to act only during egg-activation and first cleavage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-LHernault1">[16]</xref>. One explanation for this paradox is that the late-occurring defects might be a downstream manifestation of a cryptic defect earlier in development. Alternatively, sperm-supplied PEEL-1 might persist long after fertilization but only become toxic at the 2-fold stage. While we have been unable to visualize PEEL-1 after fertilization, using either PEEL-1::GFP or the anti-PEEL-1 antibody (presumably because PEEL-1 becomes too diffuse), three observations are consistent with PEEL-1 acting directly during the 2-fold stage.</p>
        <p>First, pre-2-fold embryos were able to develop normally even when exposed to more PEEL-1 protein than is delivered by sperm. We heat-shocked pre-2-fold embryos, aged 3 to 7.5 h after the four-cell stage, carrying either an array or insertion of <italic>Phsp-16.41::peel-1</italic>. Embryos were heat-shocked for 20 min at 34°C. Longer and earlier heat-shock were not possible because even in wild-type embryos, such conditions cause premature arrest (personal observations). Except for occasional subtle shape defects during early elongation, more than 97% of array- and insertion-carrying embryos developed normally to the 2-fold stage (<italic>n</italic>≥200; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s008">Figure S8A</xref>). This result is consistent with sperm-supplied PEEL-1 being able to persist until the 2-fold stage without manifesting a visible defect earlier in development.</p>
        <p>Second, heat-shock expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> as late as 30 min before the 2-fold stage phenocopied the defects observed in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos. In the heat-shocked embryos described above, embryos carrying an array of <italic>Phsp-16.41::peel-1</italic> uniformly arrested at the 2-fold stage and showed muscle detachment, epidermal leakage, and excretory cell distention (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s008">Figure S8B–J</xref>). These defects were also observed among insertion-carrying embryos, although their occurrence required earlier induction of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). In addition, consistent with heat-shock treatment exposing embryos to more PEEL-1 protein than is delivered by sperm, the defects induced by heat-shock were often more severe than those observed in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos, and even among insertion-carrying embryos, these defects could not be rescued by endogenous expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). These results demonstrate that as long as <italic>peel-1</italic> is expressed at or just before the 2-fold stage, presence of PEEL-1 in the early embryo is dispensable for the 2-fold arrest.</p>
        <p>Finally, rescue of <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos did not require early expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic>. We induced <italic>zeel-1</italic> expression in male-sired, <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos by heat-shocking embryos carrying either an array or an insertion of <italic>Phsp-16.41::zeel-1</italic>. Heat-shock treatment rescued 53%–100% of array-carrying embryos (<italic>n</italic> = 17−43), as long as heat-shock treatment occurred at least 1 h before the 2-fold stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). (Here rescue is defined as elongation past the 2-fold stage. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s008">Figure S8A</xref> for the proportion of embryos that hatched.) Similar results were observed for insertion-carrying embryos, although rescue activity required earlier induction of the transgene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). These results imply that ZEEL-1 can neutralize sperm-supplied PEEL-1 at any time before the 2-fold stage. This scenario is temporally discordant with PEEL-1 causing a cryptic defect early in development.</p>

        <title>Cell-Specific Expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> Produces Cell-Specific Ablation</title>
        <p>To test the cell-autonomy of <italic>peel-1</italic> killing, as well as the utility of <italic>peel-1</italic> as a tool for cell-specific ablation, we expressed <italic>peel-1</italic> under the control of each of two cell-specific promoters: <italic>Punc-47</italic>, which expresses in the GABA-ergic neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-McIntire1">[37]</xref>, and <italic>Pexp-3</italic>, which expresses in the egg-laying muscles and the anal depressor muscle (C. Frøkjœr-Jensen, personal communication). For each promoter construct, we examined the presence or absence of the corresponding cell types for four independent extra-chromosomal arrays.</p>
        <p>In both muscle cells and neurons, cell-specific expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> produced cell-specific ablation, although the efficacy of ablation varied among arrays. Three of the <italic>Punc-47::peel-1</italic> arrays killed 94.2%–99.8% (<italic>n</italic> = 241−453) of GABA-ergic neurons, although the fourth array killed only 28.6% (<italic>n</italic> = 350) of them. Each of the <italic>Pexp-3::peel-1</italic> arrays killed 6%–27% (<italic>n</italic> = 83−90) of anal depressor muscles and 74%–94% (<italic>n</italic> = 140−180) of egg-laying muscles. Of the egg-laying muscles that remained alive, all were severely atrophied (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Lower toxicity to the anal depressor muscle may have been caused by selection bias among our arrays, because animals lacking the anal depressor muscle were very severely constipated and therefore more slow-growing than others. In addition, even among animals in which the anal depressor remained alive, constipation was prevalent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s009">Figure S9</xref>), indicating that function of this muscle was impaired.</p>
        <p>Aside from the defects caused by ablation of the corresponding cell types, animals carrying either type of construct were morphologically and behaviorally normal, consistent with PEEL-1 acting cell-autonomously. In addition, with one exception, no defects were observed outside the ablated cells types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001115-g008">Figure 8F</xref>). The exception was that the three “high kill” <italic>Punc-47::peel-1</italic> arrays were lethal to the animal when inherited somatically along the lineage of the four RME neurons: For these three arrays, embryo and early larval lethality was very high (33.0%–57.7%; <italic>n</italic> = 327−1,095), and the only animals surviving to adulthood were those that lost the arrays somatically in the four RME neurons. Given that the RME neurons are not required for survival <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-McIntire2">[38]</xref>, this lethality implies that either (<italic>i</italic>) expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> in the RME neurons kills a neighboring cell nonautonomously or (<italic>ii</italic>) expression of <italic>peel-1</italic> is leaky and kills one or more essential cells along the RME lineage. While we did not distinguish between these possibilities, we note that the sister cell to one RME neuron is the excretory cell, which is essential for survival.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element in <italic>C. elegans</italic> is composed of two, tightly linked genes: a sperm-delivered toxin, <italic>peel-1</italic>, and an embryo-expressed antidote, <italic>zeel-1</italic>. <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> are located adjacent to one another in the genome, and both genes encode transmembrane proteins. <italic>peel-1</italic> is expressed in the male germline, and its product is delivered to the embryo via fibrous body-membranous organelles. In the absence of <italic>zeel-1</italic>, sperm-supplied PEEL-1 causes dose-dependent, late-occurring defects in muscle and epidermal tissue. <italic>zeel-1</italic> is expressed transiently in the embryo, and tissue-specific expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic> produces tissue-specific rescue. The transmembrane domain of <italic>zeel-1</italic> is required and partially sufficient for function, and like <italic>peel-1</italic>, this domain is evolutionarily novel and does not occur outside <italic>C. elegans</italic>. Finally, although PEEL-1 and ZEEL-1 normally function in embryos, <italic>peel-1</italic> is lethal when expressed ectopically in adults, and this lethality is rescued by ectopic expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic>.</p>

        <title>Sperm and Early Embryos May Be Protected from PEEL-1</title>
        <p>Given the evidence that sperm-supplied PEEL-1 may persist throughout embryogenesis and act directly during the 2-fold stage, PEEL-1 must be a remarkably potent toxin. Sperm are tiny in size compared to the oocyte, roughly 1% as large by volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Browning1">[14]</xref>, so PEEL-1 concentrations in the embryo are necessarily low. Moreover, assuming that PEEL-1 localizes to plasma membranes in the embryo, as might be expected for a FB-MO protein, then with each cell division, PEEL-1 will become more and more dilute relative to the total membrane component of the embryo.</p>
        <p>Equivalently, the 2-fold stage of development must be remarkably sensitive to the toxic effects of PEEL-1. While the cause of this hypersensitivity remains unclear, we emphasize that the morphogenetic processes occurring at the 2-fold stage involve changes in cell shape and cell adhesion that are vastly more dramatic than those in earlier development. In addition, the two tissues most affected by PEEL-1—muscle and epidermis—are also the two tissues in which these morphogenetic changes are most pronounced.</p>
        <p>The high potency of PEEL-1, combined with its widespread toxicity to a variety of cell types, highlights an unusual aspect of sperm cell biology: sperm are able to function normally, despite high concentrations of PEEL-1. While the mechanism of sperm protection remains unclear, we note that sperm differ from other cell types in three ways. First, sperm contain only a nucleus, some mitochondria, and FB-MOs; all other organelles and all ribosomes are excluded <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Wolf1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Ward1">[40]</xref>. Second, sperm lack an actin-based cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Nelson2">[41]</xref>, and instead crawl using polymers of the Major Sperm Protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Italiano1">[42]</xref>. Third, sperm sequester PEEL-1 in FB-MOs. Such sequestration is not possible in other cell types because FB-MOs are sperm-specific. In addition, although FB-MOs fuse with the plasma membrane upon sperm activation, they persist as permanent fusion pores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Ward2">[43]</xref>. This morphology prevents at least some FB-MO proteins from diffusing into the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Washington1">[44]</xref>, and it may prevent diffusion of PEEL-1 as well.</p>
        <p>The fact that pre-2-fold embryos are able to develop normally even when <italic>peel-1</italic> is induced by heat-shock indicates that pre-2-fold development is less sensitive than the 2-fold stage to the toxic effects of PEEL-1. However, given the hypersensitivity of the 2-fold stage, it remains unclear whether pre-2-fold embryos are fully resistant to PEEL-1 (like sperm), or whether PEEL-1 levels in the heat-shocked, pre-2-fold embryos were too low to produce general cytotoxic effects. While we cannot discount the possibility of full resistance, we note that in the heat-shocked embryos, the time interval between heat-shock and the 2-fold stage was 5 h, at most. Five hours was sufficient for necrosis to develop in heat-shocked adults, but the two heat-shock experiments are not directly comparable because the heat-shock response in adults and embryos may not be equivalent, and the duration of heat-shock was shorter in embryos than in adults.</p>

        <title>Possible Mechanisms of PEEL-1 Toxicity and ZEEL-1-Mediated Rescue</title>
        <p>Because PEEL-1 has no sequence similarity to any other protein, the PEEL-1 sequence cannot be used to infer the mechanism of its toxicity. The fact that PEEL-1 is toxic even in extremely tiny amounts suggests that PEEL-1 might act catalytically—for example, by nucleating aggregation events or by acting as a transmembrane protease. The muscle hyper-contraction observed in heat-shocked adults, as well as the paralysis and 2-fold arrest observed in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos (which may in theory result from too much muscle contraction rather than too little), suggests that PEEL-1 might act by releasing intracellular calcium, perhaps by generating a membrane pore. It remains unclear, however, how calcium release alone can account for the epidermal defects observed in <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos, because increased calcium signaling alone does not cause embryonic arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Bui1">[45]</xref> and is even known to suppress certain defects in epidermal morphogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Pilipiuk1">[46]</xref>. In addition, it remains unclear how sperm might be protected from increased calcium, given the role of calcium in sperm activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Washington1">[44]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Given the uncertain mechanism of PEEL-1 toxicity, there are also many possible mechanisms of ZEEL-1-mediated rescue. ZEEL-1 might promote degradation of PEEL-1, or it might prevent PEEL-1 from binding to its target, either by acting as a competitive inhibitor or by neutralizing PEEL-1 through direct interaction. While we have been unable to demonstrate a direct physical interaction between PEEL-1 and ZEEL-1, several observations are consistent with it. First, both PEEL-1 and ZEEL-1 are transmembrane proteins. ZEEL-1 localizes to cell membranes, and PEEL-1 localizes to FB-MOs. Assuming that FB-MOs do not endocytose during fertilization, localization to these organelles should deliver PEEL-1 to the plasma membrane of the zygote, where it should have the opportunity to encounter ZEEL-1 later in development. Second, the transmembrane domain of ZEEL-1 is required and partially sufficient for function, consistent with this domain binding directly to PEEL-1. Third, tissue-specific expression of <italic>zeel-1</italic> produces tissue-specific rescue, consistent with ZEEL-1 being able to neutralize PEEL-1 only when both proteins are present within the same cell. Fourth, ZEEL-1 can neutralize PEEL-1 toxicity even in adults, demonstrating that the genetic interaction between <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> does not require any intermediaries specific to embryogenesis. Fifth, in both embryos and adults, ZEEL-1 is able to neutralize small but not large doses of PEEL-1. This dose-dependence implies that the genetic interaction between <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> requires a minimum ratio of ZEEL-1 to PEEL-1.</p>

        <p>The <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element's mode of action is similar to that of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>, in that both types of elements act through paternal-effect killing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Serbus1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Werren1">[11]</xref>. <italic>Wolbachia</italic>'s molecular mechanism is very different, however, because <italic>Wolbachia</italic> does not load sperm with an extra-nuclear toxin, but instead modifies the sperm pronucleus to undergo a chromatin condensation defect during the first mitotic division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Breeuwer1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Presgraves1">[49]</xref>. In addition, <italic>Wolbachia</italic> is an intracellular bacterium, not a nuclear-encoded locus, and rescue of <italic>Wolbachia</italic>-mediated killing depends upon the contents of maternal ooplasm, not zygotic transcription of a nuclear-encoded gene.

        <title>Sheltering of the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> Element by Near-Perpetual Homozygosity</title>
        <p>Previously, we demonstrated that haplotypes carrying the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element and haplotypes lacking it are maintained by balancing selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. We hypothesized that the target of selection may be a linked polymorphism, rather than the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. Under this scenario, <italic>peel-1</italic> may represent an unprecedented case of “inverted” sheltered load. Sheltered load refers to the incidental maintenance of deleterious alleles tightly linked to sites under balancing selection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Uyenoyama1">[51]</xref>. Ordinarily, sheltered load occurs when deleterious recessives arise on haplotypes maintained in persistent heterozygosity, such as those of major histocompatibility complex loci in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Hughes1">[52]</xref> or self-incompatibility loci in plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Stone1">[53]</xref>. <italic>peel-1</italic> is like these deleterious recessives in that although <italic>peel-1</italic> has the potential to impose substantial genetic load on the species, its effects are rarely visible to natural selection. In the case of <italic>peel-1</italic>, however, sheltering is inverted because <italic>peel-1</italic> is only visible when heterozygous, and in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, heterozygosity is the exception rather than the norm.</p>
        <p>Like any locus promoting its own transmission to the detriment of the rest of the genome, the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element creates a selective environment favoring its own suppression. From a genic perspective, loci unlinked to the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element suffer a fitness cost every time they are transmitted to a <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryo. As a consequence, mutations unlinked to <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> that either suppress the activity of <italic>peel-1</italic> or mimic the activity of <italic>zeel-1</italic> will be favored by natural selection. Insofar as such alleles are accessible in mutational space, their absence further attests to the sheltering of the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element by near-perpetual homozygosity. (The <italic>peel-1</italic> mutations in strains MY19 and EG4348 do not represent favored alleles because they do not arise on haplotypes suffering a fitness cost.)</p>

        <title>Evolutionary Origins of the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> Element</title>
        <p>The insertion/deletion polymorphism of <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> raises the following question: Did this indel polymorphism arise by an insertion event or by deletion of preexisting sequence? With respect to <italic>zeel-1</italic>, this polymorphism probably arose by a deletion event, because the divergence between <italic>zeel-1</italic> and its presumed ancestor, <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic>, predates allelic divergence at the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> locus. <italic>zeel-1</italic> and <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> are 45% diverged at the amino acid level, and divergence at synonymous sites is saturated (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). In comparison, the Bristol and Hawaii alleles of genes surrounding the indel polymorphism of <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> are roughly 2% diverged at the amino acid level and 10%–16% diverged at synonymous sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, and this level of divergence is representative of the divergence between all haplotypes carrying the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element and all haplotypes lacking it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>.</p>
        <p>It is reasonable to suppose that the <italic>peel-1</italic>/<italic>zeel-1</italic> element originated as a weak toxin-antidote pair and then co-evolved into its current form. Yet given the low selective pressure for transmission ratio distortion in a self-fertilizing species, it is unlikely that <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> co-evolved within <italic>C. elegans</italic> as result of this type of selective pressure alone. One possible solution to this paradox is that <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic> co-evolved in the out-crossing ancestor of <italic>C. elegans</italic>, where the selective pressure for transmission ratio distortion would have been much stronger. Another, non-mutually exclusive hypothesis is that <italic>peel-1</italic> was originally favored because it aided in another cellular process, such as sperm competition, and its toxicity to the embryo was initially mild and incidental. Under this scenario, <italic>zeel-1</italic> would have arisen to counteract the toxicity of <italic>peel-1</italic>, and once <italic>zeel-1</italic> became established, the presence of <italic>zeel-1</italic> would have allowed for stronger toxicity on the part of <italic>peel-1</italic> and, eventually, lethality in <italic>zeel-1</italic>'s absence. Regardless of the initial selective pressures favoring <italic>peel-1</italic> and <italic>zeel-1</italic>, however, the fact that both <italic>peel-1</italic> and the transmembrane domain of <italic>zeel-1</italic> are evolutionarily novel indicates that the self-promoting activity of the <italic>peel-1</italic>/<italic>zeel-1</italic> element arose fundamentally from the co-evolution of two novel proteins.</p>

        <title>Scoring Embryo Lethality</title>
        <p>In all experiments except the age-effect experiment, embryo lethality from self-fertilizing hermaphrodites was scored by isolating hermaphrodites at the L4 stage and singling them to fresh plates the following day. After laying eggs for 8–10 h, the hermaphrodites were removed and embryos were counted. Unhatched embryos were counted ∼24 h later.</p>
        <p>To score embryo lethality from mated hermaphrodites, three or four L4 hermaphrodites were mated to six to ten L4 or young adult males for 24–36 h. Hermaphrodites were then singled to fresh plates and embryo lethality was scored as above. Broods were examined for the presence of males 2–3 d later, and any broods lacking males were excluded. To allow male sperm to age within the reproductive tract of the hermaphrodite, mated hermaphrodites were removed from males, and lethality was scored among embryos laid 3 d after removal.</p>
        <p>In the age-effect experiment, 91 <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)peel-1(+)/niDf</italic>9 hermaphrodites were singled at the L4 stage and transferred every 12 h to fresh plates. Hermaphrodites were discarded after the first 12-h period in which they failed to lay fertilized embryos. Total embryos were counted at the end of each laying period, and unhatched embryos were counted ∼24 h after each laying period had ended.</p>
        <p>To score embryo lethality from partially mated hermaphrodites, 130 <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)peel-1(+)/niDf</italic>9 hermaphrodites were mated at the L4 stage to an equal number of PD4790 males, which carry an insertion of the fluorescent marker, <italic>Pmyo-2::GFP</italic>. After 24 h, hermaphrodites were singled and transferred every 12 h to fresh plates until day five. Embryo lethality was scored as above, except that after unhatched embryos were counted, hatched and unhatched progeny were classified as self- or cross-progeny according to presence of pharyngeal GFP. Hermaphrodites laying 100% self-progeny or more than 95% cross-progeny were excluded. The remaining hermaphrodites, which we define as “partially mated,” laid ∼10%–50% self-progeny. In these broods, we calculated the portion of self-progeny, laid during days 3 to 5, that failed to hatch.</p>

        <title>Mapping <italic>peel-1</italic> Mutations in MY19 and EG4348</title>
        <p>Absence of the paternal-effect in EG4348 was mapped relative to <italic>bli-3(e767)</italic>, a visible marker located ∼10 cM from the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval. Mapping was performed as described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. Briefly, EG4348 males were crossed to MT1344 hermaphrodites, and F1 hermaphrodites were mated to CB4856 males. The resulting hermaphrodite progeny were allowed to self-fertilize, and their broods were scored for embryo lethality (i.e., presence of <italic>peel-1</italic> activity) and presence of Bli animals. Directionality with respect to <italic>bli-3</italic> could be inferred because <italic>bli-3</italic> is located at the left-hand tip of chromosome I.</p>
        <p>Preliminary sequence analysis of the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval in EG4348 was performed by genotyping EG4348 with a subset of the markers listed in Table S2 of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. These markers tile across the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval, and they distinguish all haplotypes carrying an intact copy of the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element from all haplotypes lacking it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. In other words, the Bristol-like alleles of these markers are in perfect linkage disequilibrium with presence of the <italic>peel-1/zeel-1</italic> element. At all markers we assayed, EG4348 carried the Bristol-like allele.</p>
        <p>Fine-mapping in MY19 and EG4348 was performed by crossing each strain to MT1344 and collecting Lin Non-Bli and Bli Non-Lin recombinants in the F2 generation. Recombinant animals were genotyped (via a portion of their F3 broods) at each of two markers flanking the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval. The right-hand marker for the MY19 cross was a BstCI snip-SNP amplified with primers 5′-GTA TTC CGA CGA TTC GGA TG-3′ and 5′-CAT TGA GAA CAC AAA AAC AAA CG-3′. The right-hand marker for EG4348 cross was an AfeI snip-SNP amplified with primers 5′- GAC ATA TTT CCC GCA ACC TG-3′ and 5′- GTG ACG AGG CTT GAG GAT TC-3′. The left-hand marker for both crosses was a BanI snip-SNP amplified with primers 5′-CGC CAA ATA TGT TGT GCA GT-3′ and <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-CAC CAC GTG TCC TTT CTC ATT-3′</named-content>.</p>
        <p>Recombinants breaking within the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval were homozygosed for the recombinant chromosome, and the resulting homozygotes were phenotyped for <italic>peel-1</italic> activity. Phenotyping was performed by crossing each line to CB4856 and scoring embryo lethality from self-fertilizing, F1 hermaphrodites, and from F1 males backcrossed to CB4856 hermaphrodites. Recombinants were classified as having <italic>peel-1</italic> activity if these crosses produced ∼25% and ∼50% embryo lethality, respectively. Next, the locations of recombination breakpoints were mapped more finely by sequencing six to ten sequence polymorphisms, located throughout the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval, that distinguish MY19 or EG4348 from Bristol. The MY19 polymorphisms were determined from the MY19 sequence described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, and the EG4348 polymorphisms were determined by amplifying and sequencing arbitrary fragments from this strain. Some polymorphisms are shared between MY19 and EG4348, and these were used in both crosses. For the most informative recombinants, we later sequenced across the entire breakpoint region in order to map these breakpoints to the level of adjacent polymorphisms. This approach mapped the <italic>peel-1</italic>-disrupting mutations to regions of 5 kb in MY19 and 8 kb in EG4348. These intervals were then sequenced in the corresponding strains, and all sequence polymorphisms were identified. Finally, we genotyped these polymorphisms in a panel of 38 wild strains previously identified as having intact <italic>peel-1</italic> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. These strains, as well as the primers used for genotyping them, are given in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001115.s002">Figure S2</xref>. The MY19 sequence was deposited in GenBank previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, and the EG4348 sequence was deposited under accession number HQ291558.</p>

        <p>RNA was collected from mixed-staged Bristol animals by freeze-cracking and extracting in Trizol (Invitrogen) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Reverse transcription-PCR (RT-PCR) was performed using pairs of primers flanking each candidate mutation in MY19 and EG4348.

For 3′ RACE, the RT reaction was performed using 5′-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG ACT TTT TTT TTT TTT TTT TT-3′, and PCR was performed using the gene-specific primer, 5′-ACA TGT ATC TTG ATC TGC CTG A-3′ (forward), and the adaptor primer, 5′-GTT TTC CCA GTC ACG AC-3′ (reverse).

Then, a second round of PCR was performed using the adaptor primer, 5′-GGC CAC GCG TCG ACT AGT AC-3′ (forward), and another nested, gene-specific primer, 5′-AGA GCA ATA ACA TGC GCA AA-3′ (reverse). SuperScript III (Invitrogen) was used in all RT reactions, and PlatinumTaq (Invitrogen) was used for all PCR reactions.

        <p>CB4088 and MT3301 animals were grow at 15°C and synchronized at the L1 stage by bleaching and hatching overnight in M9. L1s were split into two populations, and one population was shifted to 25°C. When animals had reached young adulthood, hermaphrodites and males were separated by hand, and RNA was collected as above. Real-time PCR of <italic>peel-1</italic>, <italic>spe-9</italic>, and <italic>rpl-26</italic> was performed in triplicate, for 40 cycles, on an ABI 7900HT using the QuantiTect SYBR Green Kit (Qiagen).

        <p>Transgenic animals carrying <italic>peel-1(+)</italic> were generated by two methods: bombardment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Praitis1">[58]</xref> and Mos1-mediated, single-copy insertion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-FrokjaerJensen1">[59]</xref>. For bombardment, a fragment containing the Bristol allele of <italic>peel-1</italic>, along with ∼2.8 kb of upstream sequence and ∼1 kb of downstream sequence, was excised from fosmid WRM0633bE09 (Bioscience LifeSciences, Nottingham, UK) using AhdI and NgoMIV. This fragment was cloned into the yeast shuttle vector, pRS246 (ATCC, Manassas, VA), via yeast-mediated ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Raymond1">[60]</xref> of the fragment's ends. The resulting plasmid, pHS11, was bombarded into QX1320, along with the <italic>unc-119(+)</italic> rescue vector, pDP#MM016B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Maduro1">[61]</xref>. Bombardment was performed as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Merritt1">[62]</xref>, although only extra-chromosomal arrays were recovered. Nine independent transgenic lines were tested for <italic>peel-1</italic> activity by crossing them to CB4856 and scoring embryo lethality from self-fertilizing, F1 hermaphrodites (self-cross) and F1 males backcrossed to CB4856 hermaphrodites (backcross).</p>
        <p>For Mos1-mediated insertion, the <italic>peel-1</italic> fragment from pHS11 was amplified by PCR, using primers having NheI cut sites, and this amplicon was cut with NheI and ligated into pCFJ151 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-FrokjaerJensen1">[59]</xref> linearized with AvrII. The resulting plasmid, pHS26, was injected into QX1409 along with the vectors needed to generate single-copy insertions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-FrokjaerJensen1">[59]</xref>. Insertion-carrying animals were recovered by the direct insertion method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-FrokjaerJensen1">[59]</xref>, and five independent insertion-carrying lines were tested for <italic>peel-1</italic> activity as above. For one of the two insertions that did exhibit <italic>peel-1</italic> activity, the self-cross and backcross were repeated, and hatched progeny were collected and genotyped for a PCR-length polymorphism located less than 1 kb from <italic>niDf9</italic>. The primers used to amplify this polymorphism were 5′-TGG ATA CGA TTC GAG CTT CC-3′ (forward) and 5′-CCC CCT AAT TTC CAA GTG GT-3′ (reverse).</p>
        <p>For three of the <italic>peel-1</italic> array lines, a small number of severely deformed L1s were observed in the backcross, similar to the “escapers” typically observed among <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos sired by hermaphrodites. We suspected that these L1s had “escaped” the paternal-effect due to partial germline silencing of the <italic>peel-1</italic> arrays. Consistent with this hypothesis, we genotyped 13 of these animals, using the PCR-length polymorphism described above, and all were <italic>zeel-1(niDf9)</italic> homozygotes. We then calculated the frequency of these escapers relative to the total number of <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected progeny (i.e., relative to the total number of dead embryos and deformed L1s).</p>

        <p><italic>ZEEL-1::GFP</italic> was generated by amplifying <italic>GFP</italic> from PD95.75 and inserting it into pHS4.1, a genomic subclone of <italic>zeel-1(+)</italic> described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. pHS4.1 was linearized with AhdI, and yeast-mediated ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Raymond1">[60]</xref> was used to insert <italic>GFP</italic> just upstream of the <italic>zeel-1</italic> stop codon. Later, a second <italic>ZEEL-1::GFP</italic> construct was generated using the cDNA of <italic>zeel-1</italic>, instead of the genomic locus. This construct was generated by first cutting pHS4.1 with EcoNI and BglII, in order to remove the entire coding region of <italic>zeel-1</italic>, and then inserting a full cDNA of <italic>zeel-1</italic>, followed by <italic>GFP</italic>. The cDNA of <italic>zeel-1</italic> was cloned previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>, and this replacement was performed using yeast-mediated ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Raymond1">[60]</xref>. Both constructs showed full rescue of <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos, and data from the two constructs were combined.</p>
        <p>To generate <italic>ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub></italic>, pHS4.1 was cut with EcoNI and KpnI, and the fragment containing <italic>zeel-1</italic> codons 5 to 205 was removed. The remaining fragment was then re-circularized, using yeast-mediated ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Raymond1">[60]</xref>, to fuse codon 4 to codon 206. To generate <italic>ZEEL-1<sub>TM</sub></italic>, the entire coding region of <italic>zeel-1</italic> was excised from pHS4.1 using EcoNI and BglII, and this fragment was replaced with a partial cDNA of <italic>zeel-1</italic> encoding the first 205 amino acids of the protein. This replacement was performed using yeast-mediated ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Raymond1">[60]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To generate <italic>Y71A12B.17<sub>TM</sub>::ZEEL-1<sub>SOL</sub></italic>, the coding region of <italic>zeel-1</italic> was excised from pHS4.1, as above, and yeast mediated ligation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Raymond1">[60]</xref> was used to replace this fragment with a partial cDNA of <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic>, followed by a partial cDNA of <italic>zeel-1</italic>. The resulting construct contained the <italic>N</italic>-terminal 207 codons of <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> fused to the <italic>C</italic>-terminal 712 codons of <italic>zeel-1</italic>. The junction of this fusion was chosen to overlap a string of seven amino acids (KNERKEG) that are perfectly conserved between the two proteins. The <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> cDNA was cloned by reverse transcribing RNA from the Bristol strain using primer 5′-TTG AAC AAA AAC AAT GGA TAT GTA A-3′, and then performing PCR using primers <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GGG GAC AAG TTT GTA CAA AAA AGC AGG CTT CAT GTC GGA TTT CGA CTC AGA-3′</named-content> (forward) and 5′-GGG GAC CAC TTT GTA CAA GAA AGC TGG GTC ATT TAT TAA CTC CAA CAA TGA TTC G-3′ (reverse). This PCR product was then cloned into the vector, pDONR221 (Invitrogen), using the Gateway cloning kit (Invitrogen). The <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> cDNA differs slightly from the WormBase gene prediction and was deposited in GenBank under accession number HQ291557.</p>

To test each transgene for its ability to rescue <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos, transgenic animals were crossed to the Bristol strain, and lethality was scored among embryos derived from two crosses: self-fertilizing F1 hermaphrodites (self-cross) and F1 males backcrossed to hermaphrodites of the original transgenic line. To calculate hatch rates among <italic>peel-1</italic>-affected embryos inheriting <italic>ZEEL-1::GFP</italic> and <italic>ZEEL-1<sub>TM</sub></italic>, transgenic animals were crossed to QX1319, and embryos were collected from (i) transgenic, self-fertilizing, F1, <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)peel-1(+)/niDf9</italic> hermaphrodites and (ii) transgenic, F1, <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)peel-1(+)/niDf9</italic> males backcrossed to non-transgenic, <italic>niDf9/niDf9</italic> hermaphrodites.

        <p>For <italic>Ppeel-1::GFP</italic>, we joined together the <italic>peel-1</italic> promoter, <italic>GFP</italic>, and the <italic>peel-1</italic> 3′UTR. For the <italic>peel-1</italic> promoter, we used all intergenic sequences between the <italic>peel-1</italic> start codon and last coding segment of <italic>zeel-1</italic> (i.e., 2,473 bp of sequence). The <italic>peel-1</italic> 3′ UTR was determined empirically and extended 86 bp downstream of the <italic>peel-1</italic> stop codon. For <italic>GFP</italic>, we used a variant containing S65C and three internal introns (identical to the variant in pPD95.75).</p>
        <p>For <italic>Ppeel-1::PEEL-1<sub>12a.a.</sub>::GFP</italic>, the PEEL-1 leader peptide was added by extending the promoter fragment to include the first 12 amino acids of PEEL-1. This signal peptide was discovered while we were investigating a possible regulatory role of the first intron of <italic>peel-1</italic>. We had generated a GFP reporter driven by the <italic>peel-1</italic> promoter and the first intron of <italic>peel-1</italic>, and this construct also happened to carry the first 12 amino acids of PEEL-1. GFP driven by this construct was packaged into sperm (unpublished data), and in order to confirm that sperm packaging was caused by the leader peptide, rather than the intron, we generated <italic>Ppeel-1::PEEL-1<sub>12a.a.</sub>::GFP</italic> (which excludes the first intron). Conversely, we also generated a reporter carrying the first intron and a randomized leader peptide, and for this construct, no sperm packaging was observed (unpublished data).</p>
        <p>To tag PEEL-1 with GFP, the promoter fragment was extended even further to include the entire <italic>peel-1</italic> gene, up to (but excluding) the stop codon.</p>
        <p>All three constructs were injected into EG4322 or QX1409, and single-copy insertions were obtained using the direct insertion MosSCI method <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-FrokjaerJensen1">[59]</xref>.

Embryos were then washed three times in PBST and incubated overnight with the primary antibody diluted in PBST+1% BSA. MH2, MH4, and MH5 were diluted 1/150, and DM5.6 was diluted 1/1,000. Embryos were washed three times in PBST and incubated overnight with Alexa488-labeled anti-mouse (1/500) (Invitrogen), diluted in PBST+1% BSA. Embryos were washed again three times in PBST and mounted in Vectashield mounting media with DAPI.</p>

        <title>Phylogenetic Analysis of <italic>zeel-1</italic></title>
        <p>Separate phylogenetic trees were built for (i) <italic>zyg-11</italic> and all <italic>zyg-11</italic> homologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic> and (ii) <italic>zyg-11</italic> and all <italic>zyg-11</italic> homologs in <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>C. briggsae</italic>, <italic>C. remanei</italic>, and <italic>C. japonica</italic>. <italic>zyg-11</italic> homologs were defined as all genes carrying the <italic>zyg-11</italic>-like leucine-rich repeat region. After removing the predicted transmembrane domains of ZEEL-1, Y71A12B.17, and Y55F3C.9, all protein sequences were aligned using MUSCLE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Edgar1">[66]</xref>. The alignments were performed using the BLOSUM30 substitution matrix, a gap open penalty of −10, and a gap extend penalty of −1. The <italic>C. elegans</italic>–only alignment was trimmed to exclude residues having gaps in more than 90% of sequences, and the multi-species alignment was trimmed using the heuristic method, <italic>automated1</italic>, from TrimAL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-CapellaGutierrez1">[67]</xref>, which is optimized for maximum likelihood tree construction. Finally, phylogenetic trees were constructed using PhyML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Guindon1">[68]</xref>, using the LG substitution model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Le1">[69]</xref>, zero invariant sites, and four substitution rate categories. Branch support was determined using bootstrap sampling with 100 replicates.</p>
        <p>Divergence between <italic>zeel-1</italic> and <italic>Y71A12B.17</italic> was determined by aligning the two proteins with MUSCLE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Edgar1">[66]</xref>, trimming the alignment of gaps, and using PAML <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Goldman1">[70]</xref> to calculate synonymous site divergence on the corresponding nucleotide sequences. (The total length of gaps was less than 0.1% of the length of the total alignment.) The summary statistics are as follows: number of synonymous sites = 715.5; number of non-synonymous sites = 2,002.5; synonymous substitutions per site (<italic>d</italic><sub>S</sub>) = 1.0709; non-synonymous substitutions per site (<italic>d</italic><sub>N</sub>) = 0.3267.</p>

        <title>Heat-Shock</title>
        <p>Adults and larvae were heat-shocked by submerging sealed agar plates in a 34°C water bath for 1 h. Embryos were heat-shocked by mounting embryos on an agar pad, incubating the slide at 19–20°C for the prescribed number of hours before placing the slide on the floor of a sealed, 1 cm×8 cm×8 cm plastic box, and submerging the box in a 34°C water bath for 20 min. After heat-shock, embryos were imaged every 20 min for at least 10 h. Initially, embryos were staged directly by collecting and mounting four-cell embryos. Later, when it became clear that the vast majority of heat-shocked embryos developed to the 2-fold stage without defects or delay, throughput was increased by collecting mixed stage embryos and mounting, incubating, and heat-shocking as above. These embryos were staged relative to the time at which they initiated elongation and by comparing their morphology before heat-shock to images of embryos that had been staged using the direct method.</p>

For each cell type, the percent of cells killed by the arrays was calculated assuming that all dead cells had inherited the array.

(A) Wild isolate EG4348 was crossed to Bristol and Hawaii, and lethality was scored among embryos collected from self-fertilizing F1 hermaphrodites and F1 males backcrossed to Hawaii hermaphrodites. A control cross, using F1 individuals derived from a cross between Bristol and Hawaii, was performed in parallel. (B) Embryo lethality was scored among embryos collected from three crosses: (i) self-fertilizing <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)/zeel-1(+)peel-1(+)</italic> hermaphrodites, (ii) self-fertilizing <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)/zeel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)peel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)</italic> hermaphrodites, and (iii) <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)/zeel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)peel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)</italic> males mated to <italic>zeel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)peel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)/zeel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)peel-1(</italic>Δ<italic>)</italic> hermaphrodites. The allelic nature of <italic>peel-1</italic> on the haplotype carrying <italic>zeel-1(tm3419)</italic> is purposefully omitted because the goal of this experiment was to determine whether the deletion <italic>tm3419</italic> disrupts <italic>peel-1</italic> activity. Expected values were calculated under the hypothesis that <italic>tm3419</italic> creates a null allele of <italic>zeel-1</italic> but does not affect <italic>peel-1</italic>. Among embryos sired by hermaphrodites, slight decreases from 25% and 100% are expected because the paternal-effect killing is not fully penetrant when sperm derive from hermaphrodites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001115-Seidel1">[13]</xref>. (C) Absence of <italic>peel-1</italic> activity in EG4348 is genetically linked to <italic>bli-3</italic>, which is located on the left-hand tip of chromosome I, 10 cM from the <italic>peel-1</italic> interval. EG4348 was crossed to a strain of the Bristol background carrying <italic>bli-3(e767)</italic>, and F2 chromosomes were scored for <italic>peel-1</italic> activity and presence of the <italic>bli-3(e767)</italic> allele.</p>
