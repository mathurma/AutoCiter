<p>The prediction of functional RNA structures has attracted increased interest, as it allows us to study the potential functional roles of many genes. RNA structure prediction methods, however, assume that there is a unique functional RNA structure and also do not predict functional features required for <italic>in vivo</italic> folding. In order to understand how functional RNA structures form <italic>in vivo</italic>, we require sophisticated experiments or reliable prediction methods. So far, there exist only a few, experimentally validated transient RNA structures. On the computational side, there exist several computer programs which aim to predict the co-transcriptional folding pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>, but these make a range of simplifying assumptions and do not capture all features known to influence RNA folding <italic>in vivo</italic>. We want to investigate if evolutionarily related RNA genes fold in a similar way <italic>in vivo</italic>. To this end, we have developed a new computational method, T<sc>ransat</sc>, which detects conserved helices of high statistical significance. We introduce the method, present a comprehensive performance evaluation and show that T<sc>ransat</sc> is able to predict the structural features of known reference structures including pseudo-knotted ones as well as those of known alternative structural configurations. T<sc>ransat</sc> can also identify unstructured sub-sequences bound by other molecules and provides evidence for new helices which may define folding pathways, supporting the notion that homologous RNA sequence not only assume a similar reference RNA structure, but also fold similarly. Finally, we show that the structural features predicted by T<sc>ransat</sc> differ from those assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. Unlike the existing methods for predicting folding pathways, our method works in a comparative way. This has the disadvantage of not being able to predict features as function of time, but has the considerable advantage of highlighting conserved features and of not requiring a detailed knowledge of the cellular environment.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many non-coding genes exert their function via an RNA structure which starts emerging while the RNA sequence is being transcribed from the genome. The resulting folding pathway is known to depend on a variety of features such as the transcription speed, the concentration of various ions and the binding of proteins and other molecules. Not all of these influences can be adequately captured by the existing computational methods which try to replicate what happens <italic>in vivo</italic>. So far, it has been challenging to experimentally investigate co-transcriptional folding pathways <italic>in vivo</italic> and only little data from <italic>in vitro</italic> experiments exists. In order to investigate if functionally similar RNA sequences from different organisms fold in a similar way, we have developed a new computational method, called T<sc>ransat</sc>, which does not require the detailed computational modeling of the cellular environment. We show in a comprehensive analysis that our method is capable of detecting known structural features and provide evidence that structural features of the <italic>in vivo</italic> folding pathways have been conserved for several biologically interesting classes of RNA sequences.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>RNA molecules play diverse roles in many of the most basic cellular processes. In the translation process, for instance, the protein coding ‘message’ is encoded in a messenger RNA (mRNA) and transfer RNAs (tRNAs) and ribosomal RNAs (rRNAs) are involved in this catalytic process. Micro RNAs are implicated in regulating mRNA availability. A range of other non-protein-coding RNAs (ncRNAs) have been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Eddy1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mattick1">[2]</xref>. Moreover, studies of mammalian transcriptomes have found, rather surprisingly, that the majority of the genome is transcribed, and that the vast majority of transcripts do not overlap with known protein-coding regions, hinting at the possibility that many functionally important classes of ncRNAs remain to be discovered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mattick1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Carninci1">[3]</xref>.</p>
<p>For many classes of ncRNA molecules studied so far, RNA structure plays a crucial part in defining its functional role in the cell. We know, for example, that tRNAs assume a distinct three-dimensional conformation in order to function properly during translation and that the functional configuration of the ribosome complex relies both, on properly folded rRNAs as well as many proteins binding to the respective rRNAs. In contrast to proteins, we can typically learn a lot about an RNA's functionality by studying only its secondary structure, i.e. the set of base-pairing nucleotide positions in the RNA sequence. This is the case because most RNA sequences studied so far fold in a hierarchical manner, with the secondary structure emerging first and the tertiary contacts between secondary structure elements emerging later.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, an RNA molecule is synthesized during transcription and will immediately start to fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Boyle1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Kramer1">[5]</xref>. A succession of cellular events — involving, for example, splicing, RNA editing, the binding of proteins, metabolites or other RNA molecules — may influence the kinetic, co-transcriptional folding pathway <italic>in vivo</italic> which yields one or more biologically active, i.e. functional structural confirmations.</p>
<p>The view that one RNA sequence has one functional RNA structure turns out to be too simplistic. We know by now of several cases, where a given RNA sequence has more than one functionally important RNA structure, e.g. ribo-switches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Nudler1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Tucker1">[8]</xref> which change their structure upon binding a metabolite, as well as cases, where a transient RNA structure is functionally important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Repsilber1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-RoChoi1">[10]</xref>. We therefore propose to develop a method which allows us to identify evolutionarily conserved structural elements which are likely to be required for the formation of the functional structures <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>There exist by now a wide range of computational methods that can predict an RNA secondary structure given an RNA sequence. Many of these methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mathews1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Zuker2">[14]</xref> in particular earlier methods, aim to predict the thermodynamically most stable RNA secondary structure. Many biological systems, however, are not in thermodynamic equilibrium. The predictions of these so-called minimum-free energy (MFE) methods depend on the underlying energy parameters which in turn depend on the temperature, the ion concentration and other parameters. Theoretical studies of RNA molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Morgan1">[15]</xref> have shown that the thermodynamic structure of even moderately long RNA molecules often does not correspond to the functional RNA structure that has been conserved during evolution, i.e. the RNA structure that exerts the biological function <italic>in vivo</italic>. This may, at least partly, be due to co-transcriptional folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Boyle1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Kramer1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Meyer1">[16]</xref>. More recent structure prediction methods use a comparative approach which simultaneously analyzes several evolutionarily related RNA sequences from different organisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Hofacker2">[17]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Meyer2">[32]</xref>. Detailed structural studies employing several dedicated evolutionary models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Pedersen1">[21]</xref> find that the substitution rate in base-paired regions is reduced by a factor of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and in loop and bulges by a factor of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with respect to the substitution rate in un-structured regions, i.e. that loops and bulges tend to evolve significantly slower than un-structured regions and only slightly faster than base-paired regions at least in set of RNA structures investigated in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Pedersen1">[21]</xref>. This is in line with our expectation that loops and bulges are on average more likely to be bound by other molecules (RNAs, DNAs or proteins) than unstructured regions. These comparative methods aim to detect the RNA secondary structure that has been conserved during evolution. The implicit assumption made by these methods is that evolutionarily conserved structures are likely to be functionally important which has been shown to be a reasonable assumption. The performance of these comparative methods is – generally speaking – higher than that of non-comparative methods <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gardner1">[33]</xref> provided the input data are high-quality multiple-sequence alignments or the method is capable of generating a multiple-sequence alignment as part of its predictions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Perriquet1">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Holmes1">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Meyer2">[32]</xref>. All of the above computational methods, however, only aim to predict a single RNA structure and cannot be used to detect the presence of transient RNA structures or the presence of multiple functional RNA structures such as, for example, ribo-switches which are known to have two distinct functional structures.</p>
<p>The program RNA<sc>subopt</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Wuchty1">[34]</xref> takes a single RNA sequence as input and predicts a list of all structures below a certain energy cutoff. Enumerating enough structures to capture most of the structure probability, however, is only possible for short sequences. Moreover, since the total number of possible structures is so vast, the probability of any particular structure is not a reliable indicator for identifying potential alternative structures. Rather, one would like to group similar structures together, and identify groups with a high overall probability. Voss <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Voss1">[35]</xref> formalize this grouping process by defining abstraction functions in order to map structures to ‘RNA shapes’, and are capable of calculating the total probability for a given shape. The runtime for this method grows exponentially with sequence length, making it impractical for sequences longer than about 400 nucleotides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Janssen1">[36]</xref>. It is possible, however, to sample structures from the Boltzmann distribution in polynomial time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Ding1">[37]</xref>, and to then apply the RNA shapes abstraction in order to estimate the shape probability for longer sequences. This approach is capable of recovering alternative structures for some ribo-switches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Voss1">[35]</xref>. All of the above approaches assume the RNA sequence to be in thermodynamic equilibrium and are thus limited to identifying alternative structures which occupy a significant portion of the Boltzmann distribution. For co-transcriptionally folding RNA sequences (which may become kinetically trapped), this assumption does not necessarily hold and the time-averaged probabilities for different structural configurations encountered during the kinetic folding may differ markedly from their respective probabilities derived from the Boltzmann distribution.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, RNA molecules are known to fold co-transcriptionally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Boyle1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Kramer1">[5]</xref>, i.e. while they emerge during transcription. The resulting kinetic folding pathway can depend on a variety of events during and after transcription such as the speed of transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Repsilber1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Lewicki1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Chao1">[39]</xref>, splicing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Neugebauer1">[40]</xref>, RNA editing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Morse1">[41]</xref>, the binding of proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Herschlag1">[42]</xref>, metabolites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Winkler2">[43]</xref> and other RNA molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Lee1">[44]</xref>, the temperature and the concentrations of monovalent and divalent ions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Pyle1">[45]</xref>. The co-transcriptional folding pathway can differ significantly from the re-folding one <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-HeilmannMiller1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Zhang1">[47]</xref>, both in terms of time line and structural features.</p>
<p>The increasing interest in RNA folding pathways has spurred the development of computational methods for RNA structure prediction which take the folding kinetics explicitly into account. These methods try to model the physical process by which an unfolded RNA folds into its functional conformation(s) as a continuous-time Markov process which allows only local rearrangements of secondary structures. If we knew all entries of the transition rate matrix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> containing the transition rates between all pairs of possible structures, the vector of probabilities for all structures at a given time could be calculated as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As the state space of all possible secondary structures can be very large for RNAs of biological interest, it is generally not feasible to calculate the full transition matrix. However, folding trajectories can be sampled using Monte Carlo stochastic simulation of the Markov process. Several programs, including RNA<sc>kinetics</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mironov1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Danilova1">[50]</xref>, K<sc>infold</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Flamm1">[51]</xref> and K<sc>inefold</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Isambert1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Xayaphoummine2">[54]</xref>, employ this method, though they differ significantly in their implementation.</p>
<p>Mironov and Lebedev <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mironov2">[49]</xref> were the first to model the co-transcriptional folding of an emerging RNA sequence and to allow entire helices not only to form, but also to disintegrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mironov3">[55]</xref>. The transition probabilities of their Markov chain Monte-Carlo method correspond to the chemical rate constants for forming and disintegrating helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mironov1">[48]</xref> and thus have a clear physical interpretation. Their theoretical framework could be readily extended to also deal with pseudo-knotted RNA secondary structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mironov2">[49]</xref>.</p>
<p>K<sc>infold</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Flamm1">[51]</xref> defines legal transitions as the formation, disruption, or shifting of a single base-pair. The folding trajectories it generates are therefore very fine-grained, specifying when each base-pair is added or removed. In K<sc>inefold</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Isambert1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Xayaphoummine2">[54]</xref>, transitions add or remove entire helices, a simplification which reduces the number of legal transitions from any state, but which also requires a more complex estimation of the transition state energy. The program assumes that the energy barrier is the energy required to nucleate three base pairs of a new helix, plus the energy required to displace any helices blocking the formation of the new helix. K<sc>inefold</sc> also allows for pseudo-knotted structures, which requires a more complicated energy model than the standard Turner model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Mathews4">[56]</xref> used by K<sc>infold</sc> (which ignores pseudo-knots). K<sc>inefold</sc> also takes into account some topological constraints induced by pseudo-knots which may kinetically trap other helices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Xayaphoummine2">[54]</xref>. Both programs can simulate the folding from an unfolded state as well as the co-transcriptional folding of an emerging sequence. The latter is done by dividing the sequence into transcribed and un-transcribed regions whose boundary shifts 5′ to 3′ at a certain rate, and restricting legal moves to those that form no base-pairs in the un-transcribed region. Neither of these two programs can model dynamic transcription speeds, although there is experimental evidence that transcriptional pausing influences the folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Wong1">[57]</xref>.</p>
<p>Other computational approaches for predicting kinetic folding pathways consider energy landscapes in order to reduce the size of the state-space. The energy landscape can be viewed as a barrier tree, where the local minima are leaves in the tree which are connected to one or more gradient basins via saddle-points. Saddle-points are the lowest energy structures that connect the gradient basins around these local minima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Flamm1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Flamm2">[58]</xref>. Constructing such a barrier tree representation of the energy landscape requires the consideration of all possible structures. Barrier trees constructed from a list of the lowest-energy structures (generated with RNA<sc>subopt</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Wuchty1">[34]</xref>) typically capture the most relevant features of the energy landscape for sufficiently short sequences (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> base pairs (bp)). In order to reduce the state space, Wolfinger <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Wolfinger1">[59]</xref> define the state-space as the basins around local minima of the energy landscape, and calculate the transition rates between adjacent basins using a variation of the so-called flooding algorithm used to construct barrier trees. Barrier trees are also useful for interpreting folding trajectories sampled with Monte Carlo simulations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Flamm1">[51]</xref>. A similar approach is taken by Tang <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Tang1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Tang2">[61]</xref>, where the folding landscape is approximated by a probabilistic road map which defines the allowed transitions between states. They restrict the state-space to a set of secondary structures probabilistically sampled from the Boltzmann distribution. Transitions are only allowed to the nearest <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> neighbors, with energy barriers estimated heuristically. Ideally, these states should capture the main features of the folding landscape while being few enough to solve the master equation (though it is also possible to do Monte Carlo simulation here). Zhang and Chen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Zhang2">[62]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Cao1">[64]</xref> partition the structure space into clusters based on the presence or absence of certain (somewhat arbitrarily chosen) rate-limiting base-stacks, which have particularly high energy barriers to their formation or disruption. The distribution of structures within clusters is assumed to be at thermodynamic equilibrium, so the transition rates between clusters can be calculated by summing the rates of transition between the structures at the boundaries of clusters, adjusted for the probability of the boundary structure in its cluster. All of these thermodynamic-landscape-based methods, however, are not applicable to the analysis of co-transcriptional folding, since an RNA's energy landscape changes while it is being transcribed. By calculating energy landscapes for all partially transcribed subsequences and then mapping the local minima from each landscape onto its successor, however, one could – in theory – adapt landscape-based methods to co-transcriptional folding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Heine1">[65]</xref>.</p>
<p>Long sequences are problematic for all the above methods since the number of possible secondary structures, and therefore the worst-case complexity of the energy landscape, grows exponentially with the sequence length. The K<sc>inwalker</sc> program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Geis1">[66]</xref> was designed to allow the analysis of the folding kinetics for long sequences (around 1000 bp). For this, it dispenses with simulation and instead deterministically predicts a potential co-transcription folding pathway which is pieced together from heuristically chosen combinations of pre-computed minimum free-energy (MFE) structures for short sub-sequences and assumes (similar to MFE methods for RNA structure prediction) the pseudo-knot free MFE structure to be the final RNA structure. The method can be considered kinetic in that it allows the incorporation of an MFE sub-structure only if the energy barrier between the current structure and the resulting merged structure that the transition can occur within a reasonable time, i.e. before the next transcription step. Calculating the energy barrier between two arbitrary structures, however, has been shown to be NP-complete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Manuch1">[67]</xref>. K<sc>inwalker</sc> thus employs a further heuristic for estimating these barriers. In summary, K<sc>inwalker</sc> aims to find the MFE structure at each transcription step, subject to the constraint that the transitions between structures be kinetically feasible.</p>
<p>All of the above prediction methods take at most the RNA sequence itself, the temperature, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> concentration and a constant transcription speed into account, but do not capture any potential interactions with other molecules or other features of the biological environment which may influence the folding pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>. The latter is difficult to do, not only because we typically lack information on the interaction partners and the mechanisms and timing of their interactions, but also because we cannot easily capture the wealth of relevant details of the complex cellular environment in a computationally tractable model. The performance of the existing computational methods can strongly depend on the sequence length and other features of the individual input sequence. This is not surprising given that any errors in the early stages of the folding pathway prediction are magnified as the folding progresses. A precise knowledge of the transcription start site i.e. the 5′ end of the RNA sequence is thus crucial. The prediction performance of the existing methods has thus only been evaluated on very small data sets.</p>
<p>It is also challenging to study kinetic folding pathways experimentally. There exist by now a range of powerful experimental techniques for studying large sets of RNA sequences in an ensemble-averaged way such as UV melting, isothermal titration calometry, circular dichroism, chemical foot-printing and, more recently, single-molecule techniques such as fluorescence correlation spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Onoa1">[68]</xref>, single-molecule fluorescence resonance energy transfer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Krishanthi1">[69]</xref> and force spectroscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-ClausenSchaumann1">[70]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Hyeon1">[71]</xref>. These experimental methods, however, still await to be taken from the test tube to the cell in order to explore how RNA sequences fold <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Alemn1">[72]</xref>.</p>

<title>Motivation</title>
<p>If a structural feature is functionally important, it is typically well conserved in groups of related RNAs, even if the level of primary sequence conservation may be low. These conserved structural features can be detected in alignments of several evolutionarily related RNA sequence by identifying pairs of alignment columns where the base-pairing potential, but not necessarily the primary sequence itself has been conserved. This analysis of these so-called co-varying alignment columns is even capable of identifying tertiary structure motifs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gutell1">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Yeang1">[74]</xref>. Functionally equivalent RNA sequences from related organisms tend to be more conserved in terms of RNA structure than primary sequence, making it often challenging to establish high-quality sequence alignments based on primary sequence conservation only. Theoretically, all functional helices, regardless of their stability or transience, should be evolutionarily conserved (though not necessarily equally conserved), and comparative methods should therefore be capable of identifying functional transient or alternative structures. Moreover, evolution acts on <italic>in vivo</italic> structures, which may be influenced by protein-binding, RNA binding in <italic>trans</italic> or other local factors. These interactions would need to be taken into account by non-comparative methods which try to replicate the co-transcriptional folding process, but are currently ignored. Comparative methods, however, do not necessarily require information on interaction partners because they derive their predictions from the observed patterns of covariation. One can even argue that comparative methods may be able to <italic>predict</italic> single-stranded binding sites by identifying regions which are devoid of conserved structural features.</p>
<p>We have devised T<sc>ransat</sc> as a comparative method which takes as input a fixed multiple-sequence alignment of evolutionarily related RNA sequences from different organisms and an evolutionary tree relating these sequences. It employs a multiple step strategy in order to predict a set of conserved helices that can be considered statistically significant.</p>

<title>Identifying conserved helices and calculating their log-likelihood values</title>
<p>In the first step, T<sc>ransat</sc> determines helices for each individual, un-gapped sequence of the input alignment. We define a helix to consists of 4 or more consecutive consensus base-pairs which are <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the next step, the helices of the individual sequences are mapped onto the input alignment, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g001">Figure 1</xref> for details. This procedure produces many helices spanning <italic>all</italic> sequences of the multiple sequence alignment and ensures that the impact of alignment errors is minimized. We call these helices conserved helices. For each conserved helix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we then compute the log-likelihood score as follows:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the length of the helix in base-pairs, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> corresponds to the hypothesis that the alignment columns of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are base-paired and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the hypothesis that the alignment columns of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are un-paired, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g002">Figure 2</xref>.

<title>T<sc>ransat</sc>: Mapping of helices to the alignment.</title>
<p>T<sc>ransat</sc> first predicts the helices for all individual sequences in the fixed input alignment and then maps all of them to the alignment remembering the base-pairing sequence positions. In the example above, there are two helices, one derives from sequence 1 (see top figure), the other one from sequence 2. Mapping these two helices from their respective sequence to the entire alignment results in the two potential conserved helices shown above (see the arcs linking the respective alignment columns). Both conserved helices are then evaluated by T<sc>ransat</sc> in terms of log-likelihood value and p-value estimation. The log-likelihood value is calculated based on the base-paired alignment columns in that helix and all sequences in the alignment, see the text and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g002">Figure 2</xref> for details. All helices predicted by T<sc>ransat</sc> for a given input alignment can then be ranked according to their p-value. For the two helices in the example above, the helix that fits the sequences in the given alignment better will have the higher log-likelihood value and lower p-value. As T<sc>ransat</sc> is not capable of modifying the fixed input alignment, this mapping strategy minimized the impact of alignment errors.</p>

The Felsenstein algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Felsenstein1">[75]</xref> is a recursive algorithm which calculates the likelihood by moving from the leaf nodes of the evolutionary tree, i.e. the observed nucleotides and gaps in the corresponding alignment column or pair of alignment columns, via the internal tree nodes to the root node of the tree.</p>
<p>In contrast to the customary way of calculating the likelihood, we interpret one-sided gaps in base-paired alignment columns as non-consensus base-pairs rather than missing information. Two-sided gaps, however, are still treated as missing information which amounts to summing over all possible base-pairs when moving “up the tree” in the Felsenstein calculation. This treatment of two-sided gaps makes sense as the length of a helix can shrink or expand over time <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Holmes2">[76]</xref>. One-sided gaps, however, cannot be interpreted as the loss or gain of an entire base-pair and we therefore regard them as non-consensus base-pair.</p>
<p>In the likelihood calculation for two base-paired alignment columns, the Felsenstein algorithm traverses the tree from the leaf nodes (i.e. the observed nucleotides in two base-paired alignment columns) via the internal nodes to the root node of the tree. It sums over <italic>all</italic> possible nucleotide pairs at the internal nodes, weighing each possibility according to the corresponding entry of the pair rate matrix. If we interpret a gap in the base-pair <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as missing information (as is customary), the Felsenstein algorithm takes <italic>all</italic> base-pairs, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, probabilistically in account at the corresponding <italic>leaf node</italic> thereby including two consensus pairs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The likelihood of going from <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the next internal tree node is dominated by the two good options, whereas we argue that it is conceptually more appropriate to interpret the gap as character which cannot base-pair with the other nucleotide (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in this case). This is also in line with what we know about the evolution of RNA secondary structure, namely that helices tends to lose or acquire entire base-pairs, not half-pairs. Using our modified likelihood calculation which treats one-sided gaps as non-consensus base-pairs rather than missing information significantly increases our ability to distinguish base-paired from un-paired alignment columns.</p>

<title>Estimating p-values</title>
<p>The ability of an RNA sequences to form random helices is known to strongly depend on the sequence itself, in particular its length and its nucleotide and di-nucleotide composition. The log-likelihood value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> alone is thus typically not a reliable indicator of whether or not a helix <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e061" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> should be considered real. In order to correct for the fact that different RNA sequences have a higher chance of forming random helices than others, we estimate the p-value for the log-likelihood value of each conserved helix. This estimation procedure is done as follows for each input alignment separately.</p>
<p>In the first step, the input alignment is realigned based primary sequence conservation only using T-C<sc>offee</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Notredame1">[77]</xref>. The purpose of the realignment step is to remove patterns that are only supported by secondary structure conservation and patterns that may have been introduced by human experts. The realigned alignment is then randomized following the procedure described by Washietl and Hofacker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Washietl1">[78]</xref>. This involves first binning the alignment columns according to their primary sequence similarity and gap composition and then swapping alignment columns only within bins. This procedure ensures that a column can only be swapped for another column with a similar gap pattern and level of sequence conservation.</p>
<p>For each original alignment, we generate 500 randomized alignments. For each shuffled alignment (which we assume to no longer contain any real helices), we detect “conserved” helices that may have appeared by chance and then calculate their log-likelihood values. Both are done in the same way as for the original input alignment. We then combine the log-likelihood values from all 500 randomized alignments into a single histogram of log-likelihood values and use the resulting distribution to assign p-values to the log-likelihood values of the conserved helices in the original input alignment. Conserved helices in alignments with a high structure-formation potential thus require – generally speaking – larger log-likelihood values in order to be considered significant than helices in alignments where the overall structure-formation potential is lower. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g003">Figure 3</xref> summarizes the strategy employed by T<sc>ransat</sc>. The number of randomized alignments that it is to be generated for each input alignment to T<sc>ransat</sc> is an input parameter to one of the programs of the T<sc>ransat</sc> software package that can be easily adjusted by the user. The number of randomized alignments should be increased if significantly lower p-values are to be studied.</p>

In the first step, the original T<sc>ransat</sc> input alignment is realigned based on primary sequence conservation only. In the second step, the columns of the resulting alignment are permuted multiple times, resulting in 500 shuffled versions of the original alignment. For each shuffled alignment, conserved helices are detected and their log-likelihood values calculated as for the original alignment. In the final step, the log-likelihood values of all helices in the shuffled alignments are entered into a histogram which is then used to derive p-values for the helices of the original alignment.</p>

The mean fraction of canonical base-pairs corresponds to the proportion of consensus base-pairs in the base-paired alignment columns of the consensus structure. The closer this fraction is to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e067" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the better the consensus structure is supported by all sequences in the seed alignment. The covariation measures the fraction of base-paired alignment columns that are supported by mutations which maintain the base-pairing ability, but alter the nucleotides forming the base-pair.</p>
<p>Applying these four selection criteria, we arrive at a data set of 134 seed alignments which contain 6 to 712 sequences (average is 60 sequences) and whose length ranges from 100 to 1247 bp (average is 221 bp). The total tree length of these alignments ranges from 0.4 to 116.3, the average being 10.0. We call this data set the R<sc>fam</sc> data set.</p>

<title>The artificial data set</title>
<p>In order to be able to investigate the dependence of the performance on the alignment length and the total tree length in detail, we generate an artificial data set comprising a total of 990 alignments. Each alignment in this artificial dataset is generated as follows. In the first step, an RNA secondary structure from the RNA STRAND database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Andronescu1">[86]</xref>, a total tree length, and a desired number of sequences in the alignment is chosen. In the second step, a balanced, binary tree is generated where all branches have the same length. In the third step, the alignment itself is generated by assigning a nucleotide to each position in the alignment (or pair of positions when dealing with alignment columns which are base-paired in the corresponding RNA structure) from the respective equilibrium distribution, and then following the tree from its root to the leaves, assigning nucleotides to each node in the tree based on the transition matrices derived from the appropriate rate matrix. We use the same equilibrium distributions and rate matrices as P<sc>fold</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Knudsen2">[20]</xref> and S<sc>imul</sc>F<sc>old</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Meyer2">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>Structures selected from the RNA STRAND database were binned according to their sequence length (100–199, 200–299, etc. up to 900–999). For the tree length experiment, 10 structures were selected at random from each bin, and for each structure, alignments of 10 sequences were generated with total tree lengths of 0.5, 1, 2, 4, 8, and 16. The artificial data set for which the tree experiments were performed thus consists of 540 artificial alignments. For the alignment length experiment, 50 structures were selected at random from each bin. For each structure, we generated an alignment with 10 sequences and a total tree length of 4. The artificial data set for which the length experiments were performed consists therefore of 450 artificial alignments.</p>

<title>The <italic>hok</italic> data set</title>
<p>The <italic>hok/sok</italic> system in the R1 plasmid of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> is responsible for maintaining the plasmid's presence through successive generations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gerdes1">[87]</xref>. It comprises three genes: the <italic>hok</italic> (‘host-killing’) gene encoding a protein toxin, the <italic>mok</italic> (‘modulation of killing’) gene required for <italic>hok</italic> translation, and the <italic>sok</italic> (‘suppression of killing’) gene which blocks the translation of <italic>mok</italic>, thereby repressing <italic>hok</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gerdes2">[88]</xref>. The <italic>hok/sok</italic> system expresses two constitutively transcripts. One transcript, called the <italic>hok</italic> transcript, where the <italic>hok</italic> and <italic>mok</italic> reading frames overlap, and the other transcript corresponding to the <italic>sok</italic> RNA gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gerdes3">[89]</xref>. The <italic>hok/sok</italic> system stabilizes the plasmid by killing daughter cells that lack the plasmid after fission from the plasmid-containing parent. The way this happens is that daughter cells soon run out of <italic>sok</italic> transcripts to suppress <italic>hok</italic> translation because the constitutively-expressed <italic>hok</italic> transcript is more stable than the the also constitutively-expressed <italic>sok</italic> transcript which degrades quickly. The RNA structure of the <italic>hok</italic> transcript is key to this mechanism.</p>
<p>As the <italic>hok</italic> transcript emerges, it forms a metastable structure, which blocks the ribosomal binding sites for the <italic>hok</italic> and <italic>mok</italic> gene, thereby preventing premature ribosome loading. Once the whole transcript has been produced, the transcript adopts a stable inactive RNA structure. However, 3′ processing of this transcript allows the transcript to rearrange into the active structure, which is translationally active unless the <italic>sok</italic> transcript is bound to it. This metastable structure is likely to also guide the folding into the stable inactive structure (which comprises a ‘long-distance’ helix that pairs a region at the 5′ end of the transcript to a region near its 3′ end), preventing premature formation of the active structure.</p>
<p>A review of the <italic>hok/sok</italic> mechanism can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gerdes2">[88]</xref>. Several evolutionarily related toxin/antitoxin systems have been identified, and the alignment of their transcripts reveal covariation patterns consistent with each of these structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gultyaev1">[90]</xref>. We choose the alignment from Gerdes <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gerdes2">[88]</xref> which contains several more members of the <italic>hok</italic> family. It comprises a total of 9 sequences, has a length of 196 bp and a total tree length of 2.31. As this alignment provides only an outline of the helices, we manually derived the exact consensus structure from the observed evolutionary pattern. The Gerdes alignment does not cover the entire length of the <italic>hok</italic> transcript, but comprises the regions with most structural rearrangements.</p>

<title>The <italic>trp</italic>-attenuator data set</title>
<p>The <italic>trp</italic>-attenuator is a ribo-switch which regulates transcription of the <italic>trp</italic>-operon in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Yanofsky1">[91]</xref>. It is located in the leader peptide region of the <italic>trp</italic>-operon transcript, and can form three different helices. Two of the helices, the helix involving regions 1 and 2 (called the 1∶2 helix) and the 3∶4 helix (the numbering of regions is from 5′ to 3′), are mutually compatible, whereas the third 2∶3 helix is incompatible with either of the two other helices.</p>
<p>The formation of the 1∶2 helix during transcription causes the RNA-polymerase to pause. If a ribosome starts translation, it disrupts the 1∶2 helix as soon as it reaches region 1 of the transcript, thus freeing the RNA-polymerase. If tryptophan is limited, the ribosome will pause at the tryptophan codon in region 1, thereby allowing helix 2∶3 to form and simultaneously preventing the formation of the 3∶4 helix which serves as a terminator stem which ends transcription. This allows the <italic>trp</italic>-operon to be fully transcribed. If tryptophan is not limiting, however, the ribosome disrupts the 2∶3 helix, thereby allowing the 3∶4 helix to form and to terminate the transcription.</p>
<p>Several protein-mediated ribo-switches which regulate <italic>trp</italic>-operon activity have been identified in <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gollnick1">[92]</xref>.

<title>Performance evaluation</title>
<p>The performance of new prediction methods is best benchmarked by comparing the set of predicted to the set of known structure for an, ideally, large and diverse data set that has been carefully and completely annotated (the <italic>test set</italic>). If the prediction method depends on free parameters, these parameters should have been trained or manually derived from a <italic>training set</italic> which should have no overlap with the test test (and which has to be large and diverse enough to minimize the risk of parameter over-fitting). Typically, training and test sets are permuted several times in cross-evaluation experiments in order to show that both, the parameter training and the resulting performance are fairly independent of the particular choice of training and test set. This careful benchmarking is comparatively easy to accomplish for some applications, e.g. methods for RNA secondary structure prediction, but more difficult for others.</p>
<p>The conclusive benchmarking of computational methods for predicting kinetic folding pathways has, so far, been difficult. This is due to several reasons. First, detailed experimental results on folding kinetics, usually done via temperature- or pH-jump kinetic trapping procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Nagel1">[95]</xref> or single-molecule ‘optical-tweezer’ manipulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Harlepp1">[96]</xref>, are only available for a small number of sequences which are typically quite short (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e068" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> bp) and may, moreover, correspond to artificial sequences. Second, the assumptions made explicitly or implicitly by the prediction methods may not apply to the experimental setting. Third, there are no standard metrics for comparing experimental results with output from computational prediction methods (whose type of output varies greatly from method to method). Fourth, many computational methods (especially more heuristic ones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Geis1">[66]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Gultyaev2">[97]</xref>) rely on a number of free parameters which require a dedicated test set in order to train them reliably and to avoid overlap with the test set. Consequently, most methods for predicting the RNA folding kinetics have been evaluated via a qualitative rather than quantitative comparison and only by considering a few chosen experimentally investigated sequences.</p>
<p>T<sc>ransat</sc> has been devised to detect conserved RNA helices of statistical significance. Using T<sc>ransat</sc>, we thus hope to not only detect the helices of the known functional RNA structure, but also new helices of functional importance which may be involved in defining the RNA's folding pathway <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Performance for detecting helices of known functional RNA secondary structures</title>
<p>Comparing the helices predicted by T<sc>ransat</sc> to the helices of the known RNA secondary structures in our R<sc>fam</sc> data set should allow us to get an estimation of T<sc>ransat</sc>'s performance. For the purposes of this evaluation, we assume that the structural annotation of this data set is not only correct, but also complete.</p>
<p>As we want to know how good T<sc>ransat</sc> is at recovering helices of the known RNA secondary structure, we investigate the helix-specific performance in addition to the base-pair specific performance. We measure the performance in two ways: the sensitivity as function of the false positive rate (FPR) and the sensitivity as function of the positive predictive value (PPV).</p>
<p>As is customary, we define the sensitivity as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e069" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where TP is the number of true positives and FN is the number of false negatives. The false positive rate is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where FP is the number of false positives and TN is the number of true negatives. The positive predictive value is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The sensitivity thus measures the fraction of known features that have been correctly predicted, whereas the positive predictive value corresponds to the fraction of predicted features that are correct. As we discard predicted helices with a p-value below a user-defined threshold of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, we classify base-pairs as defined in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000823-t001">Table 1</xref>.</p>

<p>T<sc>ransat</sc>'s primary aim is to reliably detect statistically significant, conserved helices. It thus makes sense to investigate the helix-specific performance in some detail.

<p>As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g004">Figure 4</xref> shows, T<sc>ransat</sc> has almost the same performance for helices as for individual base-pairs. For many applications, one wants to maximize the sensitivity and the PPV at the same time. A good way to visualize how both performance measures vary with the p-value threshold is thus to plot the F-measure as function of the p-value threshold as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g004">Figure 4</xref>. The F-measure or F-score is defined as the harmonic mean of the sensitivity and the PPV, i.e. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The helix specific F-measure reaches its maximum value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for a p-value threshold of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, whereas the base-pair specific F-measure peaks at a p-value threshold of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with an F-measure of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Another measure which combines several performance indicators into one is the so-called Mathews correlation coefficient (MCC) which is defined as <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000823.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. It is similar, but not identical to the F-measure, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g004">Figure 4</xref>. We expect the observed sensitivity to be an indicator of T<sc>ransat</sc>'s true performance. As we do not know for sure, however, whether or not the known structural annotation is complete, i.e. if all functional helices have been annotated, the measured positive predictive value can be viewed as a lower boundary to the true performance of T<sc>ransat</sc>.</p>

<p>T<sc>ransat</sc> is a comparative method, whereas all existing methods for predicting kinetic folding pathways take a single RNA sequence as input. It is well known that the performance of comparative RNA secondary structure prediction methods depends on the number of sequences in the alignment, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Knudsen1">[19]</xref>, or, more precisely, on the total tree length of the sequences in the input alignment, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Pedersen2">[22]</xref>. In order to investigate how T<sc>ransat</sc>'s performance varies with the total tree length, we investigate the predictions for the artificial data set. We calculate the maximum-likelihood (ML) tree as the reference tree for all alignments in our artificial data set. As <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g006">Figure 6</xref> shows, the performance increases with the total tree length. This dependence is more pronounced for the sensitivity as function of the PPV than the sensitivity as function of the false positive rate.</p>

First, due to the way the artificial data set was constructed, it does not contain any conserved structural features that are not already part of the structural annotation, whereas we cannot say for sure whether or not the structural annotation of the R<sc>fam</sc> data set is really complete. This affects in particular the sensitivity as function of the positive predictive value. Second, (again due to the way the artificial data set was generated) its alignments do not contain any alignment errors and no structural variation between sequences of the same alignment, whereas the alignments of the R<sc>fam</sc> data set may be affected by both types of complications. The performance evaluation for the artificial data set thus presents only an idealized view of the program's true performance, but has the advantage of allowing us to study the influence of the alignment length and the total tree length in great detail and without having to take additional complications into account.</p>
<p>When comparing the effect of the total tree length on the performance to the effect that the alignment length has, it is clear that evolutionary diversity, i.e. the total tree length, has a much greater influence on the performance than the alignment length. This can be understood by the way that T<sc>ransat</sc> generates predictions. T<sc>ransat</sc> detects conserved helices by identifying pairs of co-varying alignment columns. We expect the amount of co-variation to strongly depend on the total tree length. If the sequences in the input alignment look very similar, i.e. if they are closely related and if the corresponding total tree length is small, the amount of co-variation will be significantly smaller than if the sequences are evolutionarily more distantly related, i.e. if the total tree length is large. If the sequences are only very distantly related, we expect structural variation to occur between the sequences, e.g. helices that have been conserved in some sequences, but not in others. This effect cannot be observed in our artificial data set, but has been shown to exist in some biological data sets, see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Pedersen2">[22]</xref>.</p>
<p>The number of possible bi-secondary RNA structures, i.e. RNA structures that can be viewed as combination of at most two secondary structure without pseudo-knots, grows exponentially with the sequence length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Stadler1">[98]</xref>. For a non-comparative method that predicts structure elements such as helices, we thus expect the PPV to significantly decrease with the sequence length. For a comparative method, however, we expect this effect to be less pronounced because there is no reason to expect the number of structural features <italic>that are supported by co-variation</italic> to also increase quadratically with the alignment length. This is, in our view, the main reason why comparative methods tend to outperform non-comparative methods. The alignment length has, however, an effect on the p-values that are estimated for the detected helices. This, more minor, effect is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g005">Figure 5</xref>.</p>

<title>Revisiting the <sc>Transat</sc> predictions for the Rfam data set</title>
<p>The R<sc>fam</sc> data set allows us to evaluate T<sc>ransat</sc>'s performance for detecting the known references structures as presented above. For this, we assume the structural annotation of the R<sc>fam</sc> data set to be both, correct and complete. Any R<sc>fam</sc> alignment, however, only corresponds to a single functional RNA secondary structure in the R<sc>fam</sc> data base and does not contain information on alternative functional RNA secondary structure or conserved transient helices. It may thus be possible to detect additional, evolutionarily conserved structural features with T<sc>ransat</sc> that are currently not part of the structural annotation. For this, we studied several R<sc>fam</sc> families in greater detail.</p>
<p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g011">Figure 11</xref> shows the T<sc>ransat</sc> predictions for the Cripavirus internal ribosomal entry site (IRES). T<sc>ransat</sc> not only detects the helices of the known, pseudo-knotted RNA secondary structure, but also predicts several transient helices of lower statistical significance which may be involved in defining the RNA's co-transcriptional folding pathway. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g011">Figure 11</xref>, it is fairly easy to manually bring all helices into an order in which they may appear in the co-transcriptional folding pathway (see helices 1 to 12).</p>

<p>T<sc>ransat</sc> predicts the helices of the pseudo-knotted known structure correctly and also predicts several transient helices which suggest a co-transcriptional folding pathway (see numbering of helices above). All predicted transient helices (helices 4, 6 and 10) are mutually incompatible with a helix of the known RNA structure. Helix 4 may yield to helix 8, helix 6 to helix 7 and helix 10 to helix 12. The transient helices may thereby guide the formation of the known functional RNA structure.</p>

<title>Comparison of the <sc>Transat</sc> predictions to the Boltzmann ensemble of RNA structures in thermodynamic equilibrium</title>
<p>It is interesting to investigate if the helices predicted by T<sc>ransat</sc> are similar to the structural features that would be present in thermodynamic equilibrium. For this, we use the program RNA<sc>alifold</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Hofacker2">[17]</xref> with the “-p” option in order to calculate the probabilities of individual base-pairs in the Boltzmann distribution of all possible (pseudo-knot free) RNA secondary structures that are expected to be present in thermodynamic equilibrium. As T<sc>ransat</sc>, RNA<sc>alifold</sc> P takes as input a fixed multiple-sequence alignment. We then compare these probabilities (i.e. those estimated by RNA<sc>alifold</sc> P for individual base-pairs) to the p-values assigned by T<sc>ransat</sc> to individual helices. Using the same strategy as we used for T<sc>ransat</sc> for deriving a sensible p-value threshold, we derive the threshold value which maximizes the performance for the R<sc>fam</sc> data set in terms of F-measure by comparing all base-pairs predicted by RNA<sc>alifold</sc> P to those of the known reference structures. This results in a probability threshold of 5% which we use to compare the predictions by RNA<sc>alifold</sc> P to those of T<sc>ransat</sc>, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g016">Figure 16</xref> to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g017"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g018"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g019"/><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g020">Figure 20</xref> as well as Figures 3 to 10 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000823.s001">Text S1</xref> (the file with supplementary information).</p>

<p>As opposed to T<sc>ransat</sc>, the structural features of the thermodynamic ensemble predicted by RNA<sc>alifold</sc> P are not able to capture the cases where more than a single functional RNA secondary structures exist, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g016">Figure 16</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g017">Figure 17</xref>. If RNA<sc>alifold</sc> P predicts new base-pairs that are not part of the known reference structure(s), these tend to extend a known helices by one or two base-pairs to either side of the helix rather than correspond to entirely new helices as T<sc>ransat</sc> does, see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g016">Figure 16</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g017">Figure 17</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000823-g018">Figure 18</xref> and Figures 6, 7 and 8 in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000823.s001">Text S1</xref>.

<p>Overall, we thus conclude that the presence of multiple functional RNA secondary structures as well as of pseudo-knotted structures is better modelled using T<sc>ransat</sc> than assuming a structural ensemble in thermodynamic equilibrium as predicted by RNA<sc>alifold</sc> P.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We devised T<sc>ransat</sc> as a method to detect the statistically significant, conserved helices of functional RNA structures, including the helices of transient, pseudo-knotted and alternative structures as they are known to exist <italic>in vivo</italic>. As we explain in detail in the introduction, it is currently not possible to model the kinetic folding of RNA structures <italic>in vivo</italic> as function of the time as we not only lack many crucial details on the cellular environment that may influence the folding pathways (i.e. which molecules bind the RNA sequence in question when and where), but also because we currently have no adequate theoretical framework that would allow us to efficiently simulate the complex cellular environment using computational methods. We circumvent these conceptual problems by devising T<sc>ransat</sc> as a comparative prediction method which takes a fixed multiple-sequence alignment of homologous RNA sequences and a tree quantifying their evolutionary relationship as input and detects evolutionarily conserved helices and estimates their statistical significance. By employing this comparative approach, we lose the ability to predict structural features of the cellular folding pathway(s) as function of the time and to detect species-specific structural features which may also be functionally important, but gain the ability to highlight statistically significant, functional helices that have been conserved <italic>without actually having to model the cellular environment nor its evolution over time</italic>.</p>
<p>Our comprehensive performance evaluation of T<sc>ransat</sc> for a large and diverse data set (comprising 1126 multiple sequence alignments ranging from 100 to 1247 bp and comprising between 6 and 712 sequences) shows that T<sc>ransat</sc> not only reliably detects the helices of known unique RNA reference structures, but that it also able to capture known pseudo-knotted structures as well as known alternative structural configurations. In addition to these known structural features, T<sc>ransat</sc> predicts a number of distinct, novel helices of statistical significance. These may, for example, correspond to well-conserved structural features of a co-transcriptional folding pathway <italic>in vivo</italic> supporting the notion that homologous RNA sequence not only assume similar functional RNA structures, but also fold in a similar way. For some examples, the additional helices suggest a pseudo-knotted functional configuration, where only a pseudo-knot free RNA structure has been annotated so far. As we show for two examples, the predictions by T<sc>ransat</sc> can also help identifying regions of an RNA sequence that are bound by other molecules and thus single-stranded because these are regions which are devoid of statistically significant helices. Detailed investigations show that T<sc>ransat</sc>'s predictions are robust with respect to alignment errors and modifications of the input tree and that its performance is fairly independent of the alignment length. T<sc>ransat</sc>'s performance is more correlated with the length of the input tree which is not surprising given that a certain degree of evolutionary diversity is required to observe pairs of co-varying alignment columns, where the base-pairing potential, but not necessarily the nucleotides forming the base-pairs has been conserved. We also find that the dominant structural features predicted by T<sc>ransat</sc> typically do not coincide with those of the Boltzmann distribution of (pseudo-knot free) RNA secondary structures if we assume thermodynamic equilibrium. In particular, we find that the presence of known pseudo-knotted reference structures and of known alternative, functional RNA structures cannot be inferred from the Boltzmann distribution, i.e. by assuming thermodynamic equilibrium. This discrepancy may be partly attributed to the fact that the Boltzmann distribution does not include pseudo-knotted RNA structures, but overall confirms our expectation that there is <italic>a priori</italic> no good reason to assume that RNA sequences <italic>in vivo</italic> are in thermodynamic equilibrium or unbound by other molecules.</p>
<p>The T<sc>ransat</sc> software is available from people.cs.ubc.ca/∼irmtraud/transat/. This web-page also contains information on the input and output files of this analysis as well as detailed documentation on how to use T<sc>ransat</sc>. Users of T<sc>ransat</sc> can rank the predicted helices according to their p-values with lower values implying higher statistical significance. Lab scientists seeking to confirm specific helices in dedicated experiments can prioritize their experiments by starting with the statistically most significant helices.</p>
<p>We hope that the predictions by T<sc>ransat</sc> will enable more comprehensive and systematic studies of RNA folding pathways and alternative structural configurations and that they will provide useful input to the design and interpretation of future experiments. Whether the near future will bring more experimental insight into how RNA sequences fold <italic>in vivo</italic> depends to a large extent on the development of new experimental techniques that would allow us to observe an RNA sequence in its cellular environment.</p>
<p>T<sc>ransat</sc> currently focuses on highly conserved structural features that are statistically significant, but ignores those that are functional, but only present in a small fraction of the input sequences. One possibility for future work is thus to extend T<sc>ransat</sc> in order to also capture structural features that are only present in a few of all input sequences. As T<sc>ransat</sc> already explicitly models the evolutionary relationship between all input sequences and the evolution of unpaired and base-paired nucleotides, this should be relatively straightforward to do. Another, more challenging possibility for future work is to take T<sc>ransat</sc> beyond the required fixed input alignment. This is partly what the program S<sc>imul</sc>F<sc>old</sc> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000823-Meyer2">[32]</xref> addresses, but would need to done for individual helices and complemented by a corresponding procedure for estimating p-values.</p>
