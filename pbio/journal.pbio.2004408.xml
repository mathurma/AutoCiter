<abstract>
<p>We show that the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B)/p27, previously known as a cell cycle inhibitor, is also localized within mitochondria. The migratory capacity of endothelial cells, which need intact mitochondria, is completely dependent on mitochondrial p27. Mitochondrial p27 improves mitochondrial membrane potential, increases adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content, and is required for the promigratory effect of caffeine. Domain mapping of p27 revealed that the N-terminus and C-terminus are required for those improvements. Further analysis of those regions revealed that the translocation of p27 into the mitochondria and its promigratory activity depend on serine 10 and threonine 187. In addition, mitochondrial p27 protects cardiomyocytes against apoptosis. Moreover, mitochondrial p27 is necessary and sufficient for cardiac myofibroblast differentiation. In addition, p27 deficiency and aging decrease respiration in heart mitochondria. Caffeine does not increase respiration in p27-deficient animals, whereas aged mice display improvement after 10 days of caffeine in drinking water. Moreover, caffeine induces transcriptome changes in a p27-dependent manner, affecting mostly genes relevant for mitochondrial processes. Caffeine also reduces infarct size after myocardial infarction in prediabetic mice and increases mitochondrial p27. Our data characterize mitochondrial p27 as a common denominator that improves mitochondria-dependent processes and define an increase in mitochondrial p27 as a new mode of action of caffeine.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The protein p27 is a nuclear cell cycle inhibitor that can be shuttled to the cytoplasm to inactivate its inhibitory role, and this mechanism is thought to be used by cancer cells to unlock cell cycle arrest. Recent reports, however, have shown that p27 has other roles independent of cell cycle regulation, and it was observed that p27 mutant mice had increased mortality to myocardial infarction. Here, we have analyzed the potential role of p27 in the major cell types of the heart and shown that it is also present in mitochondria, the cellular powerhouses, where it fulfils important functions. We find that p27 is required for migration of endothelial cells by enhancing mitochondrial functions and that caffeine concentrations reached after consumption of 4 cups of coffee induce its translocation into mitochondria. Moreover, we observe that mitochondrial p27 protects heart muscle cells from cell death and is necessary for the conversion of fibroblasts into mechanically strong, contractile myofibroblasts, a process critical after myocardial infarction. Molecularly, we show that p27 is essential for caffeine-induced gene expression changes that mainly affect mitochondria and for mitochondrial respiration. We conclude that mitochondrial p27 improves mitochondria-dependent processes in heart cells and that physiological concentrations of caffeine have a protective effect.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1B (CDKN1B), also known as p27, was initially discovered as a nuclear-localized cell cycle inhibitor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref001">1</xref>]. Previous data demonstrating that p27 can be exported to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref003">3</xref>] were considered as a mechanism to inactivate the cell cycle inhibitory effects of p27 in the nucleus and to allow human cancer cells to escape cell cycle arrest. However, McAllister and colleagues demonstrated that nonnuclear p27 is required for migration of fibroblasts, since p27-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed to migrate, while reconstitution with p27 rescued the motility defect. Its promigratory effect was independent of its cell cycle arrest functions but rather required serine 10 phosphorylation–dependent nuclear export and a C-terminal scatter domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref004">4</xref>]. Moreover, it was suggested that knockout of a cell cycle inhibitor like p27 could be beneficial in the experimental setup of myocardial infarction. This was based on the reasoning that myocardial infarction leads to loss of cells in the heart and that enhanced proliferation of cells in p27-deficient mice may result in smaller infarct size and reduced mortality; however, exactly the opposite was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref006">6</xref>]. Moreover, over the last several years, it has become evident that functional mitochondria, not only in cardiomyocytes but also in endothelial cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref008">8</xref>] and in cardiac fibroblasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref009">9</xref>], are required for proper functionality of those cells and are essential for protective actions in cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in recent years, a number of cohort studies have convincingly demonstrated that habitual coffee consumption is associated with a lower risk of developing type 2 diabetes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref011">11</xref>]. Coffee consumption was inversely correlated with total as well as cause-specific mortality, such as heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, and diabetes, whereas no relation or a positive correlation was found with cancer-related deaths [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, several studies have shown that consumption of caffeinated coffee is associated with lower risk for coronary heart disease mortality, specifically in older subjects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref015">15</xref>]. Finally, the beneficial effect of caffeine appeared to be dose-dependent, as coffee consumption of 4 cups or more per day resulted in a further reduced risk for adverse events when compared to lower coffee consumption. We established previously that 4 cups of coffee lead to a serum concentration of approximately 30 μM caffeine in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref008">8</xref>]. Therefore, mechanisms explaining the protective effects of caffeine should be attributed to serum concentrations of less than 100 μM. Over decades, the effects of caffeine have been ascribed to its antagonist activity on adenosine receptors, inhibition of phosphodiesterases (PDEs), and elevated intracellular calcium levels. Since a raise of intracellular calcium in different cell types requires at least 500 μM caffeine, which in humans would result in lethal intoxication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref018">18</xref>], effects on intracellular calcium can be excluded as a potential mechanism. Similarly, inhibition of PDEs by caffeine requires concentrations of 250 μM or higher, depending on the isoforms investigated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref020">20</xref>]. Studies regarding the responses to activation or inhibition of adenosine receptors in the cardiovascular system are controversial. Activation of the adenosine 2A receptor has beneficial effects in the infarcted porcine myocardium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref021">21</xref>], whereas blockade of the adenosine 2A receptor reduces cardiac reactive oxygen species production and expression of NADPH oxidase 2 in the heart [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref022">22</xref>]. Thus, it remains unclear whether unspecific inhibition of adenosine receptors or PDEs by caffeine could explain the protective effects of coffee consumption. Importantly, we demonstrated that caffeine in physiologically relevant concentrations improves the functional capacity of endothelial cells ex vivo and in vivo in a mitochondria-dependent manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>Given the described protective role of caffeine and its association with mitochondria, we hypothesized that a common denominator exists in endothelial cells, cardiomyocytes, and cardiac fibroblasts that improves the mitochondria-dependent functionalities of those cells ex vivo and in vivo. Since the role of nonnuclear p27 in nontumor cells was never examined in detail, we investigated whether p27 is present in the mitochondria and is indeed required to improve mitochondria-dependent functionalities and whether the protective caffeine effects are causally related to mitochondrial p27, which would present a new mode of action for caffeine, explaining its protective function in the cardiovascular system.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial p27 is indispensable for functional improvement of endothelial cells</title>
<p>Physiologically relevant concentrations of caffeine, which have beneficial cardiovascular effects, have been attributed to 4 or more cups of daily coffee consumption. Four cups of coffee lead to a serum caffeine concentration of approximately 30 μM in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref008">8</xref>]. Since 4 or more cups of coffee seem to have a beneficial effect, we used 50 μM caffeine in all cellular studies presented here, as well as concentrations of caffeine in the drinking water of mice, which result in approximately 30–50 μM in the serum of the animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref008">8</xref>]. To assess a potential involvement of adenosine receptors in the caffeine-mediated effects, we first investigated the impact of caffeine on endothelial cell migration, as a measure for functional capacity, in the presence of adenosine receptor 2A and 2B blockers SCH442416 and GS6201, respectively. Neither inhibition of adenosine receptor 2A nor 2B changed the ability of 50 μM caffeine to induce migration in human primary endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Moreover, caffeine did not change phosphorylation of PDEs 4A and 5A, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), which is in accordance with the literature that caffeine concentrations higher than 250 μM are needed to modulate activity of those enzymes and thus to change intracellular cyclic nucleotide levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref020">20</xref>].</p>
<p>McAllister and colleagues showed that p27 is necessary for migration of HepG2 cells and embryonic fibroblasts. Furthermore, its promigratory effect was independent of its cell cycle arrest functions but rather required serine 10 phosphorylation–dependent nuclear export and a C-terminal scatter domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref004">4</xref>]. Therefore, we down-regulated p27 with 2 different small interfering RNAs (siRNAs; Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g001">1A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g001">1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s003">S3</xref>) and determined first the effect on cell viability (siRNA1: 106.9 ± 11.9%; siRNA2: 134.6 ± 21.4% of scrambled control, <italic>n</italic> = 5, means ± SEM, not significant) as well as on cellular and mitochondrial morphology (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Since transfection of p27-specific siRNAs affected neither cell viability nor morphology, we next investigated the effect on endothelial cell migration. Basal as well as caffeine-induced migration was completely blunted upon knockdown of p27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). These data demonstrate that primary human endothelial cells require p27 for migration.</p>

<p>Since functional mitochondria are necessary for endothelial cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref008">8</xref>] and protein translocation to these organelles is a major determinant of their functional capacity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref023">23</xref>], we wanted to establish a causal link between mitochondria and p27. Therefore, we investigated whether p27 is localized in mitochondria. As shown by immunoblots following biochemical separation, a fraction of p27 is localized in mitochondria. The purity of the mitochondrial preparations was confirmed by detection of the nonmitochondrial protein thioredoxin-1 (Trx-1) and the mitochondrial translocase of inner mitochondrial membrane 23 (TIM23), respectively. As an additional control, we also detected the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor 1A (CDKN1A), also known as p21, a member of the same protein family. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, p21 is not localized in the mitochondria, and caffeine does not affect the protein levels. Moreover, treatment with caffeine significantly increased mitochondrial p27 (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">2B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s005">S5</xref>). To further verify that p27 is truly localized in the mitochondria and not simply attached to these organelles, we performed a proteinase K digest of isolated mitochondria. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2C</xref>, p27 is indeed localized within the mitochondria. Digestion of the outer mitochondrial membrane with proteinase K in hypotonic buffer results in mitoplasts, mitochondria stripped of their outer membrane, leaving only the inner mitochondrial membrane and the matrix. The immunoblot analysis confirmed loss of translocase of outer mitochondrial membrane 40 (TOM40) but revealed inner mitochondrial membrane proteins like TIM23 and matrix proteins like the mitochondrial heat shock protein 70, also called heat shock protein 70 kDa protein 9 (HSPA9; or 75 KDa glucose-regulated protein [GRP75]), respectively, and also p27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). To causally link migration to mitochondrial p27, we cloned targeted variants of p27, which are exclusively localized in the nucleus or mitochondria, and expressed them in endothelial cells. Overexpression of nuclear- as well as mitochondrially targeted p27 revealed comparable expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Moreover, mitochondrially targeted p27 is exclusively found in the mitochondria; conversely, nuclear-targeted p27 could only be detected in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). We then established a rescue experiment in which endogenous p27 was first knocked down by siRNAs, followed by overexpression of nuclear- or mitochondrially targeted p27. Only mitochondrially targeted p27 rescued the migratory defect induced by knockdown of p27, whereas nuclear-targeted p27 did not improve the migratory capacity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Next, we investigated whether induction of migration by mitochondrial p27 can be further increased by caffeine. Therefore, we overexpressed mitochondrial p27 in endothelial cells, treated the cells with caffeine, and measured migratory capacity; nuclear-targeted p27 and an empty vector served as controls. Caffeine increased migratory capacity in cells transfected with the empty vector or expressing nuclear p27 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). Without caffeine, only mitochondrially targeted p27 induced migration of endothelial cells; however, the combination of caffeine and mitochondrial p27 did not show any additive effects. Thus, caffeine and mitochondrial p27 either share a common promigratory pathway, or each individual stimulus already induced maximal migratory capacity in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). To evaluate whether mitochondrial p27, but not nuclear p27, improves mitochondrial parameters, we measured mitochondrial membrane potential in endothelial cells overexpressing mitochondrial p27 or nuclear p27, respectively. Only mitochondrially targeted p27 significantly enhanced mitochondrial membrane potential (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g002">Fig 2H</xref>).</p>

<title>The N- and C-terminus of mitochondrial p27 with serine 10 and threonine 187 are required for migratory capacity of endothelial cells</title>
<p>Given the novelty of our findings, we wanted to understand which domains in p27 could be responsible for its effects on cell migration and mitochondrial functions. Subcellular distribution of p27 was described to be regulated by phosphorylation of at least 4 phosphorylation sites at serine 10, threonine 157, threonine 187, and threonine 198, all of which have been suggested to be important for nonnuclear localization. The role of phosphorylation at these sites is discussed controversially, as it could differ dependent on cell and tumor type or organ system. Nevertheless, as nuclear p27 cannot compensate for the loss of migratory capacity after knockdown of the endogenous protein, it is suggestive that these sites may play a role in migration, which depends on mitochondria. Therefore, we decided to generate p27 mutants with a mitochondrial targeting sequence, in which either the N-terminus with serine 10 (ΔN, amino acids [aas] 25–198 retained), the C-terminus with the other phosphorylation sites (ΔC, aas 1–151 retained), or both (ΔN/ΔC, aas 25–151 retained) were deleted, leaving the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor (CDI) domain intact in every construct (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). We first confirmed by immunoblotting that all of the mutants are expressed at comparable levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g003">Fig 3B</xref>). Then, we confirmed that the mutants are exclusively localized in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). Next, we examined their impact on functional capacity of human primary endothelial cells by measuring migration and adenosine triphosphate (ATP) content. Cells overexpressing the ΔN or the ΔC mutant showed only a reduced migratory capacity compared to full-length p27, whereas the ΔN/ΔC mutant completely lost the ability to induce migration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Full-length p27 increased mitochondrial ATP content (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). In contrast, this was not observed in cells overexpressing any of the p27 deletion mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). These data demonstrate that both the N- and C-terminus of p27 are required for the functional capacity of endothelial cells.</p>

<p>To further narrow down the aas relevant for mitochondrial p27, we focused on serine 10 and threonine 187 as the more likely candidates for phosphorylation because threonine 157 and 198 have been described as relevant for p27/cyclin D1/cyclin-dependent kinase 4 (CDK4) complex assembly and as such for cell cycle regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref024">24</xref>]. Moreover, for the cardiovascular system, it has been shown that p27 phosphorylation at serine 10 is reduced in murine and human atherosclerotic arteries and that prevention of this phosphorylation aggravates atherosclerosis independent of cell proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref025">25</xref>]. Phosphorylation at threonine 187 has been demonstrated to result in proteasomal degradation of p27 in several cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref026">26</xref>]; however, in the cardiovascular system, loss of this phosphorylation did not affect aortic p27 protein levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, we first examined whether caffeine induces phosphorylation of p27 at serine 10 and threonine 187. Indeed, 50 μM caffeine increased phosphorylation at both sites by approximately 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). Since both the N- and C-terminus are required for the functional capacity of p27 in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g003">Fig 3D and 3E</xref>), we generated a mitochondrially targeted, nonphosphorylatable p27(S10A/T187A) double mutant and measured the impact on migratory capacity compared to mitochondrially targeted full-length p27. Besides comparable expression levels between p27 wild type and the mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g004">Fig 4C</xref>), immunostainings confirmed the mitochondrial localization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Strikingly, overexpression of this mutant did not induce migration in endothelial cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Thus, serine 10 and threonine 187, at least in the mitochondrial fraction of p27, are required for migratory capacity. To elucidate whether these two residues are also necessary for the import of p27 into the mitochondria, we generated an analogous but untargeted p27(S10A/T187A) mutant. Following expression of this variant and the corresponding wild-type protein in endothelial cells, their protein levels in mitochondrial fractions were measured.

<title>Caffeine effects in the heart are linked to mitochondrial p27</title>
<p>It had been assumed that knockout of a cell cycle inhibitor like p27 could be beneficial in the experimental setup of myocardial infarction. This was based on the reasoning that myocardial infarction leads to loss of cells in the heart and that enhanced proliferation of cells in p27-deficient mice may result in smaller infarct size and reduced mortality. However, exactly the opposite was observed. Mice showed bigger infarct size, and the mortality was significantly increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref006">6</xref>]. Since functional mitochondria in the heart are required not only to provide energy for the pumping function but also to cope with externally or internally induced changes—e.g., during and after myocardial infarction—we hypothesized that a non-cell cycle–related function of p27, according to our data most likely in the mitochondria, could also be important for the heart. Therefore, we first analyzed the role of mitochondrial p27 in cell death induction in cardiomyocytes—a hallmark of cardiac pathologies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref028">28</xref>]. We lentivirally expressed mitochondrially targeted p27 in cardiomyocytes and measured basal and oxidative stress-induced apoptosis. Mitochondrial p27 dramatically reduced basal apoptosis and completely blunted H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). As functional mitochondria play a pivotal role in protection against heart disease and p27-deficient mice show increased mortality after myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref006">6</xref>], we measured oxygen consumption in heart mitochondria isolated from adult p27-deficient mice and their wild-type littermates as a readout for mitochondrial function. Mitochondria isolated from p27-deficient mice displayed significantly reduced complex I respiration, which demonstrates that those animals have impaired mitochondrial functionality (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). To further establish a causal link between caffeine and p27, p27-deficient animals were given 0.05% caffeine in drinking water for 10 days, a concentration for which we had previously shown to result in a serum concentration of approximately 30–50 μM and a time sufficient to completely restore the carotid endothelium after wire injury [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref008">8</xref>]. Strikingly, caffeine did not improve respiration in hearts of p27-deficient mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), whereas respiration in wild-type littermates was increased by caffeine. Next, we wanted to determine whether a connection between caffeine and mitochondrial p27 also exists on the transcriptome level. Therefore, p27-deficient animals and their wild-type littermates were given 0.05% caffeine in drinking water for 10 days. After that, RNA was isolated from whole hearts, and microarray analyses were performed. As shown in the Venn diagram in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g005">Fig 5C</xref>, all but 3 of the 245 transcripts differentially expressed after caffeine administration in wild-type mice were p27-dependent, since only 3 were also regulated in p27-deficient animals. Interestingly, among the most highly enriched gene ontology (GO) categories for biological processes are GO terms describing pathways, which take place in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Strikingly, more than one-third of the transcripts in all other GO categories are translated into proteins localized in the mitochondria (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s008">S1 Table</xref>), demonstrating that the caffeine-induced, p27-dependent transcriptome changes affect to a large part the mitochondria.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial p27 is required for proper cardiac myofibroblast differentiation</title>
<p>Over the last several years, it has become evident that in several healing processes, including wound healing and the early phase after myocardial infarction, fibroblasts have to differentiate into myofibroblasts to fill the gaps caused by cell loss. Recent findings demonstrated that intact mitochondria are needed for differentiation of fibroblasts into myofibroblasts in response to factors like transforming growth factor β1 (TGFβ1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref009">9</xref>]. Thus, we isolated cardiac fibroblasts from p27-deficient mice and wild-type littermates and induced myofibroblast differentiation by TGFβ1 in the absence or presence of caffeine. TGFβ1 induced myofibroblast differentiation, measured by the up-regulation of α smooth muscle actin (αSMA), only in wild-type cardiac fibroblasts but not in p27-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g006">Fig 6</xref>).

<title>Caffeine—in concert with mitochondrial p27—is protective in mouse models with mitochondrial dysfunction</title>
<p>One hallmark of the murine and human aging process is reduced mitochondrial respiratory capacity. Therefore, we wanted to determine whether a 10-day treatment with caffeine in 22-month-old mice could enhance respiration. Indeed, caffeine increased respiration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Moreover, the mitochondrial ATP content was increased to roughly the same extent as the mitochondrial oxygen consumption of complex I (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Interestingly, mitochondrial respiration in hearts of adult p27-deficient mice was similar as in 22-month-old wild-type animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s006">S6 Fig</xref>), suggesting that loss of mitochondrial p27 impairs the heart as strongly as aging. This is in accordance with increased infarct size and early mortality after myocardial infarction in p27-deficient mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref006">6</xref>]. Furthermore, 10 days of caffeine treatment in old animals was sufficient to raise the mitochondrial respiration to the levels observed in 6-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). In addition, the analysis of cardiac mitochondria from old mice showed a roughly 2-fold increase in mitochondrial p27 content after 10 days of caffeine (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g008">8C and 8D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s007">S7</xref>), demonstrating that caffeine-induced improved respiration is paralleled by an increase in mitochondrial p27. The amount of mitochondrial p27 in heart mitochondria of old mice after caffeine consumption was comparable to mitochondrial p27 in heart mitochondria of 6-month-old mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Thus, treatment of old mice with caffeine for 10 days markedly improved mitochondrial p27 and thus respiration in the heart. In addition, we also treated adult 6-month-old littermates with caffeine for 10 days and analyzed mitochondrial p27 by immunoblot. Similar to old mice, caffeine also increased mitochondrial p27 in adult 6-month-old mice when compared to their wild-type littermates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g008">Fig 8E and 8F</xref>).</p>

After that, mice were separated into 2 groups, one of which received caffeine in the drinking water for 10 days. Then, ischemia reperfusion injury was set, and animals were analyzed 3 weeks later. We first measured the scar size of the left ventricle and the minimum left ventricular wall thickness in both groups. Ten days of caffeine treatment significantly reduced scar size and improved wall thickness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g009">Fig 9A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g009">9B and 9C</xref>). Next, we investigated whether caffeine induces translocation of p27 into the mitochondria in this mouse model analogous to our observations in cells and in healthy adult as well as in old mice. Therefore, coimmunostainings of heart slices for p27 and the inner mitochondrial membrane protein TIM23 were performed in the border zone of the infarcted area. Indeed, colocalization of p27 and TIM23 was increased in the animals that had received caffeine, whereas p27 was mostly nuclear in the hearts of the mice on the diabetogenic diet without caffeine supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004408.g009">Fig 9D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we demonstrate that p27 is localized in the mitochondria. Serine 10 and threonine 187 within p27 are required for import into the mitochondria and functional improvements induced by mitochondrial p27. Moreover, mitochondrial p27 is sufficient to improve cellular processes, which depend on functional mitochondria, in different cells of the cardiovascular system. Moreover, it is suggestive to assume that the translocation of p27 into mitochondria might be critically involved in the improved outcomes after myocardial infarction upon caffeine administration. In summary, we present an increase in mitochondrial p27 as a new mode of action for how measurable caffeine concentrations in humans improve the functionality of the cardiovascular system or can even be protective in states associated with increased risk for cardiovascular diseases.</p>
<p>p27 was initially discovered as a nuclear-localized cell cycle inhibitory protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref001">1</xref>]. Previous data demonstrating that p27 can be exported to the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref003">3</xref>] were considered as a mechanism to inactivate the cell cycle inhibitory effects of p27 in the nucleus and to allow human cancer cells to escape cell cycle arrest. However, McAllister and colleagues demonstrated that nonnuclear p27 is required for migration of fibroblasts, since p27-deficient mouse embryonic fibroblasts failed to migrate, while reconstitution with p27 rescued the motility defect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref004">4</xref>]. Here, we show that only mitochondrial p27—but not nuclear p27—rescues the loss of migratory capacity induced by knockdown of endogenous p27, revealing a causal, direct link between mitochondrial localization of p27 and endothelial cell migration. Moreover, serine 10 and threonine 187 are required for import into mitochondria and the promigratory action of mitochondrial p27.</p>
<p>Interestingly, p27 is not the only protein initially described as a cell cycle inhibitor that was subsequently shown to elicit cytoplasmic and mitochondrial functions. In fact, prohibitin and prohibitin-2 were originally characterized as tumor suppressor proteins with antiproliferative activity when present in the nucleus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref031">31</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref033">33</xref>]. However, when localized in the mitochondria, prohibitins act as mitochondrial membrane–bound chaperones for the stabilization of mitochondrial proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref034">34</xref>], and interaction of prohibitin with subunits of complex I of the respiratory chain increases mitochondrial activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref035">35</xref>]. Similarly, we show here that p27 is localized within the mitochondria, where it improves mitochondrial functions. Interestingly, prohibitin has also been shown to be required for cell migration [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref036">36</xref>]. Thus, it is tempting to speculate that mitochondrial p27 exerts chaperone and/or assembly functions by interacting with mitochondrial proteins such as prohibitins, in analogy to nuclear p27, which is required for cyclin D/CDK complex assembly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref037">37</xref>]. It is important to note that mitochondrial import of the nonphosphorylatable p27 S10A/T187A mutant is markedly impaired. Thus, serine 10 and threonine 187 are required not only for p27 functions within the mitochondria but also for its import into these organelles. Similar to the p27 S10A/T187A mutant, the mutant that lacks larger regions of the N- and C-termini also showed an impaired impact on migratory capacity compared to intact p27, even when exclusively localized in the mitochondria. These results confirm the importance of the N- and C-termini of mitochondrial p27 and therein serine 10 and threonine 187 for improving migration of endothelial cells.</p>
<p>Importantly, preserved endothelial cell function accounts for up to 40% of insulin-mediated glucose metabolism in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref038">38</xref>]. Thus, caffeine-mediated stimulation of the functional capacity of the endothelium may indeed provide a direct mechanistic link for the inverse relationship between habitual coffee consumption and the risk for developing type 2 diabetes mellitus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref011">11</xref>]. Moreover, our results with the diabetogenic diet in mice demonstrate that caffeine reduces infarct size in obese, prediabetic mice. Since obesity and type 2 diabetes mellitus increase the risk for myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref040">40</xref>], coffee consumption—in addition to adequate medication, body weight lowering, and moderate exercise—could help to reduce this risk. Two large cohort studies revealed an association between coffee drinking and reduced mortality. In a prospective study of the National Institutes of Health, coffee drinking was inversely associated with subsequent mortality among 229,119 men and 173,141 women for deaths due to heart disease, respiratory disease, stroke, injuries and accidents, diabetes, and infections [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref012">12</xref>]. Similar results were obtained in a study with 521,330 participants in 10 European countries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>With respect to aging and thus to the elderly population, our data demonstrate that the mitochondrial capacity of the old heart is improved by caffeine to that of the adult heart. Since improving cardiovascular functionality in the elderly population is of major importance for extending health span, coffee consumption or caffeine per se could be considered as an additional protective dietary factor for the elderly population. Indeed, epidemiological analyses provided evidence that habitual intake of caffeinated beverages reduces the risk of heart disease mortality among elderly [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref015">15</xref>]. Moreover, since the caffeine effects are linked to increased mitochondrial p27 and thus improved mitochondrial function, enhancing mitochondrial p27 could serve as a potential therapeutic strategy not only in cardiovascular diseases but also in improving health span.</p>

The resulting supernatant was transferred to a fresh Eppendorf tube and centrifuged again for 15 minutes at 10,000 xg at 4°C. After centrifugation, the supernatant was discarded, and the pellet was rinsed twice with fresh mitochondrial isolation buffer, removing the fluffy white outer rim layer. The resulting brown pellet containing intact mitochondria was resuspended in mitochondria isolation buffer.</p>

<title>Mitochondrial respiration</title>
<p>The rate of mitochondrial respiration was monitored at 25°C using an Oxygraph-<italic>2k</italic> system (Oroboros) equipped with 2 chambers and DatLab software as previously described, with slight modifications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004408.ref053">53</xref>]. In detail, 200–300 μg of heart mitochondria were added to 2 ml of a buffer containing 200 mM sucrose, 10 mM potassium phosphate, 0.1% bovine serum albumin, 10 mM Tris-HCl, 10 mM MgSO<sub>4</sub>, and 2 mM EDTA, pH 7.0; and respiration was measured. Oxygen consumption was measured after the addition of the NADH-generating substrates malate (0.5 mM) and glutamate (0.5 mM). Then, ADP (0.15 mM) was added. To inhibit complex I activity, rotenone was added to a final concentration of 100 nM. Then, succinate (10 mM) was added, and complex II–dependent respiration was determined. Finally, KCN (2 mM) was added to inhibit complex IV activity.</p>
<p>Heart mitochondria from p27-deficient and wild-type littermates were always measured blinded in parallel, using the same conditions. The same setup was applied to measure respiration of heart mitochondria isolated from mice that had received caffeine with the drinking water or water. For each preparation, a second set of measurements was performed in a crossover design.</p>

<title>Diabetogenic diet</title>
<p>Male mice at the age of 7–8 weeks were fed a diabetogenic diet (S7200-E010, EF Bio-Serv F1850mod; containing 24% sucrose, 35.85% lard, Ssniff) for 9.5 weeks, leading to a prediabetic state and increased body weight gain. After that, animals were randomized to a control group (diabetogenic diet) or a group receiving additional 0.05% caffeine in the drinking water (diabetogenic diet + caffeine) 10 days prior to ischemia induction. Caffeine treatment was continued until the end of the experiment 3 weeks post ischemia. The composition of the diabetogenic diet is detailed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004408.s009">S2 Table</xref>.</p>

<title>Myocardial ischemia and reperfusion</title>
<p>A closed-chest model of reperfused myocardial infarction was utilized. Mice were anesthetized by intraperitoneal injection of ketamine (100 mg/kg body weight) and xylazine (10 mg/kg body weight), intubated, and ventilated with a tidal volume of 10 μl/g body weight at a rate of 140 strokes/minute (two-thirds air, one-third oxygen and isoflurane 2.0 vol.% [Forene, Abbott GmbH]). Mice were placed in a supine position on a 38°C warmed plate to maintain body temperature. After a left lateral thoracotomy between the third and four rib, the pericardium was dissected, and a 7–0 surgical suture was passed underneath the left anterior descending coronary artery (LAD). Both ends of the surgical suture were threaded through a 1-mm section of PE-20 tubing, forming a loose snare around the LAD, and were exteriorized to the left side of the thorax. The suture was left in the subcutaneous tissue. At 3 days postinstrumentation, the animals were reanesthetized by mask inhalation of isoflurane 2.0 vol.% and a mixture of one-third oxygen and two-thirds room air. Mice were placed in a supine position on a 38°C warmed plate to maintain body temperature. The skin was reopened, and after dissecting the loop, both ends of the applied suture were gently pulled tight until ST-elevation appeared on the ECG. After 60 minutes of ischemia, reperfusion was accomplished by cutting the suture close to the chest wall. Reperfusion was confirmed by reduction of ST-elevation. Reperfusion was performed for 21 days. We strictly adhered to ischemia induction between 8 AM and 11 AM to ensure equal ischemia and reperfusion tolerance.</p>

<title>Wall thickness and scar size determination</title>
<p>Three weeks post ischemia and reperfusion, animals were killed by CO<sub>2</sub>, and hearts were excised and rinsed in PBS. After dehydration, hearts preserved in Roti-Histofix 4% (Carl Roth) for 24 hours were paraffin-embedded and cut into 5-μm sections in 10 levels (approximately 100 µm) beginning from the apex up to the ligation side, discarding 250 μm between each level. To calculate scar size, fibrous area, and wall thickness, sections were stained with Gomori’s one-step trichrome staining. The heat-fixed sections were deparaffinized twice in Roti-Clear (Carl Roth) for 15 minutes and then rehydrated with a graded ethanol series to dH<sub>2</sub>O. Sections were incubated in Bouin’s solution (Sigma Aldrich) at 58°C for 15 minutes. After 5 minutes of rinsing under running water, nuclear staining was performed with Weigert's iron hematoxylin A and B for 5 minutes (1:1, Sigma Aldrich). The sections were rinsed again for 5 minutes with running water followed by 25 minutes of incubation with Gomori’s staining solution (chromotrope 2R, methylenblue, glacial acetic acid, phosphotungstic acid). Sections were briefly rinsed with water and 0.5% acetic acid 2x 2 minutes. Then sections were treated with an ascending alcohol series and Roti-Clear (2 x 5 minutes) and covered with Roti-Mount mounting medium (Carl Roth). Images were taken with a Zeiss Axio Imager M2. The circumference of the entire endocardium and epicardium and the thickness and length of the infarcted portion, fibrous area, and the left ventricle cavity area were determined using Diskus View software (Hilgers). Setting of the myocardial infarctions and scoring of scar size and left ventricular wall thickness were conducted in a blinded fashion and confirmed by an independent blinded observer.</p>

<sec id="sec033">
<title>Immunostaining of heart slices</title>
<p>The sections were stained with antibodies against p27 (polyclonal, PA5-27188, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:25) and TIM23 (clone 32, BD Biosciences, 1:100). The sections were deparaffinized with xylene and rehydrated by a descending alcohol series. For p27 and TIM23, a basic target retrieval solution boiled for 20 minutes in Tris/EDTA buffer pH 9.0 (Dako) was required. The sections were cooled down, washed with PBS, and incubated with 4% formalin for 20 minutes in a wet chamber. Then, slices were rinsed with PBS and were treated with blocking solution Tris Buffered Saline (50 mM Tris-HCl, 150 mM NaCl, 2.5 mM KCl, pH 8.0) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum/3% goat serum/0.1%Triton-X 100 for 1 hour in a wet chamber. The sections were incubated with the primary antibodies overnight at 4°C in a wet chamber. Next, the slices were washed with PBS; the incubation with the respective secondary antibodies (anti-rabbit IgG (H + L) cross-absorbed antibody, Alexa Fluor 647, A21244, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:200; and anti-mouse IgG (H + L) cross-absorbed antibody, Alexa Fluor 568, A11004, Thermo Fisher Scientific, 1:200) was performed for 1 hour in a wet chamber. The sections were covered with ProLong Diamond antifade mounting medium with DAPI (Invitrogen). Fluorescence images were taken with a Zeiss Axio Imager M2.</p>
