                <p>Combination therapies are often needed for effective clinical outcomes in the
                    management of complex diseases, but presently they are generally based on
                    empirical clinical experience. Here we suggest a novel application of search
                    algorithms—originally developed for digital
                    communication—modified to optimize combinations of therapeutic
                    interventions. In biological experiments measuring the restoration of the
                    decline with age in heart function and exercise capacity in <italic>Drosophila
                        melanogaster</italic>, we found that search algorithms correctly identified
                    optimal combinations of four drugs using only one-third of the tests performed
                    in a fully factorial search. In experiments identifying combinations of three
                    doses of up to six drugs for selective killing of human cancer cells, search
                    algorithms resulted in a highly significant enrichment of selective combinations
                    compared with random searches. In simulations using a network model of cell
                    death, we found that the search algorithms identified the optimal combinations
                    of 6–9 interventions in 80–90% of tests, compared
                    with 15–30% for an equivalent random search. These findings
                    suggest that modified search algorithms from information theory have the
                    potential to enhance the discovery of novel therapeutic drug combinations. This
                    report also helps to frame a biomedical problem that will benefit from an
                    interdisciplinary effort and suggests a general strategy for its solution.</p>

                <title>Author Summary</title>
                <p>This work describes methods that identify drug combinations that might alleviate
                    the suffering caused by complex diseases. Our biological model systems are:
                    physiological decline associated with aging, and selective killing of cancer
                    cells. The novelty of this approach is based on a new application of methods
                    from digital communications theory, which becomes useful when the number of
                    possible combinations is large and a complete set of measurements cannot be
                    obtained. This limit is reached easily, given the many drugs and doses available
                    for complex diseases. We are not simply using computer models but are using
                    search algorithms implemented with biological measurements, built to integrate
                    information from different sources, including simulations. This might be
                    considered parallel biological computation and differs from the classic systems
                    biology approach by having search algorithms rather than explicit quantitative
                    models as the central element. Because variation is an essential component of
                    biology, this approach might be more appropriate for combined drug
                    interventions, which can be considered a form of biological control. Search
                    algorithms are used in many fields in physics and engineering. We hope that this
                    paper will generate interest in a new application of importance to human health
                    from practitioners of diverse computational disciplines.</p>

            <title>Introduction</title>
            <p>The problem of combination therapy has medical and algorithmic aspects. Medically, we
                are still not able to provide effective cures for most chronic, complex diseases
                that are the main causes of death and disability, nor are we able to address the
                progressive age-related decline in human functional capacity. Algorithmically, when
                biological dysfunction involves complex biological networks, therapeutic
                interventions on multiple targets are likely to be required. Because the effect of
                drugs depends on the dose, several doses need to be studied, and the number of
                possible combinations rises quickly. For example, many cancer chemotherapy regimens
                are composed of 6 or more drugs from a pool of more than 100 clinically used
                anticancer drugs and exploring even larger combinations might be justified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Calzolari1">[1]</xref>. If
                we were to study all combinations of 6 out of 100 compounds (including partial
                combinations containing only some of these compounds) at 3 different doses we would
                have 8.9×10<sup>11</sup> possibilities. This example shows that the
                problem requires a qualitatively new approach rather than simply more efficient
                screening technology.</p>
            <p>Combined drug interventions are a common therapeutic strategy for complex diseases
                such as hypertension and cancer. As pointed out recently for cancer therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Weinberg1">[2]</xref>, most
                therapies were initially developed as effective single agents and only later
                combined clinically. A possible approach to the exploration of new therapeutic
                activities not present in individual drugs is based on the exhaustive study of all
                possible combinations of pairs of compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Zimmermann1">[3]</xref>. This
                “brute force” approach has detected many interesting novel pairs
                of compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Zimmermann1">[3]</xref>, but the resulting exponential expansion in the
                number of possibilities precludes the comprehensive exploration of larger
                combinations.</p>
            <p>Several authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Araujo1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Fitzgerald1">[5]</xref> have recently argued
                that the future of combination therapy lies in the development of accurate
                quantitative network models that capture the mechanistic interactions of cellular
                and organism physiology. Fitzgerald et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Fitzgerald1">[5]</xref> acknowledge that we
                do not yet know what these models will look like, and that systems biology research
                is still data-limited for this purpose. Indeed their recent review does not report
                any successful application of this approach to combination therapies.</p>
            <p>Here we suggest a novel solution to the problem of combination drug therapy, making
                use of search algorithms originally developed for digital communication. When
                modified in several key aspects, these search strategies can be used to find more
                effective combined therapeutic interventions without the need for a fully factorial
                experimental design (testing all possible combinations of drugs for all selected
                doses). These algorithms may also provide a framework upon which information from
                system-wide molecular data (e.g. transcriptomics and metabolomics) and from
                mechanistic computational networks models can be superimposed.</p>
            <sec id="s1a">
                <title>Rationale for the Suggested Algorithms</title>
                <p>To understand the motivation for our work it is important to consider that, even
                    if simulations might play a role, the intended use of the algorithms is not
                    entirely <italic>in silico</italic>, but partially <italic>in vivo</italic> or
                        <italic>in vitro</italic>, using high-throughput biological measurements in
                    organisms or isolated cells, respectively. This approach becomes increasingly
                    relevant because high-throughput measurement technology, initially developed by
                    drug companies for the screening of large libraries of compounds in multi-well
                    plate formats, is now more and more available to the scientific community.</p>
                <p>It is useful to regard the information processing by our experimental systems as
                    parallel biological computations, since the algorithms we are using are indeed
                    derived from algorithms that were implemented <italic>in silico</italic> in
                    other scientific fields. Parallel measurements are suitable for multi-well
                    high-throughput technology.</p>
                <p>There are requirements regarding the computational complexity of the algorithms
                    that limit the choice of suitable approaches. These requirements are discussed
                    in more detail in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>. Both the
                    number of operations and computational costs unique to <italic>in vivo/in
                    vitro</italic> algorithms should be considered.</p>
                <p>Algorithm design requires the application of an appropriate structure to the
                    data. Although there are many options to represent the space of possible drug
                    combinations, we used a tree representation with drug combinations as nodes
                    linking to all possible additions of one drug in the next level. Individual
                    drugs form the base of the tree and combinations of maximum size are at the top
                    (see Algorithms section in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>).
                    When exploring the drug combination tree going from smaller to larger
                    combinations, as in the algorithms we suggest, we are giving more weight to
                    lower-order drug interactions. This is consistent with data available on adverse
                    drug interactions, which are reported mostly for two-drug combinations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Baxter1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Hansten1">[7]</xref>. Estimating the
                    optimal size of a combination is a different problem, examined in detail in the
                        <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>. The beneficial effect of a
                    combination is also due to additive components (not depending on interactions)
                    and to multiple higher-order effects.</p>
                <p>The search algorithms we suggest are derived from sequential decoding algorithms.
                    These were chosen in part because of similarities among the data trees to be
                    searched in the biological and decoding applications (see again the Algorithms
                    section in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Results</xref>). Sequential
                    decoding algorithms are used for convolutional codes, in which nearby nodes in
                    the data tree are related, similarly to different but partially overlapping
                    combinations of drugs.</p>
                <p>Another feature of sequential algorithms that fit our purposes is the use of a
                    list-based memory of the path taken to reach each node. We provide in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> a detailed argument suggesting
                    that a suitable algorithm should be able to integrate all available information
                    on the state of the system with that obtained by iterative measurements. The
                    integration should take place at every iteration within the algorithm, rather
                    than being a weighted average of different methods applied separately. The
                    presence of the updated list as a guide for each iteration provides our
                    algorithms with a natural mean of information integration.</p>
                <p>Both the fully factorial dataset we show in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g001">Figure 1</xref> and the complex structure of the
                    biological networks that are being reconstructed in systems biology supports
                    this expectation of frequent non-linearities in phenotype measurements along the
                    data tree. Therefore we are interested in algorithms that can search within a
                    solution space presenting substantial non-linearities. If the relation among
                    drugs in a combination were linear, the best algorithm would simply determine
                    the best dose in single drug measurements and use these to obtain the best
                    combination. If, on the contrary, non-linearities were extreme, the use of
                    stochastic algorithms might be preferable. Stochastic algorithms (see also <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>) can cope with multiple local
                    minima in the solution space, but they do so by incorporating a random element.
                    This requires a price in terms of computational cost, and the performance of
                    stochastic algorithms is therefore often not as good as that of more tailored
                    algorithms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Palmer1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Schneider1">[9]</xref>. The algorithms
                    we suggest can cope with moderate and variable non-linearities by going back to
                    previous nodes in the tree.</p>

                    test algorithms that can be used to search for an optimal combination of a
                    sizeable number of drugs, by testing only a small subset of all possible
                    combinations. The algorithms are useful for large combinations, where collecting
                    fully factorial datasets is not feasible. We present results obtained from
                    simulations in a computational model of cell death and from experiments using

                    throughput testing. These models are also representative of two different
                    general types of multi-drug interventions: one type aims at improving function,
                    while the other is based on the induction of cell death, a selective disruption
                    of network function. Results suggest that optimal or near-optimal combinations
                    of compounds can be found in these systems with only a small fraction of the
                    number of tests as a fully factorial design, and with significantly higher

                <title>A Fully Factorial Dataset Obtained in <italic>Drosophila</italic></title>
                <p>A fully factorial dataset is a dataset where all possible combinations of drugs
                    for the selected doses are tested. The dataset was obtained from biological
                    measurements in a living organism, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> (the
                    fruitfly).</p>
                <p>A detailed account of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiac aging model was
                    presented previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Paternostro1">[11]</xref>. We performed an initial screen of compounds
                    for their effects on cardiac aging in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, selected for
                    their general effects on multiple biological functions, previously demonstrated
                    low toxicity and, for some compounds, known effects on aging in other models.</p>
                <p>After screening 44 compounds individually at multiple doses (a total of 300
                    groups, each composed of 10–20 flies), we chose two doses each of four
                    compounds for more comprehensive measurements of their combined effects on three
                    age-related phenotypes: the declines in maximal heart rate, exercise capacity
                    and survival. The selected compounds (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for doses in the fly food) were: doxycycline, a broad spectrum
                    antibiotic and inhibitor of mitochondrial protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Toivonen1">[12]</xref>;
                    sodium selenite, an essential trace mineral and cofactor of many metabolic
                    enzymes; zinc sulfate, another trace mineral and cofactor of many metabolic
                    enzymes; and resveratrol, a phenolic antioxidant with an action on proteins
                    linked to aging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Wood1">[13]</xref>.</p>
                <p>The compounds were fed to flies from the age of 7 days to the age of 30 days. We
                    have previously shown cardiac physiological changes with age in 30 day-old flies
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Paternostro1">[11]</xref>. The maximal heart rate was measured at the age
                    of 30 days. Climbing velocity was measured every 5 days between the ages of 15
                    to 30 days, using a non-invasive procedure. We studied 10 male flies for
                    climbing and 10 female flies for the cardiac measurements. Survival to 30 days
                    was also measured in these flies. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the fully factorial dataset consisting of 81
                    combinations of 4 drugs, using 2 doses for each drug (1 control, 8 individual
                    tests, 24 groups of 2 combined drugs, 32 groups of 3 combined drugs and 16
                    groups of 4 combined drugs).</p>
                <p>The number on the right of each combination in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g001">Figure 1</xref> is a summary score (z-score)
                    obtained from the three phenotypes mentioned: the declines with age in maximal
                    heart rate, climbing velocity and survival. Each value was normalized by
                    dividing by a weekly control, then for each group subtracting the population
                    mean and diving by the population standard deviation. The z-scores from the
                    three phenotypes were then averaged to yield a summary z-score that equally
                    weights each of the three measurements. Analysis of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows that, with a larger number of
                    drugs in the combination, there is a statistically significant increase
                    (p&lt;0.05) in the percentage of treatments that have an improved z-score
                    compared with untreated controls of the same age.</p>
                <p>The landscape (see section in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref> on
                    control landscapes) obtained from this dataset has 7 local maxima and 1 global
                    maximum in the phenotype z-score. The maxima correspond to drug-doses
                    configurations for which the z- score decreases by changing any of the drugs by
                    a single dose. We have also calculated the basin of attraction, i.e. the number
                    of drug-doses configurations that will end up in a given maximum by following
                    the maximal increase in z-score, and found that the global maximum corresponds
                    to the largest basin. This is an example of how landscape terminology can be
                    used to define moderate non-linearities suitable for the algorithmic approach we
                    suggest.</p>

                        show how they relate to the algorithms used in sequential decoding. Fully
                        factorial datasets, where every possible drug combination is tested, grow

                        input size. An exponential growth is not practical for large n, therefore
                        our aim is to find algorithms with improved efficiency, for example with a

                                color indicates a different drug-dose pair. Additionally, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g001">Figure 1</xref> shows

                        when a combination has already been used for extension in the tree, we move
                        to the next combination in the sorted list. As indicated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g002">Figure 2</xref>, we do not
                        combine different doses of the same drug with each other, to limit the size
                        of the search, but this is not an essential feature.</p>
                    <p>This algorithm is effective in searching combinations where the effect is not
                        purely additive, because it can overcome non-linearities by going back to

                    <p>A family of related algorithms can be derived from the basic structure of the
                        stack sequential algorithm described in the previous section, adapted to
                        different requirements, and with different trade-offs between complexity and
                        performance. This is similar to the case of sequential decoding. Examples of
                        other algorithms that are part of the sequential decoding family, with
                        trade-offs partially analogous to those we have implemented, are the Fano

                    <p>This family of algorithms can be divided into three basic classes that differ

                        three classes. The class that follows the same direction of search within
                        the data tree as the stack sequential we call SS; the class that searches
                        the tree in the other direction, from the top down, we call TD; and the
                        class combining both approaches (starting as SS and continuing as TD) we
                        call SS-TD (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g004">Figure

                    <p>In this implementation we introduced two features that make the algorithm
                        more appropriate for our application.</p>
                    <p>In S2 we choose only the best dose to extend from for the individual drugs.
                        This is because if we need to return to this level after having combined the
                        best single drug with all the others, it means that all lower order
                        interactions (that is couples) were not beneficial, and therefore we prefer
                        to change drug rather than trying a different dose of the same drug.</p>
                    <p>In S6 we limit the number of backtracks to limit the cost of the algorithm.
                        We used a limit of 2 in all the experiments presented. This limit can be
                        increased if the throughput of the technology we use for the biological
                        measurements allows it. If we wish to increase this limit, we can make a
                        choice among possible implementations that either backtrack only one level
                        at a time or jump to any level that ranks next in the summary list. These
                        implementations would have different complexity.</p>
                    <p>While SS′ moves up in the data tree the number of measured
                        combinations declines (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000249.s001">Text S1</xref>). This algorithm therefore gives
                        greater weight to lower order combinations in deciding which branches of the
                        data tree we should explore. This is consistent with the expectation that
                        lower order interactions among drugs are likely to be stronger than higher
                        order interactions, as mentioned in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction.</xref></p>
                    <p>The experimental complexity of this implementation (both best and worst case)
                        grows as O(n<sup>2</sup>) for the number of drugs, and O(m) for the number
                        of doses (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000249.s001">Text S1</xref>). Increasing the backtracking
                        limit we might reach, in the worst case, the same complexity of the fully
                        factorial, that is O(a<sup>n</sup>).</p>
                    <p>For algorithms including an <italic>in vivo</italic> or <italic>in
                        vitro</italic> (biological) step we also have to consider other types of
                        computational complexity, beside the number of operations. Biological
                        measurements can take a very long time compared to any <italic>in

                        experiments) and may be limited by sample availability. This type of cost
                        needs to be calculated separately for each application. In these algorithms
                        there are also iterated cycles composed of biological measurements that can
                        be done in parallel. All combinations formed in S4 above, extending from the
                        best scoring combination, can be measured in parallel. Parallelization suits
                        existing screening technology (e.g. multi-well plate robotics) but the
                        number of cycles can also be limiting, again depending on the specific

                    <title>TD′ algorithm</title>
                    <p>The rationale motivating the development of top-down searches within the data
                        tree is based on both the higher scores for larger combinations shown by the
                        Drosophila fully factorial dataset of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g001">Figure 1</xref> and the reduced number of
                        combinations of higher order in all fully factorial datasets of this type,
                        shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000249.s001">Text S1</xref>. These two factors led us to expect a higher probability
                        of finding desired scores within combinations of larger size, and supported
                        the development of algorithms with a higher proportion of measurements in
                        this region of the data tree. We can also easily modify the algorithms to
                        stop once a combination with the desired score is found, and therefore we
                        wish to increase the probability of finding these combinations early in the

                    network using the two algorithms described above. The computational model is
                    based on the apoptosis network, hsa04210, of the KEGG database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.genome.jp/kegg/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.genome.jp/kegg/</ext-link>). We used the discrete apoptosis
                    model described in our previous publication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Calzolari1">[1]</xref>, where the
                    discrete state of proteins at each node is determined by the strength of a
                    signal from the neighboring nodes according to a logarithmic rule. In this
                    model, the final life/death signal is calculated following the signaling in the
                    directed network up to a final output node. The effect of a drug on a given node
                    is modeled by changing the activity on that node and calculating the

                        <p>The 3 approaches described (randomly chosen group of combinations,
                            SS′ algorithm and the SS-TD′ algorithm) are
                            compared. We report the % of tests (average±SEM
                            from 75 simulations) that can find the best combination, for
                            interventions using 6 to 9 drugs. The cost is expressed as the number of
                            tests. The decline in success rate with an increasing number of drugs
                            for the random and SS′ groups is probably explained by the
                            decreasing proportion of the total possible combinations tested (shown
                            as decreasing ratio). This is not the case for SS-TD′, but we
                            do not yet know if this is a general property of the algorithm. The
                            total number of possible combinations increases exponentially with the
                            number of drugs and becomes quickly too large for our biological
                            measurements (for example with 9 drugs the total is 262144, see
                            rightmost column) and therefore justifies the necessity of an algorithm
                            to limit the experimental space. The maximal cost for the two algorithms
                            (bottom line) is still within the reach of many experiments. This
                            simulation was done using 3 doses per drug.</p>

                <p>Both algorithms were significantly more efficient than random tests
                    (p&lt;0.0001). The SS-TD′ was clearly superior in the frequency of
                    identification of the very best combination, but the SS′ also
                    performed well (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g008">Figure 8</xref>).
                    If a purely additive strategy were the optimal one, the SS′ would find
                    it, with no backtracks. However, this does not seem to be the case. In the fully
                    factorial tests, larger combinations of up to 9 interventions were more
                    effective than single or two-drug interventions in finding the most selective
                    solution (p&lt;0.0001).</p>
                <p>We also performed an alternative simulation changing a large number of parameters
                    (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section), to test the
                    robustness of these findings, and were able to confirm the behavior shown in

                <p>As suggested by the number of top combinations found by random sampling in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000249-g008">Figure 8</xref>, these fully
                    factorial datasets contained multiple maxima. We investigated a different group
                    of 30 fully factorial datasets (using 8-drug combinations) where maxima were
                    very few (less than 0.05% of the total). Not surprisingly, in these
                    simulations, random tests never found the top combinations. However, top
                    combinations were found in 30% of the tests by the SS′
                    algorithm and in 80% of tests by the SS-TD′ algorithm.
                    Furthermore, the distances of the best solutions found from the real maxima
                    (expressed in % of the optimal value) were: 9.2±1.4

                    different doses (for 60 hours) of six drugs affecting cell viability:

                    followed the order: couples, triplets, sextuplets, quintets, quartets. The
                    SS-TD′ selectivity (mean 21.3±2.4%) was markedly
                    better than that in the random approach (mean 1.9±2.5%,

            <p>It might be argued that each drug combination and biological system will require a
                different search algorithm and that there is no reason to expect universality. The
                results reported here, obtained with very diverse systems and compounds, suggest
                otherwise. Additional rationale supporting the existence of optimization algorithms
                with general applicability to biological networks is provided by the shared
                properties of these networks (such as a scale free distribution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Barabasi1">[16]</xref>,
                robustness and evolvability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Wagner1">[17]</xref>).</p>
            <p>In future studies it will be desirable to develop formal methods to assist in the
                choice of the individual drugs to be considered by the algorithms, and to determine
                which doses to study. It is reasonable to consider several doses spanning the IC50
                or EC50, but in large combinations we should expect to use lower doses than those
                common for the same drugs as single agents. At least initially the compounds more
                appropriate for use in the algorithms are FDA approved drugs and well-known
                supplements, for which the preferred dosage as single agents is already known.</p>

                    Synergy is useful but it is not a necessary property for the optimal combination
                    In any case, our algorithm objective (finding the best combination) includes the
                    case where this optimal result is due to synergy.</p>

                    were reviewed. Most papers describe sets of clinical rules derived from clinical
                    experience or from randomized clinical trials, relevant to combinations of
                    2–3 drugs, to be implemented by physicians. These approaches were

                <title>Information Theory and Search Algorithms for Optimal Drug Combinations</title>
                <p>We can think of drug interventions as transmitting information to biological
                    networks. When we search for optimal drug combination the efficiency of
                    transmission of information (the domain of information theory) is important, and
                    it is therefore not surprising that some modified algorithms from digital
                    communications, which are used to efficiently decode signals in the presence of
                    noise, might be applicable. There are, however, also several differences that
                    require modifications to these algorithms.</p>
                <p>Among the similarities with the digital communication applications of sequential
                    decoding algorithms are the following: the partial exploration of a tree of
                    possible solutions, the dependence of the score on the previous steps of the
                    algorithm, the objective of maximizing the score and minimizing the cost, and
                    the use of an ordered list to store the solutions.</p>
                <p>Among the differences are the following: the partially different data structure
                    to be explored and the related possibility of jumping to different parts of the
                    tree and even ignoring some steps (for example, SS-TD class algorithms are not
                    used for decoding and are unlikely to be useful), and the tendency of the
                    largest combinations to have higher scores. The computational cost is also
                    partially different. For example memory is not a limiting factor but the number
                    of tests and the time required by each step are.</p>

                <title>Safety</title>
                <p>We would also like to discuss the drug safety implications of the use of drug
                    combinations in general and of our approach more specifically. Of the two main
                    types of adverse drug events, type A adverse events represent the majority <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Gilbert1">[30]</xref>.
                    These are dose-related and arise from the pharmacological action of the drug
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Gilbert1">[30]</xref>. Type A adverse events are not necessarily
                    increased in combinations if we use reduced doses of each drug. Furthermore, the
                    objective metric of the algorithm can incorporate the reduction of adverse
                    effects. An example is the choice of selective cell death for the cancer cell
                    measurements we report, rather than just the killing of cancer cells. If we were
                    to find a large therapeutic combination that had an extremely selective action
                    only on cancer cells (or on a particular cancer), this would have a greatly
                    improved safety profile compared to any of the existing chemotherapeutic
                    regimens.</p>
                <p>The second major type of adverse drug events, type B, is much more rare and not
                    dose-related. These adverse events are at least in part genetic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Gilbert1">[30]</xref>
                    and should be ameliorated by including genomic data as one of the components of
                    our algorithms in future implementations. As for single drugs, medication safety
                    is always a balance of risks and benefits. Some types of cancer have a prognosis
                    of only a few months. Hence the risk-benefit analysis cannot be discussed for
                    drug combinations in general, but depends on the type of disease, the type of
                    drugs involved and the condition and informed choice of each patient.</p>
                <p>Drug interactions are a known cause of adverse events, but, given that
                    multi-therapy is common and essential for many patients (most hospitalized
                    patients receive at least six drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Hardman1">[31]</xref>), it is preferable
                    to develop formal methods of assessment, as we suggest, rather than leaving the
                    development of multi-therapies to the empirical decision of individual
                    physicians.</p>

                <title>Nonlinearities and Control Landscapes</title>
                <p>We have mentioned in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s1">Introduction</xref> that one of the desirable features of these
                    algorithms is the capacity of dealing with non-linearities in drug combinations.
                    The most suitable measures of non-linearity can be obtained by building an
                    n-dimensional “control landscape”, where the dimensions are
                    the drugs, at different doses. The notion of landscape represents a commonly
                    used concept in the analysis of many complex systems encountered in physics,
                    biology, computer science and engineering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Palmer1">[8]</xref>. Several features
                    can provide a quantitative characterization of these landscapes, such as the
                    density of optima <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Reidys1">[32]</xref> or the ruggedness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Palmer1">[8]</xref>. The ruggedness
                    measures the correlation of the biological score to be optimized in
                    “neighboring” positions and can be obtained by defining
                    random walk processes in the drug configuration space, and by calculating the
                    correlation length of the score in such processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Reidys1">[32]</xref>. The landscape
                    could also be modified using system-wide biological data (omic data) to reduce
                    non-linearities. This omic warping is analogous to approaches commonly used in
                    physics.</p>
                <p>While the tests in cancer cell lines reported here do add evidence supporting the
                    efficacy of the suggested algorithms, it would be desirable in future
                    experiments to give priority to the collection of fully factorial datasets.
                    Comparisons with random samples have several limitations, including the fact
                    that the true optimum is unknown. Fully factorial datasets are, when
                    experimentally feasible, more informative, allowing the characterization of the
                    landscapes and the evaluation of alternative search algorithms.</p>

                <title>Integrating Other Information in the Algorithms</title>
                <p>There is a more general rationale supporting the use of algorithms integrating
                    information on the state of the system with iterative measurements. The
                    Artificial Intelligence community realized at the beginning of the 90s that
                    robots could not manage a complex environment utilizing only explicit models of
                    reality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Bekey1">[33]</xref>. An alternative approach that started from
                    simpler stimulus-response algorithms was more successful and was later
                    integrated with the older models in hybrid architectures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Bekey1">[33]</xref>. The proponents of
                    this approach (among them Rodney Brooks) argued that this process was similar to
                    the evolution of the nervous system, which is based on stimulus-response
                    mechanisms of increasing complexity in lower invertebrates, integrated (but not
                    replaced) by representations of reality within the brain of higher organisms.
                    See also Figure 1 of Pfeifer
                    et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Pfeifer1">[34]</xref>. Similarly we can start from
                    “stimulus-response” algorithms and then improve them using
                    progressively more detailed and mechanistic models of biological networks. The
                    algorithms we have described are composed of several iterations, each depending
                    on the previous response of the system. As pointed out <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Bechhoefer1">[35]</xref>, control and
                    optimization algorithms do contain information about the system, when effective,
                    but only in an implicit form. This approach, used to control very complex and
                    partially unknown systems by natural evolution and by possibly the most
                    ambitious attempt to emulate evolution, building intelligent machines, is a
                    general strategy that motivated the development of our algorithms.</p>

                    and transcriptional profiles of treated cells or organisms closer to that of the
                    target state and by how much. A similar approach was used in a recent
                    publication by Lamb et al <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Lamb1">[37]</xref>, where a single score was obtained to
                    represent the response of a breast cancer cell line to drugs. The score was a
                    summary of multivariate biological data (microarrays). This statistical approach
                    is justified by the fact that not all molecular information is included in the
                    network models, but is expected to play a lesser role as the comprehensiveness
                    of the models improves.</p>
                <p>Metabolic models similar to that described in our recent paper on
                        <italic>Drosophila</italic> hypoxia may also play a role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Feala1">[38]</xref>.
                    Gene expression data of metabolic enzymes and NMR measurements of metabolites
                    for individual treatments could be added to the model and the effect of
                    combining the interventions can be simulated. The model can provide summary
                    measures that have an important effect on function, such as ATP production, and
                    are ideally suited as weighted modifiers of the algorithm rankings. For the
                    cancer experiments we could iteratively modify the apoptosis computational
                    networks described in our recent paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Calzolari1">[1]</xref>. To reflect the
                    results of intervention experiments, one could add to the model the targets of
                    all the drugs used, and use microarray data specific for the cell types to
                    modify the simulations. As our biological knowledge improves, mechanistic models
                    should play an increasing role.</p>
                <p>The algorithms described here are suitable as frameworks to integrate imperfect
                    information from different sources. The information can be used to modify the
                    rankings and fully factorial datasets can be used to assign weights to different
                    types of information. For example, if the cytoprotective protein Bcl-2 is
                    overexpressed in a target cell type or if network simulations indicate that it
                    is an important control node, one could modify the ranking metric of
                    combinations including drugs acting on it and test whether this improves the
                    efficiency of the algorithms within our fully factorial datasets.</p>

                <title>Potential Applications to Personalized Medicine</title>
                <p>There is great interest in personalized medicine and it is clear that
                    personalized therapy requires combinations, since we cannot develop a different
                    drug for each patient. The information on the state of the system that we
                    suggest should be incorporated in the algorithms can at the same time provide a
                    molecular profile corresponding to each effective combination. In other words an
                    omic-combination dictionary could be built listing the untreated genomic,
                    transcriptomic, proteomic and metabolomic profile optimally responding to a drug
                    combination, and this information could guide therapy in individual patients.</p>
                <p>The algorithms could be used not only to find optimal combinations for specific
                    diseases but also for individual patients when repeated sampling is feasible,
                    for example in studies of chemosensitivity of cells from the blood of leukemia
                    patients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Nerenberg1">[39]</xref>.</p>

                <p>Novel technology for high-throughput screening and for omic data measurements
                    might allow us to develop new combined pharmacological interventions adapting
                    algorithmic and theoretical approaches from more quantitative sciences</p>
                <p>We report data from computational simulations and from biological experiments
                        <italic>in vivo</italic> and in cell culture, suggesting that modified
                    search algorithms from information theory have the potential to enhance the
                    discovery of novel optimal or near-optimal therapeutic combinations.</p>
                <p>It would be desirable to obtain a larger number of fully factorial datasets, for
                    different biological systems. This would allow a direct comparison of the
                    algorithms reported here with other reasonable alternatives, such as stochastic
                    algorithms. Fully factorial datasets would be even more useful if they were to
                    include system-wide molecular (omic) data, at least for the single drug and for
                    untreated cases. While this might require a considerable experimental effort, it
                    would allow this area of research to be firmly established and provide a
                    resource for scientists with different algorithmic backgrounds to test their
                    ideas.</p>
                <p>Several colleagues have already pointed out analogies with other computational
                    problems within their fields of expertise that might lead to useful alternative
                    approaches. For example a colleague has suggested that exploring alternatives
                    within the class of “online algorithms” is a promising area
                    of future work. Other colleagues have proposed that modern biologically-inspired
                    heuristic methods, such as “particle swarm optimization”,
                    might also be used to search for optimized drug combinations. In the next few
                    years we plan to obtain and make fully available on the web additional fully
                    factorial datasets for drug-induced selective cell death, and we hope that this
                    will stimulate interdisciplinary interest in this approach to the problem of
                    multi-drug therapy.</p>

                <p>A detailed account of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> cardiac aging model was
                    presented previously, in which an age-dependent decline in Drosophila cardiac
                    rate under stress was reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Paternostro1">[11]</xref>. We developed
                    new methods for imaging rapidly and non-invasively the adult
                    <italic>Drosophila</italic> heart and for automated measurement of heart rate
                    and its variability.</p>
                <p>To assess exercise capacity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and changes with age,
                    climbing velocity was measured using a method described by Gargano et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Gargano1">[40]</xref>,
                    modified to include image processing that allowed individual flies to be
                    studied.</p>
                <p>The flies were transferred into 15-ml tubes and the operator tapped the top of
                    the tube. Owing to their capacity for geotaxis orientation, flies tend to climb
                    upwards. A digital imaging system/camera (Motionscope PCI, Redlake Imaging MASD,
                    Inc.) with an attached Vivitar wide-angle lens, was used to capture video
                    sequences at 60 frames per second of the flies as they climbed the tube. Images
                    were analyzed with software (MotionScope 2.21.1) and for each fly within the
                    tube an individual velocity was obtained.</p>
                <p>The selected compounds and doses (in the fly food) were: doxycycline, with
                    concentrations at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL; sodium selenite, at 0.005 mg/mL and
                    0.0125 mg/mL; zinc sulfate, at 0.5 mg/mL and 1 mg/mL; and resveratrol, at 0.25

                <p>The data sets, used to test the SS′ and SS-TD′ algorithms,
                    were created using the apoptosis model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000249-Calzolari1">[1]</xref>, with some
                    changes concerning the search procedure and the output value. Instead of
                    performing an exhaustive search on all the nodes of the network, we limited the
                    search to a randomly chosen subgroup of nodes. We also used as output value the
                    difference of the cubic value of one individual compared to the average of the
                    cubic sum of the remaining population, to reward the individuals with the
                    highest values.</p>
                <p>Confirmatory simulations were also performed, to test the robustness of our
                    findings by changing several parameters. The parameters were the number of
                    states for nodes and links, the starting values for the states, the ranges of
                    the output of the simulation, and the nodes selected for the interventions.</p>
                <p>The software was written in C++ and implemented on 32-nodes of
                    a 64-bit Linux cluster with 2GB of memory per node. The longest searches
                    required about 30 minutes of computation.</p>
                <p>The analysis of the collected data consisted of three separated steps: sort,
                    search algorithm and statistical analysis. For the first step, a quick sort
                    implementation was used creating different ranks for each individual. In the
                    second step, all the algorithms and random execution returned information for
                    each rank. These were used in the last step, where we collected the statistical
                    analysis data, dividing the resulting population into different samples, to
                    compare each algorithm with the others.</p>
                <p>Owing to the dimension of the data, it was necessary to limit the number of
                    analyzed nodes to a maximum of 9. Computational time was significant only for
                    the sorter, requiring several hours for the largest files on an entry-level
                    Linux workstation.</p>

                <p>ATP is a marker for cell viability because it is present in all metabolically
                    active cells and the concentration declines very rapidly when the cells undergo
                    necrosis or apoptosis. Human tumor cells DOHH2 and RS11846 were maintained as
                    suspension cultures at standard conditions: humidified atmosphere with
                    5% carbon dioxide, at 37°C in an incubator, using RPMI-1640
                    medium, supplemented with 10% heat-inactivated fetal calf serum and 2
                    mM L-glutamine. Cells were kept in log phase via replacement of cellular
                    suspension aliquots by fresh medium two or three times weekly. Stock solutions
                    of the 6 chosen drugs were freshly prepared in water (Vincristine),
                    physiological saline solution (Rituximab) or DMSO (Etoposide, Q-VD-Oph,
                    Apogossypol and Dexamethasone). The stock solutions were diluted with RPMI-1640
                    in order to obtain the desired final concentrations. Less than 0.5%
                    of the solvent was present at the final dilutions. All the procedures related to
                    cell culture, drug preparation, and treatment were carried out in a laminar flow

                    µL aliquots of ATPlite reconstituted reagent (Perkin-Elmer) were added
                    to every well. The plates were shaken for 3 minutes at 750 rpm (Eppendorf
                    MixMate). The absorption of the samples was measured using a monolight 3096
                    microplate luminometer (BD). Ten µL of a 10 mM ATP solution was added
                    to every well as internal standard. The plates were shaken for 2 minutes at 750
