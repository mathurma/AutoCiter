<abstract>
<p>Postnatal thymic epithelial cell (TEC) homeostatic defect- or natural aging-induced thymic atrophy results in a decline in central T-cell tolerance establishment, which is constituted by thymocyte negative selection and cluster of differentiation (CD) 4<sup>+</sup> thymic regulatory T (tTreg) cell generation. Emerging evidence shows this decline mainly results from defects in negative selection, but there is insufficient evidence regarding whether tTreg cell generation is also impaired. We mechanistically studied tTreg cell generation in the atrophied thymus by utilizing both postnatal TEC-defective (resulting from <italic>FoxN1-</italic>floxed conditional knockout [cKO]) and naturally aged mouse models. We found that the capacity of tTreg cell generation was not impaired compared to CD4<sup>+</sup> thymic conventional T cells, suggesting thymic atrophy positively influences tTreg cell generation. This is potentially attributed to decreased T cell receptor (TCR) signaling strength due to inefficiency in promiscuous expression of self-antigens or presenting a neo-self-antigen by medullary TECs, displaying decreased negative selection-related marker genes (Nur77 and CD5<sup>high</sup>) in CD4 single positive (SP) thymocytes. Our results provide evidence that the atrophied thymus attempts to balance the defective negative selection by enhancing tTreg cell generation to maintain central T-cell tolerance in the elderly. Once the balance is broken, age-related diseases could take place.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Chronic inflammation in the elderly is partially attributed to atrophy of the thymus—an organ that regulates the immune system—and in particular the ability of organisms to recognize their own cells—a phenomenon known as central tolerance. Immune central tolerance is established by two processes: first, immune cells that react strongly to self are eliminated in a process called negative selection, and second, thymic regulatory T (tTreg) cells are generated to suppress self-reactive immune reactions. The former has already been reported to be defective in the aged thymus, but whether the generation of new tTreg cells is also impaired has remained unclear. Here, we analyzed the effect of aging on tTreg cell generation and found that the atrophied thymus is still able to make new tTreg cells; indeed, we show that tTreg cell generation capacity is enhanced when compared with other naïve T cells from the same thymus. We conclude that the balance of defective negative selection with enhanced tTreg cell generation may be necessary to avoid autoimmune diseases during aging.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Central T-cell tolerance, which refers to the mechanism by which newly developing T cells are rendered nonreactive to self [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref001">1</xref>], plays an important role in controlling autoimmunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref002">2</xref>]. Central T-cell tolerance is established in the thymus through two main processes: thymocyte negative selection to deplete self-reactive T clones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref004">4</xref>] and tTreg cell generation to execute suppressive function in the periphery [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref006">6</xref>]. Both negative selection and tTreg cell generation are critically dependent on medullary thymic epithelial cell (mTEC)-presentation (promiscuous expression) of self-antigens/peptides binding to the MHC groove (self-peptide-Major Histocompatibility Complex [self-pMHC]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref007">7</xref>]. Once the self-pMHC interacts with T cell receptors (TCRs) on the self-reactive T clones, a TCR signal is produced. Based on affinity/avidity of self-pMHC to self-TCR, this interaction may produce a strong signal, causing negative selection to lead to deletion of this self-T clone. However, if a weak signal is produced, it will allow this T clone to survive and differentiate into thymic conventional T (tTcon) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref008">8</xref>]. Moreover, if the TCR receives a signal at an intermediate strength, or a strong but transient signal (hit-and-run), this self-T clone will undergo tTreg cell differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref009">9</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref010">10</xref>]. Therefore, central T-cell tolerance establishment in the thymus is determined by the interaction between the self-pMHC on the thymic epithelial cells (TECs) and TCR on the developing thymocytes.</p>
<p>During aging, the thymus undergoes a progressively age-related atrophy, or involution, which leads to the impairment of central T-cell tolerance establishment, resulting in increased self-reactivity in the periphery, which is one of the etiologies that induce the manifestation of chronic inflammation in the elderly (termed inflammaging) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref011">11</xref>]. This atrophy is attributed both to the deterioration of TEC homeostasis, particularly mTEC, regulated by the <italic>FOXN1</italic> (Forkhead box protein N1) gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref012">12</xref>], and in part, the decline of the autoimmune regulator <italic>Aire</italic> gene in mTECs, which causes a prominent dysfunction in negative selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>]. The generation of tTreg cells are critical for the maintenance of self-antigen tolerance and immune homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref006">6</xref>]. Although evidence shows that aging is associated with enhancement of the peripheral regulatory T cell (pTreg) population as well as its function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref016">16</xref>], it is largely unclear whether the process of tTreg cell development in the age-related atrophied thymus is enhanced or impaired. Although newly generated tTreg cells were reported to be substantially declined with age in a recent report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref017">17</xref>], the experimental evidence on this point is still insufficient. Therefore, the question is whether tTreg cell generation in the aged thymus exhibits any decline or enhancement along with declined negative selection; whether thymic atrophy differentially impacts these two processes of central T-cell tolerance establishment; and what the underlying mechanism is.</p>
<p>In this study, we explored how tTreg cell generation in the atrophied thymus is affected and by what mechanism in mouse models. We demonstrated that although thymic atrophy perturbs negative selection, resulting in an inability to sufficiently deplete self-reactive T clones, it was compensated for by relative enhancement of tTreg cell generation, as shown by an increased ratio of percentage of tTreg cells to percentage of tTcon cells and unreduced absolute tTreg cell numbers despite a dramatically decreased whole thymic cellularity. This relative enhancement was attributed to the new generation/differentiation of tTreg cells, rather than any changes in apoptotic or anti-apoptotic features, which was demonstrated by enhanced phosphoralated-Zap70 (p-Zap70) and unchanged apoptotic (Annexin V<sup>+</sup>) cells in certain cell subsets. We determined that the mechanism is potentially due to a declined TCR signaling strength, shifting from high strength, which is required for negative selection, to intermediate strength, which favors tTreg cell generation, because negative selection-related marker gene signals (Nur77 and cluster of differentiation [CD] 5<sup>high</sup>) were decreased in certain cell subsets of the atrophied thymus compared to those in the young thymus. Additionally, this declined TCR signaling strength is due to an inefficient presentation of self-pMHC on mTECs, which was demonstrated in a neo/mock self-antigen rat insulin promoter (RIP)-driven membrane-bound ovalbumin (mOVA) transgenic (Tg) mouse model. Together, our results provide evidence that the atrophied thymus attempts to balance the defective negative selection by relatively enhancing tTreg cell generation to maintain central T-cell tolerance in the elderly.</p>

<title>Thymic atrophy relatively enhanced tTreg generation associated with a reduced mature Treg thymic reentrance</title>
<p>To determine whether the capacity of newly generated tTreg cells is impaired in aged thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref017">17</xref>] and/or in the TEC defect-induced atrophied thymus, we utilized our previously generated mouse model with accelerated thymic atrophy (due to postnatal TEC homeostatic defect) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref012">12</xref>], in which the <italic>loxp</italic>-flanked <italic>FoxN1</italic> gene (<italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref018">18</xref>] can be deleted by ubiquitous promoter-driven Cre-recombinase and estrogen-receptor fusion protein (CreER<sup>T</sup>) mediation through either a tamoxifen (TM) induction or a CreER<sup>T</sup> autoleakage with age. We named this model the FC (<italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup>/CreER<sup>T</sup>) mouse and FF (<italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup> without CreER<sup>T</sup> for controls) mouse. One-month-old FC thymi without any TM treatment exhibit the same thymocyte profiles as those in wild-type (WT) young mice. However, when young FC mice are treated with TM for 3 consecutive days (TM x3), or FC mice are housed for more than 6 months without any TM treatment but with an age-related CreER<sup>T</sup> autoleakage, their thymi exhibit thymic atrophy analogous to aged (approximately 18-month-old) WT thymi (details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, a <italic>rag</italic>-<italic>gfp</italic> reporter gene was utilized in this model to mark newly generated thymocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>], which we termed either FC-Rag-GFP or FF-Rag-GFP mice. We first observed absolute cell numbers of newly generated (Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup>) CD4 single positive (SP) (CD4<sup>SP</sup>) thymocytes, including tTreg cells and tTcon cells in CD4<sup>SP</sup> population, in the acute atrophied thymus (TM x3) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). We found that although thymic mass was dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1A</xref> image) with reduced numbers of newly generated CD4<sup>SP</sup> and tTcon cells, the newly generated tTreg cells were not decreased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1B</xref>), implying tTreg cells are unaffected by the acute thymic atrophy. We then analyzed integration of tTreg cells and tTcon cells in newly generated CD4<sup>SP</sup> population by measuring the age-dependent dynamic ratios of percentage of tTreg cells to percentage of tTcon cells in the accelerated atrophied thymus (<italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup> deletion through a CreER<sup>T</sup> autoleakage over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref012">12</xref>]).

Under the background of a dramatically decreased total thymic cell number in the atrophied thymus, the absolute cell numbers of newly generated tTcon cells were dynamically decreased, while tTreg cell numbers were not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, right panel). Additionally, we gated the Rag-GFP reporter negative (Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup>) CD4<sup>SP</sup> population (gate shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), which are not composed of newly generated T cells and were proposed to be primarily peripheral cells that had recirculated back to the thymus (i.e., thymic-reentered mature T cells) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref017">17</xref>]. These thymic-reentered pTreg cells were also proposed to suppress development of newly generated tTreg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref017">17</xref>]. The ratio of percentage of regulatory T cells (Treg) (mainly pTreg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref017">17</xref>]) to percentage of conventional T (Tcon) cells of Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup> in the thymus was decreased with age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, left panel), while the absolute cell numbers of both Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup> populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1D</xref>, right panel) mirrored the pattern observed with the Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup> population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1C</xref>, right panel). Together, these results suggest that the severity of thymic atrophy positively influences new tTreg cell generation and negatively affects pTreg cells reentering the thymus.</p>

<p>In the naturally aged (WT, ≥ 18 months old) mouse, pTreg cells are increased [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref015">15</xref>] due to their accumulation, which is attributed to decreased <italic>Bim</italic> (a pro-apoptotic gene) expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref020">20</xref>]. However, the <italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup>-deleted mice have a relative young periphery since only the thymus undergoes an accelerated aging. Therefore, the young FC mouse does not have increased/accumulated pTreg cells. In order to account for the peripheral interference of new tTreg cell generation in the naturally age-related atrophied thymus, we investigated the same parameters in WT (containing Rag-GFP reporter) mouse thymi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g002">Fig 2</xref>). As we expected, in the population of new Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>SP</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, left and middle panels), the ratio of percentage of tTreg cells to percentage of tTcon cells was shown also to be increased in an age-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, left panel). The absolute cell numbers of either tTreg cells or tTcon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, linear regression in right panel; for nonlinear one-phase decay, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) showed the same tendency as FC mice in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1C</xref> right panel, as did the Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup>CD4<sup>SP</sup> populations, i.e., potential thymic-reentered cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). These results are consistent with the findings in FC mice shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">Fig 1</xref>. Therefore, we concluded that thymic atrophy does not impair the capacity of new tTreg cell generation and is associated with a reduction of pTreg cells reentering in an age-dependent manner.</p>

<title>Relatively enhanced tTreg cell generation in the atrophied thymus was driven by the thymic microenvironment, rather than tTreg cell intrinsic alterations</title>
<p>We believe that the atrophied thymic microenvironment promotes the activity of new tTreg cell generation. To exclude any intrinsic alterations from tTreg cells in the atrophied thymus, such as tTreg cells acquiring any refractory behavior for anti-apoptosis or loss of suppressive function, we designed an adaptive transfer experiment based on a published protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref021">21</xref>]. We intrathymically (i.t.) injected sorted pre-tTreg cells (CD4<sup>SP</sup>CD25<sup>-neg</sup> thymocytes) from a pool of young OT-II<sup>+</sup> TCR Tg (MHC class-II restricted ovalbumin-specific TCR transgenic) mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref022">22</xref>] (with <italic>Rag</italic><sup>−/−</sup> background, details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s003">S3 Fig</xref>) into either normal (FF control) or acute atrophied (FC, <italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup>CreER<sup>T</sup> with a TM x3 induction) thymi containing RIP-mOVA Tg TECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref024">24</xref>], termed FC- or FF-mOVA mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g003">Fig 3A</xref>).

<p>We first verified that the atrophied thymic microenvironment promoted the grafted pre-tTreg cells (CD4<sup>SP</sup>CD25<sup>-neg</sup> thymocytes) to differentiate into tTreg cells in an increased proportion compared to tTcon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g003">Fig 3B</xref> bottom panels and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g003">Fig 3D</xref>) and that there were unchanged absolute cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g003">Fig 3C</xref>) compared to the counterpart in the FF-mOVA normal thymic microenvironment. The results therefore confirm that changes in the thymic microenvironment, rather than changes intrinsic in T clones, enhance the differentiation toward tTreg cells.</p>
<p>We then observed an increased intensity of p-Zap70 in the subsets of both newly generated tTreg cells and newly generated tTcon cells of the naturally aged thymi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g004">Fig 4A–4D</xref>) and in tTreg cells but not in tTcon cells from the FC-mOVA atrophied thymi infused with OT-II<sup>+</sup> TCR-Tg pre-tTreg cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). The increase of p-Zap70 in T clones indicates that the TCRs are activated and these thymocytes are activated to undergo either apoptosis or differentiation. Therefore, we investigated the apoptosis in tTreg cells and tTcon cells from the young and aged thymi of Rag-GFP reporter mice. This approach is used to either exclude a possibility that the increased tTreg cell proportion is due to aquiring a refractory behavior and subsequently resisting apoptosis or to confirm that the decreased tTcon cell proportion is due to increased apoptosis after TCR activation (increased p-Zap70). The results showed that in the atrophied thymus, apoptosis in newly generated tTreg cells was not reduced or increased compared to those in the normal thymus, whereas apoptosis in newly generated tTcon cells was increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g004">Fig 4F–4H</xref>). The results imply that increased TCR activation in tTreg cells leads to tTreg cell generation, while in tTcon cells it results in tTcon reduction in the aged thymus. Finally, we tested tTreg cell suppressive function to further comfirm that tTreg cells in the atrophied thymus do not possess intrinsic defects in function. This was done by comparing sorted, newly generated tTreg cells (Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup>CD4<sup>SP</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>) from young WT, middle-aged WT, and middle-aged FC mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s004">S4A Fig</xref>).

<p>These results implied insufficient negative selection signals were received by self-reactive TCRs in the atrophied thymus, which leads to a functional handicap of both negative selection and deletion of self-reactive T clones from the developing thymocyte pool, as we reported in our previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<title>Capacity of presenting self-antigen on mTECs in the atrophied thymus declined</title>
<p>TCR signaling strength is produced through an interaction between the self-pMHC presented on mTECs and the self-recognizing TCR expressed on self-T clones. Self-peptide presentation in mTECs is also termed “promiscuous expression” of peripheral tissue-specific antigens (TSAs), which distinguishes the TEC-autonomous gene expression. In addition, expression of most TSAs on mTECs is <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent. Given that aging primarily occurs in TECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref034">34</xref>] and the <italic>Aire</italic> gene is declined in mTECs on a per-cell basis in the atrophied thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>], this suggests that mTECs in the age-related atrophied thymus are unable to normally promiscuously express self-pMHC. Therefore, we hypothesized that the reduced TCR signaling strength is due to ineffective self-pMHC expression on the surface of these mTECs, leading to a reduction of interactive signaling to the self-T clones. This is unlikely to be a defect in TCR avidity since transfer of young thymocytes into the atrophied thymus showed the same relatively enhanced tendency of new tTreg cell generation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g003">Fig 3</xref>). Therefore, we detected expression of a neo/mock-self-antigen (mOVA) on mTECs to mimic TSA expression in FF-mOVA and FC-mOVA mouse models. In this model, mOVA expression on mTECs is controlled by <italic>Aire</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref024">24</xref>], and the thymus of FC-mOVA experiences accelerated aging (resulting from a <italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup> deletion under a CreER<sup>T</sup> autoleakage over time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref012">12</xref>], see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). Our results showed that mOVA expression in the FC-mOVA<sup>+</sup> thymus was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g007">Fig 7</xref>), which verified our hypothesis that mTECs in the atrophied thymus are unable to present self-antigen efficiently. This notion is also supported by our previous finding that <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent self-antigens (such as salivary protein-1, Insulin-1 and -2, intestinal fatty acid binding protein) were decreased in mTECs of the <italic>FoxN1</italic>-conditional knockout (cKO) atrophied thymus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref013">13</xref>].</p>

<title>The tTreg cell-required cytokines and NF-κB factor unlikely affected tTreg cell generation in the atrophied thymic microenvironment</title>
<p>To further identify the underlying mechanism by which thymic atrophy relatively enhances tTreg cell generation, we also considered that tTreg cell generation-required cytokines, such as interleukin-2 (IL-2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref035">35</xref>] and Transforming Growth Factor-Beta (TGFβ) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref036">36</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref037">37</xref>], as well as transcription factors, such as the Nuclear Factor kappa Beta (NF-κB) family [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref039">39</xref>], which are primarily provided by the thymic microenvironment, could be altered in the atrophied thymus. We detected that in the naturally aged and acute atrophied FC thymi (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), expression levels of IL-2 and TGFβ, as well as one of the NF-kB family of transcription factors, p105/p50, were unchanged compared to young and FF counterparts with normal thymi. Only expression of p105/p50 was slightly increased in the naturally aged thymus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, top panel), which was due to inflammation in the atrophied thymus. Although this increase could help tTreg cell maturation by inducing expression of forkhead box P3 (FoxP3) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref039">39</xref>], this is most likely not the primary mechanism for the enhancement of tTreg cell generation we observed in the atrophied thymus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Using a combination of naturally aged and multiple genetically engineered mouse models and investigating signaling molecules in either the thymocyte or mTEC thymic cellular compartments, we have demonstrated that the aged, atrophied thymic microenvironment does not impair, but may relatively promote, tTreg cell generation. This evidence has revealed how central tolerance is established in the age-related atrophied thymic microenvironment, which we determined to be a heterogeneous effect of defective negative selection accompanied by relatively enhanced tTreg cell generation. This is probably a potential attempt by the atrophied thymus to desperately balance the defective negative selection by enhancing tTreg cell generation to maintain central T-cell tolerance. As we know, under normal conditions, two arms—namely, negative selection and tTreg cell generation—work in tandem for central T-cell tolerance establishment. However, in the age-related atrophied thymus, as one arm of tolerance induction (negative selection) fails, we assert that the second arm (tTreg cell generation) attempts to compensate, resulting in relative tTreg cell enhancement.</p>
<p>This mechanism can be explained by changes in TCR signaling strength in the thymus, which acts as a gate-keeper to determine thymocyte fate (diagrammed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g008">Fig 8</xref>). Although this is the first time that this observation has been noted in the TEC-defective and age-related atrophied thymus, the phenomenon has been demonstrated by several loss-of-function young mouse models. The TCR signaling is produced by interaction between the two parties: mTECs and thymocytes. The first established mouse model for studying this signaling pathway contains an alteration in the thymocyte side. As we know, when the TCR responds to antigen recognition, the immunoreceptor tyrosine-based activation motifs (ITAMs) are activated and the signaling kinase Zap70 is subsequently phosphorylated. A mouse model with a knock-in allele of TCRξ chain gene with tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutations in 6 out of 10 ITAMs leads to a 60% decrease in TCR signaling potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref040">40</xref>]. This mouse model exhibited a defect in negative selection but an increase in tTreg cell generation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref040">40</xref>]. The second mouse model for the TCR signaling pathway contains a change in the TEC compartment. Tg expression of a microRNA targeting Major Histocompatibility Complex (MHC) class-II transactivator (CIITA) results in declined MHC-II on mTECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref026">26</xref>], which leads to an insufficiency for mTECs to present self-antigens for normal interaction with TCR. This also resulted in an enhancement of tTreg cell generation at the expense of negative selection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref026">26</xref>]. These two models from both parties of the signaling interaction support one conclusion, namely, that shifting a strong signal to an intermediate signal due to any weakening of the interaction between self-pMHC and self-reactive TCR allows the self-reactive thymocytes, which should be deleted, to differentiate to tTreg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref025">25</xref>]. In the age-related atrophied thymus, the capacity of self-antigen presentation (promiscuous expression of TSAs) on mTECs is reduced due to a defect in TEC homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref012">12</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref034">34</xref>] associated with a decline of <italic>Aire</italic> gene expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref013">13</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>]. Although there has been controversy about the role of <italic>Aire</italic> gene in positive selection of Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref041">41</xref>], it has been accepted that <italic>Aire</italic> regulates <italic>Aire</italic>-dependent self-peptide expression on mTECs. Moreover, total [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref042">42</xref>] or certain specific [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref043">43</xref>] tTreg cells were found not to be decreased in <italic>Aire</italic> deficient models. Therefore, the interaction of self-pMHC and self-reactive TCR produces weak signals in the age-related atrophied thymus, which results in a similar outcome as illustrated by the second model: ineffective mTECs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref026">26</xref>].</p>

<p>Interaction between self-pMHC on mTEC and TCR on thymocytes produces three types of signaling strength to determine self-T clone fates. A strong signal leads to negative selection and results in the self-T clone depletion; an intermediate signal leads to thymocyte differentiation to a tTreg cell population; and a weak signal results in thymocyte survival to differentiate into tTcon cells. These signals can be detected by negative selection marker genes, such as Nur77 and CD5 expression on CD4<sup>SP</sup> thymocytes. Thymic aging impairs mTECs, including a decline of <italic>Aire</italic> expression. It results in ineffective presentation of self-pMHC, thereby weakening the interactions between self-pMHC and TCR. Therefore, some self-T clones which should be depleted shift to tTreg cell generation due to strong signaling strength shifting toward intermediate signaling strength.

<p>Our results presented here are inconsistent with a published report in which the phenotype of “substantially decreased new tTreg cells and augmented recirculating pTreg cells among thymic Treg cells with age” was observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref017">17</xref>]. These phenotypes were based on different observations by comparing Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup> Treg cells versus Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup> Treg cells within a thymic Treg subset and Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup> Tcon cells versus Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup> Tcon cells within a thymic Tcon subset, rather than comparing Treg cells to Tcon cells within the Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>SP</sup> or Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup> CD4<sup>SP</sup> subsets. The results presented a proportion change between newly generated (Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup>) and reentered (Rag-GFP<sup>-neg</sup>) portions only in the same subset, rather than reflecting the changes in an integrated total CD4<sup>SP</sup> population. Therefore, it does not exhibit integrated changes in newly generated and reentered Treg cells compared to their counterpart Tcon cells and within the entire CD4<sup>SP</sup> cell population. Regarding inhibition of the de novo tTreg cell generation by reentered pTreg cells in the thymus, these cells may be importantly involved in a potential negative feedback loop of regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref017">17</xref>]. Since pTreg cells are increased in aged mice and humans due to declined <italic>Bim</italic> gene-resulted accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref015">15</xref>], it is a concern that aged pTreg cells may reenter the aged thymus more than their young counterparts to augment inhibition of new tTreg cell generation. However, we did not see this, since there was no particularly different tendency of re-entry of young pTreg cells (FC model possesses a young periphery with no accumulated Treg cells and no decreased <italic>Bim</italic> gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>]) or old pTreg cells (naturally aged model) in the atrophied thymus (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g002">2C</xref>). Therefore, the pTreg reentering mechanism should be the same in either young or aged individuals.</p>
<p>Development of tTreg cells in the thymus is primarily dependent on thymic microenvironments. We found that the atrophied thymic microenvironment favors tTreg cell development because they demonstrated more activity compared to their counterparts in the normal thymus (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g004">4A–4E</xref>) and compared to tTcon cells in the same atrophied thymus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). This is not due to apoptotic resistance by a refractory feature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g004">Fig 4F–4H</xref>). Except for tTreg cells, apoptosis in tTcon cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g004">Fig 4F–4H</xref>) and in other populations of FC mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref018">18</xref>] is increased. Increased apoptotic microenvironment was reported to drive tTreg cell generation through the apoptosis-TGFβ-FoxP3 axis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref021">21</xref>]. Although we did not find any increase of TGFβ (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s005">S5 Fig</xref>), we believe that increased apoptosis in the thymus induces an increased pro-inflammatory condition that will be favorable for tTreg cell development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref038">38</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>It is well known that in aged humans and mice, an increased pTreg pool has been observed not only in proportion and absolute Treg numbers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref015">15</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref044">44</xref>] but also in function [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref016">16</xref>], which negatively affects anti-infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref045">45</xref>] and antitumor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref046">46</xref>] immunity. Given the fact that tTreg cell generation is relatively enhanced in the aged atrophied thymus, we have a reason to deduce that output of tTreg cells may impact the pTreg pool in aged individuals. Although evidence is still insufficient, it was reported that in the pTreg pool, the proportion of natural Treg cells (i.e., tTreg cells, based on recommended Treg nomenclature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref047">47</xref>]) versus inducible Treg cells is increased with age [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref048">48</xref>]. This not only implies that older individuals are less capable of generating inducible Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref048">48</xref>] due to an intrinsic defect in these extrathymically induced Treg cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref049">49</xref>] but also indirectly suggests that aged thymus-derived tTreg cells are increased in the peripheral pTreg pool. Our peripheral data also provide evidence that recent thymic emigrant (Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup>) Treg cells in the spleens of aged mice were increased, while Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup> CD4<sup>SP</sup> Tcon cells in the spleens of aged mice were decreased (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Another profound question is why this increased tTreg cell involvement in the aged pTreg pool cannot suppress self-reactivity-induced inflammaging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>], although it suppresses normal anti-infection and antitumor immunity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref045">45</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref046">46</xref>]. This can probably be accounted for because reduced capacity of presenting self-pMHC diverts the lineage of some tTreg cell-biased clones into self-reactive tTcon cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref050">50</xref>]. These tTcon cells are released to the periphery to elevate self-reactivity, which is our next in-depth work. There is also another possibility of an imbalance between increased total Treg cells and decreased specific Treg cells, i.e., a biased tTreg cell specificity, which is seen in unpublished studies of certain autoimmune diseases and will be substantially addressed in our future work as well. However, as we have reported here, the atrophied thymus indeed attempts to balance the defective negative selection by enhancing tTreg cell generation to try to maintain central T-cell immune tolerance in the elderly. This mechanism should contribute to an optimal balance in most aged people since most of them do not have an onset of age-related autoimmune diseases, despite most elderly people having increased chronic inflammation. However, once this balance is broken, age-related inflammatory diseases could take place.</p>

Briefly, intact thymic lobes from FF- or FC-mOVA-Tg newborn mice were directly transplanted into young host OT-II<sup>+</sup> TCR-Tg mice under the kidney capsule (a diagram is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2003352.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). One week after the transplantation, the host mice were i.p. injected with TM x3 to induce deletion of the <italic>FoxN1</italic><sup>fx/fx</sup> gene in the grafted thymic lobes. Two weeks after the last TM injection, the grafted thymi were isolated for flow cytometric analysis (FACS) of Nur77 and CD5 in CD4<sup>SP</sup> cells carrying Vα2<sup>+</sup>V<bold><italic>β</italic></bold>5<sup>+</sup> TCR chain type for detecting cells bearing OT-II<sup>+</sup> TCR-Tg T cells.</p>

<title>Flow cytometric assay of thymocytes and TECs</title>
<p>For thymocyte staining, single-thymocyte suspensions were prepared from the thymi of mice using a 70-μm cell strainer. Samples were then stained with specific fluorochrome-conjugated antibodies of cell surface CD markers, indicated in each figure legend, and then fixed and permeabilized with fixation/permeabilization buffer (eBioscience Treg staining kit, #88-8115-40), per company’s instruction, followed by intracellular staining for PE-anti-FoxP3 (eBioscience Cat# 12-5773-82) or FITC-anti-FoxP3 (eBioscience Cat# 11-5773-82), and/or PE-anti-p-Zap70 (Cell Signaling, Cat# 14791, clone 65E4, recognizing phosphorylation at Tyr319/Syk [Tyr352]), PE-anti-Nur77 (eBioscience, Cat# 12-5965-82, clone 12.14), and AlexaFluor488-anti-GFP (BioLegend, Cat# FM264G). For TEC staining, the thymus was cut into pieces, then was digested with Collagenase-V/DNase-I, as per previously published methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref051">51</xref>], then stained with surface molecules: fluorochrome-conjugated anti-CD45 (clone 30-F11), -MHC-II (clone M5/114.15.2), -Ly51 (clone 6C3), and -EpCAM (clone G8.8), which were purchased from BioLegend, and FITC-anti-Ovalbumin from AbCam (Cat# ab85584). Flow cytometry was performed using an LSRII flow cytometer (BD Biosciences) with 6 colors, and data were analyzed using Flow-Jo software.</p>

<title>Annexin-V-based apoptosis assays of tTreg cells</title>
<p>Thymocytes were harvested from young (2 months old) and aged (16 months old) Rag-GFP reporter mice, and stained with surface CD markers as described above. Then, the cells were washed with Annexin-V binding buffer and incubated in APC-Annexin-V (BioLegend, Cat# 640920) at a 1:20 dilution with Annexin-V binding buffer (10 mM Hepes adjusted to pH 7.4, 140 mM NaCl and 2.5 mM CaCl<sub>2</sub>) for 15 min at room temperature in the dark. The cells were then washed with PBS and fixed and permeabilized with fixation/permeabilization buffer, followed by eBioScience intracellular staining protocol for FoxP3 and GFP. Positive control cells were aliquoted from the thymocytes and made by incubating at 55°C for 20 min to induce cell death before staining.</p>

<title>Suppressive function assay of tTreg cells</title>
<p>Antigen presenting cells (APCs) were prepared from young WT mouse bone marrow-derived dendritic cells (with rGM-CSF and rIL-4 induction to get 85% CD11c<sup>+</sup> cells) and were treated with irradiation of 2,000 Rads. T effector (Teff) cells were prepared from young WT spleen through direct flow cytometric sorting of CD4<sup>+</sup>CD25<sup>-neg</sup> spleen T cells; details were outlined in our and others’ previous publications [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref016">16</xref>]. The tested newly generated tTreg cells (CD4<sup>SP</sup>CD25<sup>+</sup>Rag-GFP<sup>+</sup>) were sorted from 3 groups of thymocytes: young (approximately 6–8 weeks old) Rag-GFP WT; middle-aged (approximately 12 months old) Rag-GFP WT; and middle-aged (≥ 8 months old) FC-Rag-GFP mice (similar to ≥18-month-old WT with the atrophied thymus, See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The sorting purity check showed 95%–99% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2003352.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). A mixed culture with APCs (5 × 10<sup>3</sup>/well), Teff cells (5 × 10<sup>4</sup>/well), and tTreg cells (2.5 × 10<sup>4</sup>/well) supplied with CD3ε (1 μg/ml) and CD28 (2 μg/ml) antibodies were set in 96-well U-bottom plates for 72 hours. Proliferation of cells was determined using CellTiter 96 Aqueous One Solution Reagent (Promega, Cat#TB245) following the company’s protocol: adding 20 μl of solution per well for additional 2-hour culture, and absorbance was measured at 490 nm using an ELISA 96-well plate reader (BioTek ELx800).</p>

<title>Real-time RT-PCR for cytokine expression assay</title>
<p>Total RNAs were isolated with TRIzol reagent and reverse transcribed (RT) to cDNA with the SuperScriptIII cDNA kit (Invitrogen/ThermoFisher Scientific). Real-time RT-PCR was performed with TaqMan reagents and primers (TGFβ, NFκBs, IL-2, and housekeeping GAPDH and 18sRNA; the primers and probes were purchased from Invitrogen) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2003352.ref018">18</xref>]. The relative expression levels of mRNAs from the thymi were internally normalized to both GAPDH and 18sRNA levels, then compared to a ΔΔC<sub>T</sub> value from pooled young samples, which was always arbitrarily set as 1.0 in each real-time PCR reaction.</p>
