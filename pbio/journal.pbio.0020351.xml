				<article-title>Endangered Frogs Coexist with Fungus Once Thought Fatal</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The chytrid fungus <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis</named-content> has been implicated in the decline and extinction of numerous frog species worldwide. In Queensland, Australia, it has been proposed as the cause of the decline or apparent extinction of at least 14 high-elevation rainforest frog species. One of these, <italic>Taudactylus eungellensis,</italic> disappeared from rainforest streams in Eungella National Park in 1985–1986, but a few remnant populations were subsequently discovered. Here, we report the analysis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> infections in toe tips of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> and sympatric species collected in a mark-recapture study between 1994 and 1998. This longitudinal study of the fungus in individually marked frogs sheds new light on the effect of this threatening infectious process in field, as distinct from laboratory, conditions. We found a seasonal peak of infection in the cooler months, with no evidence of interannual variation. The overall prevalence of infection was 18% in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> and 28% in <italic>Litoria wilcoxii/jungguy,</italic> a sympatric frog that appeared not to decline in 1985–1986. No infection was found in any of the other sympatric species. Most importantly, we found no consistent evidence of lower survival in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> that were infected at the time of first capture, compared with uninfected individuals. These results refute the hypothesis that remnant populations of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> recovered after a <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> epidemic because the pathogen had disappeared. They show that populations of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> now persist with stable, endemic infections of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content>.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Increasingly, the amphibian chytrid fungus <italic>(Batrachochytrium dendrobatidis)</italic> has been implicated as a major contributor to global catastrophic declines in frog populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger4">Berger et al. 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Daszak1">Daszak et al. 1999</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Daszak2">2003</xref>). It has been found on frogs in areas where catastrophic declines were reported, it has been shown in the laboratory to be highly pathogenic to some species, and there is pathological evidence to link this fungal parasite to host mortality (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger4">Berger et al. 1998</xref>). The pathogen may therefore be capable of producing the extremely high mortality observed during declines. However, little information is available on the impact of the fungus on individuals in the field, rather than the laboratory. Furthermore, little has been published on the prevalence of infection among frog populations as a whole, as distinct from the prevalence among morbid frogs only. In addition to data on the prevalence of the pathogen among morbid animals, information on the prevalence of a putative pathogen in the population in general is important to determine the potential effect of the pathogen on the host population (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McCallum1">McCallum and Dobson 1995</xref>).</p>
      <p>In Queensland, Australia, there have been extinctions or major declines of at least 14 frog species in undisturbed, high-elevation rainforest streams, commencing in 1979–1981 in the Conondale and Blackall Ranges (26°50′ S, 152°41′ E), followed in 1985–1986 in the Eungella region of the Clarke Range (21°07′ S, 148°29′ E), and, in 1990–1995, in the Wet Tropics bioregion (17°22′ S, 145°49′ E) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Laurance1">Laurance et al. 1996</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McDonald1">McDonald and Alford 1999</xref>). <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Laurance1">Laurance et al. (1996</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Laurance2">1997</xref>) suggested that an epidemic disease was responsible for all these declines, without proposing an agent. Despite the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> in ill and dead frogs collected from the Big Tableland in the Wet Tropics in 1993, it was not recognised as a pathogenic organism until 1998 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger4">Berger et al. 1998</xref>) and was described as a new species of fungus in 1999 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Longcore1">Longcore et al., 1999</xref>). <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> has been suggested as the causative agent of many of the east coast Australian declines (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger2">Berger et al. 1999a</xref>), although only the decline at Big Tableland (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McDonald1">McDonald and Alford 1999</xref>) had direct evidence of an association with the presence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content>.</p>
      <p>In this paper, we report the retrospective analysis of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> infection on toe tips collected between 1994 and 1998 from six species of frogs at Eungella National Park in east-central Queensland, Australia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020351-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Declines at this location were particularly catastrophic. Between 1985 and 1986, the Eungella Gastric-Brooding Frog <italic>(Rheobatrachus vitellinus)</italic> disappeared suddenly from relatively undisturbed rainforest streams, and it is now considered to be extinct (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McDonald2">McDonald 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Campbell1">Campbell 1999</xref>; Department of Environment and Heritage 2003). During the same period, the Eungella Torrent Frog <italic>(Taudactylus eungellensis)</italic> also disappeared, but it was later found to have persisted in a few small populations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McDonald2">McDonald 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Couper1">Couper 1992</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McNellie1">McNellie and Hero 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Retallick1">Retallick et al. 1997</xref>), which are the subject of this paper. A suite of other species that coexisted with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. vitellinus</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> showed no evidence of decline. Unfortunately, the extent of infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> in the frog community at Eungella during the period of decline is unknown. The first record of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> at Eungella was from a moribund frog collected in 1995 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger2">Berger et al. 1999a</xref>).</p>

      <p>We detected <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> on 71 (15.0%) of the 474 toes assessed. Four species showed no sign of infection, while we detected infections on 58 (18.4%) of 316 toes of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> and 13 (34%) of 47 toes of frogs identified at the time as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Litoria lesueuri</named-content> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020351-t001">Table 1</xref>).

      <p>Using a logistic model with season (summer, autumn, winter, and spring), species, and site as predictor variables, we found significant effects of each variable on infection, corrected for the effects of the other variables (for season, the change in deviance [Δdev] = 15.25, df = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0061; for site, Δdev = 13.56, df = 5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.02; for species, Δdev = 17.32, df = 5, <italic>p</italic> = 0.004). The most parsimonious model (i.e., one that minimizes the Akaike Information Criterion [AIC]) included each of these predictors but no interaction terms.</p>
      <p>Further analysis was concentrated on the two species on which <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> was detected, namely <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> and <italic>L. wilcoxii/jungguy.</italic></p>
      <sec id="s2a">
        <title>Infection in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content></title>
        <p>The proportions of frogs that were infected in the three largest populations (at Rawson Creek, Dooloomai Falls, and Tree Fern Creek [<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020351-g001">Figure 1</xref>]) differed significantly among those sites (Δdev = 12.84, df = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). A significantly smaller proportion was infected at Rawson Creek (10.5%) than at Dooloomai Falls (26.7%) or Tree Fern Creek (25.0%). There was a marginally significant difference overall in the infection levels among males, females, and subadults (Δdev = 5.9, df = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.052). However, when site was included in the model, any suggestion of a difference in infection level between males, females, or subadults disappeared. When we separated the main <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> populations, it was apparent that the difference in prevalence between those categories was influenced by the population at Tree Fern Creek, where 46% of males (<italic>n</italic> = 13) and no females or subadults were infected (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020351-t002">Table 2</xref>). When we grouped all sites and times, the estimated overall prevalence of infection was 18.1%.</p>

Further, there was no evidence that the pattern of seasonal variation in infection changed among years (Δdev = 5.561, df = 6, <italic>p</italic> = 0.49). Infection was most prevalent (37.8%) during the winter months (1 June to 31 August) and least prevalent (11.3%) during the summer months (1 December to 28/29 February). Comparing the two sites with the largest sample sizes, Dooloomai Falls and Rawson Creek, there was no evidence that they had differing seasonal patterns of infection (Δdev = 5.32, df = 3, <italic>p</italic> = 0.150), although the level of infection overall was much higher at Dooloomai Falls (log odds ratio = 1.1612, standard error [se] = 0.3586, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0012). Infection levels were much higher in winter and spring combined than in summer and autumn (log odds ratio = 1.360, se = 0.3589, <italic>p</italic> = 0.00015), and there was no evidence of infection levels differing between winter and spring or between summer and autumn (Δdev = 1.107, df = 2, <italic>p</italic> = 0.5).

        <p>This simple analysis suggests that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> may affect survival, but confounds the probability of recapturing a frog that is present at a site with the probability that a frog is still present at the site. The more sophisticated analysis that follows separates these two components, although it cannot distinguish between death and permanent emigration from the site. For brevity, we refer to continued presence at the site as “survival.”</p>
        <p>Investigating mark–recapture data for both Rawson Creek and Dooloomai Falls, we found that the best model (on the basis of minimizing the AIC) for which there were sufficient data to estimate almost all parameters had the probability of recapture varying with time but not group (i.e., infected and uninfected males, females, and subadults), and the survival probability differing between the groups but constant through time. However, further analysis in both cases showed that there was no evidence that survival differed between infected and uninfected frogs: At both sites, the group effect was due to survival being highest in females, intermediate in males, and lowest in subadults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020351-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020351-t004">Table 4</xref>). In the case of Tree Fern Creek, which had a smaller total sample size than the other two sites, and in which only males were infected, the best model had recapture probabilities constant with both time and group, and survival varying with group. At this site, there was some evidence that infected males had lower survival than uninfected males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020351-g003">Figure 3</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020351-t004">Table 4</xref>).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Our results show unequivocally that remnant populations of <italic>T. eungellensis,</italic> a rainforest frog that almost disappeared as a result of major die-offs in the Eungella area in the mid 1980s, now persist with stable infections of <italic>B. dendrobatidis.</italic> This does not imply that this pathogen cannot have been responsible for the decline. One hypothesis that can be discarded, however, is that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> drove frog populations to low levels, consequently became locally extinct itself, and that frog populations subsequently recovered or stabilised in the absence of the pathogen. Two other hypotheses are consistent with our observed results.</p>
      <p>It may be that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> was not responsible for the initial decline of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> populations. These populations declined more than a decade before this chytrid was formally identified, and the declines occurred over a very short period (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McDonald2">McDonald 1990</xref>). Because of the rapidity of the declines, no samples were collected during the period of declines, so it is not possible to examine for the presence of <italic>B. dendrobatidis.</italic> Although it is not possible to eliminate all environmental factors as being responsible for the decline of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> and the disappearance of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. vitellinus</named-content> from Eungella in 1985, the failure to detect substantial climatic anomalies in the area at that time (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McDonald2">McDonald 1990</xref>) means that this explanation is unlikely to account for the sudden declines.</p>
      <p>Another possibility consistent with our results is that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> was a pathogen novel to the ecosystem in 1985, and that it was indeed responsible for the declines. Available molecular evidence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Morehouse1">Morehouse et al. 2003</xref>), although not conclusive, is consistent with the hypothesis that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> is a recently emerged disease agent. Populations of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> may have recovered or stabilised following evolution of resistance to the pathogen in the frogs, or evolution of less-pathogenic strains of the fungus. Rapid coevolutionary changes in both host and pathogen following the introduction of a novel pathogen are to be expected, with the best-known example being the coevolution of myxomatosis and its rabbit hosts within a few years of the introduction of the virus to Australia in 1953 (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-May1">May and Anderson 1983</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Fenner1">Fenner and Fantini 1999</xref>). Our study provides no direct evidence for such coevolution in frogs and <italic>B. dendrobatidis,</italic> but it identifies this as an important area for future research. If it could be shown that susceptible frog populations were able to develop resistance to the amphibian chytrid, then captive breeding and artificial selection for resistance would provide an avenue for management of this threat to critically endangered species.</p>
      <p>It is intriguing that we found similar seasonal fluctuations in infection levels within each year, but no evidence of variation among the 4 y of the study. This suggests strongly that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> has become endemic and relatively stable in prevalence in these populations. Given that frog numbers and diversity remained broadly similar over this period, it suggests that some form of host–pathogen equilibrium has become established, in contrast to the epizootic that may have occurred 10 y previously.</p>
      <p>There are some obvious methodological limitations in our study that we must acknowledge. Infection status was determined by histological examination of toe tips at the time of first capture. Toe tips are often examined for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> because the feet of frogs are a particularly favoured body location for infection by the fungus (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger1">Berger 2001</xref>). However, in light infections, <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> can occur in microscopic clusters, which can potentially be missed in histological sections. Hence, a proportion of frogs found to be negative for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> using histology at first capture may actually have been infected. This possibility of false negatives (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger1">Berger 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger5">Berger et al. 2002</xref>) suggests that the infection prevalences found in this study may underestimate the true prevalence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> within these frog populations. For individuals classed as infected at the time of first capture, and that subsequently survived for extended periods, it is not known whether their infection persisted or was cleared after first capture. There is evidence that some frog species can clear <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> infection: 50% of experimentally infected <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Mixophyes fasciolatus</named-content> held at 27 °C with confirmed infection subsequently cleared the infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger1">Berger 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger6">Berger et al. 2004</xref>). The prevalences we report are therefore estimated from the prevalence of infection in frogs captured for the first time in the period under consideration.</p>
      <p>In this study, infection levels of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> were significantly higher during winter and spring than during summer and autumn. A survey of ill and dead frogs from eastern Australia from 1995 to 1999 showed a similar seasonal prevalence of chytridiomycosis (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger6">Berger et al. 2004</xref>). In the laboratory, the growth of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> has been shown to peak at about 23 °C, with death or arrested growth occurring in vitro at temperatures above 30 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Longcore1">Longcore et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Johnson2">Johnson et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Piotrowski1">Piotrowski et al. 2004</xref>). Further, infection in some frog species can be cleared in the laboratory by exposing them to temperatures in excess of 37 °C (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Woodhams1">Woodhams et al. 2003</xref>). At Eungella, 23 °C is a typical daytime maximum temperature for winter, with water and air temperatures along streams generally remaining at or below 23 °C for the entire 24-h daylength period. In summer, however, daytime air temperatures along Eungella's streams regularly exceed 23 °C, and at sites such as Rawson Creek can reach as high as 37 °C (R. Retallick, unpublished data).</p>
      <p>The different infection levels among sites for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> reported in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020351-t002">Table 2</xref> may be correlated with the degree of sunlight and warmth that reaches the streams. The streams at Dooloomai Falls and Tree Fern Creek are well shaded and remain relatively cool and damp for much of the year. At those sites, the average canopy gap above the centre of the streams (a coarse measure of how much sunlight reaches the stream) are 0.35 m and 1.90 m respectively (R. Retallick, unpublished data). Rawson Creek is considerably wider (average canopy gap = 5.10 m) and thus receives more sunlight. With access to sunny microhabitats, where surface temperatures can exceed ambient air temperatures, frogs at “warmer” streams such as Rawson Creek may be less subject to infection at any time of the year, or may be able to reduce infection through thermoregulation. The idea that frogs may avoid, control, or eliminate infection by differential use of their environment warrants considerable and immediate attention. Such a process may prove to be critical to the relationship between <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> and frog populations in the wild.</p>
      <p>Our mark–recapture analysis did not find consistent evidence that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> at the time of first capture had a lower survival rate than uninfected <italic>T. eungellensis.</italic> Failure to reject the null hypothesis of no effect of infection on survival cannot, of course, be used as evidence in favor of the null hypothesis, and it is worth noting that the point estimate of survival for infected males was lower than that for uninfected males at each site. Only at Tree Fern Creek, however, did the best-supported model include an infection term. There was also evidence that infection influenced the proportion of frogs that were recaptured (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020351-t003">Table 3</xref>). Together with the observation that some infected <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> survived for extended periods (a maximum of 1,089 d), our results show that infection with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> did not inevitably lead to rapid death in <italic>T. eungellensis.</italic></p>
      <p>Both epidemiological theory and observations suggest that where a pathogen drives a host species to extinction, there is likely to be a reservoir host within which the pathogen has a reduced effect and is therefore maintained at a higher prevalence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McCallum1">McCallum and Dobson 1995</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McCallum2">2002</xref>). <italic>L. wilcoxii/jungguy</italic> appears not to have declined at the same time as <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">R. vitellinus</named-content> and, in our data, it has a high prevalence of infection. It therefore is a candidate reservoir host. Whether the prevalence of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> differs between the sibling species <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. wilcoxii</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. jungguy</named-content> at sites where they are sympatric would be an interesting question, but cannot be answered from our study. The <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. lesueuri</named-content> complex has a widespread distribution throughout streams on the east coast of Australia (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Barker1">Barker et al. 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Donnellan1">Donellan and Mahony 2004</xref>) and could therefore play a substantial role in the maintenance and spread of chytrid infection throughout that region. If a species is acting as a reservoir, the prevalence of infection in that species should be higher than in species that are declining as a result of infection (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-McCallum1">McCallum and Dobson 1995</xref>). The prevalence of infection we observed in <italic>L. wilcoxii/jungguy</italic> exceeded that observed in <italic>T. eungellensis,</italic> but we do not have clear evidence that this represents a higher prevalence in the populations as a whole. It is also possible that <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> exists as a saprophyte in the environment independent of amphibians (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Longcore1">Longcore et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Johnson1">Johnson and Speare 2003</xref>), or may use tadpoles (which seem relatively little affected by the pathogen) as a reservoir (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Daszak1">Daszak et al. 1999</xref>).</p>
      <p>We did not detect infection in any of the 50 individuals of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Litoria revelata</named-content> or the 42 individuals of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. chloris</named-content> we examined, which demonstrates that those species had a lower prevalence of chytridiomycosis than <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> and <italic>L. wilcoxii/jungguy</italic>. We did not record any infected frogs of any species from the two sites at which <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">L. revelata</named-content> was collected. <italic>Litoria chloris,</italic> however, has been shown to carry infection in other areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Speare1">Speare and Berger 2004</xref>) and in laboratory experiments (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Woodhams1">Woodhams et al. 2003</xref>). Sample sizes in our study for these other frog species may be too small to draw any reliable conclusions about whether they become infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> in the wild.</p>

      <title>Materials and Methods</title>
      <p>Between 1994 and 1998, 36 excursions to Eungella National Park were made as part of a mark–recapture study of populations of frogs associated with streams. Frogs were captured from six study sites (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020351-g001">Figure 1</xref>), which were visited monthly from March 1994 to June 1996, in February and September 1997, and in February and May 1998. When caught for the first time, frogs were toe-clipped using the numbering system devised by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Hero1">Hero (1989)</xref> and then released alive. Amputated toe tips were preserved and individually stored in vials filled with 70% ethanol or 10% formalin. To minimize effects on the animals, no further toes were taken from subsequent recaptures of marked frogs; recaptured frogs were identified and released alive.</p>
      <p>All frog species encountered were monitored, with a special focus on <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> because of its precarious conservation status and history of decline.</p>
      <p>In 1997, toes from six species (278 individual frogs) were histologically prepared in transverse sections stained with Ehrlich's haematoxylin for skeletochronological assessment (see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Castanet1">Castanet et al. [1996]</xref> for a description of the technique). We subsequently reexamined these sections for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger3">Berger et al. 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Pessier1">Pessier et al. 1999</xref>). On average, 160 sections per individual were examined. Despite the sections not being stained with eosin, which highlights the keratinised layer of the epidermis where <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> occurs (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger3">Berger et al. 1999b</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Pessier1">Pessier et al. 1999</xref>), most diagnoses were unambiguous. A small number, however, were not, and those samples were excluded from the analysis. For this assessment, samples were labelled “positive” only when the examiners were convinced that the sample was infected with <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content>. Samples in which no infection was found were labelled “negative.”</p>
      <p>For this study, a further 196 archived toes of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> were analysed by the Australian Animal Health Laboratory in Geelong, Australia, for <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">B. dendrobatidis</named-content> infection using histopathology with immunoperoxidase staining (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Berger5">Berger et al. 2002</xref>). The immunoperoxidase stain improves the sensitivity of diagnosis by highlighting structures that are equivocal with haematoxylin and eosin, and that would otherwise be diagnosed as negative.</p>
      <p>With the software MARK (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Cooch1">Cooch and White 2002</xref>), we used mark–recapture modelling to investigate the survival of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">T. eungellensis</named-content> at different sites. Frogs were grouped into six categories on the basis of their status at first capture (infected and uninfected males, females, and subadults). For both mark–recapture and analysis of prevalence, we grouped the data into 3-mo austral seasons (in Australia, summer runs from 1 December to the end of February, etc.). Mark–recapture modelling of survival requires that several assumptions be satisfied. Most critically, every marked individual present in the population at a given time has the same probability of recapture as all other members of its group, and the same probability of surviving to the next time interval. We used a parametric bootstrap (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-Cooch1">Cooch and White 2002</xref>) to test the goodness of fit of our capture history sets to these assumptions. We analysed prevalence data using logistic models implemented in R (Version 1.6.2) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020351-R1">R Development Core Team 2003</xref>). Since the mark–recapture study was performed with no knowledge of the infection status of individual animals, and the examination of histology was carried out with no knowledge of details of the fate of individual animals in the field, the study was double-blinded in design.</p>

      <p>We are grateful to Diana Mendez, Alex Hyatt, and the diagnostic staff at the Australian Animal Health Laboratory for diagnosis of chytrid infection, and the School of Public Health and Tropical Medicine, James Cook University, for work space and technical support. Funding for the original fieldwork was supplied by a grant from Australian Nature Conservation Agency (now Environment Australia) to J-M Hero, RA Alford, and KR McDonald, and an Australian Post-Graduate Research Award to R Retallick. This study was completed under multiple Queensland Parks and Wildlife Service permits, and ethics approval was obtained from the Experimentation Ethics Review Committee (Biological Sciences, James Cook University). Financial support for the retrospective analysis was provided by the Australian Research Council and the US National Science Foundation Integrated Research Challenges in Environmental Biology scheme. Some of the analysis was carried out by H McCallum while he was a visiting scientist at the Centre for Population Biology, Silwood Park.</p>
