<abstract>
<p>It is crucial to determine whether rapid eye movement (REM) sleep and slow-wave sleep (SWS) (or non-REM sleep), identified in most mammals and birds, also exist in lizards, as they share a common ancestor with these groups. Recently, a study in the bearded dragon (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>vitticeps)</italic> reported states analogous to REM and SWS alternating in a surprisingly regular 80-s period, suggesting a common origin of the two sleep states across amniotes. We first confirmed these results in the bearded dragon with deep brain recordings and electro-oculogram (EOG) recordings. Then, to confirm a common origin and more finely characterize sleep in lizards, we developed a multiparametric approach in the tegu lizard, a species never recorded to date. We recorded EOG, electromyogram (EMG), heart rate, and local field potentials (LFPs) and included data on arousal thresholds, sleep deprivation, and pharmacological treatments with fluoxetine, a serotonin reuptake blocker that suppresses REM sleep in mammals. As in the bearded dragon, we demonstrate the existence of two sleep states in tegu lizards. However, no clear periodicity is apparent. The first sleep state (S1 sleep) showed high-amplitude isolated sharp waves, and the second sleep state (S2 sleep) displayed 15-Hz oscillations, isolated ocular movements, and a decrease in heart rate variability and muscle tone compared to S1. Fluoxetine treatment induced a significant decrease in S2 quantities and in the number of sharp waves in S1. Because S2 sleep is characterized by the presence of ocular movements and is inhibited by a serotonin reuptake inhibitor, as is REM sleep in birds and mammals, it might be analogous to this state. However, S2 displays a type of oscillation never previously reported and does not display a desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) as is observed in the bearded dragons, mammals, and birds. This suggests that the phenotype of sleep states and possibly their role can differ even between closely related species. Finally, our results suggest a common origin of two sleep states in amniotes. Yet, they also highlight a diversity of sleep phenotypes across lizards, demonstrating that the evolution of sleep states is more complex than previously thought.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Until recently, the general understanding about sleep was that only mammals and birds show two sleep states: slow-wave sleep and rapid eye movement (REM) sleep. Consequently, it was thought that these two states appeared independently in these warm-blooded animals. However, a recent paper reported the presence of these two states in the bearded dragon lizard (<italic>Pogona vitticeps</italic>), suggesting that these two states arose with the common ancestor of mammals, birds, and reptiles. We confirmed the presence of two sleep states in the bearded dragon and compared its sleep with that of another lizard, the Argentine tegu (<italic>Salvator merianae</italic>). Our results show that both lizard species have two sleep states with similarities to the two sleep states observed in mammals and birds. Additionally, our study of behavioral and physiological parameters as well as the brain activity associated with sleep in these lizards allowed us to also show important differences between these two species of lizards and between lizards, birds, and mammals. Our findings indicate that sleep in lizards is more complex than previously thought and raise further questions about the nature, function, and evolution of these two sleep states.</p>

<title>Behavioral sleep</title>
<p>Based on the 1913 behavioral definition [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref001">1</xref>], sleep is characterized by sustained immobility, a species-specific sleep posture and location, and a high arousal threshold. In addition, it displays a circadian distribution and is homeostatically regulated. Based on these criteria, it has been shown that sleep occurs in all animals, from the simplest organisms to the most complex ones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref002">2</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref005">5</xref>]. Such ubiquity of sleep indicates that it constitutes a fundamental need for all living organisms.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec003">
<title>Two sleep states in mammals and birds</title>
<p>In the 50s, two distinct sleep states were described in humans and cats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref007">7</xref>]. The first sleep state is slow-wave sleep (SWS), also known as non-rapid eye movement (REM) sleep or quiet sleep. This state is characterized in mammals by the occurrence of cortical high-amplitude slow delta waves (0.5–4 Hz) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref008">8</xref>], hippocampal sharp-wave ripple (hSWP-R) complexes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref010">10</xref>], and spindle oscillations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref012">12</xref>]. During SWS, physiological processes are reduced, including heart rate, body temperature, eye movements, and muscle tone. In sharp contrast, the active sleep state named REM or paradoxical sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref007">7</xref>]—commonly associated with dreaming in humans—is characterized by REM and cortical desynchronization like the awake state, but without muscle tone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref007">7</xref>]. REM sleep and SWS are also characterized by a high arousal threshold. During REM sleep, in contrast to SWS, thermoregulation processes including shivering, piloerection, and sweating are abolished [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref013">13</xref>], brain temperature increases, and the heart and breathing rates become irregular [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref014">14</xref>]. Finally, toe, tail, limb, and whisker movements occur phasically (muscle twitches) during REM sleep [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref015">15</xref>]. SWS and REM sleep have been unequivocally identified to date only in terrestrial mammals and birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref004">4</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Since these species are homeotherms, it has often been proposed that the two sleep states evolved together with homeothermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the poikilothermic nonavian reptiles, including lizards and snakes, turtles, and crocodiles share a common ancestor with mammals and birds. Squamates (lizards and snakes) are the group that shares the most ancestral features with the common ancestor of birds and nonavian reptiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Therefore, to retrace the evolution of the two sleep states, studying species in this group is essential.</p>

<title>The tegu lizard does not sleep like a bearded dragon.</title>
<p>(A) Phylogenetic tree of amniotes representing the common origin of mammals, birds, and nonavian reptiles. The figure also illustrates that both REM sleep and SWS have been identified in mammals and birds and more recently possibly also in a lizard, the bearded dragon (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>vitticeps</italic>). We investigated sleep in the Argentine tegu (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic>) to determine whether the bearded dragon is the only lizard to display those two sleep states. (B) Pictures of the two species recorded. The animals were equipped with a recording device on their head. (C) Raw signal of one LFP recorded in the DVR with a 35-μm–diameter tungsten electrode in the two species during S1 (sharing similarities with mammalian SWS) in bluish, S2 (sharing similarities with mammalian REM sleep) in red, QW in light blue, and AW in dark blue. The raw data illustrate the difference in all states of the DVR LFP. (D) Dendrogram (left) and correlation map (right) obtained from the hierarchical clustering of the distance between the correlation of each LFP 3-s window PSD between 9 PM and 2 AM in both species. On the right of each correlation map are the normalized mean power spectra of the two clusters computed for one animal in each species representing the two distinct sleep states identified, S1 in bluish and S2 in red. The comparison of the normalized power spectra of each state reveals a frequency profile that is clearly different between the two species, with a desynchronized activity (composed of all the frequencies higher than 5 Hz) for the bearded dragon during S2 and a power spectrum mainly composed of 15-Hz oscillations for the tegu. (E) The band power ratio (δ [0.5–4 Hz]/β [11–30 Hz]) computed as in Shein-Idelson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref022">22</xref>] for the bearded dragon. Each horizontal segment represents 30 min of the ratio computed with a 10-s window and a step of 0.1 s. The value of the ratio is color coded from 0 (blue) to 27 (yellow). The figure from the top to the bottom represents the evolution of the ratio over 24 h from 6 PM. A dark rectangle indicates the dark period. On the right, the normalized autocorrelation map of the ratio is illustrated. The autocorrelation was computed within 600-s windows with a step of 1 s. Both figures reveal a rhythmic alternance with a period of around 90 s across episodes, with δ frequencies (yellow) and episodes with β (blue) during the dark period, when the animal is lying on the floor with the eyes closed. (F) The distribution of the eye movements within each δ–β cycle; the mean phase is represented with a black arrow. The red line is the mean δ/β power ratio across the δ–β cycle. (G) This is the same figure as (E) for the Argentine tegu. The figure reveals no clear cycle in the δ/β power ratio over 24 h. AW, active wake; DVR, dorsoventricular ridge; LFP, local field potential; PSD, power spectrum density; QW, quiet wake; REM, rapid eye movement; SWS, slow-wave sleep; S1, sleep state 1; S2, sleep state 2.</p>

<title>Sleep in squamates (lizards and snakes)</title>
<p>Despite its importance in understanding the evolutionary origins of these sleep states, less than 40 studies, mostly from the 70s, have been devoted to the study of sleep in nonavian reptiles [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref018">18</xref>]. Of them, 16 were dedicated to squamates, with only seven articles including more than three recorded animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref025">25</xref>]. In addition, these studies were performed in only six species, all belonging to the infraorder Iguania. They revealed that this lizard family displays behavioral sleep during the night, including a specific posture and, when examined, a high arousal threshold and a homeostatic response to sleep deprivation. The sleep period was often described as one large bout during the night. During the day, periods of activity intersected long phases of quiet wake (QW). Sleep was also reported to be associated with a decrease of the heart and respiratory rates. Regarding the presence of one or multiple sleep states in lizards, the existence of a REM-like sleep state was already suggested in 1966 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref019">19</xref>], mainly based on the presence of eye movements during sleep periods. However, these older studies failed to convince, and no consensus was obtained because of limitations in methodology, recording conditions, and the absence of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref018">18</xref>]. However, in 2016, Shein-Idelson and colleagues provided convincing evidence for the existence of two electrophysiological sleep states [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref022">22</xref>] in a species never previously recorded for this purpose, the bearded dragon (<italic>Pogona vitticeps</italic>). The authors observed—specifically during the night, when the animal was lying on the floor of the cage with its eyes closed—a very regular alternation of periods characterized by the occurrence of “slow waves” and periods characterized by local field potential (LFP) desynchronization, similar to those observed during the awake state and associated with isolated eye movements. The authors concluded that both SWS and REM sleep exist in this species with a very rhythmic periodicity. However, such a periodicity, as regular as clockwork, is quite surprising and had never been reported before in either other nonavian reptiles or in mammals and birds. Moreover, muscle tone, motor automatism, heart rate, and arousal threshold evaluation were missing to unequivocally demonstrate that the state identified as REM sleep did not correspond to short periods of awakening also known to be characterized by desynchronized electroencephalogram (EEG) and eye movements.</p>
<p>Therefore, we decided to replicate the experiments of Shein-Idelson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref022">22</xref>] and to compare these data with data for another species of lizard from a different family to test the generality of these findings. We replicated data on one bearded dragon (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>vitticeps</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and developed a multiparametric approach to examine sleep in the Argentine tegu lizard, <italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). We chose this species as it belongs to the Lacertoidea family, for which sleep has never been recorded with the exception of three studies focusing on circadian rhythms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref028">28</xref>]. Furthermore, this predatory species displays an active foraging life style, an omnivorous diet, and high cognitive abilities, with one of the highest encephalization quotients across squamates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref029">29</xref>]. Consequently, it may have larger quantities of sleep and more specifically REM sleep than other lizards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref030">30</xref>]. Six subadult Argentine tegus (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic>) were studied. We recorded LFPs by means of 35-μm–diameter tungsten electrodes implanted at different depths in four forebrain regions. We simultaneously recorded the nuchal electromyogram (EMG), the electro-oculogram (EOG), and the electrocardiogram (ECG) using a wireless system. All the animals were video monitored for 24 h a day with four near-infrared cameras. As brain LFP amplitudes and frequencies covary with temperature [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref031">31</xref>], we performed all the experiments at a constant temperature. Therefore, baseline conditions, the arousal threshold, and the effect of 9 h of sleep deprivation by means of gentle handling were recorded at 28 °C (body temperature). Finally, systemic injections of fluoxetine—a serotonin reuptake inhibitor known to suppress REM sleep in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref033">33</xref>]—were performed at two different concentrations.</p>

<title>Replication of the bearded dragon sleep experiments</title>
<p>The signals obtained from tungsten electrodes implanted in the dorsoventricular ridge (DVR) of a bearded dragon—a forebrain structure proposed to be homologous to the mammalian isocortex, the amygdala, and/or the claustral complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref037">37</xref>]—revealed different patterns across vigilance states (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). During the dark period, the bearded dragon displays a stereotypical posture, with the head lying on the floor in a specific location of the terrarium. This posture was never seen during the light period, as the animal always had its head up from the floor. During this period, two electrophysiological phases with distinct frequency content coexisted (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>). The first electrophysiological sleep state, rich in δ (0.5–4 Hz) frequencies, was characterized by a signal containing one to two slow negative high-amplitude sharp waves (HShWs) per second, lasting around 100–200 ms with an amplitude of 500 mV. The second electrophysiological sleep state contained frequencies in the β (11–30 Hz) band, an oscillatory pattern that looked like the awake one (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The δ/β power ratio and the autocorrelation of the signal revealed a very regular alternance between periods with δ and periods with β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). The periodicity of these cycles was around 90 s. Finally, the extraction of the occurrences of the eye movements from the EOG showed that the second electrophysiological sleep state contained more ocular movements than the first one. Eye movements were mainly isolated and appeared mostly at the beginning of S2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Our results obtained for one animal confirm the results reported by Shein-Idelson and colleagues. However, the same recordings and analysis performed on the Argentine tegu revealed different electrophysiological patterns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Indeed, even if two electrophysiological sleep states could be detected during the night resting phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), S1 did not contain slow negative HShWs as observed in the bearded dragon, and S2 differed from the awake activity, as an oscillation around 15 Hz dominates this phase. Finally, the autocorrelation analysis suggested no periodicity of the δ/β power ratio (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). As the same protocol was performed on these two lizard species, and as it revealed such different results, we decided to characterize sleep in greater detail in the Argentine tegu and developed a multiparameter approach as described below.</p>

<title>Behavioral sleep in the tegu is characterized by a decrease in the number of eye movements and a higher arousal threshold</title>
<p>During the light period, the tegus remained outside of their shelter and displayed short periods of active behavior, with head movements, locomotion, drinking, and feeding intersected by periods of immobility (quiet wake, QW) where animals were lying on the floor, eyes closed, head down with the four limbs spread apart. We observed that all animals entered their shelter 1 h (19 h 11 ± 27 min) before the onset of darkness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Next, they curled up and kept their eyes closed and stayed in their shelter until 2 h after light onset (10 h 10 ± 23 min). During this phase, repositioning and movements of the head, limbs, toes, or whole body rarely occurred, and the eyes remained mostly closed. We also observed rare tongue flicking with the head slightly up and the eyes closed.</p>

<p>To objectively demonstrate that the animals were sleeping, we then measured for each hour the percentage of stimulations that induces an arousal and the associated number of eye movements and the heart rate. Between 6 PM and 10 AM, the percentage of time spent in the shelter was significantly higher than between 10 AM and 6 PM, while the number of stimuli that induced an awakening was significantly lower (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.01). In addition, the number of eye movements and the heart rate tended to decrease during the night (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0556) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g002">Fig 2A, 2C and 2D</xref>). In line with the behavioral definition of sleep, these results strongly suggest that the animals are awake between 10 AM and 6 PM and are sleeping between 6 PM and 10 AM. We then developed a custom script based on the number of eye movements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g002">Fig 2F</xref>) and the muscle activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s001">S1 Fig</xref>) to automatically score sleep behavior (SB), QW, and active wake (AW) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). We compared the periods of time spent in the shelter with SB periods scored with our algorithm and obtained 87% of correct assignments, a sensitivity of 0.91, and a specificity of 0.87 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s005">S1 Table</xref>). Using such automatic scoring, we measured the percentage of time spent in each state over 24 h: 6.4 ± 1% (AW), 29 ± 2% (QW), and 64.6 ± 2% (SB), with a mean bout duration of 0.5 ± 0.1 min (AW), 2.6 ± 0.2 min (QW), and 18.3 ± 1.6 min (SB).</p>

<title>Multisite LFP recordings reveal the occurrence of slower frequencies during active wake compared to quiet wake and behavioral sleep</title>
<p>Baseline recordings of LFPs were made during 24 h at 28°C in the DVR, the rostral medial cortex (rMC) and caudal medial cortex (cMC)—homologous to the mammalian hippocampus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref038">38</xref>]—and the nucleus sphericus (NS), a vomeronasal region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref039">39</xref>] caudal to the DVR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g003">Fig 3D and 3C</xref>).

<p>During AW, a significantly higher muscle tone (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), a higher number of eye movements (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001), and a higher heart rate (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.001) were recorded compared to QW and SB (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s006">S1 Video</xref>).

<title>Behavioral sleep in the tegu is composed of two states differentiated by sharp waves, 15-Hz oscillations, and eye movements</title>
<p>In agreement with the power spectrum analysis, we observed on the raw signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">Fig 4A</xref>) as well as on the time/frequency representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s007">S2 Video</xref>) the phasic occurrence during SB of oscillations at a frequency of 15 Hz. We first selected for each animal the electrode showing the highest power of this 15-Hz frequency during SB using an unsupervised method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s003">S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s004">S4</xref> Figs). We then performed a hierarchical clustering of the SB signals based on the correlations between each 3-s–window power spectrum for each animal. This revealed the existence of two clusters of sleep (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These two clusters define two electrophysiologically distinct sleep periods: S1 periods not showing any predominant oscillation and S2 periods characterized by the presence of an oscillation around 15 Hz (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Based on the mean power spectra of S1 and S2 computed for each animal, we extracted a power ratio (S2 detection ratio; S2R) to automatically detect the periods with 15-Hz oscillations (S2R = [10–22 Hz]/[(4–10 Hz) + (22–28 Hz)]) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">Fig 4E</xref>). Periods displaying 15-Hz oscillations mostly occurred during sleep (83.4 ± 2%), although some were observed during QW (16.4 ± 2%). They were nearly absent during AW (0.09 ± 0.05%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). The oscillations had a peak frequency of 15.3 ± 0.03 Hz and lasted on average 4.3 ± 0.1 s (but some episodes lasted 1 to 32 ± 2.3 s). They occurred 4.6 ± 0.1 times per min (2,229.6 ± 260 bouts over 24 h) without a regular periodicity, with an average individual variability of 3.4 oscillations per min ranging between 0.02 and 16. SB periods with these oscillations (S2) constituted 17.2 ± 2.3% of the total sleep time. No change in the power and the frequency of the oscillations was detected across the night. S2 periods occur preferentially at the beginning (18.9 ± 0.9%) and at the end (18.4 ± 2.4%) rather than in the middle (13 ± 1.7%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0139 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0287, respectively) of the night (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">Fig 4G and 4H</xref>).

The lines below show an enlargement of the areas indicated by a square. The next lines show the corresponding muscle activity (EMG), heart rate (ECG), and EOG. The vertical scale bars represent 100 μV. (B) Time frequency representation of 24 h of recording of a whitened LFP DVR split into four 6-h periods starting at 2 PM (in blue the low power, in red the high power). The color bar above each time frequency illustrates the hypnogram obtained with automated scoring (blue for AW, orange for QW, and green for SB). The phasic occurrence, mainly during SB, of periods with oscillations around 15 Hz is clearly visible. In addition, the increase in low frequencies is clearly visible during AW. (C) Dendrogram (left) and correlation map (right) obtained from the hierarchical clustering of the distance between the correlation of an LFP 3-s–window power spectrum between 9 PM and 2 AM. (D) Mean power spectra of the two clusters computed for each animal, representing the two distinct sleep states identified, S1 in bluish and S2 in red. The black crosses are the frequency peaks of the mean power spectrum during S2, and the black circles the crossing between the power spectra of S1 and S2. The mean of these values is used to extract the S2 detection ratio, S2R = [10–22 Hz]/([4–10 Hz] + [22–28 Hz]). (E) Computation of the ratio S2R defined in (D) over 24 h in one animal. The red line is the threshold (the mean + 1 standard deviation of S2R) used to detect S2 state. (F) Percentage of S2 periods automatically detected during the three vigilance states, showing that S2 occurs mostly during SB (<italic>n</italic> = 5; SB versus QW, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0201; SB versus AW, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0002; AW versus QW, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0099).

In red, mean percentage of S2 ± SEM across animals per hour during 24 h, showing that S2 periods tend to be more numerous at the beginning and at the end of the night than in the middle of it. (H) Histograms per 3 h showing that S2 periods occur significantly more at the beginning and at the end of the sleep time (from left to right, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0139, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0287, <italic>n</italic> = 5). (I) Histograms showing from top to bottom a significant decrease of the heart rate variability (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0079, <italic>n</italic> = 5); an increase in the number of eye movements (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0079, <italic>n</italic> = 5); and a small decrease in muscle tone computed as the norm of the Hilbert transform (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0079, <italic>n</italic> = 5) between S2 (red) and S1 (bluish) for each episode lasting more than two seconds. The heart rate variability and the muscle tone are represented relative to the mean muscle tone between S1 and S2 for each animal. The gray lines show individual values.

<title>Sleep deprivation and an antidepressant suppressed HShWs and 15-Hz oscillations</title>
<p>To determine whether sleep homeostasis is present in lizards, 9 h gentle-handling sleep deprivation was performed between 7 PM and 4 AM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

<p>We then tested the effect of fluoxetine on the occurrence of the 15-Hz–oscillation periods defined as S2 and HShWs to determine whether they showed similarities with mammalian REM sleep and hippocampal sharp waves, respectively. Indeed, it has been shown that both REM sleep in mammals and birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref041">41</xref>] and in vitro hippocampal sharp waves are inhibited by serotonin reuptake inhibitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref042">42</xref>].

Control injection of saline did not induce any effect on the total percentage of SB, the number of SB episodes, or their duration compared to baseline (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). The lower concentration of fluoxetine did not affect the total amount of AW, QW, and S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.05). Nevertheless, SB episodes (S1 + S2) were interrupted by short awakenings compared to baseline, inducing a significant decrease of their mean duration (10 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0366 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0255, respectively) and a significant increase in the number of SB episodes (10 mg/kg and 60 mg/kg, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0106 and <italic>p</italic> = 0.0325, respectively). Regarding the specific effect on the 15-Hz oscillations, their quantities were not significantly decreased with 10 mg/kg of fluoxetine in contrast to 60 mg/kg, strongly suggesting that the state of S2 is dramatically reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>) (<italic>p</italic> = 0.0096).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In the present paper, we confirm the findings of Shein-Idelson and colleagues on the bearded dragon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref022">22</xref>]. Moreover, by coupling multisite LFPs, videos, and physiological recordings both under baseline condition and during and after sleep deprivation and fluoxetine injections, we were able to demonstrate the existence of two sleep states in the Argentine tegu. Further, we provide evidence of similarities between these two states in the tegu and mammalian and avian SWS and REM sleep. However, the phenotype of these two states in the tegu differs strongly to that observed in mammals, birds, and more surprisingly, the bearded dragon.</p>

<title>Sleep in the bearded dragon</title>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Behavioral sleep</title>
<p>Based on their posture and specific location, previous studies concluded that squamates display behavioral signs of sleep during the night. Yet, only four of these studies measured the arousal threshold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref024">24</xref>], and only two used sleep deprivation experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref024">24</xref>]. Even if arousal threshold and sleep deprivation were missing for the bearded dragon, the animal displayed a stereotypical posture with the head on the floor, the eyes closed, in a specific location of the terrarium. Thus, we suggest that in accordance with Shein-Idelson and colleagues, the animal was sleeping during this period.</p>

<title>Electrophysiological sleep</title>
<p>In this replication experiment, we confirmed that the bearded dragon displays two electrophysiological patterns corresponding to two sleep states. The first one, rich in δ frequencies, explained by the presence of slow HShWs, was proposed to be a homolog of the mammalian SWS. Indeed, this state is characterized by cortical delta waves and hippocampal sharp waves in mammals. However, whether those slow HShWs are similar to delta or sharp waves or those waves reflect a brain mechanism specific to the bearded dragon remains unknown. Complementary experiments, including cognitive tests and extracellular as well as intracellular recordings, should be conducted. Moreover, describing the memory network of nonavian reptiles—and specifically the implication of the DVR—is necessary to understand the role of these waves and to test whether they have the same cognitive role as in mammals. Regarding S2 as described by Shein-Idelson and colleagues, the DVR LFP looks like the awake state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1C</xref>), and isolated eye movements are more present during this phase. Based on these two features and the alternation with the SWS-like state, Shein-Idelson and colleagues proposed that this state is homologous to mammalian and avian REM sleep. If the animal is indeed sleeping, then this would be the most parsimonious hypothesis. However, eye movements and a desynchronized brain activity are also present during QW. An arousal threshold evaluation should be conducted to differentiate this putative REM-like sleep state from QW in this species. Nevertheless, the study by Shein-Idelson and colleagues provides credit to the hypothesis of the existence of an REM-like sleep state in squamates. The alternation between the two sleep states reported for the bearded dragon is also observed in mammals. However, a periodicity with a regularity like the one observed in the bearded dragon was never reported in either mammals or birds, which raises questions about its nature. Moreover, recent reports of artificial cyclical states with the same periodicity under urethane [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref045">45</xref>] or infra-slow–brain oscillations in the sigma band during mammalian SWS suggest that other ultradian cycles could exist in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref046">46</xref>] and possibly also squamates. Nevertheless, none of these cycles is associated with an increase in eye movements. Our replication confirms that the bearded dragon has two sleep states alternating with surprising regularity. However, at this point, we cannot draw conclusions about the nature and the homology of these states, and other species should be investigated to test the generality of these results.</p>

<title>Sleep in the Argentine tegu</title>
<sec id="sec017">
<title>Behavioral sleep</title>
<p>Thanks to the evaluation of the behavioral criteria of sleep, we show for the first time that the Argentine tegu, the only species of the Lacertoidea studied so far, also displays behavioral sleep at night. As the animal spent (in these conditions) more than 90% of its time with its eyes closed and lying on the floor, it is difficult to differentiate SB from QW based on these features. We demonstrate here that SB differs from QW by a higher arousal threshold, a decrease in the number of eye movements, and a lower heart rate in addition to the specific location and posture typically observed. We also observed eye movements and occasionally small movements of the toes and the head. More often, large movements or repositioning of the animal during SB was also observed in the tegu, as reported for other lizards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref018">18</xref>]. This would suggest that a state similar to REM sleep could be present in lizards. However, the nature of REM sleep could not be strictly identified from eye and other movements, as arousal also shows these features [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref047">47</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec018">
<title>Does S1 sleep correspond to SWS?</title>
<p>Using our unsupervised, integrative, and multiparameter approach, we were able to distinguish two sleep states in the tegu during SB. S1 was characterized electrophysiologically by the absence of 15-Hz oscillations during behavioral sleep. In addition, numerous isolated HShWs occur at a rate of 1 per min in all structures recorded. The presence in the EEG of isolated sharp waves specifically during sleep has been already reported in other lizards [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref025">25</xref>]. Isolated sharp waves have also been recorded during sleep in turtles and crocodiles (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref018">18</xref>]). Because of their morphology and their presence during sleep, it has been suggested that those waves could be similar to the mammalian hSWP-Rs (duration between 40–100 ms, amplitude that can exceed 2.5 mV, and a variable occurrence of 1 to 60 per min [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref010">10</xref>]). hSWP-Rs are generated by a burst of activity in cornu ammonis area 3 (CA3), inducing a large depolarization in cornu ammonis area 1 (CA1) stratum radiatum associated with a fast oscillation in the CA1 pyramidal layer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref010">10</xref>]. Their role in the mammalian memory consolidation processes is well described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref010">10</xref>]. Therefore, their existence in a reptilian brain during sleep would have important consequences regarding the function of sleep in these animals. However, the shape of the HShWs is also consistent with cortical slow waves. In the tegu, as well as in the bearded dragon, HShWs were reported during SB, just like hippocampal sharp waves and cortical slow waves in mammals. Regarding their morphology, the tegu and turtle HShWs show a similar duration: shorter than 50 ms, with an amplitude between 0.2 and 1 mV and an occurrence of 1 per min, similar to the mammalian hippocampal sharp waves. Interestingly, in contrast to the data reported in other lizards and nonavian reptiles, the bearded dragon showed slow HShWs occurring at a high rate of 60–120 per min (0.5–1 Hz) with a half width of 100–400 ms, morphologically rather similar to mammalian slow waves. Moreover, the localization of the tegu HShWs also questions their true nature. Indeed, mammalian hippocampal sharp waves are recorded in the mammalian hippocampus, subiculum, and entorhinal cortex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref010">10</xref>] and were not reported in birds (for review, see [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref048">48</xref>]). In contrast, slow waves have been recorded in most cortical regions in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref050">50</xref>] and birds, as well as in the avian DVR during anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref051">51</xref>]. As HShWs were observed in all recorded regions in the tegu forebrain, this could suggest that reptilian HShWs could be a precursor form of avian and mammalian slow waves. This hypothesis is also supported by a recent report of HShWs in the crocodilian DVR under anesthesia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref052">52</xref>]. In reptiles, pharmacological experiments have also been conducted. In the 70s, injections of atropine sulfate, amphetamine, nembutal, alpha-methyl-tyrosine, and parachlorophenylalanine, drugs known to modify the quantity of ventral hippocampal sharp waves in the cat, were shown to induce the same effects on turtle sharp waves (<italic>Geochelone carbonaria</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref054">54</xref>]. This let the authors suggest that reptilian HShWs could be similar to mammalian sharp waves. However, some of the drugs that suppress mammalian hippocampal sharp waves also suppress cortical slow waves. In the Argentine tegu, we demonstrated that the HShWs tend to disappear after fluoxetine injection. However, in mammals, little is known of the effect of serotonin on hippocampal ShWs. To our knowledge, only one paper reported that serotonin blocks, in vitro, rodent hippocampal sharp waves [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>As a conclusion, since the precise mechanism of the generation of HShWs has not been identified, their definition relies on a rather vague description based on their shape, state of occurrence, occurrence rate, and pharmacological responsiveness. Unfortunately, these properties do not allow us to differentiate between hSWP-Rs and slow waves or another type of wave specific to lizards. However, as both hippocampal sharp waves and cortical slow waves are present during SWS in mammals, this would suggest that S1 in the tegu is likely homologous to mammalian and avian SWS. Moreover, after fluoxetine injection, the HShWs disappear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g007">Fig 7</xref>), but the automated sleep-scoring algorithm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g007">Fig 7A and 7B</xref>) suggests that the animal is able to sleep without these waves. This is further suggested by the typical sleep posture taken up by the animal inside its shelter. This suggests that the HShWs are only one feature of the complex phenotype of sleep in reptiles. Moreover, these waves by themselves are not sufficient to characterize this sleep state in reptiles.</p>

<sec id="sec019">
<title>Does S2 sleep correspond to REM sleep?</title>
<p>Based on the presence of active periods during sleep, the existence of REM sleep has been suggested in six of the seven previous studies on lizards. They mostly observed limb and eye movements associated with an EEG with an awake-like activity. In the tegu, we reported a state (S2) that shares partial similarities with mammalian and avian REM sleep. It is electrophysiologically characterized by the presence of oscillations with a 15-Hz frequency present in nearly all structures recorded during SB. To our knowledge, such a type of oscillation has never been reported before during sleep in any lizard species. We demonstrated that S2 episodes preferentially appear at the beginning and at the end of the sleep period and lasted 4.3 s on average. The 2,229.6 ± 261 episodes constituted 17.2 ± 2.3% of the total sleep time. Because some S2 episodes lasted more than 20 s, it is unlikely that the oscillations correspond to sleep spindles, an oscillation appearing during SWS in mammals in the same range of frequencies (between 10 and 18 Hz) and lasting between 0.4 and 1 s [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref012">12</xref>]. In addition, we observed that a higher density of eye movements and a decrease in muscle tone occurred during S2 compared to S1. We also showed that the 15-Hz oscillations, but not SB, were suppressed after the injection of fluoxetine, a specific serotonin reuptake inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g007">Fig 7</xref>). This suggests that S2 was suppressed after 60 mg/kg of fluoxetine injection, although we cannot exclude that the drugs may have suppressed the oscillations but not the state. Contrary to such a hypothesis, we were not able to identify periods after fluoxetine injection displaying an increase of eye movements and a decrease of muscle tone as seen during S2. In addition, no significant changes were observed when comparing the muscle tone and the eye movement density during SB (S1 + S2) in the different conditions (EOG density during baseline versus saline versus fluoxetine 60 mg/kg, <italic>p</italic> = 0.6115; muscle tone, <italic>p</italic> = 0.416). Yet, even if the serotonin distribution in the brainstem is similar in lizards compared to mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref055">55</xref>], and despite the fact that some studies on lizards have suggested a similar effect of fluoxetine on aggression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref056">56</xref>], it remains unknown whether the S2 state shares the same neuronal substrate with mammalian REM sleep. Importantly, the duration and regular occurrence of REM sleep reported in the bearded dragon does not match that seen for S2 in the tegu nor that previously reported in birds and mammals. Indeed, in the tegu, the duration and temporal distribution of S2 are quite similar to that seen for REM sleep in most birds, which display a short mean duration of episodes of 5 to 10 s and a percentage of around 10% of total sleep time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref057">57</xref>]. Another important feature of bird and mammalian REM sleep is the presence of ocular saccades. As reported here in the tegu from EOG recordings and in the bearded dragon based on unilateral video monitoring, more eye movements also occur specifically during the postulated REM sleep episodes. However, in both cases, the eye movements were isolated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref022">22</xref>] and often unilateral in the tegu, in contrast to the REMs recorded in mammals that occur in bursts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref058">58</xref>], illustrating that the phenotype of S2 is different from that of REM sleep in mammals and birds.</p>
<p>Altogether, our results for the tegu and those obtained for the bearded dragon suggest that two different sleep states with partial similarities to REM sleep and SWS exist in two different species of lizard, even if an arousal threshold evaluation would be necessary in both species to clearly differentiate S2 from QW. Yet, the short duration of the REM-like sleep state in the tegu renders this extremely difficult from a practical point of view. However, these two states display very different temporal distribution and type of oscillations in the two species. It therefore raises the question whether one or the other is the exception among lizards. The recording of additional lizard species is required to answer this question. Further, additional experiments are necessary to determine whether the structures generating REM-like sleep episodes in the bearded dragon and the tegu are the same as those generating REM sleep in birds and mammals. Moreover, the constant temperature used does not reflect the natural temperature fluctuations experienced by these animals and therefore constitutes a limitation of this study. Finally, we observed rare small and isolated twitches or motor automatisms in the tegu during the night but without a strict association with the S2 state. It might be that these muscle twitches occur during short periods of awakening or that in tegu, twitches are not associated to a specific sleep state. Another possibility is that they occur specifically during S2 only in young animals, as it has been shown that they are more numerous during this stage in mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref060">60</xref>]. In agreement with this hypothesis, more muscle twitches have been observed in juvenile lizards and even in ovo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref061">61</xref>]. To summarize, the two species of lizards recorded displayed two sleep states sharing some similarity with mammalian and avian REM sleep and SWS but diverged notably regarding the presence of twitches, the speed and number of the eye movements, and the absence of a wake-like EEG for the tegu compared to mammalian REM sleep.</p>

<title>Implications for the origin of the sleep states</title>
<p>Our results demonstrate the existence of two different sleep states in the tegu and the bearded dragon, sharing features with mammalian and bird REM sleep and SWS. The existence of an REM-like sleep state in a lizard suggests that homeothermic animals are not the only ones to show two sleep states. However, even if some nonavian reptiles display two sleep states, the ancestral or convergent origin of these states remains unclear. In fact, too few studies have been conducted in nonavian reptiles to fully conclude that a REM-like sleep state did not appear convergently. Moreover, around 75% of the studies on turtles and almost all of the studies on crocodiles (both groups being closely related to birds) did not report two sleep states. Whether the two sleep states originated at the base of the amniote tree or before also remains to be determined by means of new studies of sleep in other nonavian reptiles as well as amphibians and fish. Deciphering the origin of the two sleep states is complicated, and the further we move away from mammals and the classical definition of sleep, the more difficult it will be to identify homologies. More than providing additional evidence for a reptilian REM-like sleep state, our results reveal the true diversity in sleep phenotypes, a diversity that should be explored through integrated and complementary approaches without an underlying biased definition based on mammalian studies. Indeed, even in mammals and birds, experiments on basal species show that those states could be mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref063">63</xref>]. Maybe the question should not be whether nonavian reptiles show REM sleep and SWS, but how did these states appear and evolve along the different branches of the amniote tree.</p>

<title>Animals</title>
<p>We report data on one bearded dragon (<italic>P</italic>. <italic>vitticeps</italic>) and six Argentine tegus (<italic>S</italic>. <italic>merianae</italic>), five males and one female (#2), with an age of 2 y (± 0.5), 3 ± 0.7 kg. All tegus were bought from official breeders and were maintained individually in a 4-m-square area (2 m × 2 m). The bearded dragon was maintained and recorded in a smaller terrarium (90 cm length, 50 cm width, 40 cm height). The tegus were fed dead mice two to three times a week, and the bearded dragon was fed crickets and vegetables twice weekly. Water was provided ad libitum. Prior to experiments, animals were maintained under a 12 h:12 h light/dark cycle in a room maintained at 25 °C with a hot spot at 45 °C available between 11 AM and 6 PM. Six infrared (850 nm) panels (Viewpoint SA) were always on. A shelter transparent to infrared wavelengths was used to monitor the animals during the dark phase. All the experiments were conducted in a room at 25 °C after at least 2 days of habituation. A custom floor heating regulated at 30 °C was used for the tegu. The nuchal temperature was measured for one animal of each species thanks to a micro thermistor implanted in the nuchal muscles. The nuchal temperature measured in one animal was around 28 °C for the tegu and 25 °C for the bearded dragon.</p>

<title>Imaging and verification of the electrode position</title>
<p>Prior to the surgery, two 100-μm diameter holes were drilled under anesthesia (cf. surgery part) in the anterior and posterior part of the parietal bone. These holes served as references during electrode implantation. MRI imaging was carried out on a 3T GEHC MR750 System using an 8-channel wrist coil. The head of the lizard was placed at the center of the coil. After a three-plane localizer, two 3D high-spatial–resolution magnetic resonance imaging (HR-MRI) acquisition sequences were performed in the coronal plane. For both HR-MRI acquisitions, similar parameters were used: 59.2-mm slab thickness with 100 × 80 mm<sup>2</sup> field of view (FOV), 148 × 448 × 384 acquisition matrix size, and a 592 × 1,024 × 768 reconstruction matrix leading to a slice thickness of 100 μm with an in-plane pixel of 97 × 97 μm<sup>2</sup>. First, a T1-weighted FSGGR sequence with 30 ° flip angle, 29.4 ms TR, 10.1 ms TE, and ±7.8k Hz receiver bandwidth with 22’15” scan time was performed. Second, a FIESTA-C sequence with 70 ° flip angle, 10.8 ms TR, 3.6 ms TE, and ±41.7 kHz receiver bandwidth with 12’45” scan time was performed. A few days later, a CT scan was performed to image the skull. The experiments were done on an NVEON system (Siemens), with a tension of 80 kV, a current of 500 μA, and an exposure time of 900 ms with 720 steps. The reconstruction of the final volume permits us to obtain a voxel size of 55.62 μm<sup>3</sup> in the three dimensions. The two modalities (MRI and CT scan) were realigned by choosing at least 10 common landmarks and using a principal component analysis method for realignment (Avizo v7.0.1). Next, landmarks were put on the MRI slices at the targeted electrode positions. A custom script (Matlab r2016b; The MathWorks, Natick, MA, USA) was used to transform the targeted landmarks into the reference frame defined by the holes drilled on the skull. The coordinates obtained were those used for the surgery. This procedure was used for all animals of both species. One week after the surgery, a second CT scan was performed in order to check the electrode positions by realigning the last CT scan to the two presurgical images.</p>

<title>Perfusion</title>
<p>Under surgical anesthesia (cf. surgery) and after an electrocoagulation lesioning (2 s, 0.5 mA), animals were perfused transcardially [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref064">64</xref>] with a 400-ml Ringer-Lactate solution (Braun Medical, France) followed by a 2,000-ml 4% paraformaldehyde fixative solution, with a perfusion pump (Gilson, France) set at a 55 ml/min rate. Brains were removed and postfixed for 2 d at 4 °C in the same solution. Brains were included in paraffin (LEICA ASP300, Germany) and mounted (Myr EC 350–2, Spain), and 7-μm slices were cut with a microtome (Leica RM2245, Germany) for histochemical processing. One slice out of every seven was kept.</p>

<title>Nissl staining</title>
<p>The Nissl staining was done for the bearded dragon and tegus #2, #3, #4, #5, and #6. The paraffin was removed from each slice with two 4-min baths of methylcylohexane, then two 4-min baths of 100% alcohol, followed by a 4-min bath of water. The Nissl stain was performed by putting the slices successively into the following baths: 2 min water, 4 min Cresyl Violet acetate (1 g/L) (Sigma Aldrich, St. Louis, MO, USA), 1 min alcohol 75%, 30 s alcohol 95%, 15 min alcohol 15%, 5 s alcohol 100%, 5 s alcohol 100%, 2 min OTTIX (MM France, France). Then slices were digitalized (Zeiss Axioscan Z1, Germany) with a 5X Fluar (ON 0.25) lens.</p>

<sec id="sec027">
<title>Surgery</title>
<p>The animals were anesthetized with a mixture of ketamine (66 to 100 mg/kg) and medetomidine (100 to 200 μg/kg) at 19 °C injected intramuscularly and equally distributed in the four limbs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref065">65</xref>]. After every 6 h, reinjections of half the previous dose were performed. Reflexes and respiratory rate were checked throughout the surgery. During surgery, two stainless steel electrodes were inserted bilaterally in the intercostal muscles for measuring heart rate, and two others were also implanted in the neck muscles to assess muscle tone. For the tegus and the bearded dragon, two other electrodes, gold plated at the tip, were positioned behind each eye, under the eyelid, to record eye movements. The tegus were also implanted with three to four bundles of six 35-μm diameter tungsten electrodes in different brain regions (DVR, NS, rMC, and/or cMC). Only the DVR was implanted with this kind of bundle during the bearded dragon surgery. One screw was fixed on the skull between the two eyes for signal referencing for the tegu. The reference was inserted on the most caudal part of the parietal bone for the bearded dragon. To do so, lizards were placed in an adapted stereotactic frame. All wires were then connected to a head connector (EIB-36-PTB Neuralynx), which was secured over the skull using acrylic Superbond (Sun Medical Co.). Next, dental Paladur cement (Heraeus Kuzler) was applied around the head connector to protect all the wires and the connector.</p>

<sec id="sec028">
<title>Behavior</title>
<p>The behavior of the animal was monitored with four cameras (Dragonfly2 DR2-HIBW, PointGrey) equipped with a band-pass filter in the near-infrared wavelength. One camera was recording the full area, and the three others were dedicated to the animal shelter. The videos were recorded 24 h a day (VPCore2, Viewpoint), and the actimetry, which is the number of pixels changing more than 14 gray levels between two successive images, was evaluated online for each camera.</p>

<sec id="sec029">
<title>Arousal threshold</title>
<p>The arousal threshold was evaluated for the Argentine tegus. A microrotor was fixed over the head of the animal for at least 4 d. The microrotor was programmed with a custom device to rotate at the maximum power for 5 s every hour to avoid any habituation. When the rotor was activated, an LED light was on. Using the four videos, any signs of awakening (like an eye opening or a leg or head movement) after a stimulation was recorded, as well as the latency thereof. The percentage of awakening after stimulation was evaluated for each hour for each animal. The mean percentage was then calculated for five animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec030">
<title>In vivo electrophysiology</title>
<p>For the tegus, the electrophysiological signals from at least 22 tungsten electrodes into the brain—two ECG, two EMG, two EOG, and in some animals, a screw EEG—were recorded wirelessly (TBSI W32). A custom battery (3,000 mAh) for recording at least 4 d without changing the battery was used and fixed over the back of the animal with tape. The amplification of the system was 1,000×. The digitalization was performed using a DAQ card (National Instruments USB 6363) with a custom script (Matlab r2016b). The data were sampled first at 20 kHz, low-pass filtered at 500 Hz, and subsampled at 2 kHz online. The videos were synchronized with an output TTL to trig the start and the stop of each video. For the bearded dragon, the DVR LFP was recorded with eight tungsten electrodes at different depth (−4 to −2 mm below the skull, at 1.28 mm caudal to the anterior part of the pineal hole, and 1.94 mm lateral). Two EOGs were also recorded. The signals were recorded thanks to a custom wireless recording device at 128 Hz and to a custom Matlab script.</p>

<title>Sleep deprivation</title>
<p>The sleep deprivation was performed on the Argentine tegu by gentle handling without changing the light cycle from 7 PM to 4 AM. The shelter was removed from the area, and when the animal displayed a sign of sleep (mostly closing the eyes), the experimenter woke up the animal by pulling a rope attached to the animal’s tail. After deprivation, the animal was left for at least 24 h without any human intervention. The sleep deprivation was performed on four animals, and the recordings started during the baseline and ended at least 24 h after the recovery.</p>

<title>Pharmacology</title>
<p>Twelve ml of fluoxetine (10 and 60 mg/kg; Interchim, France) or saline (vehicle) solutions were randomly injected intraperitoneally at 4 PM in the tegus.

<title>Preprocessing, visualization, and “shelter scoring”</title>
<p>All the electrophysiological signals of the tegus were filtered with a zero phase-shift low-pass filter (cutoff frequency 100 Hz, order 2) and subsampled at 250 Hz before any other treatments. Next, the electrophysiological signals, the actimetry, and the video were imported into a custom software program (SlipAnalysis, developed under Matlab r2016b). An empty hypnogram was then created. The hypnogram was then manually filled per 5 s from the video with two states: animal inside the shelter or animal outside the shelter. All the analyses performed were also done with custom scripts (Matlab r2016b).</p>

<title>Automated vigilance states scoring</title>
<p>For the Argentine tegus, differential EOG calculated from the subtraction between the two EOGs was filtered with a low-pass filter (Fc 10 Hz, order 10). Then, the maximal value of the redressed signal was evaluated every second. Eye movement occurrence and duration were extracted by taking any part of the signal higher than 30 μV. Next, every epoch of the hypnogram during which the interval between eye movements was higher than 30 s was scored as SB. The other epochs were considered as QW. The episodes of SB spaced by less than 2 min were merged, and those lasting less than 2 min were removed. A differential EMG calculated from the subtraction between two EMGs was filtered with a high-pass filter (Fc 10 Hz, order 10) and the absolute value of the Hilbert transform was calculated. An average filter with a 0.5-s window was applied, and the mean value was evaluated for every 1 s bout. AW was scored when the processed EMG value was above 20 μV. Every episode lasting less than 5 s was ignored, and episodes spaced by less than 5 s were merged (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g002">Fig 2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). For the baseline experiments, the episodes scored as SB in the automated hypnograms were compared with the “shelter scoring” (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s005">S1 Table</xref>). A mean correct rate of 0.873 was obtained on the six animals, with a mean sensitivity of 0.911 and a mean specificity of 0.874.</p>

<sec id="sec035">
<title>Electrode selection</title>
<p>At least 22 electrodes were implanted in three to four regions in each tegu. In order to remove electrodes that were likely in the cerebral spinal fluid (CSF), we computed the mean power spectrum density (MPSD) into the 0.5–45 Hz band. For all animals, based on the imaging (MRI and postsurgery CT scan), we labeled the electrodes that were in the CSF and those in the brain. A threshold was obtained by computing the mean plus one standard deviation from all MPSD of the CSF electrodes. Every electrode with MPSD below the threshold was removed from the analyses and considered as being in the CSF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). In order to choose the best electrode to extract the S2 states, we computed the MPSD during the episodes scored as SB. An interpolated spectrum was computed by removing the 10–20 Hz band and keeping the value in the 5–10 Hz and 20–25 Hz bands (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2005982.s003">S3A–S3F Fig</xref>). A spline interpolation was used to evaluate this interpolated spectrum. By this means, one electrode was chosen per animal by taking the electrode with the maximal ratio between the interpolated and the real spectrum into the 10–20 Hz band. Animal two was removed from the S2 and HShW analysis because none of its electrodes had a ratio higher than 0.5%. As only the DVR was recorded, we choose the electrode with the highest amplitude for the bearded dragon.</p>

<sec id="sec036">
<title>Clustering and S2 extraction</title>
<p>We used the methodology of Shein-Idelson and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref022">22</xref>]. From the baseline experiments, between 9 PM and 2 AM, the signal of the chosen electrode was whitened with an autoregressive algorithm. A multitaper power spectrum between 0.5 and 30 Hz was computed for each 3-s epoch scored as SB (windows 3 s, bandwidth 1 Hz, 5 tapers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref066">66</xref>]). Each power spectrum was normalized by the mean power spectrum. A correlation matrix of these power spectra was calculated. Then, a hierarchical clustering with two clusters was realized based on a Euclidian distance of the correlation and using a Ward linkage (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">1D and 4C</xref>). A mean normalized power spectrum per animal was then calculated for each cluster (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">4D</xref>). For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1</xref>, we used the ratio used by Shein-Idelson and colleagues (δ/β, [0.5–4 Hz]/[11–30 Hz]). For our detailed analysis on tegus, we detected the peak of each power spectrum of the state of maximum power in the 10–20 Hz band and the crossing frequency between the two normalized power spectra in order to extract the band power ratio that maximizes the cluster detection. Based on the means of these values, we defined S2R, which is the mean power of the 10–22 Hz band divided by the sum of the 4–10 Hz and the 22–28 Hz bands (S2R = [10–22 Hz]/[(4–10 Hz) + (22–28 Hz)]). This ratio was calculated for the 24-h baseline of each animal on the chosen whitened electrode. A threshold was defined as the mean plus one standard deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g003">Fig 3E</xref>). Every part of the signal above that threshold was considered as S2. If the S2 episodes were separated by less than 2 s, they were merged, and the episodes lasting less than 2 s were removed. The autocorrelation of Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">1E, 1G</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">4C</xref> was computed as described in Shein-Idelson and colleagues.</p>

<title>Physiological measurements</title>
<p>The heart rate was extracted from the ECG electrode previously filtered with a high-pass filter (Fc 10 Hz, order 10). A peak detection was performed (threshold 100 μV, min interval between peak 0.7 s). The instantaneous heart rate was then computed by measuring the interval between peaks. The muscle tone was extracted from differential EMGs filtered with a high-pass filter (Fc 10 Hz, order 10). The muscle tone is the absolute value of the Hilbert transform of the signal was filtered with a mean filter (windows 0.5 s). The eye movement density was calculated from the EOG channels. The signal was filtered with a low-pass filter (Fc 10 Hz, order 10). Each part of the signal above 30 μV was considered as an eye movement. The density of eye movements corresponds to the number of eye movements occurring per min per state. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, representing the phase histogram of the eye movements of the bearded dragon, was obtained by detecting the δ and β periods. The δ/β ratio was evaluated. Each δ period was extracted when the ratio was higher than the average and β periods when the ratio was lower than the average. Each cycle of δ–β periods was normalized between 0 and 2 π radians. The distribution of the occurrence of the ocular movements was evaluated relatively to this cycle.</p>

<title>Sharp wave extraction</title>
<p>For the tegus, the HShW extraction was performed on all channels that were not considered as being in the CSF. The HShW detection algorithm was adapted from the spike-detection algorithm described by Quiroga and colleagues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2005982.ref040">40</xref>]. The HShWs were detected without any filter applied to the data. The threshold used was 10 times the signal-to-noise ratio, and 50 ms before and after the peak of the HShW was used for the waveform averaging. The channels kept for the analysis (baseline, sleep deprivation, and pharmacology) were the channels with the cleanest mean waveforms. The HShW density was evaluated by dividing the number of HShWs during a state by the duration of that state.</p>

<sec id="sec039">
<title>Statistics</title>
<p>All the statistics were performed using Matlab. Wilcoxon signed-rank tests were used for single comparisons between mean parameters per state (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g002">2B, 2C, 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">4I</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g006">6A, 6B, 6E, 6F and 6G</xref>). For multiple conditions with balanced designs, an analysis of variance with two factors (ANOVA2) was used followed by post hoc analysis using Fisher’s least significant difference procedure (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g004">4F, 4H</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g005">5D, 5E, 5F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2005982.g007">7A, 7B, 7D and 7F</xref>).

<title>Wake states.</title>
<p>The video shows 5 min of the behavior and biological signals during the wake period of animal #1. It shows QW (in orange) and AW states (in blue). From the top to the bottom: the color hypnogram, the EMG filtered with a high pass at 10 Hz, the ECG filtered with a high pass at 10 Hz, the EOG filtered with low pass at 10 Hz, and the raw trace of an LFP recorded from the cMC and below its time frequency representation. The scales are in μV and Hz. The color scale is between −120 and −90 dB. The video was accelerated four times, and the time between two vertical lines is 2 s. AW, active wake; cMC, caudal medial cortex; ECG, electrocardiogram; EMG, electromyogram; EOG, electro-oculogram; LFP, local field potential; QW, quiet wake.</p>
