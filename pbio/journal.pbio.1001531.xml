        <p>Plant organ growth is controlled by inter-cell-layer communication, which thus determines the overall size of the organism. The epidermal layer interfaces with the environment and participates in both driving and restricting growth via inter-cell-layer communication. However, it remains unknown whether the epidermis can send signals to internal tissue to limit cell proliferation in determinate growth. Very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) are synthesized in the epidermis and used in the formation of cuticular wax. Here we found that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis is essential for proper development of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Wild-type plants treated with a VLCFA synthesis inhibitor and <italic>pasticcino</italic> mutants with defects in VLCFA synthesis exhibited overproliferation of cells in the vasculature or in the rib zone of shoot apices. The decrease of VLCFA content increased the expression of <italic>IPT3</italic>, a key determinant of cytokinin biosynthesis in the vasculature, and, indeed, elevated cytokinin levels. These phenotypes were suppressed in <italic>ipt3;5;7</italic> triple mutants, and also by vasculature-specific expression of cytokinin oxidase, which degrades active forms of cytokinin. Our results imply that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis is required to suppress cytokinin biosynthesis in the vasculature, thus fine-tuning cell division activity in internal tissue, and therefore that shoot growth is controlled by the interaction between the surface (epidermis) and the axis (vasculature) of the plant body.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The epidermis functions as an important interface with the environment, but in plants it is also essential for establishing and maintaining the primary plant body. Recent studies have shown that the epidermis participates in both driving and restricting plant growth via inter-cell-layer communication. However, it remains an open question as to whether the epidermis can send signals to internal plant tissues to control cell proliferation during development. Here we report that the synthesis of very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) in the epidermis is essential for the proper control of cell proliferation in the plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. We find that defects in VLCFA synthesis cause cells in the vasculature or in the rib zone of shoot apices to overproliferate. When VLCFA levels decrease, we observe that the synthesis of the phytohormone cytokinin increases in the vasculature. We also find that when cytokinin is degraded by the expression of cytokinin oxidase in the vasculature, enhanced cell proliferation in internal tissues is suppressed, indicating that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis is required to suppress cytokinin biosynthesis and thus cell overproliferation. Our results demonstrate that shoot growth is controlled by interactions between the surface (epidermis) and the axis (vasculature) of the plant body, and highlight a role for VLCFAs in this interaction.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The epidermis is formed from the outermost L1 layer in the shoot apical meristem (SAM) and functions as an important interface with the environment. However, recent studies have shown that it also plays an essential role in the establishment and maintenance of the plant body. <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants with defects in epidermal cell specification exhibit disorganized morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Abe1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Tanaka2">[3]</xref>. Biophysical manipulation of the epidermis revealed that it generates mechanical constraints on inner layers, thus restricting plant growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Fleming1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Pien1">[5]</xref>. Another report showed that epidermis-specific expression of brassinosteroid receptor (BR) or brassinosteroid biosynthesis enzyme rescued plant growth in dwarf mutants, indicating that a BR-generated signal from the epidermis promotes the growth of ground tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-SavaldiGoldstein1">[6]</xref>. These results suggest that the epidermis participates in both driving and restricting growth via inter-cell-layer communication. However, it remains an open question as to whether the L1 layer can send signals to internal tissue to control cell proliferation during development.</p>
      <p>A characteristic feature of the epidermis is that it is covered with a hydrophobic barrier, the cuticle, which prevents plants from transpiring and protects tissues from pathogen attack <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Kunst1">[7]</xref>. The cuticle is mainly composed of cutin matrix and cuticular wax; cutin is a plant-specific lipid polymer that consists of long-chain fatty acids (LCFAs) with an acyl chain length of 16 or 18 carbons, whereas cuticular wax contains very-long-chain fatty acids (VLCFAs) with fully saturated unbranched hydrocarbon chains (≥20 carbons). Plant VLCFAs are synthesized in the endoplasmic reticulum by sequential addition of 2-carbon moieties to the 18-carbon LCFA, which is made in the plastid. The carbon donor malonyl-CoA is synthesized from acetyl-CoA by acetyl-CoA carboxylase and used for each cycle of the elongation reaction. VLCFA synthesis consists of four enzymatic steps: (1) condensation of acyl-CoA with malonyl-CoA catalyzed by ketoacyl-CoA synthase (KCS), (2) reduction of 3-ketoacyl-CoA by 3-ketoacyl-CoA reductase (KCR), (3) dehydration of 3-hydroxyacyl-CoA by 3-hydroxy acyl-CoA dehydratase (HCD), and (4) reduction of enoyl-CoA by enoyl-CoA reductase (ECR). VLCFAs are also components of seed storage triacylglycerols and sphingolipids; in yeast and mammalian cells, the latter function as signaling molecules controlling cell proliferation, stress response, and programmed cell death <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Worrall1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants with defects in VLCFA synthesis display cuticular deformation, leading to alteration of pathogen-plant interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-ReinaPinto1">[9]</xref>, post-embryonic organ fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Sieber1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Chen1">[11]</xref>, and retardation of plant growth with abnormal morphology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Panikashvili1">[12]</xref>. <italic>PASTICCINO2</italic> (<italic>PAS2</italic>) is the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> gene encoding HCD, one of the enzymes involved in VLCFA synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Bach1">[13]</xref>. A loss-of-function mutant of <italic>PAS2</italic> displays embryo lethality, and the leaky mutant <italic>pas2-1</italic>, which contains reduced amounts of VLCFAs, cuticular wax, and sphingolipids, exhibits severe morphological defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Bach1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Harrar1">[17]</xref>. However, cuticular deformation cannot explain all of these phenotypes; in particular, the cause of defective overall growth is not well understood. Here we show that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis is essential for plant growth, and that it suppresses cell proliferation by targeting cytokinin biosynthesis in the vasculature, thus fine-tuning cell division activity in determinate growth. Our results suggest that the epidermis sends non-autonomous signals to the vasculature and suppresses overproliferation.</p>

        <p><italic>pas2-1</italic> mutant seedlings exhibit various morphological defects to a variable extent in individual plants; for example, true leaves are fused (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Faure1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Bellec1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Harrar1">[17]</xref>, and hypocotyls are swollen and possess more cortical cell layers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g001">Figure 1B and 1C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Faure1">[14]</xref>. Previous reports also noted that mutant leaves sometimes produce a callus-like structure as a result of increased cell proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Faure1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Harrar1">[17]</xref>. We therefore observed the SAM, which gives rise to organs like leaves and flowers. We found that more cells accumulate in the rib zone (RZ)—a region below the self-renewing stem cell pool that contributes to the meristem pith—and that the vasculature was disorganized (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>

        <p>We monitored the expression pattern of <italic>PAS2</italic> using the <italic>ProPAS2:β-glucuronidase</italic> (<italic>GUS</italic>) reporter gene (a fusion of the ∼2.0-kb <italic>PAS2</italic> promoter and the <italic>GUS</italic> gene). GUS signal was detected in mature embryos, cotyledons and true leaves of seedlings, the inflorescence stem, and pistils and anthers of flowers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In tissue sections, <italic>GUS</italic> expression was observed only in the L1 layer of the SAM and in the epidermis of young leaves and the inflorescence stem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g002">Figure 2A–2C</xref>). In situ RNA hybridization also indicated L1-specific expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). To examine protein-level expression, we generated the <italic>ProPAS2:PAS2–GUS</italic> reporter gene (the same promoter and the full-length <italic>PAS2</italic> coding region fused in-frame to <italic>GUS</italic>); the functionality of the PAS2–GUS fusion protein was tested as described below. <italic>GUS</italic> expression was again detected in the L1 layer, and faint expression was noted in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g002">Figure 2E</xref>).</p>

        <p>To test whether <italic>PAS2</italic> expression in the epidermis is necessary and sufficient for normal plant development, we downregulated <italic>PAS2</italic> by RNAi using the <italic>ATML1</italic> promoter, which drives L1-specific expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Sessions1">[18]</xref>. The expression level of <italic>PAS2</italic> was reduced in the transgenic plants compared to wild-type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Although the phenotypes were highly variable, we could find <italic>pas2-1</italic>-like phenotypes in eight of the 44 transgenic lines, such as swollen hypocotyls, fused leaves, and retarded growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Moreover, in transgenic lines showing no macroscopic phenotype, we observed overproliferation of vasculature cells and enlargement of the RZ, the latter of which appeared to be mainly due to enhanced cell expansion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). As mentioned above, the <italic>ProPAS2:PAS2–GUS</italic> reporter gene showed faint expression in the vasculature; thus, to verify that <italic>PAS2</italic> expression in the epidermis is sufficient for proper development, we introduced the RNAi construct under the procambial <italic>ATHB8</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Baima1">[19]</xref>. As a result, no <italic>pas2-1</italic>-like phenotype was found among 79 transgenic lines, supporting the epidermis-specific role of <italic>PAS2</italic> in plant development. We then introduced <italic>ProATML1:PAS2–GUS</italic> into the <italic>pas2-1</italic> mutant. GUS expression was specifically observed in the L1 layer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g003">Figure 3E</xref>), and five of the six transgenic lines displayed fully rescued phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), indicating the functionality of PAS2–GUS.

        <title>Mild Reduction of VLCFA Content Enhances Cell Proliferation and Promotes Shoot Growth</title>
        <p>In <italic>pas2-1</italic>, the cuticular wax content is severely reduced <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Bach1">[13]</xref>; it is thus difficult to distinguish the outcome of defective cuticular formation from other effects arising from low VLCFA content. Therefore, we examined dose-dependent phenotypes in wild-type seedlings using the synthetic inhibitor cafenstrole, which blocks the first step of VLCFA elongation reactions by targeting KCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Trenkamp1">[20]</xref>. Our recent study showed that cafenstrole treatment of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedlings reduced the content of C22 and C24 fatty acids, although our experimental conditions did not allow us to detect C26 or longer fatty acids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Nobusawa1">[21]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Seedlings treated with 3 µM cafenstrole displayed severe growth retardation with swollen hypocotyls and fused leaves, as observed in <italic>pas2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). Those treated with 30 nM cafenstrole did not show growth inhibition, but instead produced larger leaves with thicker hypocotyls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Measurements of leaf area and cell size showed that, in 12-d-old seedlings, leaf blade area increased 1.7-fold after 30 nM cafenstrole treatment (14.4±2.5 mm<sup>2</sup> for the control and 24.0±5.0 mm<sup>2</sup> for the cafenstrole treatment; mean ± standard deviation [SD], n≥11), whereas cell size did not change significantly (830±55 µm<sup>2</sup> for the control and 852±158 µm<sup>2</sup> for the cafenstrole treatment) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Cell number also increased 1.7-fold in cafenstrole-treated leaves (17,265±2,467 for the control and 29,297±6,765 for the cafenstrole treatment) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s002">Figure S2</xref>), accounting for the 1.7-fold enlargement of leaf blades. In shoot apices, 30 nM cafenstrole caused more cells to accumulate in the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and, as a result, cell number in the vasculature of the hypocotyl dramatically increased (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). To examine cell division activity, we used the <italic>ProCDKB2;1:NT–GUS</italic> reporter (comprising the <italic>CDKB2;1</italic> promoter and the first <italic>CDKB2;1</italic> exon [<italic>NT</italic>] fused in-frame to <italic>GUS</italic>), which monitors mitotic cells during the G2 and M phases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Adachi1">[22]</xref>. The number of GUS-stained cells increased when the cafenstrole concentration was elevated, especially in the region along the vasculature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). These results demonstrate that a mild reduction of VLCFA content (with 30 nM cafenstrole or in <italic>PAS2</italic> RNAi plants) enhances proliferation of vasculature cells, while a severe reduction (with 3 µM cafenstrole or in <italic>pas2-1</italic>) causes overall growth retardation with impaired cuticular formation, as described below.</p>

        <p>Transmission electron microscopy revealed that an electron-dense cuticular layer disappeared in <italic>pas2-1</italic>, and that only a trace of cuticular layer was formed in wild-type seedlings treated with 3 µM cafenstrole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). On the other hand, a thicker cuticle was formed in the presence of 30 nM cafenstrole (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g004">Figure 4D</xref>); thus, it is unlikely that cell proliferation was enhanced as a consequence of reduced cuticle synthesis. This idea is supported by the observation that <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants specifically impaired in cuticular formation did not display enhanced cell proliferation, as described later. Moreover, the expression of the L1-specific reporter <italic>ProPDF1:GUS</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Abe2">[23]</xref> retained its L1 specificity in <italic>pas2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s003">Figure S3A</xref>), indicating that epidermal identity is maintained under low-VLCFA conditions.</p>

        <title>Low VLCFA Content Increases Cytokinin Level and Enhances Cell Proliferation</title>
        <p>We quantified phytohormone content, and found that levels of the cytokinins isopentenyladenine (iP) and <italic>trans</italic>-zeatin (tZ), and of their ribosylated and phosphorylated precursors (iPR, iPRPs, tZR, and tZRPs), increased in <italic>pas2-1</italic> and in wild-type treated with 30 nM or 3 µM cafenstrole (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001531-t001">Table 1</xref>). This indicates that active cytokinins are highly synthesized in <italic>pas2-1</italic> and after cafenstrole treatment. Indeed, expression of the primary cytokinin response marker <italic>ARABIDOPSIS RESPONSE REGULATOR 6</italic> (<italic>ARR6</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-To1">[24]</xref> was stimulated by cafenstrole treatment in vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>). Moreover, 30 nM cafenstrole did not enlarge leaves, but instead slightly reduced the cell number and the leaf size, in <italic>ipt3;5;7</italic> triple mutants, in which cytokinin levels are severely decreased because of defects in cytokinin biosynthetic isopentenyltransferases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g006">Figure 6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Miyawaki1">[25]</xref>. This finding suggests that cytokinin is associated with the cafenstrole-induced activation of cell division.

In mutants of <italic>PAS3</italic> and <italic>PAS1</italic>, which encode acetyl-CoA carboxylase and a scaffold protein for the elongase complex, respectively, VLCFA content is dramatically reduced and, as a result, organ growth is severely inhibited <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Faure1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Baud1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Roudier1">[28]</xref>. As observed in <italic>pas2-1</italic>, these mutants contained higher amounts of tZ and iP compared to wild-type, and more cells accumulated in the RZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>), indicating an enhancement of cell division. A recent report demonstrated that <italic>glossyhead1</italic> (<italic>gsd1</italic>), another mutant allele for <italic>PAS3</italic>, did not show severe growth inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-L1">[29]</xref>.

Correspondingly, we detected a small increase of tZ level in seedlings, and a mild enhancement of cell proliferation in the RZ, but these phenotypes were less prominent than those in <italic>pas</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). Note that the RZ in the control (L<italic>er</italic>) was already larger than that in Col-0 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). We also found a similar trend in the leaky <italic>mosaic death1</italic> (<italic>mod1-1</italic>) mutant, in which the activity of the LCFA-synthesizing enzyme enoyl-ACP reductase was reduced by half (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Mou1">[31]</xref>. Although LCFA and VLCFA content in <italic>mod1-1</italic> have not been reported so far, we noticed that tZ and iP levels increased slightly and that cell proliferation was enhanced in the RZ (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). This suggests that VLCFA content might be reduced as a result of decreased LCFA synthesis, but not as severely as in <italic>pas</italic> mutants, leading to modest effects on cytokinin level and cell division. The above results indicate that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis is responsible for suppressing cytokinin biosynthesis and cell proliferation. We also observed three mutants with defects in cuticular wax formation from VLCFAs, <italic>cer4-1</italic>, <italic>wax2</italic>, and <italic>mah1-3</italic>, which display impaired synthesis of primary alcohols, aldehydes, and secondary alcohols and ketones, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g007">Figure 7A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Chen1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Rowland1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Greer1">[33]</xref>.

        <title>VLCFA Synthesis Is Required for Suppression of Overproliferation by Repressing Cytokinin Biosynthesis in the Vasculature</title>
        <p>To identify the cause of higher cytokinin production under low-VLCFA conditions, we conducted microarray analyses and examined the expression levels of cytokinin biosynthesis genes. (Microarray data have been deposited in the ArrayExpress database under accession number E-MEXP-3315.) In <italic>pas2-1</italic>, the mRNA levels of <italic>IPT3</italic> and <italic>CYP735A2</italic> were 3.9- and 6.6-fold higher, respectively, than in wild-type (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s007">Table S1</xref>). <italic>IPT3</italic> encodes one of the nine adenosine phosphate-isopentenyltransferases (IPTs), which catalyze the first and rate-limiting step of cytokinin biosynthesis to produce isopentenyladenine riboside phosphates (iPRPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Miyawaki2">[34]</xref>. CYP735A2 converts iPRPs to <italic>trans</italic>-zeatin riboside phosphates (tZRPs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Takei1">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We examined cytokinin levels and <italic>IPT3</italic> expression in the <italic>pas2-1</italic> mutant carrying <italic>ProATML1:PAS2–GUS</italic>, which rescued <italic>pas2-1</italic> phenotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). As described above, levels of tZ and iP were highly elevated in <italic>pas2-1</italic> compared to those in wild-type (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001531-t001">Table 1</xref>), but in <italic>pas2-1</italic> carrying <italic>ProATML1:PAS2–GUS</italic>, no such increase of cytokinin content was detected (tZ, 0.57±0.06 pmol/g fresh weight for Col-0 and 0.71±0.13 pmol/g for the transgenic line; iP, 0.49±0.03 pmol/g for Col-0 and 0.51±0.03 pmol/g for the transgenic line; mean ± SD, 7-d-old seedlings [<italic>n</italic> = 3]). The elevated level of <italic>IPT3</italic> transcripts in <italic>pas2-1</italic> was also reduced to the wild-type level by <italic>PAS2–GUS</italic> expression in the epidermis (the relative mRNA level, with that for wild-type set to 1, was 3.77±0.15 for <italic>pas2-1</italic> and 0.81±0.09 for <italic>pas2-1</italic> carrying <italic>ProATML1:PAS2–GUS</italic>; mean ± SD, 7-d-old seedlings [<italic>n</italic> = 3]). These results indicate that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis is required to suppress not only cytokinin biosynthesis but also <italic>IPT3</italic> expression.</p>
        <p>We then monitored <italic>IPT3</italic> expression in 5-d-old seedlings using the <italic>promoter:GUS</italic> reporter. Consistent with a previous observation of <italic>IPT3</italic> expression in the phloem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Baima1">[19]</xref>, we detected the GUS signal in vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Cafenstrole treatment increased the intensity of the GUS signal and extended the expression domain in shoot apices and leaves; a similar expression pattern was also observed in <italic>pas2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g008">Figure 8A and 8B</xref>). In cafenstrole-treated leaves, expression of the procambial marker <italic>ProATHB8:GUS</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Nobusawa1">[21]</xref> was restricted to vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s003">Figure S3B and S3C</xref>), but <italic>IPT3</italic> expression extended to spongy mesophyll cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g008">Figure 8C</xref>). This indicates that low-VLCFA conditions increase <italic>IPT3</italic> expression in the vasculature and cause ectopic expression in non-vascular cells.</p>

        <p>To examine whether increased cytokinin synthesis is a cause or a consequence of the overproliferation phenotype, we monitored <italic>IPT3</italic> expression after transfer of 3-d-old seedlings to a medium containing 30 nM or 3 µM cafenstrole. We also observed the <italic>ProCYCB1;2:NT–GUS</italic> reporter (comprising the <italic>CYCB1;2</italic> promoter and the N-terminal region of <italic>CYCB1;2</italic> [<italic>NT</italic>] fused in-frame to <italic>GUS</italic>), which monitors G2/M phase cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Culligan1">[36]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s005">Figure S5</xref>, higher <italic>IPT3</italic> expression was noted after 6 h and 12 h for 3 µM and 30 nM cafenstrole, respectively, compared with the non-treated control. By contrast, <italic>CYCB1;2</italic> expression increased from 12 to 24 h in the SAM and in young true leaves regardless of cafenstrole treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s005">Figure S5</xref>), suggesting a general activation of cell division at this developmental stage. Expression was even higher after 48 h for both 30 nM and 3 µM cafenstrole, but not for the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s005">Figure S5</xref>), demonstrating that cafenstrole-induced overproliferation occurred later than 24 h. Measurement of cytokinin content revealed that cytokinin precursors, especially iPR and iPRPs, increased after 6 to 12 h of 3 µM cafenstrole treatment, and that iP and tZ increased after 24 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s008">Table S2</xref>). These results indicate that cafenstrole induces cytokinin synthesis, which is then followed by activation of cell division, implying that enhanced cytokinin synthesis is the cause of overproliferation triggered by low-VLCFA conditions.</p>
        <p>The above results suggested an interesting hypothesis, namely, that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis is required to confine cytokinin biosynthesis to the vasculature and prevent cells from overproliferating. To test this hypothesis, we examined whether the effect of cafenstrole is suppressed by reducing cytokinin levels. We expressed the gene for Venus-fused cytokinin oxidase 1 (CKX1), which degrades active forms of cytokinins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Werner1">[37]</xref>, under the control of <italic>ATML1</italic> and <italic>ATHB8</italic> promoters. Venus fluorescence showed that the <italic>ATML1</italic> and <italic>ATHB8</italic> promoters conferred epidermis- and vasculature-specific expression, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>). We measured leaf area in four independent lines for each promoter construct, and found that 30 nM cafenstrole enlarged leaves in wild-type and <italic>ProATML1:CKX1–Venus</italic>, but that no such enlargement occurred in <italic>ProATHB8:CKX1–Venus</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g009">Figures 9A, 9B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s006">S6C</xref>). The latter effect was due to the suppression of cafenstrole-induced enhancement of cell proliferation in leaves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g009">Figure 9B</xref>). Enhanced cell accumulation in the vasculature, expansion of hypocotyl width at the base of cotyledons, and an increase in vascular cell number in hypocotyls were also suppressed by <italic>CKX1–Venus</italic> expression in vascular bundles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g009">Figures 9C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s006">S6D</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001531.s006">S6E</xref>). We also expressed <italic>CKX1–Venus</italic> in <italic>pas2-1</italic>, but the macroscopic phenotype of the mutant was not suppressed with either promoter, probably owing to severely impaired cuticular formation. However, when shoot apices were observed microscopically, we found that the enhanced cell accumulation in the RZ and disorganization of the vasculature were partially suppressed with <italic>ProATHB8:CKX1–Venus</italic>, but not with <italic>ProATML1:CKX1–Venus</italic> in <italic>pas2-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g009">Figure 9D</xref>). These results indicate that, under low-VLCFA conditions, an increase of cytokinin biosynthesis in the vasculature is the major cause of overproliferation. The inability of <italic>ProATML1:CKX1–Venus</italic> to suppress overproliferation suggests that non-cell-autonomous factors (other than cytokinins) act from mesophyll cells to the epidermis to promote cell division, as reported previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Serralbo1">[38]</xref>.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study, we showed that a higher concentration of cafenstrole (3 µM) caused severe growth defects, notably swollen hypocotyls and fused leaves, which are similar to those observed in the leaky <italic>pas2-1</italic> mutant. More cells accumulated in the RZ of <italic>pas2-1</italic>, and the number of cortical cell layers increased in the hypocotyl. In contrast, at a lower concentration (30 nM), seedlings showed neither overall growth inhibition nor organ fusions; rather, the leaves were enlarged due to increased cell number. Enhanced cell proliferation was also observed in the vasculature in shoot apices, resulting in a dramatic increase of cell number in the vasculature of hypocotyls. When <italic>PAS2</italic> expression was specifically downregulated in the epidermis, we could again observe disorganized vasculature due to enhanced cell proliferation. It is likely that, in <italic>pas2-1</italic> and in wild-type plants treated with 3 µM cafenstrole, the stimulatory effect on cell division might be difficult to observe macroscopically, except for the swollen hypocotyl, due to impaired cuticular formation and consequent growth defects. However, a common feature was observed following mild or severe inhibition of VLCFA synthesis, namely, enhanced cell proliferation in the vasculature or in the RZ, respectively. It is noteworthy that, in <italic>pas2-1</italic>, cell accumulation was prominent in the RZ but not in the vasculature. One possible explanation for this observation is that the amount of cytokinin in the vasculature may be so high that cell division is actually inhibited. The lower level of cytokinin in the RZ than in the vasculature may efficiently enhance cell proliferation. It is also probable that faster accumulation of RZ cells in <italic>pas2-1</italic> suppresses cell division in the vasculature by intertissue communication. Further studies are needed to examine such possibilities.</p>

However, in a <italic>pas2</italic> mutant carrying phosphomimic mutations in <italic>CDKA</italic>, the phenotype of phosphomimic <italic>CDKA</italic> plants was not epistatic to the <italic>pas2</italic> phenotype; rather, the two phenotypes were additive, indicating that PAS2 functions in parallel to CDKA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Dissmeyer1">[40]</xref>. This is supported by the fact that PAS2 is exclusively localized to the endoplasmic reticulum, whereas CDKA is distributed in both the nucleus and the cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Bach1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Boruc1">[41]</xref>. Here, we observed enhanced cell proliferation in the RZ or in the vasculature not only in <italic>pas2</italic>, but also in other VLCFA-related mutants, such as <italic>pas1</italic>, <italic>pas3</italic>, <italic>gsd1</italic>, and <italic>fdh</italic>, as well as by treatment with the KCS inhibitor cafenstrole. Therefore, the overproliferation phenotype is not specifically linked to PAS2 functions, but instead is caused by inhibition of VLCFA synthesis.</p>
      <p>We revealed that, in <italic>pas2-1</italic> and under cafenstrole treatment, <italic>IPT3</italic> expression in the vasculature was elevated and its domain expanded to the spongy mesophyll cells. Indeed, the content of active cytokinins increased prior to the activation of cell division, whereas the overproliferation phenotype was suppressed in <italic>ipt3;5;7</italic> mutants and by vasculature-specific degradation of cytokinins. These results demonstrate that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis confines cytokinin biosynthesis to the vasculature and restricts cell proliferation. The idea that <italic>IPT3</italic> is a possible target of epidermis-derived signals is supported by a previous report that overexpression of <italic>IPT3</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> resulted in a 3.4-fold increase of cytokinin content, and enlarged leaves with increased cell number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Galichet1">[42]</xref>. However, it is also likely that <italic>CYP735A2</italic>, whose expression increased 6.6-fold in <italic>pas2-1</italic>, is another target. In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and rice plants, impairment of VLCFA synthesis elevates the expression of <italic>KNOTTED-like homeobox</italic> (<italic>KNOX</italic>) genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Harrar1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Ito1">[43]</xref>. Moreover, overexpression of class I <italic>KNOX</italic> (<italic>KNOXI</italic>) genes is known to promote cytokinin synthesis in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Yanai1">[44]</xref>. However, it is unlikely that VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis restricts the cytokinin level by controlling <italic>KNOXI</italic> expression, because we observed overproliferation not only in the SAM but also in leaves, where <italic>KNOXI</italic> genes are not expressed. It is known that cytokinin induces expression of the <italic>KNOXI</italic> genes <italic>KNAT1/BP</italic> and <italic>STM</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Rupp1">[45]</xref>, suggesting that <italic>KNOX</italic> upregulation under low-VLCFA conditions results from increased cytokinin synthesis in the shoot apex. Our results indicate that epidermis-derived signals fine-tune cell division activity in internal tissue, suggesting that shoot growth is controlled by the interaction between the surface (epidermis) and the axis (vasculature) of the plant body (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Indeed, perturbing this regulation by lowering VLCFA synthesis increased leaf size, demonstrating that non-autonomous signals are essential to restrict organ size.</p>

          <title>A model for restriction of cell proliferation by VLCFA synthesis.</title>
          <p>VLCFA synthesis in the epidermis confines cytokinin (CK) synthesis to the vasculature via non-autonomous signals, and restricts cell proliferation. VLCFA is also used for the synthesis of cuticular wax; thus, cuticle formation and cell proliferation are coordinately controlled by VLCFA synthesis during shoot development. Green and blue lines represent the epidermis and the vasculature, respectively.</p>

      <p><italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants with defects in cuticular wax formation from VLCFAs (<italic>cer4</italic>, <italic>mah1</italic>, <italic>wax2</italic>) did not exhibit phenotypes similar to those observed in <italic>pas</italic> mutants or cafenstrole-treated wild-type plants. Although we cannot exclude the possibility that some level of wax classes synthesized in these mutants suppresses the overproliferation phenotype, it is more likely that VLCFA derivatives function as signaling molecules to control cytokinin biosynthesis and cell division (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). In yeast and animals, sphingolipids made from VLCFAs act as signaling molecules controlling cell proliferation, cell death and stress responses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Worrall1">[8]</xref>. Although <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants defective in sphingolipid biosynthesis are impaired in cell growth, and in severe cases die <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Chen2">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Dietrich1">[47]</xref>, some types of sphingolipids may control cell division by affecting cytokinin synthesis. It is also possible that VLCFA-containing lipids may function as mediators or ligands that control gene transcription, as suggested in mammals, yeast, and bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Black1">[48]</xref>. Indeed, arachidonic acid is known to induce stress-related gene expression and elicit defense signaling in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Savchenko1">[49]</xref>. It is also likely that some metabolites, whose levels change depending on VLCFA synthesis, confine cytokinin biosynthesis to the vasculature.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, 21 genes have been identified for KCS, which catalyzes the first step of VLCFA elongation reactions. Some of them are expressed predominantly in the epidermis, as observed for <italic>PAS2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Joubs1">[50]</xref>. Indeed, <italic>PAS2</italic>, <italic>KCS11</italic>, <italic>KCS16</italic>, and <italic>KCS20</italic> have one L1-box, and <italic>KCS6</italic>, <italic>KCS9</italic>, <italic>KCS10/FDH</italic>, and <italic>KCS18</italic> have two L1-boxes, in their promoter regions, at which transcription factors ATML1 and PDF2 bind and control the L1/epidermis-specific gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Abe1">[1]</xref>. Four <italic>kcs</italic> mutants, <italic>kcs6</italic>, <italic>kcs10/fdh</italic>, <italic>kcs2</italic>, and <italic>kcs20</italic>, exhibit a glossy appearance and/or organ fusion, but no overproliferation phenotype was described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Fiebig1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Lee1">[54]</xref>. However, we observed mildly enhanced cell proliferation in the RZ of <italic>fdh-13</italic>, suggesting that other <italic>kcs</italic> mutants may also accumulate more cells in the RZ (or in the vasculature) than wild-type plants. Alternatively, specific VLCFAs may be required to suppress cell proliferation, because the distribution of various VLCFA species may depend on the substrate preference of each KCS (e.g., for a particular carbon chain length). HCD is unlikely to have such substrate preference, as it is encoded by the single-copy gene <italic>PAS2</italic> in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>; thus, the <italic>pas2</italic> mutation reduces the overall level of VLCFAs including those that are responsible for suppressing cell proliferation. Further studies will reveal which VLCFA species or VLCFA-containing lipids are associated with non-autonomous signals to suppress cell proliferation in tissues.</p>
      <p>Previously, cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor genes were ectopically expressed in the L1 layer, and meristem organization was investigated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Bemis1">[55]</xref>. Cell number in the epidermis was reduced, while that in the cortex and mesophyll was the same as in wild-type. These and our present observations indicate that cell proliferation in shoot growth is not coordinated between the L1 and the inner layers; rather, it is controlled by VLCFA-derived signals that act on cytokinin biosynthesis in the vasculature. A likely benefit of this system is that plants can coordinate cuticular wax formation and organ growth, and can thus maintain proper development under various environmental conditions. Several <italic>KCS</italic> genes are induced by abiotic stress, such as salt, dehydration, and osmotic stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Joubs1">[50]</xref>; the transcription factor MYB30, which activates expression of VLCFA biosynthesis genes, is also induced by pathogen infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Raffaele1">[56]</xref>. Therefore, plants may deploy mechanisms to actively form cuticular wax and suppress cell proliferation to minimize energy consumption under stressful conditions. It is also known that BES1, a downstream transcription factor in the brassinosteroid signaling pathway, directly interacts with and activates MYB30 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Raffaele1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-Li1">[57]</xref>. While BES1 is involved in generating cell growth-promoting signal(s) from the L1 to inner layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001531-SavaldiGoldstein1">[6]</xref>, brassinosteroid signaling in the epidermis may also control cell proliferation by activating MYB30 and VLCFA synthesis. Identification of non-autonomous signals will reveal how plants limit organ growth and adapt to changing environments by controlling cell growth and proliferation.</p>

For each promoter construct, three independent lines, which are different from those shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001531-g009">Figure 9</xref>, were used for measurement. Data are presented as mean ± SD (<italic>n</italic>≥20). (D) Measurement of hypocotyl width. Hypocotyls of 8-d-old seedlings grown in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 30 nM cafenstrole were measured. Data are presented as mean ± SD (<italic>n</italic>≥20). Significant differences between wild-type and <italic>CKX1–Venus</italic> transgenic seedlings were determined by Student's <italic>t</italic>-test: ***, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; the other differences are not significant (<italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05). (E) Cross sections of 5-d-old hypocotyls grown in the absence (−) or presence (+) of 30 nM cafenstrole. Bars, 50 µm (A), 20 µm (B), and 100 µm (E).</p>
