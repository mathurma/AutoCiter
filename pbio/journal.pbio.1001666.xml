<p>This study reveals a novel pathway that responds to hypoxia and modulates energy metabolism by cardiomyocytes in the mouse heart, thereby determining oxygen consumption.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cardiomyocytes are vulnerable to hypoxia in the adult, but adapted to hypoxia <italic>in utero</italic>. Current understanding of endogenous cardiac oxygen sensing pathways is limited. Myocardial oxygen consumption is determined by regulation of energy metabolism, which shifts from glycolysis to lipid oxidation soon after birth, and is reversed in failing adult hearts, accompanying re-expression of several “fetal” genes whose role in disease phenotypes remains unknown. Here we show that hypoxia-controlled expression of the transcription factor Hand1 determines oxygen consumption by inhibition of lipid metabolism in the fetal and adult cardiomyocyte, leading to downregulation of mitochondrial energy generation. Hand1 is under direct transcriptional control by HIF1α. Transgenic mice prolonging cardiac Hand1 expression die immediately following birth, failing to activate the neonatal lipid metabolising gene expression programme. Deletion of Hand1 in embryonic cardiomyocytes results in premature expression of these genes. Using metabolic flux analysis, we show that Hand1 expression controls cardiomyocyte oxygen consumption by direct transcriptional repression of lipid metabolising genes. This leads, in turn, to increased production of lactate from glucose, decreased lipid oxidation, reduced inner mitochondrial membrane potential, and mitochondrial ATP generation. We found that this pathway is active in adult cardiomyocytes. Up-regulation of Hand1 is protective in a mouse model of myocardial ischaemia. We propose that Hand1 is part of a novel regulatory pathway linking cardiac oxygen levels with oxygen consumption. Understanding hypoxia adaptation in the fetal heart may allow development of strategies to protect cardiomyocytes vulnerable to ischaemia, for example during cardiac ischaemia or surgery.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Regulation of oxygen usage in cardiomyocytes is of great medical interest, because adult cardiac tissue is extremely vulnerable to hypoxia during myocardial infarction and cardiac surgery. While some progress has been made toward protecting cardiomyocytes from hypoxia in these circumstances, it has been limited by a lack of understanding of endogenous oxygen-sensing pathways. In contrast to adult cardiac tissue, embryonic cardiomyocytes are highly resistant to hypoxia, although the mechanisms underlying this have hitherto been unclear. Using mice we show that the transcription factor Hand1 is expressed at high levels in the fetal heart, under direct control of HIF1α signaling, a pathway well known to respond to hypoxia. We show that Hand1 expression decreases at birth as the neonate is exposed to higher levels of oxygen. By experimentally increasing Hand1 expression in the neonatal heart, we see lower oxygen consumption in cardiomyocytes and this is caused by <italic>Hand1</italic> repressing key regulatory genes involved in cardiomyocyte lipid metabolism. This has the effect of decreasing mitochondrial ATP generation via the tricarboxylic acid cycle. Furthermore, we show that increasing Hand1 expression in adult transgenic hearts is protective against myocardial infarction, suggesting that a hypoxia–Hand1 pathway may also be of importance in the adult heart.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Adult cardiomyocytes are particularly vulnerable to hypoxia, which can result in cellular dysfunction and death. While some progress has been made towards protecting cardiomyocytes from the deleterious effects of low oxygen levels, cardiac ischaemia continues to result in high mortality and remains a clinical challenge <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Eltzschig1">[1]</xref>. Fetal cardiomyocytes, in contrast, are adapted to function at extremely low oxygen levels. In the relative hypoxia of the womb, the fetal heart generates ATP predominantly from glucose via glycolysis and energy generation shifts to mitochondrial β-oxidation of lipids and the tricarboxylic acid cycle as the primary source of energy for the heart only after birth, when oxygen levels are abundant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lopaschuk1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lopaschuk2">[3]</xref>. It is striking that to varying degrees this is reversed in the adult failing heart.</p>
<p>Little is known about the mechanisms regulating these changes in cardiac energy metabolism. Specifically, the molecular link between oxygen availability and molecular control of energy metabolism is currently ill-defined. In the mouse, cellular and metabolic changes in the heart occur rapidly after birth, the switch from glycolysis to β-oxidation of lipids and the tricarboxylic cycle occurring within a week of birth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lopaschuk1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Sheldon1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Makinde1">[7]</xref>. Under conditions of “stress” such as those leading to cardiac hypertrophy and heart failure, fetal-type glycolytic energy metabolism is known to recommence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Taegtmeyer1">[8]</xref>. This is accompanied in the failing heart by re-expression of several isoforms of enzymes, of transcription factors, and of structural and other proteins normally expressed in the fetal heart. Metabolic remodeling therefore appears to be part of a broader phenotypic switch between adult and fetal states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Taegtmeyer1">[8]</xref>. Analyzing the mechanisms regulating changes in the heart during the transition from fetus to neonate, in particular the changing sensitivity to oxygen levels, may therefore inform efforts towards more effective therapeutic intervention for heart failure. Furthermore, understanding how the fetal heart is adapted to hypoxia may allow development of strategies to protect cardiomyocytes vulnerable to ischaemia, for example during myocardial ischaemic events or cardiac surgery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Eltzschig1">[1]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have previously reported studies suggesting a role for elevated levels of the cardiac transcription factor <italic>Hand1</italic> in the derangement of electrical conductivity and arrhythmia of the failing heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Breckenridge1">[9]</xref>. Here we show that cardiac levels of <italic>Hand1</italic> mRNA and protein fall immediately following birth and investigate the control and consequences of this postnatal down-regulation. Expression of <italic>Hand1</italic> mRNA is up-regulated by <italic>HIF</italic> signaling, and <italic>Hand1</italic> itself inhibits the expression of a number of genes involved in cardiomyocyte lipid metabolism. Through inhibition of lipid metabolism, <italic>Hand1</italic> reduces cellular oxygen consumption and cardiomyocyte vulnerability to ischaemia. We hypothesise that in the cardiomyocyte, <italic>Hand1</italic> is part of a pathway linking ambient oxygen levels to oxygen consumption through regulation of cellular lipid metabolism.</p>

<title>Hand1 Expression Is Induced by Hypoxia Signaling in the Perinatal Heart</title>
<p><italic>Hand1</italic> mRNA is expressed at high levels in the developing embryonic heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Firulli1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Riley1">[11]</xref>. In contrast, only low levels have been reported in adult cardiac tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Ritter1">[12]</xref>. We therefore investigated whether <italic>Hand1</italic> expression changed around birth or during subsequent growth and maturation of the heart. Using quantitative RTPCR analysis of cDNA from mouse hearts, we found that <italic>Hand1</italic> mRNA levels decrease rapidly in the immediate postnatal period (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), whereas those of the related transcription factor <italic>Hand2</italic> remain largely unaltered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We found that protein levels of Hand1 and 2 broadly follow those of mRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). In the early embryo, <italic>Hand1</italic> is expressed at high levels in the developing trophoblast and subsequently in the developing heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Riley1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Cross1">[13]</xref>.

<p>We first tested whether ambient levels of oxygen affect <italic>Hand1</italic> levels in the adult mouse, incubating wild-type adult mice in 12% oxygen for 2 wk and comparing Hand1 expression levels with those of controls maintained under normoxic conditions. Such exposure to hypoxia resulted in 18-fold elevation of <italic>Hand1</italic> mRNA levels compared with controls (<italic>n</italic> = 4 each group, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), indicating that cardiac Hand1 levels are directly or indirectly hypoxia-inducible.</p>
<p>We next tested whether neonatal <italic>Hand1</italic> expression is directly dependent on HIF1α signaling by examining <italic>Hand1</italic> mRNA levels in transgenic mice showing constitutive hypoxic signaling. Cardiac-specific deletion of <italic>VHL</italic> in <italic>αMHC-cre::VHL<sup>(fl/fl)</sup></italic> neonates results in constitutive cardiac expression of <italic>HIF1α</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lei1">[18]</xref>.

Furthermore, chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) showed binding of HIF1α to two of the five canonical HIF binding sites located in 5 kb of sequence upstream of the murine Hand1 transcriptional start site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g001">Figure 1G</xref>).</p>

<title>Transcription Changes in Hand1 Up-Regulating Hearts</title>
<p>Glycogen depletion suggested significant changes in neonatal myocardial energy metabolism as a result of <italic>Hand1</italic> up-regulation, and we therefore performed Affymetrix microarray analysis to monitor changes in the myocardial transcriptome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001666.s005">Table S1</xref>).

These data imply that <italic>Hand1</italic> in the neonatal heart acts independently of <italic>PGC1-α</italic>.</p>
<p>We next carried out ChIP, assaying canonical E-boxes (CAnnTG) in the 5′ promoters of the <italic>ACC</italic>, <italic>MCD</italic>, <italic>ACBP</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>FATP</italic>, <italic>HSL</italic>, and <italic>ATGL</italic> genes, using a Hand1 antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g003">Figure 3H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001666.s002">Figure S2</xref>). This revealed that Hand1 binds to several (but not all) E-boxes in the 5′ promoters of <italic>ACAC</italic>, <italic>MCD</italic>, <italic>FABP4</italic>, <italic>ACBP</italic>, and <italic>HSL</italic> promoters in vivo (albeit with varying degrees of avidity).

<p>We then went on to confirm that Hand1 directly regulates one of these putative target genes. We cloned a 1 kb fragment of the mouse HSL promoter and ligated it into the pGL3 luciferase vector (Promega), and performed site-directed mutagenesis to abolish the middle e-box site, which we found bound Hand1 protein in the chIP assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g003">Figure 3I</xref>). Mutation of this e-box site led to a 7-fold increase in luciferase expression over the e-box containing promoter in untransfected HL1 cells, and a 13-fold increase in HL1 cells stably transfected with Hand1. Lower basal levels of promoter activation were found in Hand1 expressing cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g003">Figure 3I</xref>).</p>

<title>Hand1 Reduces Cellular Oxygen Consumption</title>
<p>To test the hypothesis that the reduction in cardiomyocyte lipid uptake and synthesis mediated by <italic>Hand1</italic> will be reflected in decreased cellular oxygen consumption, we tested the effect of <italic>Hand1</italic> expression on oxygen consumption of stably transfected HL1 cardiomyocyte lines.

Incubation of HL1 cells with excess of palmitate or glucose has the effect of driving the cell towards either β-oxidation of lipid or glycolysis, respectively. Lipid oxidation is reflected by a significant increase in oxygen consumption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g005">Figure 5B</xref>).

<p>The redox state of mitochondrial NADH is a function of respiratory chain activity and substrate turnover. We measured the resting level of NADH autofluorescence in HL1 cells, which was then expressed as the “redox index,” a ratio of the maximally oxidized and maximally reduced signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-PlunFavreau1">[29]</xref>. The dynamic range of the signals was defined by obtaining the maximally oxidized signal following the response to 1 µM FCCP (which stimulates maximal respiration and fully oxidises the mitochondrial NADH pool). In these conditions, mitochondrial NADH is taken as fully oxidised and defined as 0%. The maximally reduced signal was then defined as the response to 1 mM NaCN (which fully inhibits respiration), preventing NADH oxidation, and so promoting maximal mitochondrial NADH reduction. In these conditions, NADH is taken as 100% reduced. HL1 cells down-regulating Hand1 did not significantly change the NADH redox state (35.7%±2.89%; <italic>n</italic> = 23 compare to 32.6%±2.4% in control shRNA transfected cells).

It should be noted that Hand1 down-regulation and Hand1 up-regulation had an opposite effect on the total mitochondrial pool of NADH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). We found that Hand1 down-regulation significantly increases the NADH substrate pool (to 156%±6.5% of control; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001) and Hand1 up-regulation significantly decreases the NADH pool in mitochondria (87.5%±4.6% of control; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05).</p>
<p>We then carried out glucose flux analysis on stably transfected HL1 cell lines, using uniformly labeled <sup>13</sup>C-Glucose, incubating for 4 h and analysing <sup>13</sup>C lactate levels with <sup>1</sup>H NMR. We found significant elevation of lactate production in Hand1 overexpressing cells compared with control Hand1 shRNA down-regulating cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g006">Figure 6F,H</xref>), and significantly elevated <sup>13</sup>C labeling of lactate in adult XMLC-Hand1 hearts compared with controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g006">Figure 6G</xref>).

<p>Taken together, these results imply that the effect of Hand1 is to reduce mitochondrial energy generation, and to switch cellular metabolism from aerobic glycolysis and mitochondrial energy generation to anaerobic glycolysis.</p>

<title>Modulation of Hand1 Expression in a Mouse Model of Cardiac Ischaemia</title>
<p>Since up-regulation of <italic>Hand1</italic> reduces cardiomyocyte oxygen consumption, we hypothesised that an increase in cardiac <italic>Hand1</italic> levels may enhance tolerance to ischaemia. We therefore tested the effect of Hand1 up-regulation in an animal model of myocardial ischaemia. Hearts were removed from adult (2 mo old) up-regulating (<italic>XMLC2-Hand1</italic>) and control (<italic>XMLC2-rTTA</italic>) mice after 1 mo of doxycycline administration, and subjected to 35 min of global ischaemia during Langendorff perfusion, followed by 30 min of reperfusion and infusion with prewarmed triphenyltetrazolium chloride as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Siddall1">[30]</xref>. Overexpression of the Hand1 transgene resulted in a 47% reduction in tissue death compared with control mice (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g006">Figure 6I</xref>) consistent with elevated <italic>Hand1</italic> levels reducing cardiomyocyte oxygen consumption. Following 30 min of global ischaemia of Langendorff-perfused adult wild-type hearts, we were able to detect increased levels of HIF1α protein, but not Hand1 protein, using Western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001666-g006">Figure 6J</xref>). This implies that Hand1 is not involved in the acute response to hypoxia/ischaemia.</p>
<p>We have previously found that adult <italic>Hand1</italic> up-regulating hearts display a heart-failure-like phenotype of low threshold for ventricular arrhythmia and a diastolic defect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Breckenridge1">[9]</xref>. As energy generation is also remodeled in failing hearts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Neubauer1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Neubauer2">[32]</xref>, we measured PCr/Cr in Hand1 up-regulating adult mouse hearts. We found significant reductions in PCr/CR ratio (1.25±0.25 for controls versus 0.88±0.23 in Hand1 overexpression; <italic>p</italic> = 0.037) and PCr/ATP (1.70±0.06 versus 1.37±0.126; <italic>p</italic> = 0.0425) in <italic>Hand1</italic> up-regulating hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001666.s008">Table S4</xref>). Therefore, ischaemia protection in <italic>Hand1</italic> up-regulating hearts occurs at the expense of ATP production—that is, the same strategy employed in the fetal heart.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The mammalian cardiomyocyte is exposed to a large range of oxygen concentrations during development and terrestrial life. The ability of the cardiomyocyte to function in extremely low levels of oxygen is lost after birth, with serious medical consequences in the ageing human. Here we propose that the transcription factor <italic>Hand1</italic> is part of a novel metabolic pathway adapting the embryonic heart to varying levels of hypoxia during development, birth, and adulthood. This pathway may be of significance in the adult during heart failure, as Hand1 is one of the “fetal” genes up-regulated in the failing cardiomyocyte. The links between heart development and heart failure are becoming more apparent, and may provide clues to future therapies.</p>
<p>There is circumstantial evidence connecting <italic>Hand1</italic> expression with hypoxia during development. Hypoxia inducible factor (<italic>HIF</italic>) signaling is essential for formation of the placental trophoblast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Adelman1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Caniggia1">[15]</xref>, embryonic heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Compernolle1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Krishnan1">[17]</xref>, and developing nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Tomita1">[33]</xref>. Strikingly, these areas overlap <italic>Hand1</italic> function in the developing embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Firulli1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Riley1">[11]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>HIF</italic> signaling is thought to be activated in the failing heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Zolk1">[34]</xref>, where <italic>Hand1</italic> is up-regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Breckenridge1">[9]</xref>. Therefore, our data fit with a model whereby Hand1 expression is under control of hypoxia signaling in both the fetal and adult heart. Cardiac overexpression studies of the type described in this report are unable at present to differentiate between effects on the left and right ventricle. Development of reliable chamber-specific transgene expression is awaited for these studies. We found that cardiac-specific Hand1 null hearts exhibit up-regulation of the genes encoding proteins involved in lipid metabolism that are down-regulated in Hand1 overexpressing neonates. We also found that lipid oxidation in these hearts is increased relative to controls. These mice die <italic>in utero</italic> around e16–17 (our unpublished data and Mcfadyen et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-McFadden1">[26]</xref>). It is possible that the cause of death is an increase in oxygen demand due to up-regulated lipid metabolism. More broadly, the contribution of metabolic regulation to control of normal embryonic development is not yet clear.</p>
<p>The key adaptation of the fetal heart to hypoxia is the generation of ATP from oxygen-sparing glycolysis rather than oxygen-expensive lipid oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Giordano1">[35]</xref>, although the absolute rates of glucose oxidation versus glycolysis are as yet unclear. There are several lines of evidence suggesting that selection of energetic substrate is coupled to ambient oxygen levels, and regulation of cellular lipid oxidation is a key mechanism to determine oxygen consumption. Experimental inhibition of cellular lipid metabolism by etomoxir, a <italic>CPT1</italic> antagonist that prevents mitochondrial long-chain fatty acid import, shifts energy metabolism to glycolysis, leading to lower myocardial oxygen consumption, and protects against myocardial ischaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Hogberg1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lopaschuk4">[37]</xref>. Exposure of neonatal rats to hypoxia results in a decrease in overall lipid content and remodeled acyl-carnitine metabolism, resembling the effect of persistent Hand1 expression on lipid metabolism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Bruder1">[38]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our understanding of the molecular mechanisms linking lipid oxidation rates with ambient oxygen in the heart, specifically around birth, is incomplete. It is known that <italic>PGC1-α</italic> has a role in postnatal maturation of cardiac metabolism via regulation of mitochondrial number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lai1">[25]</xref>. The effect of <italic>Hand1</italic> on the postnatal heart seems to be independent of <italic>PGC1-α</italic>. This is supported by the finding that overexpression of <italic>PGC1-α</italic> has a limited effect in the adult mouse heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Russell1">[39]</xref> in contrast to the effects of <italic>Hand1</italic> overexpression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Breckenridge1">[9]</xref>. The transcriptional control of <italic>PGC1-α</italic> remains mysterious. We found that PGC1-α mRNA levels were not altered in neonatal VHL null hearts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001666.s002">Figure S2</xref>), implying that expression of this gene is not affected by changes in cardiac HIF signaling levels at birth.</p>
<p>Our data show that the effect of Hand1 in the heart is to down-regulate mitochondrial metabolism as well as lipid metabolism, reflected by changes in mitochondrial morphology, membrane potential, and glucose flux. This mechanism leads to an additional layer of regulatory complexity, as several glycolytic enzymes are known to be directly regulated by HIF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Semenza1">[40]</xref>. HIF signaling is thus likely to regulate several metabolic pathways in the neonatal heart in parallel. This may lead to an increased degree of metabolic flexibility, as evidenced by the fact that the phenotype of cardiac Hand1 up-regulating neonates is more severe than that of αMHC-Cre::VHL<sup>(fl/fl)</sup> neonates, which are born with relatively normal cardiac morphology and die with cardiac arrhythmia by the second postnatal week <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Neary1">[41]</xref>.</p>
<p>The idea that the same pathways are active in the fetus and adult heart is attractive, as it goes some way towards explaining the basis of the re-expression of the “fetal gene expression programme” seen in heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Taegtmeyer1">[8]</xref>. Perhaps a more accurate term is “hypoxia adaptive gene expression programme.” This is adaptation of the cardiomyocyte to low oxygen via metabolic and contractile gene isoform expression switching, and occurs to preserve oxygen at the expense of ATP production and lower cardiac output, as occurs in persistently Hand1 expressing neonatal hearts. There is evidence that this occurs in healthy humans. Healthy volunteers have been shown to up-regulate cardiac glucose oxidation at altitude <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Chen1">[42]</xref>, and it was recently found that healthy, young volunteers suffered what is essentially a reversible cardiomyopathy involving decreased ATP production and diastolic dysfunction on ascent of Everest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Holloway1">[43]</xref>. Indeed, protection of the mouse heart against ischaemia by etomoxir occurs at the expense of ATP production and decreased lipid oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lopaschuk4">[37]</xref>. Remodeling of energy metabolism may be adaptive in the short term to protect against hypoxia, but is associated with a poor long-term clinical outcome in human heart failure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Neubauer1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Neubauer2">[32]</xref>. Our data showing that Hand1 is not significantly induced by ischaemia in the Langendorff perfused heart suggest that a hypoxia–Hand1 pathway is not involved in the response to acute ischaemia. This pathway seems more likely to be important in the response of the myocardium to chronic or repeated hypoxia/ischaemia. Interestingly, “hibernating” myocardium, whose function is temporarily decreased by repeated hypoxia, has been shown to revert to glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Depre1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Depre2">[45]</xref>.</p>
<p>Our Langendorff perfusion data suggest that the HIF1α/Hand1 pathway may be active in the adult heart. However, this must be regarded as preliminary evidence at the moment. While this assay has proved to be a robust, reproducible assay for ischaemia/reperfusion studies, there are some important caveats when extrapolating Langendorff data to whole-animal physiology. The fact that the heart is removed from the mouse and perfused is clearly a major factor in this. Furthermore, the perfusate substrates contained in the Krebs-Henseleit buffer used in this assay are predominantly crystalloid, and are designed to optimize performance of the isolated heart, rather than to recapitulate physiological conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Bell1">[46]</xref>. The supraphysiological glucose concentrations in the Langendorff perfusate would, in theory, push the hearts towards a more glycolytic metabolism, potentially leading to an underestimate of the effects of Hand1 with respect to ischaemia protection. While it is theoretically possible to gain some measure of cardiac contractile function with a ventricular balloon in the Langendorff assay, we did not measure “cardiac function” in our Langendorff assay. We have argued in the past that such measurements in the Langendorff system are prone to artifact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Bell1">[46]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> models of myocardial infarction will be necessary to investigate formally a role for modulating Hand1 levels in myocardial ischaemia protection. However, we have previously shown that adult Hand1 up-regulating mouse hearts display a diastolic defect without significant systolic dysfunction at steady state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Breckenridge1">[9]</xref>. Studies are now ongoing to investigate formally a potential role for Hand1 in myocardial infarction.</p>
<p>Finally, our finding that Hand1 activity forms part of the regulatory mechanism adapting the fetal heart to intrauterine hypoxia may have clinical relevance. There is a growing body of evidence suggesting that cardiomyocyte lipid metabolism is of importance in determining oxygen consumption and therefore susceptibility to ischaemia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lopaschuk4">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Dyck1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Lopaschuk5">[48]</xref>. It has also been shown that tight control of lipid metabolism is important in modulating oxygen consumption; overexpressing VLDL receptors in transgenic mouse hearts increases mortality following experimental myocardial infarction, presumably by increasing oxygen consumption via increasing lipid substrate presentation to the cardiac mitochondria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001666-Perman1">[49]</xref>. Our data on the cardioprotective effects of Hand1 expression in a model of ischaemia support the idea that therapeutic manipulation of lipid metabolism in ischaemic cardiomyocytes may be beneficial. We hypothesise that therapeutic strategies in cardiac ischaemia and heart failure could be based on the fetal model of hypoxia protection, whereby modulation of metabolic substrate preserves oxygen at the expense of ATP production.</p>
