<abstract>
<p>Post-transcriptional regulation is regarded as one of the major processes involved in the regulation of gene expression. It is mainly performed by RNA binding proteins and microRNAs, which target RNAs and typically affect their stability. Recent efforts from the scientific community have aimed at understanding post-transcriptional regulation at a global scale by using high-throughput sequencing techniques such as cross-linking and immunoprecipitation (CLIP), which facilitates identification of binding sites of these regulatory factors. However, the diversity in the experimental procedures and bioinformatics analyses has hindered the integration of multiple datasets and thus limited the development of an integrated view of post-transcriptional regulation. In this work, we have performed a comprehensive analysis of 107 CLIP datasets from 49 different RBPs in HEK293 cells to shed light on the complex interactions that govern post-transcriptional regulation. By developing a more stringent CLIP analysis pipeline we have discovered the existence of conserved regulatory AU-rich regions in the 3’UTRs where miRNAs and RBPs that regulate several processes such as polyadenylation or mRNA stability bind. Analogous to promoters, many factors have binding sites overlapping or in close proximity in these hotspots and hence the regulation of the mRNA may depend on their relative concentrations. This hypothesis is supported by RBP knockdown experiments that alter the relative concentration of RBPs in the cell. Upon AGO2 knockdown (KD), transcripts containing “free” target sites show increased expression levels compared to those containing target sites in hotspots, which suggests that target sites within hotspots are less available for miRNAs to bind. Interestingly, these hotspots appear enriched in genes with regulatory functions such as DNA binding and RNA binding. Taken together, our results suggest that hotspots are functional regulatory elements that define an extra layer of regulation of post-transcriptional regulatory networks.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>All the cells in a given organism contain the same genome, yet their phenotype can be very diverse. The vast majority of this diversity arises from the differences in the expression of genes and proteins in them. One of the main mechanisms involved in controlling the protein and mRNA repertoire in cells is post-transcriptional regulation. The recent development of high-throughput sequencing techniques gives us now an unprecedented opportunity to investigate how post-transcriptional regulation works and which are the elements involved in defining the final set of mRNAs and proteins inside cells. In this work, we have performed a comprehensive computational analysis of several post-transcriptional regulators in a commonly used human cell line in order to understand which factors are involved in post-transcriptional regulation and how they coordinate their function. The results of our analysis show that this process is orchestrated around small regions in the mRNAs where many regulators bind and may compete with each other to regulate the mRNAs. The investigation and characterization of these regions gives us insight into the underlying combinatorial control that causes gene expression to differ across cell types and in diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Post-transcriptional regulation is the set of mechanisms and processes that control gene expression at the RNA level and affect the properties and the amount of RNA transcribed and translated into proteins. This regulation is performed mainly by RNA binding proteins (RBPs) and miRNAs, which primarily target the 3’ untranslated region (3’UTR) of transcripts. In animals, miRNAs usually function by promoting translational inhibition and decay of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref001">1</xref>]. In contrast, RBPs have a wider range of functions and are often involved in multiple post-transcriptional processes.</p>
<p>Although some miRNAs are predicted to target thousands of mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref002">2</xref>], not all of their predicted targets are down-regulated upon miRNA transfection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref003">3</xref>], and many seem to be regulated only in certain cellular contexts or under stress conditions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref004">4</xref>]. In some cases, miRNAs have even been found to promote translational activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref005">5</xref>] or increase mRNA levels. All these different complex functions suggest that miRNAs and RBPs take part in combinatorial regulation, where the <italic>combination</italic> of factors that bind to an RNA determines its fate.</p>
<p>In humans, more than 1000 RBPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref007">7</xref>] and ~2500 miRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref008">8</xref>] are involved in this complex regulation. MiRNAs are known to act cooperatively to down-regulate mRNAs when bound close in space [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref010">10</xref>]. RBPs can compete for binding to AU-rich elements (AREs) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref011">11</xref>] or cooperate in mRNA regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref013">13</xref>]. Moreover, they can compete and collaborate with miRNAs, or even perform opposite functions in different contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref014">14</xref>]. For instance, AUF1 has been found to both compete with AGO2 for binding to the mRNA and cooperate with it [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref015">15</xref>]. Similarly, HuR has been found to compete with miRNAs for binding [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref017">17</xref>] but also to cooperate with miRNAs both to stabilize and degrade target mRNAs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref019">19</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous studies that aimed to decipher the interactions between miRNAs and RBPs have been focusing either on single genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref024">24</xref>] or on the interactions between a single RBP and miRNAs using cross-linking immunoprecipitation coupled to high-throughput sequencing (CLIP-seq) data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref017">17</xref>], and only recently these interactions have been explored at a transcriptome-wide scale [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref026">26</xref>]. However, the differences across CLIP protocols [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref027">27</xref>] and existing computational tools used to analyze the resulting data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref029">29</xref>] complicates their integration and comparison, which is required for obtaining a picture of their interactions on a global scale. Additionally, CLIP methods typically include a significant amount of noise that can lead to the identification of artifactual binding sites if stringent filtering criteria are not used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>In this work, we reanalyze a comprehensive collection of CLIP experiments from HEK293 cells to shed light on the complex interactions between RBPs and miRNAs. By using a stringent processing pipeline and integrating multiple datasets, we show that post-transcriptional regulators bind preferentially in specific regions of 3’UTRs, i.e. hotspots, where we find enrichment of both RBP and miRNA target sites. These hotspots, rather than being experimental artifacts as previously thought [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>], share characteristics typical of other regulatory regions: high sequence conservation, accessibility, and enrichment in AU-rich elements (AREs). Additionally, our results suggest that they might function by favoring competition among regulators. Upon AGO2 knockdown (KD), we observe that the changes in expression level of transcripts that harbor miRNA target sites within hotspots are significantly different from those of transcripts that contain miRNA target sites outside them, which suggests that RBPs binding in hotspots prevents RISC association. Similar changes are observed when an RBP is knocked down, highlighting that competition for binding may occur not only between miRNAs and RBPs but also among RBPs. Interestingly, these hotspots are enriched in genes with roles in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p>Taken together, these results suggest that post-transcriptional regulation is focused in hotspots within 3’UTRs where several regulators can bind in close proximity and modulate the functions of the regulatory network both at transcriptional and post-transcriptional level.</p>

<p>To investigate the complex interactions between RBPs and miRNAs on a transcriptome-wide scale, we reanalyzed previously published CLIP data for 49 RBPs in HEK293 cells, which correspond to a total of 107 experiments. The list of all the RBPs analyzed along with a brief description from STRING database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref032">32</xref>] can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s003">S1 Table</xref>. An analysis of the functions of these proteins using GO terms revealed that many are involved in similar processes, especially in post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g001">Fig 1a</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s004">S2 Table</xref>).</p>

<p>In order to obtain a set of significant RBP binding sites that can be compared across experiments, all the datasets were reanalyzed using the same pipeline. This pipeline, which has been used previously to identify binding sites from PAR-CLIP and iCLIP datasets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref034">34</xref>], is focused on improving read preprocessing using custom scripts and mapping using BWA-PSSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref035">35</xref>], which allows to model the high mutation rate observed in CLIP data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref037">37</xref>], improving both sensitivity and specificity. Moreover, duplicate removal, which usually is performed to discard reads that map to the same location, was done on the sequence of the reads after low quality and adapter removal at the 3’end. Given the high mutation and indel rate observed in CLIP and PAR-CLIP data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref037">37</xref>], this approach was used in order to keep as many reads that represent RBP binding sites as possible. As expected, a high percentage of the reads confidently mapped from the CLIP datasets contained one or more mutations, especially T to C conversions in PAR-CLIP datasets, which are indicative of crosslinking events (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s011">S1 Fig</xref>). After mapping, significant clusters were identified using Pyicos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref038">38</xref>] (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s001">S1 Appendix</xref>). For many of the RBPs analyzed, most of the clusters were located on 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g001">Fig 1b</xref>), which is consistent with the observation that many of these RBPs are involved in post-transcriptional regulation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s004">S2 Table</xref>). On average, each mRNA expressed in HEK293 is bound by 14 different RBPs in its 3’UTR, and 20% of them are bound by more than half of the RBPs analyzed. A detailed analysis of the distribution of RBP binding sites along 3’UTRs showed that most of them bind preferentially towards the 3’UTR edges, where there is also a higher density of miRNA target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g001">Fig 1c</xref>).To understand if the observed positional bias indicates that the proteins bind in the same regions and therefore interact or compete with each other, we calculated spatial correlations between their cluster enrichments, calculated as the log2 ratio of CLIP over RNA-seq reads (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec011">Materials and Methods</xref>). For each pair of proteins, we calculated the Pearson correlation between CLIP enrichment values for each distance between -200 and 200 nt in each 3’UTR. The correlations calculated for these values were averaged over all 3’UTRs, giving us an average spatial correlation profile for the two RBPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s012">S2 Fig</xref>). These correlations were then compared to those obtained from shuffling the clusters to calculate their z-scores at each position (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). In each row of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g002">Fig 2a</xref>, the z-scores of these spatial correlations are shown for each pair of RBPs. The higher the z-score, the more significant the correlation between two RBPs in a particular position is. In 746 out of 1084 pairwise combinations of RBPs (excluding pairing of an RBP with itself), we observed that the highest positional correlation z-score was in the +/- 9 nt interval. This result reflects that for 69% of all RBP pairs, the most significant positional correlation was observed when the clusters of the two RBPs overlap in the same 3’UTR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g002">Fig 2a</xref>). If we consider only the positional correlations around AGO2 binding sites, this percentage increases to 89%. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g002">Fig 2b</xref>, the strongest positional correlations around AGO2 binding sites were found for other AGO proteins and TNRC6 proteins, which are also part of the RISC complex. Other RBPs display weaker positional correlations with AGO2 although they are highly significant compared to the random expectation.</p>

<title>RBPs preferentially bind on miRNA target sites</title>
<p>The previous analyses demonstrated that RBPs exhibit distinctive binding preferences around AGO2 binding sites. To further evaluate the correlations between RBPs and AGO2, we analyzed the enrichment distribution of their binding sites around predicted target sites of miRNAs expressed in HEK293 cells. 75% of all the target sites from expressed miRNAs in HEK293 were bound by one or more RBPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s005">S3 Table</xref>). As expected, the binding of AGO2 and the other AGO proteins peaked on top of predicted miRNA target sites, especially on target sites of miRNAs highly expressed in HEK293 cells (<italic>hisites</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3a</xref>). To identify proteins that were significantly enriched around miRNA target sites, we computed an empiric p-value by comparing their enrichment around target sites with that around random target sites. Interestingly, a total of 26 out of 47 RBPs analyzed showed a significant enrichment around <italic>hisites</italic> (empiric p-value &lt; 0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s013">S3 Fig</xref>).

In some cases, the enrichment profile of the RBPs peaked on miRNA target sites. In other cases, the enrichment increased across the miRNA target site, e.g. WDR33, or was less dependent on miRNA expression, such as in the case of HuR and EWSR1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s013">S3 Fig</xref>).

<p>To gain insight into why RBPs have a strong positional bias around <italic>hisites</italic>, we calculated the correlation between RBP enrichment on target sites and miRNA expression level, i.e. the sum of expressions of all the miRNA targeting them. Our results show a significant correlation between RBP enrichment on target sites and miRNA expression not only for AGO proteins (AGO1-4), but also for the proteins from the polyadenylation complex CF-Im68 and CPSF-73 and FUS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3c</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s015">S5 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>For each RBP we also calculated the percentage of its clusters that overlap <italic>hisites</italic>. This number ranges from less than 10% to more than 40% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3d</xref>, bars), and usually is less than 5% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3d</xref>, dots). Even though the overlap was small, in most cases the association between clusters and <italic>hisites</italic> was significantly higher than expected by chance (permutation test p-value &lt; 0.01; colored bars and dots). Interestingly, the combined set of all RBPs overlapped more than 77% of <italic>hisites</italic> (75% excluding AGO and TNRC6 proteins), which suggests that the cumulative effects of all RBPs could have a crucial role modulating miRNA function.</p>

<title>PolyA complex RBPs are specifically enriched on distal <italic>hisites</italic></title>
<p>Several components of the polyadenylation complex, including the cleavage factors CF-Im25, CF-Im59 and CF-Im68, showed a strong enrichment on <italic>hisites</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3b</xref>) and an overlap with <italic>hisites</italic> comparable to that of AGO proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3d</xref>). We analyzed their enrichment on <italic>hisites</italic> according to their location on the 3’UTRs. Each 3’UTR was divided in three equally sized regions and <italic>hisites</italic> in these regions were classified according to their location as proximal, medial and distal. Our hypothesis was that if this binding was specific, RBPs from the polyadenylation complex should be more enriched on target sites at the end of the 3’UTR. As expected, we observed a strong enrichment on distal <italic>hisites</italic> for most of these proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Two distinct types of profiles were predominant. The cleavage factors CPSF-160 and Fip1 peaked exactly on the target site region in a similar way to AGO2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3a</xref>), although their enrichment on <italic>hisites</italic> was much lower. Alternatively, CstF-64 and WDR33 displayed a change from low enrichment before the target site to high enrichment after the target site. These two different types of binding profiles around <italic>hisites</italic> may reflect the different kinds of interactions of these RBPs with miRNAs or the miRNA machinery.</p>

<title>RBPs bind in regulatory hotspots containing miRNA target sites and AREs</title>
<p>To evaluate the impact of all RBPs together, we looked at their binding in non-overlapping 50 nt windows across 3’UTRs. In order to discard weak binding sites, we considered only significant clusters with a positive enrichment relative to RNA-seq data. The list of all the windows containing RBP binding sites mapped on them can be found in the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s002">S2 Appendix</xref>. We observed that the windows with more than 3 RBPs binding were more frequent than expected if RBPs would bind independently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s016">S6 Fig</xref>). We also observed that windows containing more RBPs displayed a stronger positional bias towards 3’UTR edges, similar to that of miRNA target sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s017">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>One of the main characteristics of hotspots is that they are more accessible than windows with less RBPs binding on them (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5a</xref> top; spearman correlation coefficient rho 0.14, 0.14 and 0.15 for windows overlapping expressed miRNAs, non-expressed miRNAs and not overlapping miRNAs respectively; p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 in all cases). However, if RBP hotspots are functional regulatory elements in 3’UTRs, we expect them to have some features common to other known functional elements such as a higher conservation relative to its surrounding area. For each of the 50nt windows we measured their average conservation using phyloP scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref039">39</xref>] and their SNP density. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5a</xref>, we observed a significant correlation between the amount of RBPs binding in a window and its average conservation using phyloP scores (rho 0.19, 0.20 and 0.20 for windows overlapping expressed miRNAs, non-expressed miRNAs and not overlapping miRNAs respectively; p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 in all cases). As expected, the conservation on average was higher for hotspots overlapping miRNA target sites, which are often highly conserved across species. Additionally, we observed that the number of RBPs binding in a window had a modest but significant negative correlation with the sum of minor allele frequencies (rho = -0.04, -0.05 and -0.03 for windows overlapping expressed miRNAs, non-expressed miRNAs and not overlapping miRNAs respectively; p-value &lt; 2.2e-16 in all cases). This reflects both a lower frequency of SNPs and that the SNPs in the window are less frequent in the population. Together, these results indicate that RBP hotspots are functional regulatory elements under negative purifying selection.</p>

<p>Considering the dependencies among RBP binding sites, we decided to define hotspots in 3’UTRs as windows containing at least 5 RBPs. Some examples of RBP binding in 3’UTR hotspots can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s018">S8 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s019">S9 Fig</xref>. Using this definition, approximately 4% of all windows are classified as hotspots, whereas 56% of them are not bound by any RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5b</xref>). We noticed that the number of RBPs binding in a window is positively correlated with U-content (r = 0.21, p-value &lt; 2.2e-16) and negatively correlated with G-content (r = -0.2; p-value &lt; 2.2e-16) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s020">S10 Fig</xref>). Additionally, windows targeted by several RBPs have much higher sequence accessibility, measured as the probability that at least 20 consecutive nucleotides are unpaired (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). This result is consistent with the fact that hotspots are more accessible regions, which favors the binding of multiple RBPs.</p>
<p>We used cWords [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref040">40</xref>] to identify motifs enriched in hotspots. We identified several AREs, including UAUUUAU, among the top 20 ranked words enriched both in hotspots and in conserved regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). The core ARE element AUUUA was enriched in hotspots as well, although its frequency does not increase linearly with hotspot size (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s020">S10 Fig</xref>). We also noticed that the words enriched in hotspots overlapping miRNA target sites are very similar to those found in all hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5d</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s006">S4 Table</xref>).

<title>RBP hotspots are not CLIP artifacts</title>
<p>A previous study concluded that many regions found to be targeted by several different RBPs in CLIP-seq experiments are artifacts caused by biases in the experimental technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>]. To understand if the hotspots are a result of CLIP background, we investigated the overlap between the hotspot regions identified here and a set of binding sites obtained from a GFP PAR-CLIP experiment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>]. This experiment contained 3 datasets belonging to protein-RNA complexes with different molecular weight, which we analyzed using the same pipeline described before and pooled together. We identified 11323 significant GFP binding sites, i.e. background clusters. It has to be noted that our mapping pipeline discarded most of the data as insignificant, which is consistent with the expectation that there should be very few genuine binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s007">S5 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>The center of the significant background clusters with positive enrichment over RNA-seq were extracted and overlapped with the previously identified windows in 3’UTRs. 7% of background clusters (837 sites) overlapped with previously identified hotspots containing 5 or more RBPs. Thus, only 5% of hotspots overlapped background clusters. To validate that these background clusters were not biasing the results, we discarded all the windows containing GFP sites and repeated the analysis in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5</xref>. This filtered dataset recapitulated the results obtained previously (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s021">S11 Fig</xref>).

<title>RBP binding in hotspots influences mRNA stability</title>
<p>We have observed that hotspots are more conserved, more accessible, and enriched by miRNA target sites and AREs, including UAUUUAU, which has been associated with stronger miRNA effect and mRNA stabilizing effect [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref041">41</xref>]. Hence, we set out to assess the effect of RBP hotspots on <italic>hisites</italic> using previously published AGO2 KD microarray data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref042">42</xref>]. For each transcript, we defined a new set of 50 nt windows centered on <italic>hisites</italic> and measured the effect of the presence of a hotspot (excluding AGO2 when defining the hotspots) overlapping 1, or 2 or more <italic>hisites</italic> in a transcript upon AGO2 KD. As a control, we used two sets of transcripts, one where all the <italic>hisites</italic> were in windows containing 2 or less RBPs and another one in which transcripts contained no <italic>hisites</italic> at all. By calculating the cumulative fractions of fold expression changes of transcripts upon AGO2 KD, we found that the presence of a hotspot overlapping <italic>hisites</italic> in a transcript prevents its upregulation upon AGO2 KD (two tailed KS test p-value = 0.0017 and 6.9e-08 for 1 and 2 or more target sites blocked compared to genes without hotspots on <italic>hisites</italic> respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g006">Fig 6a</xref>).

<p>Additionally, we explored the function of hotspots overlapping the binding sites of other RBPs using published KD data. Similarly to the previous analysis, we defined hotspots centered on significant HuR clusters identified with CLIP data and measured the effect of the presence of a hotspot (without considering HuR) overlapping 1, or 2 or more HuR binding sites upon HuR KD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref016">16</xref>]. As a control, we used transcripts where all the HuR binding sites were located in windows containing 2 or less RBPs (not counting HuR), or not bound by HuR. As expected, upon HuR KD, transcripts containing HuR binding sites show lower expression compared to transcripts not bound by HuR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g006">Fig 6b</xref>, two-tailed KS test p-value &lt; 0.001 for transcripts with 1 and 2 or more HuR sites blocked compared to genes without hotspots on HuR sites). We also observed a small but significant difference between transcripts containing hotspots overlapping HuR binding sites and those that do not have them (KS test p-value &lt; 0.001 in both cases). In this case, transcripts containing HuR sites overlapping hotspots show a decreased expression upon HuR KD than transcripts containing HuR sites outside hotspots. This result suggests that upon HuR KD other RBPs with a negative effect on mRNA stability bind in those locations and thus promote mRNA downregulation. Accordingly, we found that 55% of the hotspots overlapping HuR sites contained AGO proteins, TNRC6 proteins, AUF1 or TTP, which are all known to be involved in promoting mRNA decay. Similar results were observed when analyzing the effect of hotspots overlapping AUF1 and TTP binding sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s023">S13 Fig</xref>). Taken together, these results show that changing RBP concentration within cells may affect their binding on mRNAs and modify their post-transcriptional regulation.</p>

<title>RBP hotspots define a post-transcriptional regulatory network</title>
<p>In order to understand the biological function of RBP hotspots transcriptome-wide, we sought to characterize the transcripts containing hotspots. Transcripts with hotspots possess some features that suggest that they are under strong post-transcriptional regulation, as they have longer 3’UTRs (spearman correlation coefficient rho = 0.17; p-value = 1.2 e-60) while keeping approximately the same density of miRNA target sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s024">S14 Fig</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this work, we have reanalyzed a comprehensive collection of high-throughput CLIP experiments in HEK293 cells in order to better understand the complex interactions between RBPs and miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation. Our results show that RBPs and miRNAs often bind in the same regions within 3’UTRs, which suggest that they function as regulatory hotspots that facilitate competition between the regulators. We show that these hotspots function in an analogous manner to promoter regions in accessible chromatin regions, and the RNA fate depends on which of the regulators bind to the mRNA. In turn, this regulation would also depend on external cues or post-translational modifications that modulate the relative concentration of these factors or their affinity to mRNA. Interestingly, RBP hotspots are enriched in transcripts involved in transcriptional and post-transcriptional regulation, such as RNA binding proteins, splicing factors, transcription factors and translation factors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s025">S15 Fig</xref>), thus suggesting that these regulatory hotspots play a role in auto-regulatory networks of regulators previously reviewed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref044">44</xref>]. This result is also in agreement with recent findings that show that RNPs tend to regulate the mRNAs of other RNPs and themselves thus creating auto-regulatory networks in <italic>Drosophila</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref045">45</xref>].</p>
<p>We have used positional correlations to assess the interactions between RBPs assuming that RBPs that bind in the same location may interact. Surprisingly, we found that most RBPs (69% of all RBP pairs analyzed) tend to have overlapping binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g002">Fig 2a</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s012">S2 Fig</xref>). Using this approach we confirmed some known positional correlations, such as those among polyA complex proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref046">46</xref>], the IMP and the AGO proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref036">36</xref>], the FET family proteins (TAF15, FUS, EWSR1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref047">47</xref>], and the snoRNA processing proteins FBP, NOP56 and NOP58 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref048">48</xref>]. Moreover, we found correlations that were previously unknown. Some of these can be explained by the similarity in binding motifs, such as those among HuR, TTP and AUF1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref016">16</xref>]. However, the consistent correlation of all the RBPs analyzed with AGO2 had not been previously described in literature. Additionally, the finding that many of these RBPs are also enriched on <italic>hisites</italic> further supports the positional correlations. It has to be noted that these miRNA target site predictions are independent of the CLIP data [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref049">49</xref>], which speaks against these overlaps being an artifact of the CLIP protocol.</p>
<p>One intriguing question is why the RBPs bind on miRNA target sites. If RISC directly interacts at miRNA target sites with a particular RBP, it would be expected that CLIP enrichment covaries with the expression of the miRNA that targets it. Yet, in most cases we did not find a clear correlation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s015">S5 Fig</xref>) and thereby direct interaction is probably not the general mechanism to explain RBP enrichment at miRNA target sites. Nevertheless, we found a positive correlation for several proteins from the polyadenylation complex although it is only significant for CPSF-73 and CF-Im68 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g003">Fig 3c</xref>). We found that many proteins from the polyA complex bind at <italic>hisites</italic>. As expected, we observed a stronger enrichment of the RBPs from the polyA complex on distal <italic>hisites</italic> compared to proximal or medial (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g004">Fig 4</xref>). Interestingly, we observed two clearly different types of binding profiles around <italic>hisites</italic>: one for the cleavage factors, Fip1 and CPSF-160, which show a strong enrichment specifically on distal <italic>hisites</italic>; and another one for WDR33 and CstF-64, which show an increase in the enrichment specifically after <italic>hisites</italic>. Our data merely shows that miRNAs and the RBPs from the polyA complex bind in the same location, which is likely the result of the presence of both sets of regulators in hotspot regions, which are more accessible, and thus preferred for both purposes. One may speculate that the strong enrichment of polyA complex RBPs on <italic>hisites</italic> could indicate some kind of functional interaction between these two pathways. However, the nature of these interactions cannot be explored using computational methods and additional experiments would be required to investigate it.</p>
<p>We have also shown that RBP binding sites cluster in regulatory hotspots in 3’UTRs. These hotspots are more frequent than expected if RBPs would bind independently (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s016">S6 Fig</xref>) and are significantly enriched on predicted miRNA target sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5b</xref>). Furthermore, they are AU-rich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s020">S10 Fig</xref>) and contain AREs, which are both more conserved and overrepresented (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5c</xref>). AREs and AU-rich context of miRNA targets have previously been associated with effective miRNA target sites [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref041">41</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref050">50</xref>] and are known to be targeted by many RBPs both with stabilizing and destabilizing functions. These results, together with the high accessibility of the RBP hotspots, could explain the large number of RBPs binding in the regions and their role as regulatory elements in 3’UTRs. It has to be noted that several of the RBPs analyzed in this paper are known to bind A-, U- or AU-rich motifs. Some of these RBPs, such as HuR, TTP and AUF1, can bind AREs. However, many others bind completely different motifs, such as the RBPs from the FET family, which bind AU-rich stem loops, and the proteins from the polyadenylation complex among others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref036">36</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref051">51</xref>]. Besides, CLIP crosslinking introduces a U-bias, either by the use of UV-C radiation in HITS-CLIP and iCLIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref052">52</xref>] or by the incorporation of 4-thiouridine in the RNA to cross-link the RBPs in PAR-CLIP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref036">36</xref>]. These two factors may explain a part of the U-richness observed in the hotspots, as shown by a sequence composition analysis of the significant clusters in 3’UTRs of the individual RBPs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s026">S16 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Finally, we have shown that RBP hotspots regulate miRNA target site accessibility and could favor the competition between miRNAs and RBPs in 3’UTRs. Upon AGO2 KD, transcripts containing miRNA target sites in hotspots do not show significant increased expression levels, which suggests that these target sites were protected by RBPs binding in the same hotspots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g006">Fig 6a</xref>). Interestingly, the opposite effect was found upon KD of HuR, AUF1 and TTP. Upon KD of these RBPs, transcripts containing their binding sites in hotspots show a stronger reduction in expression levels than those that have their binding sites isolated. A high fraction of those hotspots contain AGO2 or other down regulatory RBPs, which suggests that by removing the RBPs, other ones bind and affect mRNA stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g006">Fig 6b</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s023">S13 Fig</xref>). These results are in agreement with recently reported findings that show that the presence of RBP binding sites of overlapping PUM1/2 or HuR binding sites reduce their impact on mRNA stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>A previous study concluded that many regions found to be targeted by several different RBPs in CLIP-seq experiments are artifacts caused by biases in the experimental technique [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>]. As a result, these regions have been excluded from previous works analyzing the combined effect of RBPs and miRNAs in post-transcriptional regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref026">26</xref>]. In our analysis, we observed that the number of RBPs that target a hotspot weakly correlates with mRNA expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s024">S14 Fig</xref>) regardless of the use of mFDR and RNA-seq normalization of CLIP data. This bias probably hinders the identification of hotspots in lowly expressed genes, but it is unlikely that this is the reason why we observe hotspots in 3’UTRs. To validate that these regions are truly regulatory elements, we have analyzed the 3 GFP PAR-CLIP experiments used to identify CLIP artifacts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>] and studied their overlap with hotspots. Using our pipeline, only 2% and 9% of the original GFP libraries can be confidently mapped to the genome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s007">S5 Table</xref>). These results confirm the stringency of our pipeline and give extra evidence that the processing pipeline discards most of the spurious CLIP binding artifacts. Besides, additional analyses of this dataset further support that the identified regulatory hotspots are not the result of background CLIP binding sites. Firstly, it was described that background reads, i.e. the reads that appear in multiple datasets derived from a CLIP experiment of a protein that does not bind RNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>], are G-rich. In contrast, our RBP hotspots are characterized by a general G-depletion and are AU-rich (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s020">S10 Fig</xref>). Secondly, the CLIP enrichment of RBPs is in most cases not different inside or outside hotpot regions. If CLIP binding in hotspot regions would be spurious, we would expect a consistently lower CLIP enrichment of all RBPs in these regions. However, for many of the RBPs analyzed the number of RBPs in a window does not affect the distribution of their enrichment values (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s027">S17 Fig</xref>). Thirdly, the regulatory hotspots that we identify are experiencing increased selective pressure, as shown by the higher PhyloP scores and lower SNP frequencies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g005">Fig 5a</xref>). The correlation between conservation and number of RBPs in a window is observed for all windows regardless of their overlap with miRNA target sites, which indicates that the increased selective pressure happens due to the preservation of binding sites for more RBPs. Moreover, it supports the conclusion that these regions are indeed functional regulatory elements. Fourthly, we show that hotspots more often coincide with miRNA target sites, which are independent of CLIP-seq data. In conjunction, we see a significant functional effect of hotspots in the regulation of sequence accessibility both using KD data from AGO2 and other RBPs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g006">Fig 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s023">S13 Fig</xref>). Taken together, we believe that our stringent pipeline for the processing of the datasets, which includes duplicate removal, quality score aware mapping of reads, peak calling of clusters in transcripts, and normalization by gene expression, removes or diminishes the importance of most of the reads that were shown to result in background when a less stringent data pipeline was used [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref030">30</xref>] and thus allow us to identify truly regulatory regions targeted by several RBPs. Accordingly, only 5% of our regulatory hotspots, i.e. windows containing 5 or more different RBPs, overlap background sites identified by analyzing the GFP CLIP sites identified with our pipeline. Removal of these windows from our dataset did not alter the characteristics of the identified hotspots (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s021">S11 Fig</xref>), which confirms our observation that RBP hotspots are not CLIP artifacts.</p>
<p>Many studies have previously investigated the interaction between miRNAs and RBPs using both experimental and computational methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref053">53</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref054">54</xref>]. Both competition and collaboration between miRNAs and RBPs have been described, but these interactions have been often portrayed as isolated events rather than a general mechanism in post-transcriptional regulation. In this work, we have shown that the overlap between miRNA target sites and RBPs is very extensive, with more than 75% of all <italic>hisites</italic> targeted by one or more of the RBPs analyzed (excluding AGO and TNRC6 proteins), thus suggesting that RBP hotspots play a major role in miRNA regulation and post-transcriptional regulation.</p>
<p>Taken together, our analyses suggest that post-transcriptional regulation often happens in hotspots where several trans-acting factors bind and may compete and cooperate for regulating mRNAs. This organization thus facilitates fast changes on mRNA expression induced as a response to external cues and facilitate cell adaptation to environment changes.</p>

<title>Mapping and processing of CLIP and RNA-seq datasets</title>
<p>110 CLIP (including CLIP-seq and PAR-CLIP) and 3 RNA-seq datasets were downloaded from GEO database [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref055">55</xref>]. The Sequence Read Archive (SRA) accession numbers of all the datasets analyzed can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s007">S5 Table</xref>.</p>
<p>Reads from all the experiments were preprocessed using custom python scripts. First, reads were trimmed to remove low quality scores and 3’ adapter sequences (only CLIP datasets). Next, we removed duplicates by collapsing all identical reads. This step was performed instead of collapsing reads that map to identical locations to keep fragments that contain different mutations as a result of cross-linking and that represent true crosslink events that otherwise would be discarded. After these steps, all reads longer than 19 nucleotides were further analyzed. This minimum length was set to minimize the amount of incorrectly mapped reads that could come from contamination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref056">56</xref>]. Reads were mapped to the human genome (hg19) using BWA-PSSM with parameters -n 0.04 -l 1024 -m 400 -P 0.5 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref035">35</xref>].

Only reads mapped at any of the steps with a posterior probability &gt; 0.99 were considered for further analysis. For PAR-CLIP datasets, we used a custom matrix for scoring T to C mismatches assuming a 12.5% T to C conversion rate.</p>
<p>Datasets for the same proteins were joined into a single dataset and analyzed together. Additionally, we also pooled the datasets of CstF-64 and CstF-64τ and FXR1 and FXR2. Reads were clustered according to their genomic positions, requiring that at least 1 nucleotide overlap. Significant clusters were calculated using Pyicos [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref038">38</xref>], using the exons from the longest protein coding transcript for calculating the randomizations. Only clusters with a false discovery rate (FDR) &lt; 0.01 were considered for further analysis. The RNA-seq datasets were also joined and used together in further experiments.

<title>Selection of miRNA target sites</title>
<p>Good miRNA target site predictions for conserved and non-conserved miRNAs were downloaded from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://microRNA.org" xlink:type="simple">microRNA.org</ext-link> (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.microRNA.org" xlink:type="simple">http://www.microRNA.org</ext-link>; August 2010 release) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref049">49</xref>]. From this set, we selected only target sites containing at least a 6-mer seed site, and selected targets that belonged to miRNAs expressed in HEK293.</p>
<p>We used small RNA-seq data (GSM1279922) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref060">60</xref>] to estimate the expression levels of each miRNA. First, we selected from the dataset reads that were 15-27nt long, which corresponds to the length range of mature miRNAs. Next, we mapped the RNA-seq to a set of non-redundant human miRNA sequences downloaded from miRBase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref008">8</xref>] using BWA-PSSM [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref035">35</xref>]. The expression of each miRNA was defined as the number of reads mapping to its mature miRNA sequence. We defined as expressed miRNAs only the top 20% of the mature miRNAs (155 miRNAs; minimum amount of mapped reads mapped 367). All the other miRNAs not included in this set are regarded as non-expressed miRNAs in HEK293 cells.</p>
<p>For each of the target sites, we selected the set of targets that overlapped Ensembl70 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref057">57</xref>] transcripts expressed in HEK293 cells and defined a set of non-overlapping target sites. To define which target sites to keep, we overlapped the seed sites of their target sites and kept the one targeted by the most highly expressed miRNA. If several miRNAs shared the target site, we added their expression. Finally, we kept only target sites that contained a 6-mer seed site in the selected transcript. The number of target sites kept at each step of the processing is summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s009">S7 Table</xref>.</p>

<title>Random miRNA target sites</title>
<p>To measure the significance of our results, we created 100 random sets of miRNA target sites containing as many target sites as the original set preserving their distribution along 3’UTRs. We divided the set of expressed genes with predicted miRNA target sites into 30 equal size groups with similar 3’UTR lengths. Then, for each target site in a particular 3’UTR, we assigned it to another of the 3’UTRs in the set. In case that the length of the new 3’UTR was different from that of the original 3’UTR, the relative coordinates of the target site were calculated so that it would have the same relative position within the 3’UTR in relation to its length. This procedure preserved the characteristic positional distribution of miRNA target sites along 3’UTRs.</p>

If the value at position <italic>i</italic> is called <italic>x</italic><sub><italic>i</italic></sub> for one RBP and <italic>y</italic><sub><italic>i</italic>+<italic>d</italic></sub> for the other RBP binding a distance <italic>d</italic> from the first, the Pearson correlation was calculated with fixed <italic>d</italic> over all positions <italic>i</italic>, in the interval from 1 to <italic>l</italic> − <italic>d</italic>, where <italic>l</italic> is the length of the 3’UTR (for negative <italic>d</italic>, the interval is from 1 − <italic>d</italic> to <italic>l</italic>). This was done for all values of <italic>d</italic> from -200 to 200. For each <italic>d</italic>, the correlation values were averaged over 3’UTRs. UTRs shorter than 400 nt were discarded.</p>
<p>The fluctuations of the correlation coefficients are heavily dependent on the number of CLIP sites. To estimate the background distribution, we shuffled the CLIP data in a way that preserved the clustering of tags. Clusters were defined as contiguous regions in which the enrichment value was above 10<sup>−6</sup>. The clusters identified in a sequence were moved to a random location in the sequence while ensuring at least one position in between clusters. After shuffling all sequences, positional correlations were calculated as above. This was repeated 100 times and for each <italic>d</italic>, and the mean and standard deviation of the 100 values obtained in the shufflings were calculated. Using these estimates, the z-score was calculated for the unshuffled data. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g002">Fig 2a</xref>, the distribution of all z-scores calculated was considered and divided in 1000 quantiles. Each quantile was assigned a color from the scale, ranging from dark blue to red as shown. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1005460.g002">Fig 2b</xref>, z-scores were row-normalized and assigned a color using the same procedure as described above.</p>

<title>Hotspot identification</title>
<p>To identify hotspots we divided the 3’UTRs of expressed genes (at least 50% RNA-seq coverage in the 3’UTR of the longest protein-coding transcript) in non-overlapping windows of 50 nt. We overlapped the center of the RBP CLIP significant clusters with them and assigned each cluster to a single window. Only clusters with a positive enrichment over RNA-seq were considered. We also uniquely assigned each miRNA target site of expressed miRNAs in HEK293 cells to a window if the overlap between the seed site and the window was bigger than 5. Otherwise, the miRNA target sites were discarded.</p>

<title>Simulation of RBP binding site distribution on hotspots</title>
<p>We simulated 10000 times the distribution of hotspot sizes by randomly sampling the binding location of the proteins assuming a uniform distribution of the RBPs in them. We considered the total amount of windows in which we observe significant clusters of each RBP and the total amount of windows in 3’UTRs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s009">S7 Table</xref>). The size distribution of hotspots from simulated and real data can be seen in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1005460.s016">S6 Fig</xref>.</p>

<title>Analysis of hotspot conservation</title>
<p>PhyloP scores [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref039">39</xref>] calculated from 100 vertebrate genome alignments (including hg19 human genome assembly) were downloaded from UCSC genome browser.

<title>Motif analysis</title>
<p>Word enrichment analyses were done using cWords [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref040">40</xref>]. The input data sets were made using the 3’UTR window data described above. For each window, we extracted its sequence and associated it to the number of RBPs binding in it. Using this method we defined two datasets: one containing all windows and another one containing only those overlapping target sites for expressed miRNAs.</p>
<p>In the first analysis, windows were ranked using the amount of RBPs binding in them. Thus, the resulting words were differentially enriched in windows according to the number of RBPs binding in them. In the second analysis, we ranked the windows using their mean phyloP score.</p>

<title>RNA secondary structure accessibility of 3’UTR windows</title>
<p>We used RNAplFold [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1005460.ref062">62</xref>] to calculated the sequence accessibility of the 3’UTRs. Specifically, we predicted the probability that 20 contiguous nucleotides in the sequence are unpaired using the parameters -u 20 -L 40 -W 120. The obtained accessibility values were then mapped to the 3’UTR windows and averaged across windows with the same number of RBPs binding and across windows with the same number of RBPs that overlap miRNA target sites.</p>

<title>Cumulative fraction plots</title>
<p>We defined 50 nt windows around <italic>hisites</italic> (35 nt upstream of the target site 3’ end, 14 nt downstream of the target site 3’end). If the windows extended beyond transcript boundaries, we shrank them so that they would fit inside the transcript. In each of these windows, we checked the presence or absence of each of the RBPs.</p>
<p>For each transcript we measured the amount of <italic>hisites</italic> that would be free, i.e. 2 or less RBPs (excluding AGO2) would bind in the window around the <italic>hisite</italic>, and the amount of hisites that would be blocked, i.e. 5 or more RBPs (excluding AGO2) would bind in the window around them. We used these measurements to divide the genes according to the amount of free or blocked <italic>hisites</italic> they contained in 3 groups: 0, where all target sites are free; 1, where only 1 target site was blocked; 2 or more, where 2 or more target sites were blocked. As an additional control, we added the rest of genes containing no <italic>hisites</italic>.</p>
<p>For cumulative fraction plots centered on RBP binding sites, we defined 50 nt windows centered around the binding sites of the RBP of interest. The groups of transcripts used to evaluate the role of hotspots on RBP binding sites were built in an analogous manner to the one described above.</p>
