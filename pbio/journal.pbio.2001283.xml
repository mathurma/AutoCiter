<abstract>
<p>Rat somatosensory cortex contains a large sexually monomorphic genital representation. Genital cortex undergoes an unusual 2-fold expansion during puberty. Here, we investigate genital cortex development and female rat sexual maturation. Ovariectomies and estradiol injections suggested sex hormones cause the pubertal genital cortex expansion but not its maintenance at adult size. Genital cortex expanded by thalamic afferents invading surrounding dysgranular cortex. Genital touch was a dominant factor driving female sexual maturation. Raising female rats in contact with adult males promoted genital cortex expansion, whereas contact to adult females or nontactile (audio-visual-olfactory) male cues did not. Genital touch imposed by human experimenters powerfully advanced female genital cortex development and sexual maturation. Long-term blocking of genital cortex by tetrodotoxin in pubescent females housed with males prevented genital cortex expansion and decelerated vaginal opening. Sex hormones, sexual experience, and neural activity shape genital cortex, which contributes to the puberty promoting effects of sexual touch.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>We recently identified the somatosensory representation of rat genitals; remarkably, this cortical region—genital cortex—is sexually monomorphic, despite the marked sexual dimorphism of external genitals in rats. Most intriguing was the observation that genital cortex doubles in size during puberty. In order to shed light on this unusual expansion, we studied genital cortex development and sexual maturation in the female rat. We first showed that sex hormones are likely to cause the pubertal expansion of genital cortex. Next, we examined whether sexual experience affects the development of female genital cortex. Raising females together with adult males advanced genital cortex expansion, but cohousing with adult females or exposure to nontactile male cues was not sufficient to drive genital cortex growth. Surprisingly, artificial genital touch led to an early onset of female puberty and growth of genital cortex. In line with this finding, we find that if genital cortex activity is blocked, the advancing effects of adult males on puberty and genital cortex growth are inhibited. Together, our results point to an important role of genital cortex in the puberty-promoting effects of sexual touch.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Early analysis of the development of visual cortex by Hubel and Wiesel focused on binocular interactions and showed that both anatomy and physiology of ocular dominance is plastic and shaped in a visually-driven, activity-dependent process [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref001">1</xref>]. In a similar vein, the development of circuits in the somatosensory cortex (S1) was studied. It was recognized early on that precise topographic (barrel) representation of the whisker pattern in cortical input layer 4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref002">2</xref>] is imposed by peripheral inputs and has an early and brief critical period, after which it can no longer be changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref003">3</xref>]. Subsequent work identified neurogenetic mechanisms of cortical pattern formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref004">4</xref>]. With few exceptions, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref005">5</xref>] most of the work provided little evidence for neural activity dependent processes in the development of S1. From work on the barrel cortex a consensus emerged that cortical input layer 4 has an earlier critical period and shows less plasticity than other cortical layers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref006">6</xref>]. In the light of aforementioned results, the recently described developmental pattern of cortical input layer 4 of genital S1 was very surprising. Specifically, layer 4 of rat genital cortex showed a major expansion during puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref007">7</xref>]. We wondered if this very late development of genital cortex has implications for the role of activity in cortical development and might even allow early sexual experience to impact on cortical development.</p>
<p>We were also interested in the relationship between somatosensory genital cortex development and female sexual maturation. In rodents, puberty has been intensely studied and much is known about changes in subcortical structures, such as the hypothalamus, that are associated with puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref008">8</xref>]; there is, however, virtually no information available about changes in cortical circuits during puberty. A host of studies in a wide variety of species came to the conclusion that sexual maturation is not a purely age-dependent process but is also under social control. In mice, studies on female sexual development showed puberty advancing effects of male (primer) pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref009">9</xref>] and puberty delaying effects of adult female pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref010">10</xref>]. Most of the research on the social control of puberty has focused on pheromones [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref010">10</xref>] and identified the vomeronasal organ as key mediator of such effects in mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref011">11</xref>]. There is also evidence, however, that tactile interactions and sexual touch can powerfully influence sexual development. For example, the extreme reproductive suppression in the eusocial mole rat appears to be mediated by tactile rather than olfactory cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref012">12</xref>]. In a landmark study on mice, Bronson and Maruniak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref013">13</xref>] showed that the puberty advancing effects of male pheromones alone are small. Bronson and Maruniak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref013">13</xref>] suggested that the advance in female puberty caused by adult males results from a synergistic interaction of pheromones and tactile stimulation; Bronson and Maruniak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref013">13</xref>] also ruled out a role of visual and auditory cues. The underlying neural mechanisms and pathways mediating male touch induced advance of female puberty are still unknown.</p>
<p>In primates, the evidence for pheromonal effects on puberty is rather mixed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref014">14</xref>]. Sexual touch, on the other hand, is strictly regulated in most human cultures and this is particularly true during development. It has also become painfully clear that sexual abuse and inappropriate sexual contact during development have long-lasting detrimental consequences [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref016">16</xref>]. Presumably the long-lasting problems from inappropriate sexual contact during development reflect brain changes resulting from sexual experience. Remarkably, structural brain imaging in humans with a history of sexual abuse identified a thinning of putative human genital cortex, as a cortical consequence of childhood sexual abuse [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref017">17</xref>].</p>
<p>Here we ask the following questions: (1) Are sex hormones required for the pubertal expansion of female genital cortex? (2) What are the structural events underlying genital map changes? (3) Does sexual experience affect the development of female genital cortex? (4) Does activity in female genital cortex affect female puberty and does it mediate the female puberty advancing effects of male sexual touch?</p>

<title>Pubertal expansion, but not maintenance of an adult size genital cortex, requires sex hormones</title>
<p>As a first step in our analysis we performed additional experiments to confirm our recently reported data on the growth of genital cortex during puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref007">7</xref>]. To this end we analyzed the layer 4 cortical input maps in the S1 of 6 young (approximate postnatal day [P] 21) and 7 old (approximately P42) female rats. Specifically, we performed cytochrome oxidase staining, which reveals granular layer 4 regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s001">S1A–S1D Fig</xref>). We confirmed our earlier conclusions: whereas the clitoris representation in young prepubescent animals was rather small (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1A</xref>), it appears to be twice as big in adult animals (P42, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1B and 1E</xref>; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Student <italic>t</italic> test). In contrast, the size of the entire S1 did not differ significantly between young and old females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1G</xref>; <italic>P</italic> = 0.3, Student <italic>t</italic> test).</p>

<p>Next, we examined whether sex hormones play a role during the pubertal expansion of genital cortex. Hence, we ovariectomized females before (at P21) and after puberty (at P42). Twenty days after the ovariectomy animals were killed, brains were removed and tangential sections through the S1 were prepared and stained for cytochrome oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). We obtained detailed anatomical maps of layer 4 from 7 prepubertal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) and 6 postpubertal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) ovariectomized females. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1C</xref> shows a drawing of a complete S1 (thick outline) body map of a female aged P42, in which we removed the ovaries before puberty (at P21). The size of the cortical clitoris representation is small and comparable to the one of the young female, as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1A</xref>. The somatosensory cortical map obtained from a female rat ovariectomized after puberty at P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) allows 2 observations: (1) the clitoris representation is much larger than the one of the female rat ovariectomized before puberty; (2) the size of the genital cortex is comparable to the genital cortex size of an adult female (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). The population data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1E</xref>) suggest the same conclusions. The clitoris representation in females ovariectomized before puberty (mean genital cortex of S1 1.07% ± 0.09) was comparable to young females (1.07% ± 0.06) but significantly (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.01, Student <italic>t</italic> test) smaller than the genital cortex size in animals, which were ovariectomized after puberty (1.6% ± 0.15; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Comparison of the genital cortex to the posteromedial barrel subfield (PMBSF), instead of the whole S1, led to the same results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s002">S2A–S2C Fig</xref>) with no difference in the variability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s006">S1 Table</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that sex hormones are required for the pubertal expansion of female genital cortex but not for the maintenance of an adult size female genital cortex.</p>

<title>Systemic estrogen treatment accelerates genital cortex growth and advances female puberty</title>
<p>A strong impact of sex hormones on the onset of puberty has been reported using systemic estradiol injections during prepuberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref018">18</xref>]. We wondered to what extent systemic estrogen treatment can accelerate genital cortex growth. Female rats enter puberty typically at the age of P34 to P38 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref019">19</xref>]. On that account and based on the study by Ramirez and Sawyer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref018">18</xref>], we chose to treat females aged P26 for 5 days with estrogen and to test a possible effect on genital cortex at P30. Prepubescent females (P26) were injected over 5 days with either in sesame oil dissolved estradiol (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">Fig 2A</xref>, upper panel; <italic>n</italic> = 7 animals; 0.05μg estradiol, dissolved in 0.4 ml of sesame oil, per 100 g body weight) or with sesame oil alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">Fig 2B</xref>, upper panel; <italic>n</italic> = 7 animals; 0.4 ml of sesame oil, per 100 g body weight). During the fifth day of treatment animals were killed and cortical hemispheres were flattened, tangentially sectioned and processed for cytochrome oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s003">S3A and S3B Fig</xref>). In order to obtain cortical body maps, granular somatosensory regions were reconstructed through serial sections. To exclude experimenter biases cortical maps were drawn and analyzed by an experimenter blind to the condition estradiol versus oil treated animals.</p>

<p>We also assessed parameters indicative of sexual maturation and the onset of puberty. Thus, we evaluated vaginal opening (an open vagina is typically seen in females, which have entered puberty, [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref018">18</xref>]) and the weight of the uterus, which is heavier in females after puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref018">18</xref>]. Accordingly, we documented vaginal opening before, during and after the daily injections. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">Fig 2F</xref>, 2 photographs show the clitoris and vagina of an oil treated female before the beginning of daily injections (P25, upper panel) and afterwards (P30, lower panel). Vagina and clitoris for an estrogen treated animal are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, respectively. Whereas the vagina of the oil treated female was still closed at P30, the estradiol injected animal shows an open vagina at this stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">Fig 2G</xref>, lower panel), indicating that the onset of puberty took place. To quantify vaginal opening, we gave the following scores for every vaginal opening stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">Fig 2H</xref>): a score of 0 points to a closed vagina, whereas a score of 1 indicates an open vagina. A score of 0.5 represents the intermediate state, during which the vagina was about to open. The majority of oil treated females (6 out of 7) showed a closed vagina at P30, whereas most of the estrogen injected animals displayed an open vagina (6 out of 7; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Mann–Whitney U test). We also removed and weighed the uteri. On average, the oil-treated animals had lighter uteri (0.15g ± 0.07, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">Fig 2I</xref>) compared to animals, which received daily estradiol injections (0.29g ± 0.08), but this difference did not reach significance (<italic>P</italic> = 0.08, Student <italic>t</italic> test). Taken together these data suggest that systemic estradiol accelerates genital cortex growth and advances the onset of puberty.</p>

<title>Genital cortex growth is due to the invasion of dysgranular cortex by putative genital thalamic afferents</title>
<p>Which cellular changes underlie the unusual genital cortex expansion during puberty? To answer this question, we first stained alternating tangential sections of flattened cortices for cytochrome oxidase activity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s004">S4A Fig</xref>) and with vesicular glutamate transporter 2 (VGluT2) antibodies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s004">S4B Fig</xref>). While cytochrome oxidase reports constitutive layer 4 metabolic activity, VGluT2 is expressed in thalamocortical terminals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref020">20</xref>] and, hence, labels thalamic afferents. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s004">S4A Fig</xref> (upper panel) shows a tangential section through S1 of a young animal (P14) stained for cytochrome oxidase activity and in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s004">S4B Fig</xref> (upper panel) the subsequent section is shown labeled for VGluT2. The labeled structures have the same layout and size, as confirmed by quantitatively analyzed drawings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s004">S4A and S4B Fig</xref>, lower panels). In old animals, alternating staining for cytochrome oxidase activity and with VGluT2 also led to completely overlapping results. We conclude from these observations that pubertal genital cortex growth leads to an expansion of the cortical area innervated by thalamic afferents.</p>
<p>Next, we asked, how the genital cortex is able to increase its thalamically innervated area so drastically. Does the genital cortex expand like a balloon, pushing the neighboring cortex aside? Alternatively, do genital afferents invade neighboring territories? To address this issue, we analyzed S1 maps from young and old animals in more detail (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Specifically, we measured the space between fore- and hindpaw, as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, and named it interlimb cortex. The interlimb cortex (grey zone) is dysgranular in structure (i.e., does not have a distinct layer 4) and is larger in the map of a young animal (P25; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g003">Fig 3A</xref>, upper panel) than in the one of an old animal (P48; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g003">Fig 3B</xref>, upper panel). This size decrease is very surprising, as S1 grows overall by approximately 15% during puberty (note that this growth in S1 did not reach significance between young and old females; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g001">Fig 1</xref>). Cytochrome oxidase stained sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref>, lower panels) confirm this result. Whereas the absolute genital cortex area almost doubles in size from P21 to P42 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g003">Fig 3C</xref>), the absolute interlimb cortex area slightly decreases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g003">Fig 3D</xref>; mean interlimb cortex area in S1 maps of young animals was 0.64mm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.06 and in old animals 0.56mm<sup>2</sup> ± 0.1). Interestingly, the ratio of the genital cortex to the interlimb cortex significantly increases during puberty (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g003">Fig 3E</xref>; mean ratio of genital cortex to the interlimb area in young animals was 0.35 ± 0.035 and in old animals 0.51 ± 0.017; <italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.001, Student <italic>t</italic> test). The simultaneous increase of genital cortex and decrease of interlimb cortex suggest that the pubertal genital cortex growth reflects an invasion of dysgranular interlimb cortex by putative genital thalamic afferents.</p>

<title>Genital cortex growth in prepubescent females is accelerated by tactile cues from males</title>
<p>Although sex hormones have been identified as important players during the onset of puberty, there is also evidence that somatosensory stimuli (olfactory or tactile) can influence sexual development. Thus, we assessed if sexual experience affects the development of female genital cortex. To this end, we chose the following experimental paradigm, which is inspired by the seminal work of Bronson and Maruniak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref013">13</xref>]. Prepubescent females (P21) were cohoused for 9 days with (1) sexually experienced females (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, upper panel), or with (2) sexually experienced males (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, middle panel), or with (3) sexually experienced males separated by a wire mesh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, lower panel). In the first 2 groups, the animals had direct contact to interaction partners. In the third group, animals were cohoused but had no tactile access to them because of a wire mesh dividing the cage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, lower panel). Importantly, bedding was swapped between the 2 cage compartments daily, such that females received full exposure to pheromonal cues. Females were also able to see and hear the adult male. At the age of P30 animals were killed. Brains were removed and tangential sections through layer 4 of S1 were prepared and stained for cytochrome oxidase activity. The experimenter reconstructing and analyzing cortical maps was again blind to the experimental condition.</p>

Note that the cortical clitoris representation is the largest in the map of the female cohoused together with a sexually experienced male. In fact, the cortical clitoris representation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) and the fraction of clitoris of the entire S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4D</xref>) increased significantly more, when prepubescent females received male tactile cues (filled blue circles, mean genital cortex of S1 1.9% ± 0.1) compared to female tactile cues (filled red circles, mean genital cortex of S1 1.36% ± 0.1). Interestingly, pheromones and audio-visual contact alone were insufficient to drive genital cortex growth (open blue circle, mean genital cortex of S1 1.3% ± 0.1). A 1-way ANOVA also reported a significant difference between prepubescent females cohoused with either males, females, or males without having tactile contact (<italic>P</italic> = 0.01). The overall size of S1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) did not differ between groups (<italic>P</italic> = 0.67, 1-way ANOVA).

These findings suggest, that male sexual touch strongly advances female genital cortex growth.</p>

<title>Artificial genital touch drives genital cortex expansion and promotes female sexual maturation</title>
<p>We were surprised to observe such big effects following cohousing with sexually experienced males, while male olfactory cues had no impact on genital cortex development. These observations made us wonder about the relative contributions of tactile and other cues on female sexual maturation and genital cortex development. What are the contact cues that drive genital cortex expansion and promote female sexual maturation? It has previously been shown, that gentle touch of female genitals creates conditioned place preference in female rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref021">21</xref>] and increases 50kHz range trill calls emitted by hormonally primed females [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref022">22</xref>]. Similarly, we set up an experiment, where prepubescent female rats (P23) were exposed to artificial genital touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5</xref>). During a 10-minute session, animals were freely moving in a small U-shaped environment, while the female experimenter repeatedly touched the animals’ clitoris and vulva with a lubricated brush (artificial genital touch, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Control animals were placed in the same environment for 10 minutes without genital touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). For 7 days, each animal completed 3 sessions distributed across the day. Animals were killed at P30 and S1 maps were reconstructed with the experimenter being blind to the condition. Control animals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5C</xref>) had a smaller genital cortex than animals, which received artificial genital touch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Such differences in absolute (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) and relative size of genital cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5F</xref>) were significant. The effect size was comparable to the differences observed between male and female touch in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">Fig 4</xref>; the size of the entire S1 was not different (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5G</xref>). Artificial genital touch also affected female sexual maturation. While there was no significant change in vaginal opening (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5J</xref>), the uteri were significantly heavier following artificial genital touch, as compared with control rats (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5H and 5I</xref>).</p>

<title>Blockade of neuronal activity prevents genital cortex growth and delays vaginal opening</title>
<p>In order to better understand the role of female genital cortex during puberty, we blocked genital cortex activity over a certain time during prepuberty (P23–P30). To do so, P21 animals received Elvax implants over the area of genital cortex. Elvax sheets were developed for the slow, gradual release of drugs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref023">23</xref>]. Elvax sheets were either soaked with tetrodotoxin (TTX) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), which blocks voltage dependent sodium channels, or impregnated with Ringer, as a control condition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). After recovery, the implanted females were cohoused with sexually experienced males until the age of P30. S1 maps of the brains were obtained as described above. The experimenter reconstructing cortical maps was again blind to the experimental condition. A map from a control animal treated with ringer is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6C</xref>, while <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6D</xref> shows a cortical map obtained from a TTX treated female.

The difference between hemispheres from control (mean genital cortex of S1 was 1.49% ± 0.05) and TTX treated animals (mean genital cortex of S1 was 1.02% ± 0.05) was marked (<italic>P</italic> &lt; 0.0001, Student <italic>t</italic> test). These results immediately suggest 2 conclusions. First, the fact that there was a difference between control and TTX treated animals indicates that our TTX treatment was effective.

<p>Next, we wondered if an intact genital cortex is required for female sexual maturation. Therefore, we determined the status of puberty in control and TTX treated animals. Accordingly, pictures of vagina and clitoris were taken before implantation and after the behavioral experiment. Five out of 13 animals, which received a ringer soaked Elvax sheet above genital cortex, showed an open vagina at the end of the experiment. The vagina before (left panel) and after the experiment (right panel) for one of those females is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6H</xref>. In contrast, only 1 of the animals (<italic>n</italic> = 11), whose genital cortices were blocked with TTX, had an open vagina. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6I</xref> shows the pictures of 1 TTX animal before (left panel) and after (right panel) the treatment. The scores of vaginal opening are plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6J</xref>. The vaginas were closed in 9 out of 11 animals treated with TTX, and we observed a vagina that was about to open in only 1 TTX treated animal. In contrast, only 2 out of 13 animals in the Ringer group had the vagina still closed at the end of the experiment. The uterine weights (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6K</xref>) were not significantly different, however. Thus, genital cortex activity might relay effects of male sexual touch on vaginal opening in rat female puberty.</p>

<title>The relation between relative genital cortex size, estrogens, and uterine weight</title>
<p>In order to obtain insight in the relationship between female sexual maturation and genital cortex development, we plotted genital cortex size against uterine weight in all experiments, in which we collected such data (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s005">S5A Fig</xref>, there was no tight relationship between relative genital cortex size and uterine weight. Nonetheless, it was obvious that a large uterine weight (≥0.15 g) is rarely associated with a small (≤1%) relative genital cortex size. If one compared genital cortex size and uterine weight across specific experimental conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2001283.s005">S5B Fig</xref>), it was noticeable that animals with TTX treatment of genital cortex (the experiment described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6</xref>) never had very large genital cortices, even for cases with a large uterus.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our data confirm a major pubertal expansion of female genital cortex, which—unlike the maintenance of large genital cortex in adults—requires intact ovaries and sex hormones. The larger area of genital cortex in adults reflects an invasion of adjacent territories by thalamic afferents. Such changes in female genital cortex are advanced by sexual touch and require cortical activity. Most interestingly, blockade of genital cortex delays female sexual maturation, suggesting that genital cortex is the neural structure that mediates the puberty advancing effects of male sexual touch.</p>
<p>The expansion of layer 4 of genital cortex in puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref007">7</xref>] is an unusual pattern in the development of layer 4 in S1. In contrast, the barrel representation is characterized by a brief directly postnatal critical period, after which the barrel pattern can no longer be changed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref003">3</xref>]. Our data show that intact ovaries and, hence, presumably the sex hormones emitted by the ovaries are required for the pubertal expansion of genital cortex. The interpretation that sex hormones drive pubertal expansion is greatly strengthened by observations following the injection of estradiol, which mimics the pubertal expansion of genital cortex. The mechanisms, by which sex hormones, and in particular estrogens, drive pubertal expansion of genital cortex, are yet to be determined; both, a direct sex hormone effect on genital cortex and an indirect effect via growth stimulation of sex organs (i.e., the clitoris) by sex hormones are conceivable. Thus, it is possible that cortical changes follow similar mechanism, as described for the hippocampus, in which a rapid potentiation of excitatory synapses is achieved by estrogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref024">24</xref>] with different underlying mechanism in male and female rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref025">25</xref>]. From human studies, it is known that the hippocampus changes in size along the reproductive cycle with the biggest hippocampus being present when blood estrogen levels are highest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>The data discussed below indicate that at least some stage of cortical activity seems to be required for genital cortex expansion. The visualization of thalamic afferents by VGluT2 antibodies showed that cytochrome oxidase staining reveals maps completely congruent with thalamic innervation. Thus, the size increase of genital cortex in adults indicates that a larger cortical area is innervated by thalamic afferents. The detailed analysis of body maps in young and adult animals is strongly suggestive that the size increase of genital cortex results from an invasion scenario, in which putative genital afferents innervate neighboring dysgranular cortex.</p>
<p>Female genital cortex development is strongly affected by tactile sexual experience. Housing pubescent females with a sexually experienced adult male strongly advances the growth of genital cortex. Even though we killed such females at P30 (which corresponds in group-housed animals to midpuberty), they had genital cortices larger than average adult size (compare Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g002">2D</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g004">4D</xref>). This advancement of puberty was induced specifically by direct male contact and was not seen in animals cohoused but not touched by males, or in animals cohoused with females. In line with the idea that genital cortex is altered by sexual experience, we find that blockade of genital cortex prevents the pubertal layer 4 expansion of genital cortex. The requirement of experience and cortical activity for the appropriate development of adult somatotopy is similar to the requirement of cortical activity for the development of ocular dominance columns in the visual system [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref027">27</xref>]. It is notably different, however, from the development of the early postnatal development of the barrel pattern in S1, which occurs despite manipulation of peripheral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref028">28</xref>] or cortical inputs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref029">29</xref>]. Thus, genital cortex does seem to differ from barrel cortex not only in the timing of the critical period, but also the cellular mechanisms mediating genital cortex plasticity seem to differ from barrel cortex.</p>
<p>Whereas our blocking experiments show that genital cortex activity is crucial for the pubertal layer 4 expansion, it is questionable to what extent this plasticity is functionally meaningful. Decorticated animals are still able to mount and reproduce. However, subtle changes in the pattern of reproduction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref031">31</xref>] are observed. Furthermore, somatosensory feedback from the penis was shown to be critical for the achievement of intromission, and somatosensory feedback from the preputial region is needed for the execution of copulatory thrusting [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref032">32</xref>]. Blocking genital cortex activity during the critical period of puberty may cause changes in the pattern of reproduction during adulthood, i.e., that the number of intromissions and time to ejaculation might be affected (in males); lordosis or place preference behavior could be affected in females.</p>
<p>As shown many decades ago, the social signals powerfully control the advance of puberty [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref033">33</xref>]. While it became clear that pheromonal stimuli mediated by the vomeronasal organ [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref011">11</xref>] contribute to the male induced advance in female puberty in mice, the hastening effects of puberty induced by male pheromones alone are minor. Bronson and Maruniak [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref013">13</xref>] suggested that tactile male cues synergistically with pheromones advance female puberty. Further work showed that androgenized female mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref034">34</xref>], but not castrated male mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref013">13</xref>], provide the tactile female puberty promoting cues. Our artificial genital touch experiment showed a major effect of genital touch on female sexual maturation. The effects of artificial genital touch on uterine weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g005">Fig 5I</xref>) were even larger than the male effects seen in some of our control experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2001283.g006">Fig 6K</xref>). Thus, our data point to genital touch as a dominant cue for inducing puberty and question the idea that a sensory synergism is required [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref013">13</xref>]. Our data show that an intact female genital cortex promotes vaginal opening. Thus, the data suggest that genital cortex might be a tactile gateway through which sexual touch promotes female puberty. This question requires further investigation, however, as we did not observe an effect of genital cortex blockade on uterine weight, as described previously in rats [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref033">33</xref>]. The receptive field properties of genital cortex appear to be tuned to sexual tactile contacts associated with mating [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref007">7</xref>] and, hence, seem well-suited to relay signals arising from sexual touch. The ensemble of our systemic female hormone application effects on genital cortex growth and our puberty advancing effects established by genital touch leads to speculation about a possible bidirectional connection between genital cortex and the medial preoptic nucleus of the hypothalamus. This region contains gonadotropin releasing hormone (GnRH) neurons whose activity produces high frequency of GnRH release which, in turn, causes gametogenesis and an increase in gonadal steroid hormone secretion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Experiments on blockade of S1 with TTX/Elvax</title>
<p>Animals (P21) were divided into 2 groups. The control group received a chronic Ringer-impregnated Elvax sheet above genital cortex and the rats in the testing group were implanted with a TTX-impregnated Elvax sheet above genital cortex.</p>
<p>Elvax implants were prepared as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref029">29</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref038">38</xref>]. Briefly Elvax 40p (ethylene-vinyl acetate copolymer; DuPont, Wilmington, DE) was washed for one week in 95% of Ethanol and afterwards dissolved in methylene chloride to obtain a 10% solution. TTX (Abcam, Cambridge, UK) or Ringer (control) was then added in order to achieve a final concentration of 2%. The TTX or Ringer containing Elvax mixture was poured into a glass mold and quickly frozen for 1 hour at −80°C. After 30 minutes, the blocks were removed from the mold and put for another 3 days into the −80°C freezer. On day 3, the Elvax TTX or control blocks were transferred to the −20°C and stored for another 3–4 days. Subsequently, the TTX and Ringer impregnated blocks were cut on a vibratome (Leica, Wetzlar, Germany) into 150 μm sheets, which were cut into 2 mm squares using a scalpel. Before surgical implantation all Elvax sheets were washed for at least 8 hours in distilled water.</p>
<p>For surgical implantation P21 Wistar rats were anesthetized by injection of an initial dose of 100 mg/kg ketamine and 7.5 mg/kg xylazine. Respiration, blink, and pinch reflex were observed throughout the surgery and, if needed, animals were injected with an extra shot (25%) of ketamine/xylazine mixture or a 25% dose of ketamine alone. Monitoring of temperature was done using a rectal probe and could be maintained with a heating pad to 34°C–36°C. Lidocaine was locally injected in the scalp, which was then removed. A craniotomy was performed above genital cortex, and the dura was removed using a bend syringe. The TTX or Ringer impregnated sheets were placed on the brain surface and covered with silicone (Kwik-Cast; World Precision Instruments, Sarasota, FL). The exposed skull was finally covered with dental cement. Animals were allowed to recover from surgery for 2 days. Photos of clitoris and vagina were taken before the behavioral experiment. At the age of P23, implanted animals were put together with a sexually experienced male. After 7 days (at the age of P30), TTX and control animals were anaesthetized and their vaginal opening was documented as described above. Along with the perfusion, the uteri of the animals were cut out and weighed. Brains were histologically processed as described below.</p>

<title>Histology</title>
<p>At the end of the above-described experiments, animals were anaesthetized using a 20% urethane solution and perfused with phosphate buffer followed by a 2% paraformaldehyde solution (PFA). Brains were removed, hemispheres were separated, and cortices were flattened between 2 glass slides separated by clay spacers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref039">39</xref>]. Glass slides were weighed down with small ceramic weights for approximately 3 hours. Afterwards, flattened cortices were stored overnight in 2% PFA and 80 μm sections were cut on a Vibratome (Leica). Sections were stained for cytochrome-oxidase activity using the protocol of Divac et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2001283.ref040">40</xref>]. After the staining procedure, sections were mounted on gelatin coated glass slides with Mowiol mounting medium. Subsequently, pictures were taken on an Olympus BX51 microscope and layer 4 areas of S1 were drawn by using a Neurolucida software. S1 maps were reconstructed through serial sections. To exclude experimenter biases, cortical maps were drawn and analyzed by an experimenter blind to the conditions (e.g., estradiol versus sesame oil control group; TTX versus Ringer-treated group).</p>
<p>For the alternating staining procedure with cytochrome c and VGluT2, immunohistochemical labeling was performed using standard procedures. Briefly, brain sections, which should be labeled for VGluT2, were preincubated for an hour at room temperature in a blocking solution (0.1 M PBS, 2% bovine serum albumin, and 0.5% Triton X-100). Afterwards, primary antibodies were diluted in a solution containing 0.5% Triton X-100 and 1% bovine serum albumin. The primary antibody against VGluT2 was incubated with the free-floating sections for at least 24 hours under mild shaking at 4°C. Incubations with the primary antibody was followed by detection with a secondary antibody coupled to the fluorophore Alexa 488. The secondary antibody was diluted (1:500) in 0.5% Triton X-100 and the reaction was allowed to proceed for 2 hours in the dark at room temperature. After the staining procedure, sections were mounted on gelatin coated glass slides with Mowiol mounting medium.</p>
