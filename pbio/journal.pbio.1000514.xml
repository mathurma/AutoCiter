<p>Metabolomics technology reveals that fibroblast that have exited the proliferative cell cycle nevertheless utilize glucose throughout central carbon metabolism and rely on the pentose phosphate pathway for viability.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Many cells in mammals exist in the state of quiescence, which is characterized by reversible exit from the cell cycle. Quiescent cells are widely reported to exhibit reduced size, nucleotide synthesis, and metabolic activity. Much lower glycolytic rates have been reported in quiescent compared with proliferating lymphocytes. In contrast, we show here that primary human fibroblasts continue to exhibit high metabolic rates when induced into quiescence via contact inhibition. By monitoring isotope labeling through metabolic pathways and quantitatively identifying fluxes from the data, we show that contact-inhibited fibroblasts utilize glucose in all branches of central carbon metabolism at rates similar to those of proliferating cells, with greater overflow flux from the pentose phosphate pathway back to glycolysis. Inhibition of the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in apoptosis preferentially in quiescent fibroblasts. By feeding the cells labeled glutamine, we also detected a “backwards” flux in the tricarboxylic acid cycle from α-ketoglutarate to citrate that was enhanced in contact-inhibited fibroblasts; this flux likely contributes to shuttling of NADPH from the mitochondrion to cytosol for redox defense or fatty acid synthesis. The high metabolic activity of the fibroblasts was directed in part toward breakdown and resynthesis of protein and lipid, and in part toward excretion of extracellular matrix proteins. Thus, reduced metabolic activity is not a hallmark of the quiescent state. Quiescent fibroblasts, relieved of the biosynthetic requirements associated with generating progeny, direct their metabolic activity to preservation of self integrity and alternative functions beneficial to the organism as a whole.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Many cells in the human body are in a reversible state of quiescence, where they have exited the cell cycle but retain the capacity to re-enter it and divide again. Previous experiments in lymphocytes had suggested that quiescent cells reduce their glucose uptake and metabolic rate. In our studies, we have investigated the metabolism of fibroblasts, cells found in connective tissue and skin. Using “metabolomics” to monitor flux through metabolic pathways, we discovered that fibroblasts remain highly metabolically active even though they are not dividing. They degrade and resynthesize protein and fatty acid, and secrete large amounts of protein into the extracellular environment. Despite our expectation that quiescent cells would not have a high demand for nucleotide biosynthesis, we found that they do divert glucose to the pentose phosphate pathway, presumably to generate NADPH. The NADPH created may help the quiescent fibroblasts to detoxify free radicals or to synthesize fatty acids. Experiments in which we inhibited the pentose phosphate pathway resulted in increased apoptosis in quiescent cells, suggesting a possible strategy for selectively killing nondividing cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Proliferating and quiescent cells are expected to have vastly different metabolic needs. Proliferating cells must replicate the entirety of their cellular contents in order to divide. As a result, much of the metabolic energy in a proliferating cell is devoted to synthesizing DNA, proteins, and lipids. Quiescent cells are relieved of this massive metabolic requirement since they are not dividing and, in several well-studied model systems, they decrease their metabolic rates in accordance with their decreased proliferation rates. Yeast cultures, for instance, enter stationary phase when liquid cultures are grown to saturation in rich medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-WernerWashburne1">[1]</xref>. Within this population, the quiescent yeast cells fail to accumulate mass and volume <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Gray1">[2]</xref>, in part because quiescent yeast cells induce autophagy, or self-cannibalism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Noda1">[3]</xref>. In addition, the overall transcription rate is three to five times slower in stationary-phase than in logarithmic-phase cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Choder1">[4]</xref>, and protein synthesis is reduced to approximately 0.3% of the rate in logarithmically growing cultures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Fuge1">[5]</xref>. Therefore, the quiescent cells within a stationary-phase culture of yeast likely represent an example of a quiescent cell that has significantly reduced its metabolic activity.</p>
<p>Lymphocytes also undergo a major metabolic shift upon transitioning between proliferation and quiescence. Early studies showed that lectin stimulation of lymphocytes led to increased glucose uptake, and an increased rate of glycolysis and pentose phosphate pathway (PPP) activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Hedeskov1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Sagone1">[7]</xref>. More recent experiments have focused on a murine pro-B cell lymphoid cell line, FL5.12, that proliferates in response to the cytokine interleukin IL-3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Bauer1">[8]</xref>. IL-3 stimulation results in an 8-fold increased glycolytic flux. IL-3 also induces the cells to consume less oxygen per glucose consumed, and to excrete much more lactate, indicating a shift away from oxidative toward glycolytic metabolism. For human peripheral blood T lymphocytes, stimulation resulted in a 30-fold increase in glycolysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Frauwirth1">[9]</xref>; for thymocytes, the increase was 50-fold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Brand1">[10]</xref>. These differences in quiescent and proliferating lymphocytes have played a pivotal role in our understanding of the quiescent state, and experiments with lymphocytes as a model system have been important contributors to the development of the idea that quiescence is characterized by decreased metabolic activity. Lymphocytes, however, are relatively unique among mammalian cells in having primarily a “watching and waiting” function when quiescent and performing much of their physiological role only after activation.</p>
<p>Our studies focus on newborn dermal fibroblasts as a model system of quiescence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Coller1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Pollina1">[13]</xref>. In vitro, primary fibroblasts isolated directly from newborn foreskin can be induced into reversible quiescence by serum withdrawal or contact inhibition. Unlike most primary cells, fibroblasts remain healthy in culture in a quiescent state for as long as 30 d with little apoptosis or senescence, and can then re-enter the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Pollina1">[13]</xref>. In vivo, quiescent fibroblasts are central to normal physiology as the primary synthesizers of extracellular matrix necessary for the formation of cellular tissues. In response to a wound, fibroblasts enter the cell cycle from quiescence, proliferate, and secrete a collagen-rich extracellular matrix <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Martin1">[14]</xref>, pro-angiogenesis factors that recruit new blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Pollina1">[13]</xref>, and other molecules that facilitate the wound healing response <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Iyer1">[15]</xref>. A better understanding of the transition between proliferation and quiescence in fibroblasts would have broad implications for physiology and medicine. Scarring and fibrosis result from excessive fibroblast proliferation and secretion of extracellular matrix during and after wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Kose1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Desmouliere1">[17]</xref>. Additionally, tumors may contain quiescent cells that contribute to cancer dormancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Holyoake1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Ebben1">[19]</xref>. Thus, a better understanding of the transition between proliferation and quiescence, including the metabolic changes that occur, could have implications for a wide range of medical conditions.</p>
<p>The emerging field of metabolomics promises to augment our understanding of mammalian cell physiology through the systems-level characterization of cell-wide metabolite concentrations and fluxes. Using liquid chromatography–triple quadrupole mass spectrometry, we have developed a methodology for monitoring the pool size and turnover of a large number of metabolites simultaneously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Yuan1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Lu1">[22]</xref>. Here we apply metabolomic technology, flux analysis, and biochemical assays to investigate metabolic changes after primary dermal fibroblasts enter quiescence. We discovered that contact-inhibited primary fibroblasts remain highly metabolically active while adjusting their metabolic emphasis to produce NADPH, steadily renew their proteins and lipids, and enhance secretion of specific extracellular matrix proteins.</p>

<title>A Model for Cellular Quiescence in Primary Fibroblasts</title>
<p>We have developed a model system that allows us to monitor metabolic differences between proliferating and quiescent cells. Primary dermal fibroblasts were expanded and analyzed while actively proliferating, after 1 wk of growth to confluence (contact-inhibited for 7 d [CI7]), after 2 wk of confluence (contact-inhibited for 14 d [CI14]), or after 2 wk of confluence with serum concentrations decreased for the final week from 10% to 0.1% (contact-inhibited for 14 d and serum-starved for 7 d [CI14SS7]). Alternatively, fibroblasts were plated sparsely so that they did not touch each other and induced into quiescence by serum starvation and monitored after 4 d (serum-starved for 4 d [SS4]) or 7 d (serum-starved for 7 d [SS7]). In quiescent fibroblasts, the fraction of cells with 2N DNA content increased so that 80% or more of the cells were in the G<sub>0</sub>/G<sub>1</sub> phase of the cell cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The fraction of cells in S phase was significantly reduced, indicating that very few cells were actively dividing under these conditions. In both contact-inhibited and serum-starved fibroblasts, levels of the cyclin-dependent kinase inhibitor p27<sup>Kip1</sup> were upregulated, as expected for cells that entered quiescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Sherr1">[23]</xref>. In addition, staining with pyronin Y for total RNA indicated that the fraction of cells with low pyronin Y, interpreted as cells in G<sub>0</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Crissman1">[24]</xref>, increased in fibroblasts induced into quiescence by all of these methods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Pyronin Y labeling data indicate that in the contact-inhibited and serum-starved cell populations investigated as quiescence models, approximately 60%–75% of the cells are in G<sub>0</sub> and most of the remainder are in G<sub>1</sub>.</p>

<title>Rapid Glycolytic Flux in Proliferating and Quiescent Fibroblasts</title>
<p>Previous studies have reported that lymphocytes induced to exit the cell cycle in response to mitogen withdrawal exhibit decreased glycolytic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Bauer1">[8]</xref>. We used several methods to assess metabolic rates in proliferating, CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 cells. We monitored the rates at which glucose and glutamine were consumed from the medium, and lactate and glutamate were secreted into the medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, the rate of glucose consumption was approximately 2-fold lower in the contact-inhibited than in the proliferating fibroblasts. Lactate secretion decreased less than 2-fold with contact inhibition alone, and roughly 2-fold with additional serum deprivation. Glucose consumption actually slightly increased in fibroblasts induced into quiescence by serum starvation (without contact inhibition) for 4 or 7 d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s001">Figure S1</xref>). We also monitored metabolic rates in fibroblasts cultured in medium conditions containing physiological levels of glucose and glutamine (1 g/l glucose and 0.7 mM glutamine compared with 4.5 g/l glucose and 4 mM glutamine in Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium [DMEM]) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Newsholme1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Association1">[26]</xref>. Metabolic rates were somewhat lower in proliferating fibroblasts in these low glucose/low glutamine conditions compared with proliferating fibroblasts in standard medium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Quiescent fibroblasts cultured in these conditions exhibited consumption and excretion rates approximately half that of proliferating fibroblasts. Our finding that glycolytic rates are similar within a factor of two in proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts is surprising given that changes in glycolytic rate have been shown to mirror changes in proliferative rate in multiple model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Bauer1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Brand1">[10]</xref>. Indeed, while there is a dramatic decrease in the fraction of cells in the proliferative cell cycle, even the CI14SS7 condition resulted in only a 2-fold change in glucose consumption, much less than reported in other systems. Thus, decreased metabolic activity is not a universal hallmark of quiescence.</p>

<p>(A) The amount of glucose, lactate, glutamine, and glutamate were measured in conditioned medium from proliferating (P), CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 cells. Data are from three experiments with five replicates at each time point, and error bars indicate standard error. (B) Metabolites were extracted from cells in different proliferative states, and the levels of specific metabolites were quantified using mass spectrometry. Metabolite levels in individual samples were normalized to protein content at the time of harvest. Means from four experiments, each containing 4–5 replicates, are shown. Error bars indicate standard error. With a false discovery rate of 0.05, none of the metabolite levels are different between the proliferating, CI7, and CI14 cells. (C) Isotope labeling dynamics of glycolysis in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 fibroblasts. Medium was changed to [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose at time zero, and the fraction of each metabolite that is <sup>13</sup>C-labeled was determined at the indicated times after switching to labeled medium. Data are pooled from five experiments, and error bars indicate standard deviations. 3PG, 3-phosphoglycerate; Hexose-P, hexose phosphate; Pentose-P, pentose phosphate; PEP, phosphoenolpyruvate.</p>

<p>To further assess glycolytic rates in proliferating and contact-inhibited fibroblasts, we monitored the steady state pool sizes of glycolytic intermediates using liquid chromatography coupled to tandem mass spectrometry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Yuan1">[20]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Lu1">[22]</xref>. In total, we monitored the levels of 172 metabolites, 62 of which gave signals above background in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 fibroblasts. Metabolite levels were normalized per microgram of protein in cells plated at the same density because quiescent fibroblasts are smaller and contain less protein per cell than proliferating fibroblasts (E. M. Haley, A. L.-M., and H. A. C., unpublished data). The ratio of metabolite levels in the contact-inhibited (CI7 and CI14) to proliferating fibroblasts was determined for each metabolite. Some metabolites were present at consistently higher levels in proliferating fibroblasts, while others were enriched in contact-inhibited fibroblasts, although the magnitude of these changes in metabolite levels was generally modest (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>Levels of five glycolytic intermediates and pentose-5-phosphate (a combination of ribose-5-phosphate, ribulose-5-phosphate, and xylulose-5-phosphate, which could not be reliably differentiated in our liquid chromatography–tandem mass spectrometry [LC-MS/MS] method) are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g002">Figure 2B</xref>. No statistically significant differences were observed in the levels of glycolytic intermediates between contact-inhibited (CI7 or CI14) and proliferating fibroblasts at a false discovery rate of 0.05. Some glycolytic metabolites were present at lower levels in contact-inhibited, serum-deprived (CI14SS7) fibroblasts. Thus, the transition between proliferation and quiescence induced by contact inhibition alone has little effect on the pool sizes of glycolytic metabolites in primary fibroblasts. While pool sizes are not a direct indication of changes in flux, the constant levels of glycolytic metabolites in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 fibroblasts are consistent with our finding that there is little change in the rate of glucose uptake or lactate secretion among fibroblasts in these different states.</p>
<p>To more directly assess the rate of flux through glycolytic pathways, we incubated fibroblasts with [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose and determined how quickly the label was incorporated into glycolytic intermediates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). For hexose phosphate (a combination of glucose-1-phosphate, glucose-6-phosphate, and fructose-6-phosphate), fructose-1,6-bisphosphate (FBP), dihydroxyacetone phosphate (DHAP), and phosphoenolpyruvate, the unlabeled pools of intermediates were converted into fully <sup>13</sup>C-labeled intermediates at a similar rate in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 fibroblasts.</p>
<p>We also developed a computational model based on ordinary differential equations (ODEs) of central carbon metabolism for the proliferating, CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts. The ODEs in the model quantify the isotope labeling dynamics of the relevant metabolites after switching into <sup>13</sup>C-labeled carbon sources (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Model parameters (i.e., metabolic fluxes and some unmeasured pool sizes) were identified by fitting all of the available laboratory data (labeling dynamics, pseudo-steady-state labeling patterns, measured pool sizes, and uptake and excretion rates). This systems-level approach enabled quantitation of flux through different metabolic pathways in proliferating, CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>). For glycolysis, the inferred fluxes from hexose phosphate to FBP, and from DHAP to 3-phosphoglycerate, were similar in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for information regarding statistical significance). In CI14SS7 fibroblasts, hexose phosphate–to-FBP and DHAP-to–3-phosphoglycerate fluxes are approximately half those in the other conditions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>), consistent with an approximately 2-fold reduction in glucose consumption. We conclude that glucose consumption and lactate excretion proceed rapidly in fibroblasts induced into quiescence by contact inhibition.</p>

<title>Quiescent Fibroblasts Exhibit High PPP Activity</title>
<p>The PPP produces ribose-5-phosphate, needed for the biosynthesis of nucleotides, and NADPH, which can be used as a cofactor for the biosynthesis of macromolecules including fatty acids. We anticipated that proliferating cells would have higher demands for both ribose-5-phosphate and NADPH than quiescent cells, and thus higher PPP flux. Surprisingly, the pentose phosphate pool incorporated <sup>13</sup>C label very rapidly in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 fibroblasts when the cells were incubated with labeled [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Indeed, according to our computational model, hexose phosphate–to–pentose phosphate flux was actually slightly higher in contact-inhibited (both CI7 and CI14) fibroblasts than in proliferating fibroblasts (though the effect was not statistically significant). Additional serum deprivation only slightly decreased oxidative PPP flux, with the oxidative PPP flux–to–glycolytic flux ratio highest in CI14SS7 fibroblasts. Thus, the oxidative PPP is actively utilized in both proliferating and quiescent cells.</p>

<p>We anticipated that ribose generated from the PPP would be incorporated into nucleotide triphosphates more rapidly in proliferating than quiescent cells because of their increased need for nucleotide triphosphates for RNA and DNA synthesis. Indeed, in proliferating fibroblasts, ATP and UTP with labeled ribose rings accumulate more rapidly in proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). The results confirm that biosynthesis of nucleotides is more rapid in the proliferating cells.</p>
<p>Given that quiescent fibroblasts do not commit ribose phosphate to nucleotide biosynthesis, we reasoned that quiescent cells might recycle ribose phosphate back to glycolytic intermediates through the non-oxidative branch of the PPP. To test this hypothesis, we monitored the ratio of 1×<sup>13</sup>C-lactate to 2×<sup>13</sup>C-lactate after incubating the cells with [1, 2-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose. As previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Vizan1">[27]</xref>, 1×<sup>13</sup>C-lactate is formed when glucose is metabolized through the oxidative portion of the PPP to ribulose-5-phosphate. In this pathway, glucose molecules lose one <sup>13</sup>C atom in the form of CO<sub>2</sub>, and are then returned to glycolysis through the non-oxidative branch of the PPP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). 2×<sup>13</sup>C-lactate is formed by the canonical glycolysis pathway from glucose to lactate. The ratio of 1×<sup>13</sup>C-lactate to 2×<sup>13</sup>C-lactate provides an indication of the extent to which the non-oxidative branch of the PPP is utilized. This ratio is significantly higher in CI7 than proliferating fibroblasts, and even higher in CI14 fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
<p>As another indication of the rate of flux through the non-oxidative branch of the PPP, we monitored labeling of sedoheptulose-7-phosphate, a metabolic intermediate in the non-oxidative PPP. Sedoheptulose-7-phosphate is labeled rapidly in CI7 and CI14 but not proliferating fibroblasts fed [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), indicating higher flux through the non-oxidative branch of the PPP in quiescent cells. Our systems-level flux analysis confirmed increased flux from ribose phosphate back to glycolysis in contact-inhibited compared with proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>).

<title>Functional Importance of the PPP</title>
<p>To investigate the mechanistic basis for the high PPP flux in quiescence fibroblasts, we monitored protein levels of two key enzymes in the PPP, both of which generate NADPH: glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase (G6PD) and 6-phosphogluconate dehydrogenase (PGD). Protein levels of both G6PD and PGD were elevated in fibroblasts induced into quiescence by either contact inhibition or serum starvation in comparison to proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g005">Figure 5A</xref>).

<p>Both proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts generate NADPH through the PPP. The NADPH may be used for biosynthesis or to regenerate the reduced forms of glutathione or thioredoxin. We monitored reduced and oxidized glutathione (GSH and GSSG, respectively) in proliferating, CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g005">Figure 5B and 5C</xref>, GSH was slightly increased, and the ratio of GSH to GSSG significantly enhanced, in quiescent (CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7) compared with proliferating fibroblasts.

<p>We then tested the functional importance of the PPP in quiescent and proliferating fibroblasts.

<title>Truncated Tricarboxylic Acid Cycle in Proliferating but Not Quiescent Fibroblasts</title>
<p>Previous studies concluded that proliferating lymphocytes actively utilize glycolytic pathways to generate ATP while quiescent lymphocytes generate energy via an influx of fatty acids and proteins that are metabolized through the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Bauer1">[8]</xref>. To investigate TCA cycle usage, we monitored metabolite labeling through the TCA cycle after addition of [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose, [3-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose or [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glutamine in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 fibroblasts. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g007">Figure 7</xref>, proliferating and contact-inhibited fibroblasts incorporate two carbon units from glucose into citrate via acetyl-CoA at comparable rates. In CI7 and CI14 fibroblasts, the labeled carbons progress through the TCA cycle to form 2×<sup>13</sup>C-α-ketoglutarate, as expected. In proliferating fibroblasts, however, there is a substantial decrease in the transmission of labeled carbons from citrate to α-ketoglutarate, succinate, and malate. Experiments using [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glutamine further support the truncation of the TCA cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g008">Figure 8</xref>). While carbon from glutamine effectively transverses the left side of the TCA cycle in the standard clockwise direction to yield 4×<sup>13</sup>C-citrate in both proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts, subsequent formation of 3×<sup>13</sup>C-α-ketoglutarate by isocitrate dehydrogenase hardly occurs in proliferating fibroblasts.

<p>When carbon skeletons are removed from the TCA cycle for the synthesis of macromolecular precursors including amino acids, other long carbon skeletons are needed to replace them. This anaplerotic refilling should be especially important for proliferating fibroblasts since their TCA cycle activity is truncated at citrate. The major anaplerotic reaction from glycolysis involves the carboxylation of pyruvate to form oxaloacetate. This reaction can be monitored by feeding cells [3-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose and monitoring the fraction of citrate or malate with label, since the <sup>13</sup>C is retained only when the anaplerotic reaction via pyruvate carboxylase is utilized. Surprisingly, the ratios of 1×<sup>13</sup>C-citrate to unlabeled citrate and/or 1×<sup>13</sup>C-malate to unlabeled malate were significantly increased in CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts compared with proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s006">Table S2</xref>). In addition, quantitative flux analysis revealed that anaplerotic flux from pyruvate to oxaloacetate is elevated in CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 compared with proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">Figure S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>), while the flux from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA is lower in CI14 and CI14SS7 fibroblasts than in proliferating fibroblasts. Thus, contact inhibition was associated with both an increase in canonical TCA cycle activity past citrate, and an increase in anaplerotic TCA cycle flux from pyruvate to oxaloacetate. Proliferating fibroblasts, in contrast, seem unlikely to have sufficient carbon skeletons from glucose for the production of proteogenic amino acids not present in the cell growth medium.</p>

<title>Glutamine Is the Preferred Anaplerotic Source in Proliferating Fibroblasts</title>

CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts consume approximately half as much glutamine per microgram of protein as proliferating fibroblasts. CI7 and CI14 fibroblasts secrete glutamate at a lower rate compared with proliferating fibroblasts, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts secrete glutamate at a lower rate than CI7 or CI14 fibroblasts. SS4 and SS7 fibroblasts, on the other hand, consume glutamine and secrete glutamate at a faster rate than proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

These results support a model in which there is both forward and reverse flux between citrate and α-ketoglutarate, with greater flux in both directions in contact-inhibited than in proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>).

As both IDH1 and IDH2 use NADP(H) as their redox cofactor, the net effect is transfer of high energy electrons in the form of NADPH to the cytosol.

<title>Fatty Acid and Protein Degradation and Resynthesis Occur Rapidly in Proliferating and Quiescent Fibroblasts</title>
<p>Quiescent cells do not dilute out older macromolecules, organelles, or membranes with cell division, and thus may be more dependent than proliferating cells on mechanisms to break down and resynthesize membrane components and macromolecules. Our data are consistent with increased fatty acid degradation in contact-inhibited fibroblasts. Carnitine, a metabolite involved in the transport of fatty acids from the cytoplasm to the mitochondria during fatty acid degradation, is present at higher levels in CI7 and CI14 fibroblasts than in proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s002">Figure S2</xref>).

<p>The enhanced rate of fatty acid degradation in contact-inhibited fibroblasts seems to be enabling fatty acid biosynthesis to occur at a similar rate in proliferating and contact-inhibited fibroblasts. During fatty acid synthesis, citrate is transported out of the mitochondria to the cytoplasm, where it is broken down by ATP citrate lyase into oxaloacetate and acetyl-CoA used in fatty acid biosynthesis. ATP citrate lyase activity can be monitored based on the conversion of 5×<sup>13</sup>C-citrate to 2×<sup>13</sup>C-acetyl-CoA and 3×<sup>13</sup>C-oxaloacetate (measured as 3×<sup>13</sup>C-malate). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g008">Figure 8A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g003">3</xref>×<sup>13</sup>C-malate is produced similarly in proliferating, CI7, and CI14 cells, consistent with fibroblasts in all of these states being actively engaged in fatty acid biosynthesis. To more directly assess fatty acid biosynthesis in proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts, we extracted lipids from proliferating, CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts fed [U-<sup>14</sup>C]-glutamine. The contribution of carbons to fatty acids from glutamine was significantly higher in all of the quiescent fibroblasts compared with the proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g008">Figure 8B</xref>), consistent with higher “backwards” flux from α-ketoglutarate to citrate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>). The higher levels of fatty acid synthesis in contact-inhibited fibroblasts may contribute to the maintenance of membrane integrity, and may also provide a major sink for cytosolic NADPH.</p>
<p>Similarly, our results suggest that contact-inhibited fibroblasts may also be actively degrading existing protein, and thus resynthesizing protein to replace the degraded proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g009">Figure 9</xref>, the fraction of glutamate that is labeled in fibroblasts under all conditions increases rapidly after switching cells into [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glutamine and then drops off in CI7 and CI14 fibroblasts, but not in proliferating fibroblasts. This decline in the fraction of glutamate molecules with five labeled carbons corresponds to an increase in the fraction of unlabeled glutamate. One possible explanation for these data is a breakdown of unlabeled proteins and release of free amino acids into the glutamate pool. These results are in agreement with our quantitative flux analysis: protein synthesis rates are similar across all conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Fox1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Valentin1">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s005">Table S1</xref>).

Thus, one reason for the active metabolism observed in contact-inhibited fibroblasts may be to rebuild and thus refresh their lipid and protein contents.</p>

<title>Contact-Inhibited Fibroblasts Secrete Large Amounts of Extracellular Matrix Proteins</title>
<p>The high metabolic activity of quiescent fibroblasts might also be partially explained by their synthesis and secretion of extracellular matrix molecules needed for the structural integrity of tissue. While proliferating fibroblasts would be expected to secrete molecules important for wound healing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Iyer1">[15]</xref>, quiescent fibroblasts might be expected to secrete extracellular matrix molecules required at the end of a wound healing process or for maintenance of quiescent tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Senger1">[45]</xref>.

<title>Overview of the Metabolic Changes between Proliferation and Quiescence in Fibroblasts</title>
<p>The metabolic profiles of proliferating and CI14 fibroblasts are summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g003">Figure 3</xref>. Fibroblasts in both proliferating and contact-inhibited states utilize glycolysis extensively. Proliferating fibroblasts rely on the PPP to generate ribose for nucleotide biosynthesis and NADPH for biosynthetic purposes. Contact-inhibited fibroblasts employ the oxidative PPP to generate NADPH, and the carbon skeletons are largely returned to glycolysis as glyceraldehyde-3-phosphate and fructose-6-phosphate. Fibroblasts in both proliferating and contact-inhibited states contribute some glucose carbons to the TCA cycle. In contact-inhibited fibroblasts, carbons contributed by glucose are transmitted through the TCA cycle; in proliferating fibroblasts, there is little forward flux between citrate and α-ketoglutarate. Contact-inhibited fibroblasts rely more heavily on anaplerotic flux from pyruvate to oxaloacetate via pyruvate carboxylase; proliferating fibroblasts rely more heavily on glutamine, perhaps because of their higher demand for nitrogen. Glutamine drives the forward flux through the TCA cycle and also reverse flux from α-ketoglutarate to citrate, especially in the contact-inhibited fibroblasts. This reverse flux provides a mechanism for shuttling NADPH from mitochondria to the cytosol.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>What Do Quiescent Fibroblasts Do with All of Their Energy?</title>
<p>We discovered that fibroblasts induced into quiescence by contact inhibition maintain a high metabolic rate. In contact-inhibited fibroblasts, nucleotide biosynthesis is reduced, yet the rate of glycolytic, PPP, and TCA flux is almost completely maintained. Even fibroblasts that have been contact-inhibited for 2 wk and starved of serum for the final week show only a 2-fold reduction in glycolytic flux. Contact-inhibited fibroblasts also presumably generate substantial energy through the TCA cycle, where we observed flux of both glucose- and glutamine-derived carbons through more than a complete cycle. Consistent with these multiple routes of energy generation, the ATP/AMP ratio is high in contact-inhibited fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>What then do the quiescent fibroblasts do with all of their energy? Our data suggest three avenues for energy utilization. First, contact-inhibited fibroblasts may continuously degrade and resynthesize their macromolecules and membrane components via increased autophagy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Fox1">[43]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Valentin1">[44]</xref> (E. M. Haley, A. L.-M., and H. A. C., unpublished observation), a strategy that would help to ensure that old and potentially damaged macromolecules and membranes do not accumulate. Our data suggest that contact-inhibited fibroblasts may degrade protein and fatty acids at an enhanced rate compared with proliferating fibroblasts. The conclusion most consistent with our data is that the proliferating and contact-inhibited fibroblasts synthesize amino acids and fatty acids at rates that are comparable, with the new biomass contributing to new cells in proliferating fibroblasts and the new biomass replacing degraded molecules in the contact-inhibited fibroblasts.</p>
<p>Second, contact-inhibited and serum-starved fibroblasts induce pathways that generate NADPH. We discovered that three NADPH-generating enzymes, G6PD, PGD, and IDH1, are expressed at higher levels in quiescent than in proliferating fibroblasts. The results suggest that quiescent fibroblasts activate an NADPH-generating program of enzyme induction. One role of the NADPH may be to ensure the availability of GSH and thioredoxin for the detoxification of free radicals. Indeed, levels of total free radicals are lower in the contact-inhibited than in proliferating fibroblasts (E. M. Haley and H. A. C., unpublished data). Another role for the NADPH generated may be to support resynthesis of fatty acids, as fatty acid degradation yields NADH while synthesis requires NADPH.</p>
<p>Third, quiescent fibroblasts may acquire new cell-type-specific functions. In contrast to lymphocytes, which, with the exception of plasma cells, lack a major biosynthetic function in their quiescent state, fibroblasts secrete proteins and other molecules needed for the extracellular matrix even when they are quiescent. Contact-inhibited fibroblasts direct some of their metabolic activity toward this biosynthetic purpose, as we observed elevated levels of specific extracellular matrix proteins in contact-inhibited compared with proliferating fibroblasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000514-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Thus, quiescent fibroblasts, relieved of the biosynthetic requirements associated with creating progeny, can turn their protein synthesis machinery toward the synthesis of proteins that are beneficial for the organism as a whole.</p>

<title>What Is Distinctive about Quiescence?</title>
<p>Our findings shed light on some larger questions about quiescence: What are the fundamental attributes of a quiescent state? Is there a single quiescent state or are there multiple quiescent states? Our results suggest that quiescence is not necessarily associated with a shutdown of glycolysis, as reported for lymphocytes and thymocytes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Hedeskov1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Brand1">[10]</xref>. Quiescent cells can actually be highly metabolically active. In this respect, quiescent fibroblasts resemble terminally differentiated cells like cardiomyocytes, neurons, and renal tubular epithelial cells, which are among the highest energy consumers in mammals. These terminally differentiated cells are well-known to employ nutrients to achieve their contractile, signaling, and transport functions. Whether their metabolic activity, like that of contact-inhibited fibroblasts, is also directed to continuously refreshing their protein and lipid composition merits further study.</p>
<p>In addition to differing from quiescent lymphocytes, different types of quiescent fibroblasts can vary. While CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts are indistinguishable morphologically or by traditional cell cycle analysis, they differ with regard to their metabolic profiles. Compared with fibroblasts induced into quiescence by contact inhibition, fibroblasts also deprived of serum exhibited a decrease in lactate excretion rates, smaller pool sizes of glycolytic intermediates, and decreased flux from pyruvate to acetyl-CoA. Our findings suggest that cells of different types may actually be in distinct quiescent states, and may have discovered distinct solutions to the metabolic challenges associated with quiescence.</p>
<p>Finally, our findings suggest that contact-inhibited and serum-starved fibroblasts are particularly susceptible to apoptosis induced by treatment with DHEA, a pentose phosphate pathway inhibitor. The ability to selectively kill quiescent cells could have therapeutic potential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Ravandi1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Sehl1">[47]</xref>. For instance, tumor stem cells may exist in a quiescent state for years, while retaining the capacity to emerge from dormancy, proliferate, and initiate a tumor recurrence. Small molecules that target the pathways invoked by these cells to facilitate their survival during dormancy could be useful additions to our therapeutic arsenal. We discovered that contact-inhibited and serum-starved fibroblasts rely on the PPP and possibly other NADPH-generating reactions for viability. Small molecule inhibitors like DHEA might ultimately prove valuable for targeting quiescent tumor cells.</p>

<p>Primary human fibroblasts were isolated from foreskin as previously described (see Supplemental Data in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-LegesseMiller1">[48]</xref>). Fibroblasts were maintained in DMEM (Hyclone, Thermo Fisher Scientific) supplemented with 10% fetal bovine serum (Hyclone) and 100 µg/ml penicillin and streptomycin (Invitrogen). Cells were collected while proliferating, after 1 wk of confluent maintenance (CI7), after 2 wk of confluent maintenance (CI14), after 2 wk of maintenance with the last 7 d in 0.1% serum (CI14SS7), and after serum starvation in 0.1% serum for 3 d, 4 d (SS4), or 7 d (SS7). Cells made quiescent by serum starvation alone were plated sufficiently sparsely so that they did not contact surrounding cells. Medium was changed every 2 d. Proliferating cells were sampled the day after seeding. In order to better simulate conditions in vivo, we also used low glucose/low glutamine conditions in which the glucose level was 1 g/l and the glutamine level was 0.7 mM, compared with a glucose level of 4.5 g/l and a glutamine level of 4 mM in standard DMEM. While cells were confluent, the medium was changed regularly. For analysis, cells were transferred to DMEM (Invitrogen) with 7.5% dialyzed fetal bovine serum (Atlanta Biologicals or Hyclone) the day before the experiment.

Lysates were sonicated with five pulses for 15 s each at 60 J/W. Lysates were then incubated for 30 min on ice with periodic vortexing and cleared by centrifugation for 2–5 min at 4°C at 10,000 rpm. Total protein amount was assessed by the Lowry method using the Bio-Rad DC Protein Assay Kit II (Bio-Rad) as described by the manufacturer. Spectrophotometer readings taken at 650 nm were compared against a standard curve to determine lysate concentration. Total protein content was determined as the product of lysate concentration and lysate volume. Equal amounts of total cellular proteins were resolved on 12% SDS-PAGE and electro-transferred onto a PVDF membrane. Membranes were blocked for 1 h at room temperature in Tris-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (TBS-T) (10 mM Tris [pH 7.6], 15 mM NaCl, and 0.1% Tween-20) or phosphate-buffered saline containing 0.1% Tween-20 (PBS-T) containing 5% nonfat dried milk.

<title>Analysis of Extracellular Matrix Protein Levels in Conditioned Medium</title>
<p>For the analysis of extracellular matrix proteins in conditioned medium, we could not perform the experiments in the presence of high amounts of serum because serum inhibited protein transfer after immunoblotting.

<p>Fluxes were determined by integration of all available forms of experimental data within a quantitative flux-balanced framework using the same strategy as described in Munger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Munger2">[53]</xref>. An ODE model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s003">Figure S3</xref>) of central carbon metabolism was constructed. The model assumes steady-state, mass-balanced flux and simulates the resulting labeling dynamics after switching cells from unlabeled medium to uniformly <sup>13</sup>C-labeled glucose or glutamine. The model consists of 55 ODEs, describing the rate of loss of unlabeled metabolites and the rate of accumulation of labeled metabolites. It builds upon the previously described model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Munger2">[53]</xref> with a few changes. An exchange flux (<italic>F</italic><sub>12</sub>) was introduced in glycolysis between DHAP and FBP. Backward flux (<italic>F</italic><sub>11</sub>) from α-ketoglutarate to citrate, together with a latent citrate pool that is never labeled (determined by the lowest unlabeled citrate pool size observed in all experiments), was introduced in the TCA cycle. The latent citrate pool was added because for citrate, but not other metabolites, a substantial fraction of the pool (approximately 40% for the proliferating cells) did not label over the course of the experiment. Beyond labeling dynamics, additional input data included metabolite levels, rates of metabolite consumption and excretion, and the glycolysis–PPP flux convergence ratio determined after feeding [1, 2-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose for 2 h. Model parameters (fluxes, as well as pool sizes of a small number of metabolites that could not be directly experimentally measured) were identified by a genetic algorithm that minimizes a cost function defined as the sum of weighted differences between the experimental data and computational results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000514.s007">Table S3</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Feng1">[54]</xref>. As a global search algorithm, the genetic algorithm computationally probes for alternative flux solutions consistent with the experimental results. For each cell type, the algorithm was run until 1,000 consistent solutions (i.e., parameter sets that produced the lowest cost values when the algorithm reached convergence) were obtained. The distribution of the 1,000 values was then used to quantitatively represent each identified parameter. Since the distributions are not Gaussian, a flux is considered quantitatively different between proliferating and quiescent cells only when the distributions from the proliferating and quiescent fibroblasts do not overlap. This measure minimizes the false positives that may occur when only one or a few solutions are identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000514-Feng1">[54]</xref>. Although qualitatively supportive of the model-inferred enhancement of anapleurotic flux from glucose in quiescent fibroblasts, labeling data for [3-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose, which was taken at 8 h, were quantitatively inconsistent with the other labeling data, which covered the first 2 h of incubation only. The [3-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose data were accordingly excluded from the computational analysis. The computer code is available upon request.</p>

<p><bold>Modeling results for central carbon metabolism.</bold> (A) Model fits for metabolites in proliferating, CI7, CI14, and CI14SS7 fibroblasts. Experimentally measured concentrations of different labeled and unlabeled metabolites (mean ± one standard deviation) at the indicated time points are plotted against the model predictions (smooth curves) from a typical flux solution set. The time axis is in logarithmic scale to better illustrate the samples at early time points. Data and simulated results for [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glucose labeling experiments are labeled by the metabolite name only. For the [U-<sup>13</sup>C]-glutamine labeling, a “Q” precedes the metabolite name. (B) Histogram of the distribution of consistent fluxes in each condition. The <italic>x</italic>-axis indicates the flux values (in logarithmic scale); the <italic>y</italic>-axis is the number of counts (within the 1,000 consistent solution sets) that have a specific flux value. The resultant solution distribution provides a representation of the fluxes that are potentially consistent with the observed laboratory data in each cell state.</p>
