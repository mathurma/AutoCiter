        <p>The analysis of network evolution has been hampered by limited availability of protein interaction data for different organisms. In this study, we investigate evolutionary mechanisms in Src Homology 3 (SH3) domain and kinase interaction networks using high-resolution specificity profiles. We constructed and examined networks for 23 fungal species ranging from <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> to <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>. We quantify rates of different rewiring mechanisms and show that interaction change through binding site evolution is faster than through gene gain or loss. We found that SH3 interactions evolve swiftly, at rates similar to those found in phosphoregulation evolution. Importantly, we show that interaction changes are sufficiently rapid to exhibit saturation phenomena at the observed timescales. Finally, focusing on the SH3 interaction network, we observe extensive clustering of binding sites on target proteins by SH3 domains and a strong correlation between the number of domains that bind a target protein (target in-degree) and interaction conservation. The relationship between in-degree and interaction conservation is driven by two different effects, namely the number of clusters that correspond to interaction interfaces and the number of domains that bind to each cluster leads to sequence specific conservation, which in turn results in interaction conservation. In summary, we uncover several network evolution mechanisms likely to generalize across peptide recognition modules.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Protein interaction networks control virtually all cellular processes. The rules governing their evolution have remained elusive, as comprehensive protein interaction data is available for only a small number of very distant species, making evolutionary network studies difficult. Here we attempt to overcome this limitation by computationally constructing protein interaction networks for 23 relatively tightly spaced yeast species. We focus on networks consisting of kinase and peptide binding domain interactions, which play central roles in signaling pathways. These networks enable us to investigate evolutionary network mechanisms. We are able, for the first time, to accurately quantify the contribution of different rewiring mechanisms. Interaction change appears to be mainly accomplished through binding site evolution rather than through gene gain or loss. This is in contrast to other evolutionary processes, where gene duplication or deletion is a major driving factor. Moreover, our analysis reveals that interaction changes are very fast – fast enough that the number of changes saturates, i.e., the actual rate of change has been strongly underestimated in previous studies. Our analysis also reveals different mechanisms by which certain interactions are conserved throughout evolution. Our results likely transfer to other species and networks, and will benefit future evolutionary studies of signaling pathways.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Peptide recognition modules (PRMs) and kinase domains bind short linear peptide motifs on their protein binding partners and are integral members of many signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Pawson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Manning1">[3]</xref>. PRM members include the SH3 (Src homology 3), SH2 (Src homology 2), and PDZ (PSD-95/Discs-large/ZO-1) domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Pawson1">[1]</xref>. In this study, we focus on the SH3 domain, a small (∼60 amino acids) domain, implicated in crucial regulatory processes such as signal transduction, cytoskeleton organization, and cell polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Pawson2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Mayer1">[5]</xref>. SH3 domains typically bind short proline rich peptides containing a PxxP binding motif <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Mayer1">[5]</xref>. Initial structural analysis revealed two main binding classes, although variations to these canonical SH3 binding motifs have also been discovered.</p>
      <p>Experimental identification of the short peptide binding motifs recognized by PRMs has been performed using a number of methods, such as synthetic peptide arrays (SPOT), oriented peptide array libraries (OPAL), protein domain microarrays, and phage display <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Pawson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Tonikian1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Landgraf1">[10]</xref>. Binding specificity maps have been generated for <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> SH3 and kinase domains using phage display and combinatorial peptide library screening approaches, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Tonikian1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Mok1">[11]</xref>. Domain binding specificities from these experimental methods are captured in position weight matrices (PWMs) enabling comprehensive and high confidence predictions of physical interactions involving SH3 and kinase domains. The high accuracy of these PWM predictions has been demonstrated in their ability to recapitulate interactions derived from orthogonal experimental methods such as yeast two-hybrid <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Tonikian1">[6]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Interaction network studies have uncovered network properties such as scale-free and hierarchical topologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Barabasi1">[12]</xref>, resulting in the development of models describing protein interaction network evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Barabasi1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Kim1">[15]</xref>. Network rewiring rates for protein interaction networks have also been established for proteins in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> that have paralogs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Wagner1">[16]</xref>, model eukaryotic protein interaction networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao1">[17]</xref>, and yeast regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao2">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Lavoie1">[20]</xref>. A global comparative analysis on network rewiring from existing experimental datasets has suggested that regulatory networks are among the fastest evolving biological networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Shou1">[21]</xref>. However, these comparative studies are hampered by two problems: The analyzed networks are often incomplete and the species examined are highly diverged. An obvious problem is that interactions in species similar to the model organisms (such as yeast or worm) are usually inferred by means of orthology mapping, which prohibits any kind of evolutionary analysis based on them <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Matthews1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Yu1">[23]</xref>. Unlike these mapping methods, predicting interactions via PWMs enables generation of interaction networks in a species-independent manner. This permits a more accurate means to identify both conserved and diverged interactions, as interactions are determined by a domain's binding specificity and not by orthologous protein pairs, thus enabling the evaluation of different evolutionary mechanisms that give rise to the observed rates of network rewiring.</p>
      <p>In this study, we use the aforementioned high resolution <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SH3 and kinase specificity maps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Tonikian1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Mok1">[11]</xref> to computationally predict high confidence SH3 and kinase interaction networks for 23 species belonging to the Ascomycota phylum of the Fungal kingdom, representing over 300 million years of evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Sipiczki1">[24]</xref>. We quantify network evolution rates for different network rewiring mechanisms and compare them to other network evolutionary rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao2">[18]</xref>. Furthermore, we show that the rate of network rewiring reaches saturation due to the rapid rate of interaction change. Moreover, we uncover interaction conservation patterns related to multiple SH3 domains binding the same proline rich region on a protein binding partner. Finally, we show motif specific sequence conservation translates to the conservation of interactions.</p>

        <title>SH3 and kinase interaction networks for 23 fungal species</title>
        <p>Using position weight matrix (PWM) profiles derived from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> phage display experiments and combinatorial peptide library screens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Tonikian1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Mok1">[11]</xref>, we constructed SH3 and kinase interaction networks in 23 different fungal species spanning over 300 million years of evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g001">Figure 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Note that our methodology does not rely on sequence homology to predict interactions in different species, enabling the identification of species-specific interactions through binding profiles. Sequence homology is used only in the comparison of interaction networks between different species. The SH3 predicted network, using 30 PWMs from <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> resulted in ∼800 interactions and ∼400 unique proteins for each of the 23 yeast species. Likewise, the kinase network, using 63 PWMs, resulted in ∼1800 interactions and ∼450 unique proteins. Parameters to create the networks were selected using the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC) and the Matthews correlation coefficient metrics (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). In <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s001">Figure S1</xref> we provide estimates over a range of true positive and true negative ratios.</p>

High scoring interactions are selected and merged together on a per species basis to form SH3 and kinase interaction networks.

        <p>To compare the constructed networks and infer interaction conservation among the different yeast species, orthology assignments provided by Wapinski and co-workers were used to establish orthology relationships for all proteins in the networks (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Wapinski1">[25]</xref>. We further ensured that orthologs to the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SH3 and kinase proteins contained the particular SH3 and kinase domains, respectively. Here, we assume domain binding specificities found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> to be similar for orthologous proteins, even for distant species. While this is a critical assumption, five different observations suggest it is reasonable for the proteins analyzed. First, we examined paralogous domains in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> since they tend to be under weaker purifying selection than non-duplicated genes and are likely to diverge at faster rates than proteins in different species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Koonin1">[26]</xref>. We find paralogous SH3 proteins to have very high PWM similarity, especially considering those above 80% amino acid sequence identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Second, we show orthologs and paralogs share the same amino acids at similar, presumably binding determining, positions in a multiple sequence alignment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Third, SH3 domain crystal structures reveal contact amino acids to a bound ligand are highly conserved in orthologs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Fourth, orthologs to <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SH3 and kinase domains exhibit a high degree of amino acid identity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s005">Figure S5A and S6</xref>). Fifth and finally, for many following analysis, we use two species sets: one where we use all 23 species and a restricted set, where we use orthologs with an amino acid sequence identity greater than 80% (for which binding specificity is almost guaranteed to be conserved). In all cases, we observe the same results.</p>

        <title>SH3 and kinase interaction network structure and topology is conserved</title>
        <p>To assess the similarity of the fungal networks with each other, we created phylogenetic trees from the orthology mapped interaction networks, based on the number of conserved interactions between species (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). Importantly, we found that the phylogenetic trees derived from the predicted SH3 and kinase interactions () are remarkably similar to the canonical protein sequence-based phylogeny (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), suggesting that the interaction networks share similar evolutionary properties as genome sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Fitzpatrick1">[27]</xref>. While we observe similar phylogenetic trees for the fungal species, analysis spanning the 3 domains of life revealed topological differences between the metabolic pathway and sequence based phylogenetic trees, representing many more years of evolution <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Podani1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Woese1">[30]</xref>. Despite the phylogenetic similarities for the fungal species, only 5 SH3 interactions are conserved across all 23 yeast species, translating to ∼1% of all <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> SH3 interactions. For kinases, not a single interaction is conserved across all kinase interaction networks given the defined thresholds and orthology mappings. The limited number of globally conserved interactions indicates that phylogenetic similarities are due to conservation of the network structure and topology rather than individual interactions between orthologs.</p>

First, an interaction can be lost or gained but both the binding and target proteins are evolutionary retained, which we refer to as “interaction rewiring” (i.e., orthologs exist for the associated genes of the binding and target proteins). Second, the binding or target protein itself can be gained or lost (i.e. through a gene duplication), which we refer to as a “protein change”. To examine interaction differences observed in these networks, we quantified rates of interaction rewiring and protein change in both the SH3 and kinase networks and compared them to previously reported rates for other types of interaction networks.</p>
        <p>To attain a rate of interaction rewiring, we need to ascertain the number of interaction changes between two species as well as their divergence time (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). We find that the interaction rewiring rate decreases sharply as the divergence distance increases for the SH3 and kinase interaction networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s008">Figure S8A</xref>) in addition to being slower than in random networks (p-value&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s009">Figure S9</xref>). This suggests that to obtain an accurate rewiring rate one has to use closely related species, as the estimated rewiring rates are dependent on divergence distance and hence the selected reference species. For example, the rates of interaction rewiring in the SH3 network between closely related species 1) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic> and between distant species 2) <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> are 3.86×10<sup>−4</sup> and 4.01×10<sup>−5</sup> interaction rewirings per protein pair per million years respectively. Indeed, using the nearest evolutionary species as a reference, <italic>S. octosporus</italic>, for <italic>S. pombe</italic> results in an over 4 times increase to 1.85×10<sup>−4</sup> interaction rewiring per protein per million years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s014">Table S1</xref>). Intuitively, this phenomenon may be explained by a saturation of interaction changes at longer evolutionary distances. A similar result is observed when selecting SH3 domains above a range of amino acid identity thresholds (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s015">Table S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s010">Figure S10</xref>), indicating that our assumption of orthologs retaining similar specificities is reasonable, as noted above.</p>
        <p>To investigate this saturation effect, we examined the absolute number of interaction changes with respect to divergence time. Importantly, we find the number of SH3 and kinase interaction rewiring events is sufficiently rapid to reach saturation in about 200 million years of divergence since the last common ancestor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s008">Figure S8B</xref>). This saturation effect is analogous to the saturation of neutral sequence substitutions in the comparison of highly divergent sequences resulting in a biased dN/dS ratio, due to the inability to observe multiple substitutions at the same nucleotide positions thus resulting in a deflated dS value. The observed decrease in interaction rewiring rate is dominated by divergence distance and possibly reflects the inability to observe multiple rewirings of the same interaction, as the loss followed by a gain of the same interaction appears as a conserved interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s014">Table S1</xref>). Previous studies that quantified evolutionary rates for network changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao2">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Borneman1">[19]</xref> used relatively distant species for comparison and were hence likely hampered by this issue. Thus we expect that they have underestimated the true evolutionary rate.</p>
        <p>Similar to interaction rewiring, the rate of protein change is also dependent on the selected reference species. Using the nearest species to calculate rates in the SH3 network, the average rate of protein change is 1.95×10<sup>−5</sup> protein changes per protein pair per million years while the average rate of interaction rewiring is 1.61×10<sup>−4</sup> interaction rewiring per protein pair per million years (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s014">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s016">S3</xref>). An almost 10-fold difference between rates in interaction rewiring and protein change suggests that interaction rewiring is the primary mechanism for determining the overall rate of interaction change in the SH3 interaction network. A similar result is observed in the kinase network (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s015">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s017">S4</xref>). SH3 and kinase signaling interactions are known to evolve more rapidly than metabolic and other protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Shou1">[21]</xref>, due to the short protein binding surface area forming the interaction interface. Additionally, the time scale to observe the saturation phenomena in these networks is significantly smaller than the time scales used in previous comparison studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Shou1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Yu1">[23]</xref>. Here we find the dominant mechanism for interaction change, at the observed time scale, is by interaction rewiring for these signaling networks. This is reminiscent of the study by Zhong <italic>et al.</italic> who found the mechanisms of interaction rewiring and protein change corresponded to distinct mutation events. They further found single genes associated with multiple diseases could be explained by interaction rewiring (ie. network perturbation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Zhong1">[31]</xref>. Thus the rapid rewiring rate exhibited in the SH3 and kinase networks conceivably enables the discovery of new functionality while maintaining the same gene repertoire.</p>

        <title>Rates of interaction change in the SH3 and transcription factor networks are similar to rates found in the kinase network</title>
        <p>A previous study examined the rate of interaction change (i.e. the combination of interaction rewiring and protein change rates) associated with phosphosite and transcription factor regulatory networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao2">[18]</xref>. We therefore compared rates for these networks to rates for our SH3 and kinase interaction networks. To provide an unbiased comparison, by compensating for the aforementioned saturation phenomenon, we computed interaction change rates of our kinase network using <italic>S. cerevisae</italic> as the sole reference strain instead of the closest related species and observed similar rates between the two networks. Specifically, interactions in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> phosphosite network were reported to change at a rate of 1.09×10<sup>−5</sup> and 1.24×10<sup>−5</sup> interaction changes per protein pair per million years, respectively after adjusting to our orthology mappings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao2">[18]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s018">Table S5</xref>). Importantly, we found that interaction changes in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> kinase networks occur at a comparable rate, 3.68×10<sup>−5</sup> and 3.89×10<sup>−5</sup> interaction changes per protein pair per million years respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s015">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s017">S4</xref>), when <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> was used as the reference species. Considering that our computational approach is likely to contain some false positives and false negatives, the calculated rates may be overestimated. Thus, the close agreement between our findings and the Beltrao <italic>et al</italic> phosphosite network study supports the validity of our computational approach.</p>
        <p>We next quantified rates in the <italic>C. albicans</italic> and <italic>S. pombe</italic> SH3 networks and found that they change at a rate of 5.90×10<sup>−5</sup> and 5.47×10<sup>−5</sup> interaction changes per protein pair per million years, respectively (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s014">Table S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s016">S3</xref>). Interestingly, interaction changes in the SH3 networks occur at similar rates compared to interaction changes in the kinase and phosphosite networks.</p>
        <p>Rates for the transcription factor-DNA (TF-DNA) interactions have also been deduced for <italic>S. mikatae</italic> and <italic>S. bayanus</italic> regulatory networks using <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as a reference species. We found that the rates of interaction change associated with these regulatory networks (1.02×10<sup>−3</sup> and 5.91×10<sup>−4</sup> interaction changes per transcription factor-gene pair per million years for <italic>S. mikatae</italic> and <italic>S. bayanus</italic>, respectively) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s019">Table S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao2">[18]</xref> are similar to the SH3 interaction network rates of interaction change for the same species (4.82×10<sup>−4</sup> and 4.24×10<sup>−4</sup> interaction changes per protein pair per million years for <italic>S. mikatae</italic> and <italic>S. bayanus</italic> respectively) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002411-t001">Table 1</xref>). Given enhancer regions diverge at a fast rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Tautz1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Schmidt1">[33]</xref>, transcription factor interactions are expected to change rapidly.</p>

        <title>Global trends in interaction conservation</title>
        <p>The rates above highlight the plastic nature of SH3 and kinase interaction changes which in addition to the lack of a significant correlation between a SH3 PWM's entropy and the rate of interaction rewiring (ρ = −0.067, p-value = 0.724, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s011">Figure S11</xref>) suggest detecting conserved interaction signals to be difficult. Interestingly, we readily observed global trends of network conservation. Using <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as the reference species, we found a significant correlation between the number of domains that bind a target protein and the degree to with interactions are conserved, for both the SH3 (ρ = 0.466, p-value&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>) and kinase (ρ = 0.337, p-value&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>) interaction networks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>). These correlations explain 16% and 10% of the variance, respectively, where interaction conservation is the fraction of species retaining an interaction found in <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>. This suggests targeted proteins may retain interactions by maintaining many interaction partners (ie. the target protein has a high in-degree).</p>

        <p>To identify mechanisms giving rise to the above correlation, we use the position specific binding information provided by the PWMs to determine the exact region bound by a domain on a target protein (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found that high in-degree target proteins have peptide regions bound by multiple SH3 domains, forming binding site clusters primarily in proline rich regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g004">Figure cluster 4A</xref>). Binding site cluster formation may be attributed to two modes: 1) binding by the same SH3 specificity class and 2) binding by multiple SH3 specificity classes that share a common PXXP core, where X is any amino acid. As an example, Srv2p contains a multiclass cluster composed of class I, II, and III SH3 domain binders (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g004">Figure 4A</xref>).

        <p>Having identified cluster formations at SH3 target binding sites, we explored the relationship between the size of the binding site clusters and interaction conservation. A significant correlation was found between cluster size and interaction conservation (ρ = 0.192, p-value = 4.67×10<sup>−6</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), though not as significant as the correlation found at the global level of protein interactions between the number of interacting SH3 domains and interaction conservation. Interestingly, cluster sizes greater than 7 fail to exhibit the same degree of interaction conservation as proteins whose in-degree are of the same magnitude. Since proteins with many interacting SH3 domains may contain multiple clusters, this suggests the number of binding clusters may play a role in determining an interaction's conservation degree. Pursuing this observation, we find a significant correlation between the number of binding site clusters and interaction conservation (ρ = 0.461, p-value = 5.85×10<sup>−12</sup>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002411-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). This is in agreement with previous studies suggesting that the amount of a protein participating in interactions is more conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Fraser1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Kim2">[35]</xref>. The existence of disjoint clusters is analogous to the existence of several different interaction interfaces participating in a complex formation, which is most likely driving the correlation with interaction conservation. Similar observations are found within the kinase interaction network where correlations between interaction conservation and both binding site cluster size (ρ = 0.210, p-value = 1.40×10<sup>−14</sup>) and the number of clusters (ρ = 0.296, p-value = 6.48×10<sup>−10</sup>) are found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002411.s012">Figure S12</xref>).</p>

        <title>Sequence specific conservation relates to interaction conservation</title>
        <p>Cluster formation at binding sites suggests that the sequence could be evolutionary constrained to preserve recognition by multiple binding domains. To investigate the relationship between sequence conservation and interaction conservation we measured the binding site divergence using the AL2CO algorithm (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Pei1">[36]</xref> and observe a significant correlation between sequence conservation and binding cluster size (ρ = 0.241, p-value = 2.80×10<sup>−5</sup>), indicating the existence of selective pressure to maintain sequence conservation due to multiple interacting partners. However, the relative contribution of different target binding site amino acids to a domain's binding specificity varies wildly. Consider the binding specificity of a class I SH3 domain with the consensus sequence RXXPXXP, where X is any amino acid. The first, middle, and last positions of the binding site are constrained to specific anchor amino acids, whereas the other positions are free to evolve to any other amino acid. Thus from the perspective of the class I domain, a binding site is conserved when the 3 anchor amino acids are present, while the other amino acids are free to evolve.</p>
        <p>To measure the conservation of a target peptide sequence relative to a SH3 domain's binding specificity we developed a new metric. Using <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> as the reference species, for an observed target binding site, we first calculate its PWM score and the PWM score for all orthologous proteins. The difference between a species' PWM score to that of the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ortholog indicates the relative amount the target site has evolved. To provide a summary metric, PWM scores for each ortholog are weighted by their divergence distance from the <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> ortholog (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>). While many previous studies sought to identify conserved protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Matthews1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Yu1">[23]</xref>, here we show that this metric enables identification of both conserved and evolving interactions. Conserved interactions have values near zero as is the case for Srv2p which contains a highly conserved binding cluster of size 6. Evolutionary changing interactions bind evolving target binding sites identified by negative values, larger magnitudes indicate recently acquired target binding sites. One example of an evolved target binding site is found on Ubp7p in a cluster size of 5. The metric captures the evolving binding site, while only weak sequence conservation is observed. Not surprisingly, a significant correlation between the metric and interaction conservation (ρ = 0.425, p-value&lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>) is observed, highlighting the metric's ability to capture sequence conservation relevant to interaction conservation. In line with this, we find a significant correlation between the metric and binding site cluster size (ρ = 0.271, p-value = 2.41×10<sup>−6</sup>). This result demonstrates that binding specificity from multiple domains indeed places evolutionary constraint on the target binding site sequence.</p>
        <p>In conclusion, we use the specificity profiles of a common signaling domain to generate a model network for the fungal clade spanning a wide range of evolutionary distances. In this manner we overcome the difficulty of comparing interaction networks of very divergent model organisms derived from a limited amount of experimental interaction data. We draw a number of conclusions that are biologically important: First, we find that the major driver of evolution of signaling pathways is interaction change and not gene duplication or loss. Second, we find network interaction changes are so rapid that they swiftly saturate, a phenomenon future studies will need to consider. Finally, we find signatures of network conservation and propose associated mechanisms. We expect our results can be generalized to many other signaling domains, such as SH2, WW, and PDZ domains, since they are affected by the same fundamental evolutionary processes.</p>

        <p>Parameter selection was performed using the area under the receiver operator curve (AUROC). Other binary classification metrics such as Matthews correlation coefficient (MCC) resulted in the same parameters being selected. To measure model performance, both true positive and true negative sets are required. For SH3 interactions, true positive interactions were retrieved from Tonikian <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Tonikian1">[6]</xref> and true negative interactions were created using randomly selected interacting partners for each SH3 domains. The true negative set was constrained to exclude protein pairs annotated with overlapping cellular compartments, additionally true positive interactions were removed from the negative set. The parameter selected for the SH3 interaction network were the top scoring 30 interactions for each class, with accessibility and disorder scores respectively greater than 3 and 0 to achieve AUROC and MCC values of 0.86 and 0.79 respectively. For the kinase interaction network we used data from Breitkreutz <italic>et al</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Breitkreutz1">[49]</xref>.

The kinase network true negative set was constructed in the same manner as the SH3 negative. Parameters selected for the kinase interaction network were top 360 interactions for each PWM class, accessibility score greater than 4.0 and a disorder score greater than 0.9 to achieve AUROC and MCC values of 1 and 0.16 respectively.

Two network comparison types were performed, global and local, respectively based on the absence or use of exact amino acid positional target binding information. Global comparisons involve determining the interaction conservation between two proteins. Here an interaction is conserved if any of the target proteins has an ortholog found to also be a binding partner for a given protein domain (one-to-one and one-to-many orthology relationships). Local comparisons are used in identifying conserved interactions when estimating the network rewiring rate. To simplify network comparisons for evolutionary rate calculations, we constrained orthology mappings to one-to-one and many-to-one relationships with respect to the reference species, thus ensuring at most a single protein per species exists in a multiple sequence alignment for each reference species' protein. Orthology mappings are established using the shortest distance between genes, where the distances are derived from the orthogroup's reconstructed gene tree, as orthogroups encompass both orthologs and paralogs.

        <p>The network rewiring mechanism of “interaction rewiring” and “protein change” require the identification of conserved interactions, as the absence of a conserved interaction is an interaction change. For interaction rewiring, an interaction is conserved if there exists a target binding site within a window centered on the reference species' target binding site plus 10 flanking amino acids. For protein change, interaction conservation is based solely on the existence of a protein ortholog.</p>
        <p>Rates of interaction change with respect to a reference species were calculated in the same manner as Beltrao <italic>et. al.</italic> using the following equation:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002411.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>intChanges</italic> is the number of gained and lost interactions, <italic>orthDomainProteins</italic> is the number of orthologous proteins between the two species in comparison containing a SH3 or kinase domain, <italic>orthProteins</italic> is the number of orthologous proteins, and <italic>divergenceTime</italic> is the divergence time in millions of years separating the two species <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002411-Beltrao2">[18]</xref>. Rates for both network rewiring mechanisms of interaction rewiring and protein change were calculated using the above equation. This equation can be viewed as the fraction of the interaction changes versus all possible interactions amongst proteins with orthologs and normalized by the divergence distance between the two compared species interaction networks.</p>
        <p>Determining if rates of interaction rewiring significantly differ between the predicted network and random networks, 1000 sets of randomized interaction networks for each of the 23 species were created. The networks were randomized such that protein degree and the total number of nodes within the 23 interaction networks were maintained. For each set of randomized networks, the rate of interaction rewiring was calculated and compared against rates found in the original interaction networks.</p>
        <p>Estimating the error in network rewiring was performed in the SH3 interaction network and between the two closest yeast species: <italic>S.cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>S. paradoxus</italic>.
