          <title>Background</title>
          <p><italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline stem cells (GSCs) reside adjacent to a cellular niche that secretes Bone Morphogenetic Protein (BMP) ligands and anchors the GSCs through adherens junctions. The GSCs divide asymmetrically such that one daughter remains in the niche as a GSC, while the other is born away from the niche and differentiates. However, given that the BMP signal can be diffusible, it remains unclear how a local extracellular asymmetry is sufficient to result in a robust pattern of asymmetric division.</p>
        </sec>
        <sec>
          <title>Methods and Findings</title>
          <p>Here we show that GSCs are polarized with respect to the cellular niche. We first use a modified biosensor to demonstrate that the small GTPase Rac is asymmetrically activated within the GSC at the niche-GSC interface. Experiments using loss-of-function and gain-of-function mutations in Rac indicate that asymmetric Rac activity both localizes the microtubule binding protein Apc2 to orient one GSC centrosome at the niche-GSC interface during interphase and activates the Jun N-terminal kinase pathway to increase the ability of the GSC to respond to BMP ligands. Other processes act in concert with each function of Rac. Specifically, we demonstrate that the GSC cell cycle arrests at prometaphase if centrosomes are misoriented.</p>

        <sec>
          <title>Conclusions</title>
          <p>Thus, the GSCs, an adult stem cell present in a cellular niche, have a niche-associated polarity that couples control of the division plane with increased response to an extracellular maintenance signal. Other processes work in parallel with the Rac-mediated polarity to ensure a robust pattern of asymmetric division. We suggest that all adult stem cells likely employ multiple, independently acting mechanisms to ensure asymmetric division to maintain tissue homeostasis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Adult stem cells are undifferentiated cells within an organism that undergo continual asymmetric division to produce two daughter cells that have different cell fates: one daughter remains a stem cell like its parent, while the other daughter differentiates. Thus the stock of stem cells is renewed while new cells are provided to ensure tissue maintenance. Often, an adult stem cell is present within a niche, a specific microenvironment that contains signals necessary to maintain the stem cell in an undifferentiated state. The plane of division of a niche-resident stem cell can be controlled so that one of its daughters arises outside of the niche. This daughter does not receive the maintenance signals and differentiates. However, because biological systems are inherently noisy, we postulated that there might be mechanisms that couple the control of the plane of stem cell division to the response to the extracellular maintenance signals to ensure a continued pattern of asymmetric division. In this study, we show that a well-characterized niche-resident stem cell, the <italic>Drosophila</italic> female germline stem cell (GSC), also has an intracellular polarity that contributes to the determination of daughter cell fate. We find that the small GTPase Rac is activated at the interface between the GSC and its niche and that this localized Rac activity has two functions: first, it orients the plane of GSC division to ensure that one GSC daughter is born outside the niche; and second, it increases the ability of the niche-resident GSC to respond to the maintenance signal. We propose that most stem cells integrate multiple mechanisms to ensure a robust pattern of asymmetric division.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>A robust pattern of asymmetric cell division underlies the ability of adult stem cells to balance self-renewal and differentiation to ensure tissue homeostasis. In principle, either of two mechanisms could underlie the asymmetric cell division: first, a polarization in the stem cell could result in the asymmetric segregation of cytoplasmic determinants to one daughter; alternatively, the two descendant sister cells could be initially equivalent but respond differently to specific stimuli in their microenvironments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Horvitz1">[1]</xref>. However, in either case, the mechanism that generates the asymmetry must be coordinated with the control of the plane of cell division. For example, in <italic>Drosophila</italic> neuroblasts, a polarity within the stem cell, mediated by the asymmetric localization of multiple protein complexes that are organized by the Par-3 homolog Bazooka, couples the asymmetric segregation of cellular determinants with control of the orientation of the neuroblast division plane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Knoblich1">[2]</xref>. In contrast, a cellular niche could promote an asymmetric self renewal division in an adult stem cell by secreting a locally acting maintenance factor and by orienting the plane of stem cell division such that one daughter is born outside the niche and is not exposed to the maintenance factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Morrison1">[3]</xref>. However, it remains an open question whether a stem cell residing in a cellular niche could also have a polarity that links the response to the maintenance signal with a mechanism that orients the division plane.</p>
      <p>Both female and male germ line stem cells (GSCs) in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are present in well-defined cellular niches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Fuller1">[4]</xref>. In females, the niche comprises three somatic cell types: the terminal filament cells, which are the most-anterior cells in each ovariole; a small number of the Cap Cells (CpCs), which form adherens junctions with the GSCs; and escort cells, which enwrap each GSC with thin cytoplasmic extensions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Song1">[5]</xref>. The female niche is of limited size and can accommodate only two to three GSCs. CpCs secrete BMP ligands that are necessary and sufficient for GSC maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xie1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xie2">[7]</xref>. Each GSC, which contains a cytoskeletal rich organelle called the spectrosome adjacent to the niche, divides with an invariant mitotic spindle orientation perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Deng1">[8]</xref>. The daughter born in the niche has high levels of BMP signaling and remains a GSC, while the daughter born outside the niche has much lower levels of BMP signaling and becomes a Cystoblast (Cb) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Kai1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Song2">[11]</xref>. The reduction in BMP signaling in Cbs allows expression of <italic>bag of marbles</italic> (<italic>bam</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Song2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Chen1">[12]</xref>, which promotes Cb differentiation by transiently downregulating two translational inhibitors, Nanos and Pumilio <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Li1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Kim1">[14]</xref>, and by blocking BMP signal transduction downstream of the BMP receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Casanueva1">[10]</xref>. The Cbs undergo four rounds of synchronized division with incomplete cytokinesis to generate a cyst composed of 16 cells connected by a branched fusome derived from the spectrosome. One cyst cell becomes an oocyte; the others become polyploid nurse cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Telfer1">[15]</xref>.</p>

          <p>(A) GSCs in the CpC niche. Two to three GSCs are present in a niche composed of Terminal Filament cells (TFs), Cap Cells (CpCs), and Escort Cells (EsCs). The GSCs are anchored to the CpCs by Adherens Junctions (AJs). Each GSC contains a cytoskeletal organelle, the spectrosome (light orange) adjacent to the niche. One centrosome (red star) is present at the niche-GSC interface. After centrosome duplication, a centrosome migrates around the cortex (dotted line with arrow). The plane of GSC division is perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface. One daughter cell, the Cystoblast (Cb), is born outside of the niche and the other daughter cell remains in the niche as a GSC. During GSC division, the spectrosome elongates, and some spectrosomal material is segregated to the Cb. GSCs have high levels of BMP signaling, which leads to the transcription of <italic>dad</italic> and the repression of <italic>bam</italic> expression. Cbs have much lower levels of BMP signaling and transcribe <italic>bam</italic>. Bam functions to promote Cb differentiation and to inhibit BMP signaling.

      <p>The structure of the male niche at the tip of the testis is similar to, but different from, the female niche. The male niche comprises two somatic cell types, the hub cells, which cluster together to form a cellular cone surrounded by a circle of 6–12 GSCs, and the cyst stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Fuller1">[4]</xref>. Similar to female GSCs, male GSCs are anchored by adherens junctions to the hub cells, and divide with an orientation that is perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>. The GSC daughter born away from the niche differentiates into a Gonialblast that divides four times to produce 16 interconnected spermatogonia, each of which undergoes meiosis to give rise to four sperm. The hub cells secrete Unpaired, a ligand for the JAK/STAT pathway, which is necessary for continued GSC maintenance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Kiger1">[17]</xref>. Recent results suggest Upd is necessary for GSC adhesion to the niche and likely acts upon the cyst stem cells to create a protected microenvironment for the GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Leatherman1">[18]</xref>, possibly including secretion of a BMP ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Kawase1">[19]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In both sexes, the GSCs divide with an orientation perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface. In male GSCs, adherens junctions between the hub cells and the GSC localize the astral microtubule binding protein Apc2 at the niche-GSC interface to position the GSC centrosome during interphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita2">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Inaba1">[21]</xref>. After centrosome duplication, the mother centrosome, which has a robust array of microtubules, remains at the niche-GSC interface, while the daughter centrosome, which has few associated microtubules, migrates around the cortex to orient the mitotic spindle perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita2">[20]</xref>. Moreover, misorientation of the centrosomes results in a cell cycle arrest after centrosome duplication in the G2 stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Cheng1">[22]</xref>. Thus, in males, the adherens junctions provide a polarity cue that orients an interphase centrosome to presage the orientation of the mitotic spindle and the plane of GSC division, but a second mechanism, a G2 cell cycle arrest, acts to ensure the robustness of the division plane.</p>
      <p>Although the mitotic plane of female GSCs is also oriented perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface, the mechanism by which it is done is less clear. In females, unlike males, the spectrosome abuts the GSC-niche interface, and <italic>hts</italic> mutants, which lack a morphologically identifiable spectrosome, have a randomized orientation of the mitotic spindle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Deng1">[8]</xref>, suggesting that the spectrosome may aid in the positioning of the spindle.</p>
      <p>In both male and female GSCs, a change in orientation of the mitotic spindle is correlated with a change in daughter cell fate. Randomization of male GSC centrosome orientation, by mutations in <italic>Apc2</italic> or the centrosomal component <italic>centrosomin</italic>, causes an increase in GSC number <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>, as a larger number of GSC daughters become associated with the niche. Likewise, if one female GSC is lost from the niche, the remaining GSC divides with a spindle oriented parallel to the niche-GSC interface such that both daughters remain in the niche and adopt GSC fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xie2">[7]</xref>. These observations suggest that there may be a mechanism that directly couples the orientation of the plane of GSC division to the response to the extracellular maintenance signal.</p>
      <p>In this article, we show that in female GSCs the small GTPase Rac is asymmetrically activated at the GSC-niche interface. Activated Rac both orients interphase centrosomes by localizing Apc2 to the niche-GSC interface and increases GSC responsiveness to the BMP signal by activating the Jun N-terminal kinase (JNK) pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Both actions of Rac are functionally redundant with other processes, likely to ensure robustness of this asymmetric division. Thus, in GSCs, a niche-associated polarity influences both the plane of cell division and the response to the extracellular maintenance signal.</p>

        <title>Rac Is Asymmetrically Activated in GSCs</title>
        <p><italic>Rac1</italic> was identified in a microarray experiment for genes that are expressed in GSCs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s008">Text S1</xref>). In situ hybridization validated <italic>Rac1</italic> transcription in some wild-type GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and in some GSC-like cells in tumorous germaria caused by expression of a constitutively active form of the BMP type I receptor Thickveins (<italic>TkvAct</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Casanueva1">[10]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Because <italic>Rac1</italic> is not expressed in all GSCs at all times, <italic>Rac1</italic> transcription is likely modulated by other factors, possibly including the state of the cell cycle. The three Rac family members in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, <italic>Rac1</italic>, <italic>Rac2</italic>, and <italic>Mtl</italic> have partially redundant functions in other tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-HakedaSuzuki1">[23]</xref>. Although in situ hybridization failed to reveal germline transcription of <italic>Rac2</italic> or <italic>Mtl</italic> (unpublished data), we investigated the function of the Rac GTPases in GSC maintenance by eliminating the activity of as many family members as possible. Thus, we used mitotic recombination to generate clones of GSCs homozygous for <italic>Rac1</italic> and <italic>Rac2</italic> mutations and heterozygous for an <italic>Mtl</italic> mutation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1B</xref>), referred to as “<italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs.” We compared the persistence of <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSC clones to control wild-type GSC clones in the anterior germarium. While the half-life of wild-type GSC clones was over 4 wk, GSC clones mutant for <italic>Rac2</italic> and either the hypomorphic allele <italic>Rac1<sup>J10</sup></italic> or the null allele <italic>Rac1<sup>J11</sup></italic> had a half-life of 2 wk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1D</xref>), demonstrating that Rac promotes GSC maintenance. However, <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs are lost more slowly than GSCs defective in BMP signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xie1">[6]</xref> or GSCs defective in adherens junctions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Song1">[5]</xref>, both of which have a half-life of approximately 3–5 d.</p>
        <p>An anti-human Rac1 antibody stained the cortex of all germ cells including the niche-GSC interface, which is marked by the adherens junction component, DE-Cadherin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1C</xref>). Anti-Rac staining was increased in germaria in which a constitutively active allele of <italic>Rac1</italic>, <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic>, was expressed using a germline-specific driver, <italic>nos</italic>-Gal4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1D</xref>), and markedly reduced in germaria in which RNAi constructs against <italic>Rac1</italic> and <italic>Rac2</italic> were expressed using the <italic>nos</italic>-Gal4 driver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1E</xref>), referred to as “<italic>Rac-RNAi</italic> GSCs,” confirming the antibody specifically recognizes <italic>Drosophila</italic> Rac proteins.</p>
        <p>To determine the subcellular localization of active GTP-bound Rac in GSCs, we adapted a previously reported biosensor, the P21-binding-domain (PBD) of P21-activated Kinase that only binds to activated Rac and Cdc42 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Kraynov1">[24]</xref>. We used a mild heat-shock regimen to transiently express a chimeric protein composed of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PBD fused to GFP (Green Fluorescent Protein) and assayed its subcellular localization 3 h after heat shock. Although there was variability in expression levels after heat shock (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s008">Text S1</xref>), in all interphase GSCs with asymmetric GFP staining, PBD-GFP staining was present at the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1F</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figures S1F</xref>–H). The ratio of intensity of staining per unit area at the niche-GSC interface to the remainder of GSC cytoplasm was 90∶1 (91±25∶1, <italic>n</italic> = 10, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1I</xref>). Thus, in GSCs, Rac is asymmetrically activated at the niche-GSC interface.</p>
        <p>To confirm the specificity of the assay, we demonstrated that transient expression of GFP alone resulted in staining throughout GSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1J</xref>), that co-expression of active Rac1<sup>V12</sup> protein and PBD-GFP also caused staining throughout GSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1K</xref>), and that PBD-GFP failed to localize to the niche-GSC interface in <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). In addition, PBD-GFP localized properly in GSCs mutant for a partial-loss-of function <italic>cdc42</italic> allelic combination (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s001">Figure S1L</xref>).</p>

        <title>Rac Acts through Apc2 to Orient GSC Centrosomes</title>
        <p>To begin to characterize Rac function in GSCs, we examined whether loss or gain of <italic>Rac</italic> activity affected orientation of the GSC division plane. Because orientation of the centrosome at the niche-GSC interface predicts the plane of division in male GSCs, we first examined centrosome orientation in wild-type female GSCs in both fixed and living specimens. Overall, 96% of GSCs (<italic>n</italic> = 92, 72 fixed+20 living) had one centrosome associated with the niche-GSC interface.</p>
        <p>In fixed specimens (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), 12% of GSCs were at a stage in the cell cycle prior to centrosome duplication. In all these GSCs, the single centrosome was cortically located at the niche-GSC interface. The remaining GSCs had two centrosomes. In 38% of GSCs, one centrosome was associated with the niche-GSC interface while the other centrosome was migrating around the GSC cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2B–D</xref>). In 46% of GSCs, one centrosome was associated with the interface, and the two centrosomes were separated by 180°, forming an angle of 45°–90° with the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). In the remaining 4% of GSCs, neither centrosome was at the interface, and the centrosome pair was oriented parallel to the interface, suggesting these GSCs could have been preparing to undergo a symmetric self-renewal division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xie2">[7]</xref>. Thus, 92% of wild-type GSCs with two centrosomes separated by 180° had one centrosome at the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2J</xref>).</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We also recorded centrosome behavior in living GSCs using a GFP-tagged Centrosomin (<italic>n</italic> = 20). While all GSCs had a niche-associated centrosome, in 35% of GSCs, one centrosome was migrating around the GSC cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s006">Movie S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s002">Figure S2</xref>), and in 35% of GSCs, the two centrosomes were separated by 180° (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s007">Movie S2</xref>). Taken together, our data indicate that, unlike a previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Stevens1">[25]</xref>, centrosomes in female GSCs are positioned similarly to those in male GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Quantitation of GSC centrosomes in fixed <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs or in GSCs expressing <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) indicated two patterns of centrosome orientation that were not present at high levels in wild-type GSCs. First, in 12%–14% of GSCs with perturbations in <italic>Rac</italic> activity, one or both centrosomes were not located at the GSC cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2F and 2G</xref>). Second, 27%–28% of GSCs had two cortical centrosomes separated by 180°, neither of which was associated with the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2H and 2I</xref>). Quantitation of the angle of the centrosome pair in GSCs with two centrosomes separated by 180° indicated that centrosomes in 40% of GSCs of both genotypes were not associated with the niche and formed an angle of 0°–45° with the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2K</xref>). Because complete randomization of orientation of GSC centrosome pairs would result in 50% of GSCs in which this angle was between 0° and 45°, we conclude that both loss and gain of <italic>Rac</italic> function essentially randomize GSC centrosome orientation. Asymmetric Rac activity is thus strongly correlated with the localization of one centrosome to the niche-GSC interface.</p>
        <p>We then examined whether Rac affects centrosome localization in male GSCs. In 2-d-old wild-type testes, 97% (<italic>n</italic> = 73) of GSCs had a centrosome associated with the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). In contrast, in 2-d-old testes, 28% (<italic>n</italic> = 83) of <italic>Rac</italic> RNAi GSCs and 46% (<italic>n</italic> = 95) of <italic>Rac<sup>V12</sup></italic> GSCs did not have a centrosome associated with the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s003">Figure S3B and S3C</xref>). In males, mutations that alter centrosome orientation can cause an increase in GSC number, as a result of an altered plane of GSC division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>. Two-day-old wild-type testes had an average of 8.9±0.8 (<italic>n</italic> = 18) GSCs, while 2-d-old testes with <italic>Rac</italic> RNAi GSCs had an average of 10.4±1.5 GSCs (<italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.03, Welch two sample <italic>t</italic>-test) and 2-d-old testes with <italic>Rac<sup>V12</sup></italic> GSCs had an average of 11.9±1.7 GSCs (<italic>n</italic> = 8, <italic>p</italic> = 0.001). Thus, alterations in <italic>Rac</italic> activity lead to misorientation of male GSC centrosomes and result in an increase in male GSC number.</p>
        <p>In male GSCs, Apc2 localizes one centrosome to the niche-GSC interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>. Using the same methodology as we used to quantitate PBD-GFP localization at the niche-GSC interface, we found that Apc2 is also concentrated at the niche-GSC interface in female GSCs (4.7±3.9∶1, <italic>n</italic> = 20; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2L</xref>) and that asymmetric Apc2 localization was disrupted in both <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSC clones (1.28±0.87∶1, <italic>n</italic> = 12; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2M</xref>) and GSCs expressing <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> (1.29±0.7∶1, <italic>n</italic> = 23; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2N</xref>). Furthermore, reduction of <italic>Apc2</italic> activity caused same classes of centrosome defects observed in GSCs with altered <italic>Rac</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2O and 2P</xref>), as did overexpression of GFP-tagged wild-type Apc2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2Q and 2R</xref>).</p>
        <p>In male GSCs, the two centrosomes are asymmetric, in that the mother centrosome harbors a robust array of microtubules and remains near the niche-GSC interface, while the daughter centrosome has fewer associated microtubules and migrates around the GSC cortex to set up the plane of GSC division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita2">[20]</xref>. Staining of interphase male or female GSCs indicated that microtubule bundles are present near the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s003">Figures S3D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s002">2S</xref>). Moreover, in male or female GSCs expressing Rac1<sup>V12</sup>, such microtubule asymmetry is abolished; microtubules are localized uniformly around the entire GSC cortex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s003">Figures S3E</xref> and 2T). In female GSCs with reduced <italic>Apc2</italic> activity, a lower level of microtubules is uniformly present around the GSC cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2U</xref>). Therefore, we propose that Rac, acting through Apc2, controls microtubule organization to influence GSC centrosome orientation.</p>

        <title>GSCs with Misoriented Centrosomes Arrest at Prometaphase</title>
        <p>Despite the necessity for <italic>Rac</italic> to properly localize interphase centrosomes, all mitotic spindles in <italic>Rac-RNAi</italic> GSCs were oriented normally, perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface with one spindle pole associated with the interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g002">Figure 2V</xref>). Thus, there must be a second process that functions subsequent to Rac-mediated centrosome orientation to ensure proper orientation of the GSC division plane. Cheng et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Cheng1">[22]</xref> observed that if neither centrosome in male GSCs is located at the niche-GSC interface, the GSC does not undergo mitosis, but that reorientation of centrosome position allows mitotic entry, suggesting that male GSCs with misoriented centrosomes arrest in the S or G2 phase.</p>
        <p>To begin to analyze cell cycle progression in female GSCs with misoriented centrosomes, we quantitated the percentage of female GSCs that stained with an anti-phospho-Histone H3 Ser10 (pH3) antibody.

        <p>Immunofluorescence confirmed the existence of this prometaphase arrest in GSCs of all three genotypes: <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>Rac-RNAi</italic>, and <italic>Apc2</italic>. Wild-type GSCs enter mitosis with a pair of correctly oriented centrosomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3C</xref>), while centrosomes in some <italic>Rac</italic> gain-of-function and loss-of-function GSCs remain misoriented even after mitotic onset (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3D and 3E</xref>). All pH3-stained wild-type GSCs had a correctly oriented mitotic spindle that stained with an anti-α-tubulin antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3F</xref>), and had undergone nuclear envelope breakdown, as evidenced by absence of staining with an anti-Lamin-Dm antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Conversely, approximately 80% of <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3H and 3I</xref>), 45% of <italic>Rac-RNAi</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3J and 3K</xref>), and 25% of <italic>Apc2</italic> pH3-stained GSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–D) lacked a mitotic spindle and had not undergone nuclear envelope breakdown. Interestingly, we also observed cell cycle arrest in early germline cysts of all three genotypes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4G</xref>–L, compared to wild-type <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4E</xref>–F), suggesting that a similar cell cycle arrest mechanism is present in cystocyte divisions. Thus, like male GSCs, female GSCs with misoriented centrosomes can undergo a cell cycle arrest; however, the arrest in female GSCs occurs at a later stage in the cell cycle, after chromosome condensation in prometaphase, compared to the S/G2 arrest in male GSCs.</p>
        <p>We then determined whether the observed prometaphase cell cycle arrest was statistically correlated with centrosome misorientation. Although centrosome position in interphase <italic>Apc2</italic> GSCs was randomized (53%, <italic>n</italic> = 45, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3L</xref>), all mitotic spindles in <italic>Apc2</italic> GSCs (<italic>n</italic> = 25, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, chi-square test) were oriented normally with one pole adjacent to the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4A</xref>). All pH3-stained <italic>Apc2</italic> GSCs lacking a nuclear envelope (<italic>n</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3N</xref>) or with a mitotic spindle (<italic>n</italic> = 16, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3O</xref>) had two centrosomes aligned perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface with one centrosome adjacent to the interface. Conversely, all pH3-stained <italic>Apc2</italic> GSCs with an intact nuclear envelope (<italic>n</italic> = 12, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3P</xref>) or lacking a mitotic spindle (<italic>n</italic> = 5, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g003">Figure 3Q</xref>) had misoriented centrosomes neither of which was at the niche-GSC interface. The absolute correlation between the two phenotypes indicates that centrosome misorientation very likely causes the prometaphase arrest.</p>
        <p>These data suggest that centrosomes are mobile in <italic>Apc2</italic> mutant GSCs, or in <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs that lack cortical localization of Apc2, and if one centrosome becomes oriented with the niche-GSC interface, mitosis can proceed, which is similar to the function of the cell cycle arrest in male GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Cheng1">[22]</xref>. We hypothesize that uniform cytoplasmic localization of Apc2 in <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> GSCs traps centrosomes, preventing centrosome movement and alignment with the niche-GSC interface, and thereby causing a higher percentage of GSC arrest (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001357-t001">Table 1</xref>). Furthermore, none of the three mitotic spindles we observed in <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> GSCs were perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface (not shown), suggesting that <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> GSCs eventually overcome the prometaphase arrest and undergo mitosis with misoriented centrosomes.</p>
        <p>To determine whether interactions between CpCs and GSCs are essential to invoke cell cycle arrest, we examined mitotic divisions in <italic>TkvAct</italic> ovaries, in which all germ cells have high levels of BMP signaling and adopt a GSC-like morphology. In these ovaries, all pH3-stained GSCs had a mitotic spindle. Moreover, the spindle orientation of GSCs in the CpC niche was perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4M and S4O</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 6, quantitated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4P</xref>), while the spindle orientation of GSC-like cells outside the niche was random with respect to the niche-GSC interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4M and S4N</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 29, quantitated in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s004">Figure S4P</xref>), suggesting the interaction between the CpC niche and GSCs, and not high levels of BMP signaling, is essential to orient the GSC division plane. In conclusion, we have shown that a Rac/Apc2-independent cell cycle arrest functions together with the Rac/Apc2-dependent localization of interphase centrosomes to ensure the invariant division plane of female GSCs.</p>

        <title>Active Rac Elevates BMP Signaling in GSCs</title>
        <p>The two primary characteristics of the asymmetric self-renewal division of the GSC are the essentially invariant orientation of the plane of GSC division and a sharp decrease in BMP signaling between the GSC and Cb. Above, we demonstrated that asymmetrically activated Rac is necessary for GSC centrosome localization. However, because Rac is active only at the niche-GSC interface, it is possible that upon GSC division activated Rac is segregated only to the daughter that remains a GSC. Therefore, we assayed whether Rac could also elevate BMP signaling specifically in GSCs.</p>
        <p>The sharp decrease in BMP signaling from GSCs to Cbs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) can be visualized by three methodologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Kai1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Song2">[11]</xref>. First, an antibody against the active phosphorylated form of the BMP signal transducer Mad (pMad) specifically stains the GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Second, there are high levels of <italic>lacZ</italic> expression from an enhancer trap in the BMP target gene <italic>Dad</italic> (<italic>Dad-lacZ</italic>) in GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Given the specificity of the pMad staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), the lower level of anti-β-galactosidase staining in the Cb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) likely results from perdurance of the β-galactosidase protein. Third, GFP expression from a <italic>bam</italic> transcriptional reporter (<italic>bam</italic>-GFP) is not present in GSCs, but is present at extremely low levels in Cbs and high levels in dividing cyst cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). While the great majority of ovarioles expressing <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> displayed a normal pattern of BMP signaling as measured by <italic>Dad-lacZ</italic> expression, BMP signaling in 1% of ovarioles (<italic>n</italic> = 200) was expanded to encompass the whole germarium (not shown), suggesting that activated Rac could promote germline BMP signaling, but that other factors largely blocked its activity.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>We thus reasoned that expression of activated Rac in the background of a loss of a negative regulator of BMP signaling in the germ line could increase the penetrance of the BMP signaling defect. Previously, we identified two genes, <italic>bam</italic> and the E3 ubiquitin ligase <italic>dSmurf</italic>, that act redundantly to downregulate germline BMP signaling. While Bam antagonizes BMP signaling downstream of the BMP receptor Thickveins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Casanueva1">[10]</xref>, dSmurf targets multiple components of the BMP signaling pathway for degradation: in the wing discs, dSmurf ubiquitinates pMad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Liang1">[26]</xref>; and in Cbs and posterior germ cells, dSmurf interacts with the Fused (Fu) kinase to ubiquitinate the Tkv receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xia1">[27]</xref>.</p>
        <p>To further characterize the action of Bam, we first assayed its function in the germaria of <italic>TkvAct</italic> females. All germ cells in <italic>TkvAct</italic> germaria expressed <italic>Dad-lacZ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In control heat-shocked <italic>TkvAct</italic> germaria, nuclear pMad was present in 48% of individual germ cells 4 h after heat shock (<italic>n</italic> = 732 cells in six germaria) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). Conversely, in <italic>TkvAct</italic> germaria with heat shock-induced Bam expression, nuclear pMad was present in only 5% of germ cells 4 h after heat shock (<italic>n</italic> = 668 cells in five germaria). Strikingly, in these germaria pMad was predominantly localized throughout the germline cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). In contrast, heat-shock-induced expression of Bam in wild-type GSCs resulted in rapid loss of pMad from the GSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4F</xref>). We hypothesized that in wild-type GSCs, unlike the GSC-like cells in <italic>TkvAct</italic> germaria, cytoplasmic pMad is rapidly degraded, possibly by the action of DSmurf. While pMad was present only in the nucleus of wild-type GSCs subject to a control heat shock (not shown), in <italic>dSmurf</italic> females subject to the same control heat shock, pMad was observed in both the nucleus and cytoplasm of the GSC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4G</xref>), demonstrating that DSmurf is active in GSCs. Heat-shock-induced expression of <italic>bam</italic> in <italic>dSmurf</italic> females resulted in the accumulation of pMad in the cytoplasm of GSCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Thus, we conclude Bam blocks BMP signaling by preventing the nuclear accumulation of pMad.</p>
        <p>Based on the above data, we reasoned that a null allele of <italic>bam</italic>, <italic>bam<sup>Δ86</sup></italic>, could be a sensitized background in which to assay the effect of Rac activity on germline BMP signaling. While <italic>bam</italic> mutant ovarioles have a normal pattern of BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>) due to the action of <italic>dSmurf</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Casanueva1">[10]</xref>, expression of <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> in the <italic>bam</italic> mutant background caused expansion of BMP signaling throughout the germarium, shown by either anti-pMad antibody staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) or <italic>Dad-lacZ</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Expression of <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> also caused a spatial expansion of BMP signaling in <italic>dSmurf</italic> mutant ovarioles, although to a lesser extent (not shown). Thus, activated Rac promotes BMP signaling in the germarium.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>Because Rac can elevate the activity of the JNK pathway in multiple developmental contexts (e.g., embryonic dorsal closure in <italic>Drosophila</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Glise1">[28]</xref>), we examined whether Rac acts through the JNK pathway to promote BMP signaling in GSCs. The JNK pathway comprises a kinase cascade, JNKKK→JNKK→JNK, that leads to phosphorylation of the transcription factor c-Jun <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Noselli1">[29]</xref>, heterodimer formation of pJun and Fos, and transcriptional activation of multiple genes, including the phosphatase <italic>puckered</italic> (<italic>puc</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-MartinBlanco1">[30]</xref>, which acts as a negative regulator of the JNK pathway by dephosphorylating the JNK homolog Basket (Bsk). To determine whether Rac activates the JNK pathway in GSCs, we assayed expression of a <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> enhancer trap. In 25% (<italic>n</italic> = 20) of ovarioles, <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> was specifically expressed in a GSC and, likely due to perdurance of β-galactosidase protein, in a Cb (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Thus, the JNK pathway is active in GSCs, but other factors may modulate its activity. Because the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homolog of Fos, Kayak, identified by a functional GFP protein trap, always localized to the nucleus of GSCs, Cbs, and early cyst cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), Rac-mediated activation of the JNK pathway in GSCs likely depends on nuclear import of active phosphorylated c-Jun.</p>
        <p>Unlike wild-type ovarioles, in ovarioles expressing <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic>, <italic>puc-lacZ</italic> was always expressed throughout the germarium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5G</xref>), indicating that Rac can activate the JNK pathway in the germ line. Coexpression of a dominant negative form of <italic>bsk</italic>, <italic>bsk<sup>DN</sup></italic>, with <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> in the <italic>bam</italic> background completely suppressed ectopic BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5H</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), indicating that Rac-mediated expansion of BMP signaling is completely dependent on JNK activity. Moreover, expression of constitutively active forms of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> homologs of JNKK, <italic>hemipterous</italic> (<italic>Hep<sup>CA</sup></italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Weber1">[31]</xref>, and the transcription factor c-Jun, <italic>Jra</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Treier1">[32]</xref>, in the <italic>bam</italic> background also expanded BMP signaling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5I and 5J</xref>). Taken together, these data suggest that the Rac-activated JNK pathway controls one or more transcriptional targets to promote BMP signaling in the GSC.</p>
        <p>We next wished to determine whether Rac/JNK activity is necessary for BMP signaling in GSCs. However, there was no obvious difference in pMad staining or <italic>bam</italic>-GFP expression in <italic>Rac</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s005">Figure S5B and S5D</xref>) or <italic>bsk</italic> mutant GSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s005">Figure S5E</xref>) compared to control GSCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s005">Figures S5A and S5C</xref>), suggesting that other genes act in parallel with the Rac/JNK pathway to promote BMP signaling in GSCs.</p>
        <p>We then sought to identify a genetic background in which the loss of Rac/JNK signaling could have phenotypic consequences on BMP signaling in the GSC. We reasoned that if a greater number of germ cells were exposed to BMP ligands secreted by the CpCs, then the amount of ligand per GSC could become limiting. In such a background, the ability of Rac/JNK to promote BMP signaling in the GSCs might become necessary. Because the Tkv receptor on the cell surface can block ligand diffusion by acting as a sink for BMP ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Lecuit1">[33]</xref>, we examined the spatial extent of BMP signaling after reduction in Tkv levels. While heterozygosity for <italic>tkv<sup>7</sup></italic>, an allele that produces a non-functional kinase with normal BMP ligand-binding ability, did not affect the number of <italic>Dad-lacZ</italic> positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g006">Figure 6A</xref>), heterozygosity for the protein null allele <italic>tkv<sup>8</sup></italic> increased the number of <italic>Dad-lacZ</italic> positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g004">Figure 4B</xref>), indicating a reduction in Tkv receptor concentration, not a reduction in receptor signaling, causes an increase in the spatial extent of BMP signaling. The expansion of BMP signaling caused by <italic>tkv<sup>8</sup></italic> heterozygosity was further enhanced in a <italic>bam</italic>/+ background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and BMP signaling was present throughout the germarium in a <italic>tkv<sup>8</sup></italic>/+; <italic>bam</italic>/<italic>bam</italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g006">Figure 6D</xref>, compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Thus, high levels of Tkv receptor on the GSC are critical to restrict diffusion of the Dpp ligand to ensure absence of BMP signaling in Cbs. In the wing disc, Hedgehog and BMP-mediated downregulation of the Tkv receptor near the source of Dpp ligand is necessary to permit Dpp diffusion to establish a long-range gradient of Dpp across the disc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Lecuit1">[33]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Tanimoto1">[35]</xref>, indicating that modulation of receptor levels can be used either to allow or to restrict diffusion of ligands across a field of cells.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this article, we have shown that the small GTPase Rac is activated at the niche-GSC interface to influence two major aspects of the asymmetric self-renewal division of the GSC (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001357-g007">Figure 7</xref>). First, Rac activity orients the GSC division plane by localizing one interphase GSC centrosome at the niche-GSC interface. Second, Rac activity promotes BMP signaling in the GSC. Other processes act in parallel with both functions of Rac, likely to ensure the robustness of this asymmetric division. In particular, the GSC cell cycle is arrested at prometaphase if centrosomes are not localized at the niche-GSC interface. Therefore the asymmetric activation of Rac within the GSC links a mechanism that influences the plane of GSC division with a mechanism that promotes distinct fates in GSC daughters.</p>

          <title>Model of Rac function in the GSC.</title>
          <p>Activated Rac (Rac*) at the CpC-GSC interface sets up an intracellular polarity within the GSC that couples the control of the plane of cell division to the response to the extracellular BMP maintenance signal. Activated Rac concentrates Apc2 at the CpC-GSC interface to orient a centrosome during interphase. The GSC will arrest in prometaphase if one centrosome is not present at the CpC-GSC interface. These two mechanisms act together to ensure that the GSC mitotic spindle is perpendicular to the niche-GSC interface. Rac also activates the JNK pathway to promote BMP signaling in the GSC, possibly by increasing competitiveness of the GSC for BMP ligands.</p>

        <title>Rac Is Necessary for Maximal GSC Half-Life</title>
        <p>Certain genetic backgrounds, such as loss of BMP signaling within a GSC or loss of adherens junction in one GSC, decrease GSC half-life from greater than 4 wk to less than 1 wk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Song1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xie1">[6]</xref>. Conversely, our data demonstrate that Rac mutant GSCs have a half-life of about 2 wk. These data raise the question of which of the two functions of Rac has the greater effect on GSC maintenance. While <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs lack normal centrosome orientation and can arrest in prometaphase, all <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs divide with a normal orientation. Furthermore, in males, in which the niche is larger and can accommodate an increased number of GSCs, perturbations in <italic>Rac</italic> activity lead to an increase in GSC numbers, even though the GSCs have misoriented centrosomes. Taken together, these data suggest that centrosome misorientation may not markedly affect GSC half-life. Conversely, we have shown that <italic>Rac</italic> activity can be necessary for BMP signaling in a sensitized background in which GSCs are likely exposed to less BMP ligand. We propose that lack of Rac/JNK activity in a GSC could lessen the robustness of the GSC response to decreasing levels of BMP ligands as the fly ages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Pan1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Zhao1">[37]</xref>, thereby resulting in a reduction in the half-life of <italic>Rac</italic> mutant GSCs.</p>

        <title>Rac, Acting Together with a Prometaphase Cell Cycle Arrest, Orients the Plane of GSC Division</title>
        <p>Our data establish that centrosome behavior is controlled similarly in both sexes. Specifically, we used both fixed and live imaging to demonstrate that, similar to male GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>, one centrosome in female GSCs is positioned at the niche-GSC interface throughout the cell cycle, and that the second centrosome migrates around the GSC cortex to ultimately orient the plane of GSC division. Moreover, similar to male GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>, in female GSCs, Apc2 is concentrated at the niche-GSC interface, and Apc2 concentration promotes an asymmetric distribution of cytoplasmic microtubules at the niche-GSC interface. Lastly, we demonstrated that Rac activity in both sexes is necessary for proper centrosome orientation and microtubule asymmetry. Because ectopic Rac activity can be sufficient to direct Apc2 throughout the GSC, the concentration of Apc2 at the niche-GSC interface is not likely to be mediated solely by direct physical interactions between Apc2 and components of the adherens junctions.</p>
        <p>While Rac acts through Apc2 to orient interphase centrosomes, female GSCs with mispositioned centrosomes arrest at prometaphase with lack of nuclear envelope breakdown and mitotic spindle formation. Cheng et al. also reported a cell cycle arrest invoked by centrosome misorientation in male GSCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Cheng1">[22]</xref>. Their study showed that, while male GSCs with misoriented centrosomes rarely divided, reorientation of GSC centrosomes led to rapid mitotic entry. However, the GSC cell cycle appears to arrest at an earlier stage in males, the S or G2 phases, than it does in females, prometaphase, and it will be interesting to compare the mechanisms responsible for cell cycle arrest in each sex.</p>

        <title>Rac Is One of Multiple Mechanisms That Ensure Differential BMP Signaling between GSCs and Cbs</title>
        <p>To ensure maximal fertility, the mechanisms responsible for differential BMP signaling between the GSC and its sister Cb must be extremely robust. BMPs are secreted from the CpCs of the niche, and BMP signaling is only observed in GSCs. Since, in other developmental contexts, BMP ligands are able to diffuse over a field of cells, additional mechanisms must modulate BMP ligand distribution, reception, and/or signal transduction to ensure the binary pattern of BMP signaling between the GSC and the Cb.</p>
        <p>Our data indicate that local activation of Rac promotes BMP signaling in the GSC. Rac activates the JNK pathway, and we propose that activation of the JNK pathway increases the ability of the GSCs, compared to their sister Cb cells, to compete for BMP ligands secreted by the CpCs. While Rac/JNK activity is not absolutely required for BMP signaling in the GSC, we identified a sensitized genotype (<italic>tkv</italic>/+; <italic>bam</italic>/+) where both Rac and JNK activity are necessary to ensure the GSCs are always positive for BMP signaling, thereby demonstrating that both genes are active in the GSC to promote BMP signaling. Perhaps surprisingly, activation of Rac or the JNK pathway throughout the germarium of <italic>bam</italic> mutants was sufficient to cause all germ cells to have BMP signaling. It is possible that substantial BMP ligand is present in the posterior region of the germarium, but wild-type germ cells are not competent to respond to endogenous ligand. In this scenario, the lack of <italic>bam</italic> coupled with ectopic JNK activity allows the germ cells to receive and respond to endogenous ligand.</p>
        <p>Additional mechanisms also contribute to the differential response of the GSCs and Cbs to BMP ligands. First, Tkv receptors likely act as a sink to sequester the Dpp ligands and block their ability to diffuse within the germarium. We showed that reduction of <italic>tkv</italic> dose permits additional germ cells near the niche to receive BMP signaling, an effect that is increased in genetic backgrounds in which <italic>bam</italic> is reduced. Second, the heparin sulfate proteoglycan Dally is expressed in the CpCs and both restricts ligand diffusion and acts as a potential trans co-receptor for BMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Guo1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Hayashi1">[39]</xref>. GSCs send out an EGF signal that blocks Dally expression in the escort cells, thereby concentrating BMPs at the CpC surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Liu1">[40]</xref>. Thus, at least three mechanisms have been identified that either modulate BMP ligand distribution or the responsiveness to BMP ligands, near or within the niche to promote differential BMP signaling between GSCs and Cbs.</p>
        <p>Conversely, a similar number of mechanisms have been identified that restrict the ability of the Cbs and their descendants to receive or respond to a BMP signal. We have shown the BMP target gene <italic>bam</italic> and the ubiquitin ligase <italic>dSmurf</italic> function redundantly in Cbs and early cysts to downregulate BMP signaling downstream of receptor activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Casanueva1">[10]</xref>. Bam downregulates BMP signaling by blocking nuclear localization of pMad, while Smurf degrades Mad <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Liang1">[26]</xref> and acts together with Fused to degrade activated Tkv receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Xia1">[27]</xref>. Moreover, miR-184 down-regulates the BMP receptor Saxophone in posterior cyst cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Iovino1">[41]</xref>. Lastly, Brat mediated translational repression of target genes, including Mad and cMyc, also promotes Cb differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Harris1">[42]</xref>. Thus, mechanisms that promote BMP signaling in the GSCs act in concert with mechanisms that repress BMP signaling in Cbs and early cysts. These data highlight the complexity and genetic redundancy necessary to ensure a robust pattern of asymmetric BMP signaling between the GSC and Cb.</p>

        <title>Adherens Junctions Likely Play Multiple Roles in the Control of GSC Behavior</title>
        <p>In both sexes adherens junctions have been proposed to anchor GSCs to their cellular niche. However, there is an increasing appreciation that adherens junctions play additional roles in GSC maintenance. Previous work indicated that adherens junctions localize Apc2 to orient the male GSCs centrosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Yamashita1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Inaba1">[21]</xref>. Our data indicate that Rac mediates all aspects of adherens junction function in orienting the GSC centrosome including Apc2 localization, suggesting that adherens junctions could also lead, directly or indirectly, to Rac activation within the GSC. Other data indicate that differences in the levels of adherens junctions can mediate GSC competition for niche occupancy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Jin1">[43]</xref>, and that, in male GSCs, the presence of adherens junctions leads to asymmetric reception of the BMP signal within the GSC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001357-Michel1">[44]</xref>. Thus, adherens junctions play far more than a structural role in the asymmetric self-renewing divisions of the GSC.</p>

(A–D) Anti-pH3 stained mitotic <italic>Apc2</italic> mutant GSCs. Most pH3 stained <italic>Apc2</italic> GSCs have a mitotic spindle with one spindle pole adjacent to the CpC-GSC interface (A) and have undergone nuclear envelope breakdown (C). Some pH3 stained <italic>Apc2</italic> GSCs lack a mitotic spindle (B) and have not undergone nuclear envelope breakdown (D). (E–F) Mitotic divisions of wild-type four-cell cysts are synchronous and are marked by condensed chromosomes with mitotic spindle formation (E) and nuclear envelope breakdown (F). (G–L) Mitotic four-cell cysts of <italic>Rac1<sup>V12</sup></italic> (G,H), <italic>Rac-RNAi</italic> (I,J), or <italic>Apc2</italic> (K,L) with anti-pH3 staining that do not have mitotic spindles (G,I,K) and have not undergone nuclear envelope breakdown (H,J,L). (M–O) Mitotic GSCs and GSC-like cells in <italic>TkvAct</italic> germaria. While GSCs adjacent to the CpCs niche divide with an invariant division plane (M,O), the division plane of GSC-like cells not at the niche is randomized with respect to the CpC-GSC interface (M,N). (P) Quantification of spindle orientation of dividing niche-residing GSCs and non-niche-associated GSC-like cells in <italic>TkvAct</italic> germaria. Dot, angle between the CpC-GSC interface and spindle orientation. Cyan dot, dividing GSCs at the CpC niche. Magenta dot, dividing GSC-like cells outside the CpC niche. <italic>N</italic>, number scored of each of class of GSC. (A–O) Arrow, CpC niche. (A–D,M–O) Solid line, CpC-GSC interface. (A–D) Dashed outline, individual GSC. (E–L) Dashed enclosure, a dividing four-cell cyst. (M–O) Dashed outline, mitotic GSC at the CpC niche; dotted outline, mitotic GSC-like cell outside the niche. (A,M–O) Double-headed arrow, orientation of mitotic spindle. (A–D) Percentage (%) of total (<italic>N</italic>) GSCs with the specific phenotype displayed in the panel.</p>

          <p>Centrosome migration in a living female interphase GSC. In this movie, one GSC centrosome is localized at the niche-GSC interface, while the other centrosome moves between 10° and 15° around the circumference of the GSC toward the posterior. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s002">Figure S2</xref> contains representative frames from this movie. In this movie and in Movie S2, centrosomes are marked by a GFP-tagged pericentrosomal protein Centrosomin (GFP-Cnn, shown in green) under the control of germline-specific Nos-Gal4 driver. The nuclei of the somatic niche cells (and to a lesser extent, the undifferentiated anterior germline cells) are marked by a living-cell DNA dye (Draq5-Cy5, shown in red). The boundary of Cnn-GFP and bright Draq5 staining delineates the CpC-GSC interface. Each movie covers about 30 min of development, with one frame taken every minute. Each frame is a projection of a stack of eight 1 µm confocal slices. The images were taken using a 63× water lens of a DSU Olympus Spinning Disk Confocal Microscope (see more details in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001357.s008">Text S1</xref>).</p>
