				<article-title>Rousing a Latent Defense Mechanism to Fight HIV</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>Human alpha and beta defensins contribute substantially to innate immune defenses against microbial and viral infections. Certain nonhuman primates also produce theta-defensins—18 residue cyclic peptides that act as HIV-1 entry inhibitors. Multiple human theta-defensin genes exist, but they harbor a premature termination codon that blocks translation. Consequently, the theta-defensins (retrocyclins) encoded within the human genome are not expressed as peptides. In vivo production of theta-defensins in rhesus macaques involves the post-translational ligation of two nonapeptides, each derived from a 12-residue “demidefensin” precursor. Neither the mechanism of this unique process nor its existence in human cells is known. To ascertain if human cells retained the ability to process demidefensins, we transfected human promyelocytic cells with plasmids containing repaired retrocyclin-like genes. The expected peptides were isolated, their sequences were verified by mass spectrometric analyses, and their anti-HIV-1 activity was confirmed in vitro. Our study reveals for the first time, to our knowledge, that human cells have the ability to make cyclic theta-defensins. Given this evidence that human cells could make theta-defensins, we attempted to restore endogenous expression of retrocyclin peptides. Since human theta-defensin genes are transcribed, we used aminoglycosides to read-through the premature termination codon found in the mRNA transcripts. This treatment induced the production of intact, bioactive retrocyclin-1 peptide by human epithelial cells and cervicovaginal tissues. The ability to reawaken retrocyclin genes from their 7 million years of slumber using aminoglycosides could provide a novel way to secure enhanced resistance to HIV-1 infection.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>Defensins are a large family of small antimicrobial peptides that contribute to host defense against a broad spectrum of pathogens. In primates, defensins are divided into three subfamilies—alpha, beta, and theta—on the basis of their disulfide bonding pattern. Theta-defensins were the most recently identified defensin subfamily, isolated initially from white blood cells and bone marrow of rhesus monkeys. They are the only known cyclic peptides in mammals and act primarily by preventing viruses such as HIV-1 from entering cells. Whereas theta-defensin genes are intact in Old World monkeys, in humans they have a premature stop codon that prevents their expression; they thus exist as pseudogenes. In this work, we reveal that, upon correction of the premature termination codon in theta-defensin pseudogenes, human myeloid cells produce cyclic, antiviral peptides (which we have termed “retrocyclins”), indicating that the cells retain the intact machinery to make cyclic peptides. Furthermore, we exploited the ability of aminoglycoside antibiotics to read-through the premature termination codon within retrocyclin transcripts to produce functional peptides that are active against HIV-1. Given that the endogenous production of retrocyclins could also be restored in human cervicovaginal tissues, we propose that aminoglycoside-based topical microbicides might be useful in preventing sexual transmission of HIV-1.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Nearly 33 million people are infected with HIV worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b002">2</xref>], and despite extensive efforts there are no effective vaccines or other countermeasures to protect against HIV transmission [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b003">3</xref>]. In our attempts to find effective anti-HIV agents, our group determined that certain synthetic θ-defensins called “retrocyclins” are potent inhibitors of HIV-1 infection [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b008">8</xref>]. Retrocyclins belong to a large family of antimicrobial peptides known as defensins, all of which are cationic, tri-disulfide bonded peptides that have important roles in innate host defense. On the basis of the position of the cysteines and the disulfide bonding pattern, defensins are grouped into three subfamilies: α-defensins, β-defensins, and θ-defensins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b010">10</xref>].</p>
      <p>θ-Defensins such as retrocyclin have a cyclic peptide backbone, derived from the head-to-tail-ligation of two peptides that each contributes nine amino acids to form the 18-residue mature peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b011">11</xref>]. θ-Defensins are the only known cyclic peptides in mammals and were originally isolated from rhesus macaque leukocytes and bone marrow [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b011">11</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b013">13</xref>]. While θ-defensin peptides are produced in old world monkeys and orangutans, in humans they exist only as expressed pseudogenes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b014">14</xref>]. A premature termination codon in the signal peptide portion of human retrocyclin mRNA prevents its translation. The retrocyclin gene is otherwise remarkably intact, showing 89.4% identity with rhesus θ-defensins. Its genetic information was utilized to recreate retrocyclins synthetically and confirm their activity against both X4 and R5 strains of HIV-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b007">7</xref>].</p>
      <p>Retrocyclins inhibit the fusion of HIV-1 Env by selectively binding to the C-terminal heptad repeat region on gp41 blocking 6-helix bundle formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b016">16</xref>]. RC-101 is a congener of retrocyclin with a single arginine to lysine substitution that retains structural and functional similarity to retrocyclin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b004">4</xref>]. RC-101 exhibited enhanced anti-HIV-1 activity against over two dozen primary isolates from several clades [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b008">8</xref>], and did not induce inflammation or toxicity in organotypic models of human cervicovaginal tissue [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b017">17</xref>]. Continuous passaging of HIV-1 BaL in the presence of subinhibitory concentrations of RC-101 for 100 days induced only minimal viral resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b018">18</xref>]. Given these beneficial attributes, we envisioned that restoring the endogenous expression of retrocyclins in humans would provide an effective and natural way of combating HIV-1 infection.</p>
      <p>In the current study we restored the translation of this evolutionarily lost retrocyclin peptide by ablating the premature termination codon using site-directed mutagenesis, and analyzed whether human cells can synthesize biologically active retrocyclins. We found that promyelocytic HL60 cells stably transfected with retrocyclin constructs in which the premature termination codon was corrected could express retrocyclins. Application of the expressed retrocyclins to TZM-bl cells, PM1 cells, and peripheral blood mononuclear cells (PBMCs) conferred protection against HIV-1 infection. Moreover, mass spectrometric techniques confirmed the presence of correctly folded mature retrocyclin peptides. We also explored methods to read-through the premature termination codon within the retrocyclin pseudogene. Previous reports revealed that aminoglycoside antibiotics could suppress the termination codon of pseudogenes and disease-associated nonsense mutations [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b025">25</xref>]. In bacteria, aminoglycosides bind strongly to the decoding site on the 16S rRNA, thereby hindering protein synthesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b026">26</xref>]. However, in eukaryotes, aminoglycosides bind to the eukaryotic decoding site with low affinity and induce a low level of translational misreading, which suppresses the termination codon through the incorporation of an amino acid in its place [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b027">27</xref>]. Herein, we utilized aminoglycosides to induce translational read-through of the θ-defensin pseudogene, which restored the expression of functional anti-HIV-1 retrocyclin peptides in human cervicovaginal tissue models. Topical application of aminoglycosides to produce endogenous retrocyclins in the vaginal mucosa might soon be an effective preventative to combat sexual transmission of HIV-1.</p>

        <title>Creation of Promyelocytic Cells Stably Transfected with Retrocyclin Constructs</title>
        <p>θ-Defensins are formed by post-translational modification of two 12-residue gene products, each of which is processed to give a nonapeptide that contains three cysteines. The N-terminus of one nonapeptide forms a peptide bond with the C-terminus of another nonapeptide, resulting in a cyclic 18 residue peptide with three intramolecular disulfide bonds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b014">14</xref>]. To determine if human cells have retained the ability to process θ-defensins, we transfected promyelocytic HL60 cells with retrocyclin constructs each encoding a nonapeptide in which the premature termination codon was replaced with a glutamine (⊗17Q).</p>
        <p>Four types of constructs were produced: R1, R3, A1, and A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Aside from the corrected premature termination codon (⊗17Q), all constructs were engineered to contain two termination codons at the end of the gene to ensure read-fidelity. Constructs with an “R” designation terminate after the retrocyclin portion of the gene, while constructs with an “A” designation contain the retrocyclin portion with additional downstream residues that might be critical for translation and/or processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b028">28</xref>]. Constructs with a “1” designation do not have any additional residues mutated, while constructs with a “3” designation have the additional Arg → Lys mutation (R70K) encoding the RC-101 nonapeptide. HL60 cells were cotransfected by electroporation with either R1 and R3, or A1 and A3, and propagated in the presence of G418 (300 μg/ml) to create stably transfected cell lines. Stable transfection was verified by analyzing genomic DNA and mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000095-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Since two different constructs were cotransfected for each condition, combinatorially it would be possible to generate three different retrocyclin peptides as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g001">Figure 1</xref>B. For example, if cells were cotransfected with the R1 and R3 constructs, they could theoretically generate a heterodimer (HL60 cells containing retrocyclin constructs R1 and R3 [R1R3]) or homodimers (R1R1 or R3R3).</p>

        <title>Extracts of Promyelocytic Cells Stably Transfected with Retrocyclin Constructs Are Active against HIV-1</title>
        <p>We next analyzed if correcting the termination codon in the retrocyclin constructs could restore the translation of biologically active retrocyclin peptides. The infection of TZM-bl cells with HIV-1 BaL was significantly reduced when cells were treated with cellular acid extracts of R1R3 cells (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.004) and HL60 cells containing retrocyclin constructs A1 and A3 (A1A3) (<italic>p &lt;</italic> 0.002) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). A standard tetrazolium MTT assay revealed that the extracts did not affect cellular metabolism at the concentrations used in the experiment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g002">Figure 2</xref>E). Addition of A1A3 cell extracts to HIV-1 infected PM1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g002">Figure 2</xref>B) and PBMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g002">Figure 2</xref>C) showed significant (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.002 and <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.004, respectively) decrease in the viral titer as compared to cells treated with control HL60 cell extract. A trypan blue exclusion assay was performed in PBMCs to monitor cell viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g002">Figure 2</xref>F). We next affinity purified R1R3 and A1A3 cell extracts using anti-RC-101 antibody and confirmed the antiviral activity in a luciferase-based assay system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g002">Figure 2</xref>D). Interestingly, A1A3 cell extracts were found to be consistently more active than equivalent amounts of R1R3 cell extract, which suggests a role for the downstream residues in retrocyclin processing.

        <p>To determine the identity of the retrocyclin peptide expressed by A1A3 cells, HPLC fraction 26 was analyzed by mass spectrometric analysis (MALDI-TOF-MS) at the Microchemical and Proteomics Facility, Emory University (Atlanta, Georgia, US). Analysis of A1A3 Fraction 26 revealed peaks with masses 1,889.775 Da (oxidized) and 1895.890 Da (reduced), which is nearly identical to the expected mass of synthetic cyclic RC-101 (1,889.85 Da and 1,895.96 Da, respectively; unpublished data) and is in agreement with reduction of the three disulfide bridges in the molecule. Furthermore, treatment with iodoacetamide yielded mass species of 2,238.081 Da for the A1A3 fraction 26 and 2,238.071 Da for RC-101 corresponding to the predicted 6-fold–alkylated form of RC-101 (expected mass = 2,238.097 Da).

        <p>Having thus established the optimal aminoglycoside concentration required to achieve read-through of retrocylin cDNA, we next determined if aminoglycosides could restore the translation and anti-HIV-1 activity of native retrocyclin peptides. HeLa-derived cells lines such as TZM-bl cells can natively express retrocyclin mRNA (unpublished data). We applied aminoglycosides to TZM-bl cells and challenged them with HIV-1 BaL.

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>Identifying effective drugs to prevent HIV-1 infection and other viral infections is essential for countering the spread of these diseases. Exogenous (synthetic) retrocyclins exhibit full activity in the complex environment of vaginal fluid and the peptide is very well tolerated in organotypic human cervicovaginal tissue models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b017">17</xref>]. Moreover, HIV-1 evolves little resistance during continued passaging in the presence of the peptide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b018">18</xref>]. For these and other reasons, retrocyclins have emerged as potential topical microbicides to protect against sexually transmitted HIV-1 infections.</p>
        <p>In this study we have taken a different path towards developing θ-defensin therapeutics. The human pseudogenes that encode the demidefensin precursors whose post-translational processing gives rise to mature retrocyclin are expressed at the mRNA level in multiple organs, including the spleen, bone marrow, thymus, testis, and skeletal muscle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b014">14</xref>], and cervicovaginal epithelia (A. M. Cole, unpublished data). By transfecting human myeloid cells with plasmids containing retrocyclin genes without a premature termination codon, we demonstrated that the “machinery” needed to process, trim, splice, and oxidize retrocyclin precursors was available in human myeloid cells. Two sets of expression constructs were transfected into cells: a shorter form (R1R3) that terminates at the end of the retrocyclin gene and a longer form that contains (A1A3) additional 3′ untranslated residues (UTR). Interestingly, A1A3 cells expressed higher levels of retrocyclin peptides as compared to R1R3 cells indicating a role for additional residues in the translational efficiency of these peptides. This was not altogether surprising as other studies have shown that the length of the 3′-UTR regulates translation efficiency [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b030">30</xref>]. Finally, we showed that aminoglycoside-treated cells and cervicovaginal tissues could produce retrocyclins endogenously by suppressing the premature termination codon in their endogenous mRNA transcript.</p>
        <p>Since approximately 30% of inherited disorders may result from premature termination codon mutations, there has been tremendous interest and some progress in developing and applying agents that can read-through premature UAA, UAG, or UGA termination codons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b025">25</xref>]. Although aminoglycosides, as used in this study, have been most widely investigated, exciting new agents such as PTC-124, have also appeared [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-1000095-b032">32</xref>]. In a sense, human retrocyclin-deficiency is also an inherited disorder, albeit one with an incidence of 100%. It is caused by a premature termination codon mutation that occurred after human lineage diverged from the lineage we share with orangutans, lesser apes, and old world monkeys. Since HIV-1 and other viruses that currently infect humans have evolved in the absence of selective pressure exerted by retrocyclins, the ability to reawaken this ancestral molecule could be used to strengthen the innate immune system's ability to prevent or limit the infections they now induce.</p>

          <title>Creation of retrocyclin constructs and stably transfected HL60 cells.</title>
          <p>Retrocyclin cDNA was amplified from human bone marrow cDNA and cloned into pCRII-TOPO vector (Invitrogen). Two mutations, Termination codon (⊗17) → Gln (Q17) and Arg (R70) → Lys (K70) were introduced, either ⊗17Q alone (RC-100) or both (RC-101) using Quick change site-directed mutagenesis (Stratagene) and subcloned in-frame into the phCMV-luc-FSR vector (Genlantis) to generate four constructs R1, R3, A1, and A3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000095-g001">Figure 1</xref>A). Plasmids R1 and A1 encode RC-100 nonapeptide while R3 and A3 encode RC-101 nonapeptide. Constructs A1 and A3 have a longer insert that includes additional downstream residues. HL60 cells (10<sup>7</sup> cells/400 μl Iscove's DMEM) were cotransfected with 2 μg each of linearized R1, R3 or A1, A3, or phCMV-luc vector alone, by electroporation (exponential decay wave mode- 280 V; 975 μF) and selected in I20 medium with 300 μg/ml G418 sulfate. Stable transfectants thus produced were named according to the constructs used for cotransfection (R1R3, A1A3, or VC). Presence of these constructs in the cells was verified using PCR of genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000095-sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). PCR conditions used were the following: initial denaturation at 95 °C for 3 min; 30 cycles of 95 °C for 1 min; 58 °C for 1 min; 72 °C for 2 min; followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 7 min. Sequences of the primers used for the PCR reaction are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000095-st001">Table S1</xref>. RNA was extracted from 10<sup>6</sup> cells (HL60, VC, R1R3, and A1A3) using TRIzol (Invitrogen), cleaned with DNaseI (Ambion Inc.), and cDNA synthesized (iScript, BioRad). Expression of recombinant genes was verified by PCR from the cDNA and subsequent restriction digestion using HpyCH4V (New England Biolabs) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000095-sg001">Figure S1</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-1000095-sg001">S1</xref>C).</p>

          <p>Analysis of the genomic DNA and RNA of transfected HL60 cells confirms the stable transfection and transcription of rescued retrocyclin constructs, respectively. (A) PCR on genomic DNA template from transfected HL60 cells shows a 215-bp fragment representing retrocyclin cDNA construct and a 890-bp fragment of native retrocyclin gene in the genomic DNA of A1A3 clones but not in the VC cells.</p>
          <p>(B, C) Correction of the premature termination codon of retrocyclin cDNA introduces an additional HpyCH4V restriction site in the middle of an 87-bp cDNA fragment. RNA isolated from HL60 cells (control, R1R3 clones 1 and 2, and A1A3 clones 1 and 2) was used to make cDNA. Retrocyclin constructs were amplified by PCR using the cDNA as template and digested using HpyCH4V restriction enzyme. Electrophoresis of the digested PCR products shows the expected 87-bp fragment in control cells (B) and the expected absence of 87-bp fragment in R1R3 and A1A3 clones (C). All the products were also verified by DNA sequencing.</p>
