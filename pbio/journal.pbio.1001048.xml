        <p>Hair cells of the mammalian cochlea are specialized for the dynamic coding of sound stimuli. The transduction of sound waves into electrical signals depends upon mechanosensitive hair bundles that project from the cell's apical surface. Each stereocilium within a hair bundle is composed of uniformly polarized and tightly packed actin filaments. Several stereociliary proteins have been shown to be associated with hair bundle development and function and are known to cause deafness in mice and humans when mutated. The growth of the stereociliar actin core is dynamically regulated at the actin filament barbed ends in the stereociliary tip. We show that Eps8, a protein with actin binding, bundling, and barbed-end capping activities in other systems, is a novel component of the hair bundle. Eps8 is localized predominantly at the tip of the stereocilia and is essential for their normal elongation and function. Moreover, we have found that Eps8 knockout mice are profoundly deaf and that IHCs, but not OHCs, fail to mature into fully functional sensory receptors. We propose that Eps8 directly regulates stereocilia growth in hair cells and also plays a crucial role in the physiological maturation of mammalian cochlear IHCs. Together, our results indicate that Eps8 is critical in coordinating the development and functionality of mammalian auditory hair cells.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Mammalian hearing depends on mechanosensory inner and outer hair cells within the inner ear that convert sound vibrations into electrical signals. While inner hair cells are the primary sensory receptors, outer hair cells improve auditory sensitivity. Although we know that sensory cells of the auditory, visual and olfactory systems undergo a series of regulated physiological and morphological changes during development, relatively little is known about the molecular mechanisms that regulate the development of these cells. In this study, we find that the protein Eps8, which binds to the key structural protein actin and regulates cell growth and neural development, is an essential component of auditory hair cell development and function. We show that mice lacking Eps8 are profoundly deaf and that their mechanically sensitive hair bundles do not fully grow. However, we also show that the bundles retain their ability to transduce mechanical stimuli. Further study revealed that Eps8 has additional functions in the physiological maturation of inner hair cells and in their ability to transmit electrical information to the brain. Combined, our results provide evidence for the complex physiological role of Eps8 in hair cells and the reason why its absence causes profound deafness.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The mechanoelectrical transduction of sound information is made possible by sensory hair cells (inner and outer hair cells) in the cochlea <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Fettiplace1">[1]</xref>. The initial step in the sound transduction cascade is performed by mechanically gated ion channels positioned near the tips of hair cell stereocilia. Stereocilia are microvilli-like structures that protrude from the apical surface of hair cells, with a core composed of tightly packed actin filaments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Fettiplace1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Petit1">[2]</xref>. Their lengths are scaled precisely to form bundles of stereocilia (hair bundle) with a staircase-like architecture <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Peng1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Tinley1">[4]</xref>. Each hair bundle is composed of two or more rows of stereocilia that are coupled to one another by extracellular links of several types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Petit1">[2]</xref>. The staircase mainly develops postnatally when stereociliary elongation stops initially in the shortest rows at around postnatal day 5 (P5) and the tallest row at about P15 in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Peng1">[3]</xref>. The height of stereocilia within a row is similar not only within a single hair bundle but also in the bundles of closely adjacent hair cells, indicating that the polymerization and depolymerization of their F-actin core is tightly regulated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Tinley1">[4]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Several genes encoding for stereociliary proteins, including whirlin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Belyantseva1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Mburu1">[6]</xref>, espin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Zheng1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Donaudy1">[8]</xref>, and the unconventional myosins VIIa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Rzadzinska1">[9]</xref> and XVa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Belyantseva2">[10]</xref>, have been shown to cause deafness when mutated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Petit1">[2]</xref>. Although these proteins are important for the correct regulation of hair bundle length and development, they are unlikely to control actin polymerization directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Petit1">[2]</xref>. Recently, it has been shown that the novel stereociliary protein twinfilin 2, an actin filament barbed-end capping protein located only at the tips of the short and middle rows of stereocilia in IHCs, is able to control actin dynamics in developing and mature hair bundles by restricting their excessive elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Peng1">[3]</xref>. However, the nature of the protein(s) regulating actin dynamics in the tallest stereocilia remains unknown. Epidermal growth factor receptor pathway substrate 8 (Eps8 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Fazioli1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Wong1">[12]</xref>) is an evolutionarily conserved signal transducer endowed with multiple functions in the control of actin dynamics and in the integration of these events with other receptor-activated signaling functions. Depending on its association with other signal transducers, Eps8 can regulate the activation of the Rac GTPase, a master regulator of actin remodeling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Scita1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-DiFiore1">[15]</xref>, and integrate cellular signaling and membrane EGF receptor internalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Lanzetti1">[16]</xref>. Eps8 can also act directly on actin by binding to it and exerting both actin bundling and actin barbed-end capping activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Scita2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Croce1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Hertzog1">[18]</xref>. At the functional level, Eps8 has been implicated in axonal filopodia growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Menna1">[19]</xref>, in modulating the activity of the NMDA receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Offenhuser1">[20]</xref>, and in regulating the length of intestinal microvilli, which were found to be shorter in its absence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Croce1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Tocchetti1">[21]</xref>. Given the structural similarity between microvilli and stereocilia, we hypothesized that Eps8 may also be important for hair cell stereocilia growth and more generally to hair-cell function. To test these hypotheses we undertook a structural and an in-depth physiological investigation of Eps8 knockout mice. We report that hair cells from these mice indeed exhibit shorter stereocilia. Moreover, Eps8 knockout mice are deaf and the normal physiological development of IHCs is prevented. Thus our results identify a novel critical regulator of one of the most distinctive functional refinements of the mammalian auditory system.</p>

        <title>Eps8 Is Present at the Tips of the Hair Cell Stereocilia</title>
        <p>The localization of Eps8 in cochlear hair cells was determined by performing immunofluorescence and post embedding immunogold labeling on immature and adult wild-type control mice. Eps8 expression was detected at the tip of the stereocilia of cochlear hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g001">Figure 1A–D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–C). The specificity of the antibody was verified on hair cells from Eps8 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s001">Figure S1D</xref>–F). The expression pattern of Eps8 was also confirmed by immunogold labeling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g001">Figure 1E</xref>, example for an adult IHCs), with a pattern remarkably reminiscent of the localization of Eps8 at the tip of intestinal microvilli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Croce1">[17]</xref>. Punctate expression of Eps8, similar to that observed in the stereocilia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g001">Figure 1A–E</xref>), was also present in the IHC cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g001">Figure 1F,G</xref>) and was not observed in the absence of the primary antibody for Eps8 (unpublished data). This pattern of Eps8 expression was further confirmed by immunogold experiments where gold particles were observed in the cytoplasm of IHCs (density of 3 particles/µm<sup>2</sup> measured from 10 IHCs) at higher levels than over the tissue-free resin of the section. These findings indicate that there is likely to be some expression of Eps8 in the cell cytoplasm.</p>

Hair bundles of IHCs from Eps8 knockouts also had additional rows of stereocilia (five or six instead of the typical three to four rows: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>), resembling those of immature hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Furness1">[22]</xref>. OHCs from knockout mice also had shorter and additional rows of stereocilia compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>). Despite the defects associated with the absence of Eps8, the staircase-like architecture of hair bundles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Tinley1">[4]</xref> was preserved, although shallower (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g003">3</xref>), and tip links were present in both immature and adult knockout hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figure 2C and F</xref> for an adult IHC and OHC, respectively). We measured the lengths of individual stereocilia in IHCs from TEM images.

        <title>Eps8 Knockout Mice Exhibit Profound Hearing Loss</title>
        <p>The physiological consequences of the absence of Eps8 in hair cells were investigated by testing hearing function in Eps8 knockout adult mice (P30–P57) using auditory brainstem responses (ABRs) and electrocochleography. Eps8 knockouts were profoundly deaf since ABRs, which reflect the activity of the afferent auditory pathway and IHCs, could only be elicited in response to unphysiologically high sound stimulus levels (pure tone threshold in knockout mice was 110–120 dB SPL: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g004">Figure 4</xref>). ABR thresholds for broadband click (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), noise pulse stimuli (unpublished data), and frequency-specific pure tone stimulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g004">Figure 4B</xref>) in Eps8 knockout mice were significantly higher than those in control mice (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001 for click and noise pulse and pure tone). In order to investigate cochlear function in more detail we used electrocochleography (CAP, SP, and CM) and DPOAEs. Compound action potentials (CAPs), which represent the firing activity of auditory afferent fibres, were greatly reduced in Eps8 knockout mice compared to those in control animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s002">Figures S2</xref>). The thresholds for eliciting summating potentials (SPs: reflecting the summation of IHC depolarization) were also significantly higher in Eps8 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s003">Figures S3</xref>). The endocochlear potential (EP), which reflects the electrical driving force for mechanoelectrical transduction, was found to be similar between Eps8 knockout (81.3±6.5 mV) and control mice (85.1±5.3 in 10–11-wk-old mice), indicating that the driving force for generating the IHC receptor potential is likely to be normal.</p>

        <title>Hair Cell Transducer Current Does Not Require Eps8</title>
        <p>Mechanoelectrical transducer currents were recorded from hair cells, the hair bundles of which were stimulated with a piezo-driven fluid-jet. Transducer currents from apical-coil hair cells (P6–P9) in Eps8 control and knockout mice were elicited by alternating inhibitory and excitatory bundle displacements using 50 Hz sinusoidal force stimuli <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Gale1">[23]</xref>. When large/saturating excitatory stimuli were applied to the bundle, a large transducer current could be recorded in all control and knockout OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>) and IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5D–F</xref>), suggesting that the tip links observed with SEM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figure 2</xref>) were functional. It is worth noting that the hair bundles of OHCs and IHCs were stimulated from different sides (OHCs: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, top panel; IHCs: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5D</xref>, top panel). This different approach, which was due to technical limitations of simultaneously positioning the recording patch electrode and the fluid jet with respect to the tissue, caused negative pressure at the tip of the jet to produce inhibitory responses in OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>) while being excitatory in IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>). Upon moving the bundles in the excitatory direction and at negative membrane potentials, an inward transducer current could be elicited. Any resting current flowing through open transducer channels in the absence of mechanical stimulation was reduced when bundles were moved in the inhibitory direction (i.e. away from the taller stereocilia), as was evident for control hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5A and D</xref>, arrows at the negative voltage step) and knockout OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, in most of the knockout IHCs large inhibitory bundle displacements elicited small inward currents (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5E</xref>: arrow) instead of reducing the current available at rest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). This anomaly was probably due to the disorganized hair bundles, where some stereocilia were oriented on the opposite side of the hair bundle compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figure 2B</xref>: arrows). A similar behavior has also been described in myosin VIIa mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Kros1">[24]</xref>. OHCs, which appeared to have a less severe bundle disorganization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), did not show abnormal directional sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). By stepping the membrane potential from −122 mV to more depolarized values, the transducer current decreased in size at first and then reversed near 0 mV (OHCs: controls, −5.4±0.7 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 3; knockouts −2.4±0.3 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 6; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5C</xref>; IHCs: controls +1.2±1.8 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 4; knockouts −1.3±1.3 mV, <italic>n</italic> = 3 <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5F</xref>), in agreement with the non-selective permeability of MET channels to cations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Ohmori1">[25]</xref>. Note that the current became outward when excitatory bundle stimulation was applied during voltage steps positive to the reversal potential of the transducer current. At positive potentials, the larger resting transducer current, which was much more pronounced in OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5A</xref>: +93 mV, arrowhead) than IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5D</xref>: +94 mV, arrowhead), is likely to be due to an increased open probability of the transducer channel resulting from a reduced driving force for Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Crawford1">[26]</xref>. The relationship between transducer current and membrane potential shows that the maximal size of the transducer current, measured in 1.3 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>, was on average 91% larger at all membrane potentials in knockout IHCs compared to that of control cells (two-way ANOVA: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). In OHCs the maximal size of the transducer current in Eps8 knockout mice was slightly but significantly larger than that of control cells (overall about 18% larger, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5C</xref>).</p>

            <p>(A and B) Saturating transducer currents recorded from a control (A) and a knockout (B) apical-coil Eps8 OHC by applying sinusoidal force stimuli of 50 Hz to the hair bundles. The driver voltage (DV) signal of ±40 V to the fluid jet is shown above the traces (for OHCs, negative deflections of the DV are inhibitory). The top panels show the orientation of the fluid jet (not to scale) with respect to the OHC (A) and IHC (D) hair bundle. OHC membrane potentials were stepped between −122 mV and +98 mV in 20 mV nominal increments from the holding potential of −82 mV. For clarity only a few responses are shown (membrane potentials next to the traces have been corrected by the voltage drop across the residual series resistance). The arrows and arrowheads indicate the closure of the transducer channels open at rest (i.e. resting current) elicited during inhibitory bundle displacements at hyperpolarized and depolarized membrane potentials, respectively. Note that the resting current increases with membrane depolarization. Dashed lines indicate the holding current, which is the current at the holding membrane potential. (C) Peak-to-peak current-voltage curves were obtained from three control and six knockout OHCs (P8–P9) using 1.3 mM extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup>.

(D and E) Saturating transducer currents recorded from a control and a knockout IHC. Note that because of the different orientation of the hair bundles in respect to the fluid jet used between OHC and IHC recordings (see top panels in A and D), negative pressure at the tip of the jet caused excitatory responses in IHCs. In knockout IHCs, a small current in the excitatory direction was elicited during inhibitory bundle displacements (this current was not present in control IHCs: arrows and arrowheads). (F) Peak-to-peak current-voltage curves were obtained from four control and three knockout IHCs (P6–P8). Control: <italic>k</italic> = 386±102, <italic>V</italic><sub>r</sub> = +1.2±1.8 mV, <italic>V</italic><sub>s</sub> = 51±10 mV, and γ = 0.47±0.01.

        <p>We have taken advantage of the less severe hair bundle disorganization in knockout OHCs to investigate whether the absence of Eps8 had any effect on the resting transducer current. In both control and Eps8 knockout OHCs, the resting current increased with membrane depolarization as previously shown in hair cells from wild-type CD-1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Gale1">[23]</xref>. Although the resting transducer current was significantly different between control and knockout OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5G</xref>, −122 mV: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01; +98 mV: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), its increase with depolarization was the same for both genotypes (about 3 times), suggesting a similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the transducer apparatus. We tested whether this was also the case for IHCs by locally superfusing their hair bundle with a solution containing an endolymph-like concentration of Ca<sup>2+</sup> (0.04 mM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Bosher1">[27]</xref>). Lowering the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration is known to increase both the maximum transducer current and its fraction activated at rest. Calcium is a permeant blocker of the transducer channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Ricci1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti1">[29]</xref>, so the increased current amplitude in low Ca<sup>2+</sup> is caused by the partial relief of this block. Moreover, extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> causes adaptation and as such closes some transducer channels. Therefore, reducing Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx into the transducer channel, by either depolarizing hair cells to near the Ca<sup>2+</sup> equilibrium potential (as shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5A,D</xref>) or lowering the extracellular concentration, causes an increased open probability of the channel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Crawford2">[30]</xref>. In Eps8 mice, both phenomena were observed since decreasing the Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration from 1.3 mM to 0.04 mM increased the holding and maximal transducer current in both control and knockout IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5H and I</xref>). Increasing the extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> from 1.3 mM to 5 mM had the opposite effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5H,I</xref>: tested in knockouts only). The overall change in the holding current and maximal transducer current in response to extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> was significant in both control (<italic>t</italic> test: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005, respectively) and knockout (one-way ANOVA: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 and <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) IHCs. The maximal current, but not the holding current, was significantly larger (<italic>P</italic>&lt;0.0005) in knockout compared to control IHCs when the same Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration was used (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figure 5I</xref>). The above results indicate that the biophysical properties of the transducer channel, including adaptation and the presence of a resting current, are not affected by Eps8.</p>
        <p>The above experiments were performed on young animals (P6–P9) since this age is the most reliable for recording accurate transduction currents from mouse hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Kennedy1">[31]</xref>. We tested whether transduction was likely to be functional in adult hair cells by using the styryl dye FM1-43 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s005">Figure S5A,B</xref>). We did the same for immature cells as a comparison (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s005">Figure S5C,D</xref>). FM1-43 is a permeant blocker of the hair cell transducer channel that has previously been used to assess the presence of the resting transducer current in hair cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Gale1">[23]</xref>. The advantage of this method is that the possible presence of the resting transducer current can be determined without the need of interfering with the hair bundle, thus effectively eliminating any possible artifact resulting from the abnormal orientation of stereocilia in knockout mice. Bath application or local superfusion of FM1-43 resulted in the selective labeling of immature (P7) and adult (P15–P21) control and knockout hair cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together the above findings indicate that the biophysical properties of the transducer channel are not affected by the absence of Eps8 and that the abnormalities observed in knockout hair cells are the consequence of the disrupted hair bundle morphology, with IHCs being more affected than OHCs.</p>

        <title>IHCs from Eps8 Knockout Mice Do Not Develop Adult-Type Ion Channels</title>
        <p>The biophysical properties of IHCs from Eps8 knockout mice were investigated to determine whether the loss of auditory function was associated with abnormalities in the normal function or development of these cells. In pre-hearing animals (&lt;P12 in most rodents), the resting membrane potentials and size of K<sup>+</sup> currents recorded from knockout IHCs was similar to that of controls (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001048-t001">Table 1</xref>). Moreover, all immature IHCs investigated were able to generate spontaneous or evoked repetitive Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref> for control and knockout IHCs, respectively) as previously shown in wild-type cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti2">[32]</xref>. These results show that the absence of Eps8 did not interfere with the biophysical properties of pre-hearing cells.</p>

        <p>We then investigated whether IHCs were able to acquire the electrical properties characteristic of adult cells, including a rapidly activating large conductance Ca<sup>2+</sup>-activated K<sup>+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>K,f</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Kros2">[33]</xref>) and a current carried by KCNQ4 channels (<italic>I</italic><sub>K,n</sub>) with an unusually hyperpolarized activation range <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti3">[34]</xref>. While both K<sup>+</sup> currents were present in adult control IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), they were absent in Eps8 knockout cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g006">Figure 6D</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001048-t001">Table 1</xref>), which instead retained an immature phenotype by expressing the inward rectifier K<sup>+</sup> current <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti4">[35]</xref>. The physiological consequence of failing to acquire these adult-type currents was that Eps8 knockout IHCs retained the ability of generating slow Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potentials (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g006">Figure 6F</xref>), similar to those recorded from embryonic and early postnatal IHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti3">[34]</xref>. They did not acquire the fast, small, and graded voltage responses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g006">Figure 6E</xref>) as previously described in adult IHCs of normal CD-1 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Kros2">[33]</xref>. In knockout adult IHCs, the resting membrane potential (<italic>V</italic><sub>m</sub>) was significantly more depolarized and the cell membrane capacitance (<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>) significantly smaller than in control cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001048-t001">Table 1</xref>: <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.005 for both measurements), and similar to those found in immature cells, further supporting the role of Eps8 in IHC maturation.</p>
        <p>We investigated the effect of the efferent neurotransmitter acetylcholine (ACh) on control and Eps8 knockout IHCs. The ACh-activated current, which is mediated by Ca<sup>2+</sup> entering hair cells through α9α10-nAChRs and activating SK2 channels, is normally expressed in immature IHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Glowatzki1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti5">[37]</xref> or adult OHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Dulon1">[38]</xref> but not in adult IHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Glowatzki1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti5">[37]</xref>. In agreement with the above findings, adult control IHCs did not respond to the extracellular application of 100 µM ACh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). In contrast, all knockout adult IHCs showed a large ACh-activated current at around the holding potential of −84 mV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g006">Figure 6H</xref>), which further supports the requirement of Eps8 for their full physiological maturation. It is possible that Eps8 knockout IHCs could, to some extent, retain direct axosomatic olivocochlear efferent fibres of the auditory nerve that transiently modulate the electrical activity of pre-hearing IHCs before taking up their final position on adult OHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Pujol1">[39]</xref>. Overall, the biophysical properties of the IHC membrane in Eps8 knockout mice suggest that Eps8 is required for IHC physiological maturation.</p>

        <title>OHC Basolateral Membrane Properties Develop Normally in Eps8 Knockout Mice</title>
        <p>We investigated immature and adult Eps8 knockout OHCs to determine whether the development of their basolateral membrane properties was affected as in IHCs. Immature OHCs from knockout mice exhibited biophysical characteristics similar to those measured in control cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001048-t002">Table 2</xref>). However, in contrast to IHCs, the resting membrane potential and cell membrane capacitance of adult OHCs were found to be similar between control and knockout cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001048-t002">Table 2</xref>). <italic>I</italic><sub>K,n</sub>, the major current component in adult mouse OHCs and normally expressed from P8 onwards <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti6">[40]</xref>, was seen in all adult OHCs investigated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g007">Figure 7A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001048-t002">Table 2</xref>), and its size, measured in isolation as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti6">[40]</xref>, did not differ significantly between control and knockout cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001048-t002">Table 2</xref>). Moreover, adult knockout OHCs were sensitive to ACh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g007">Figure 7C,D</xref>), exhibited electromotile activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), and expressed the motor protein prestin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Liberman1">[41]</xref> in their basolateral membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). Despite the fact that <italic>I</italic><sub>K,n</sub> and ACh-mediated responses in IHCs and OHCs are carried by the same channels, their normal developmental expression was only affected in IHCs.

        <p>Since the K<sup>+</sup> currents did not mature in knockout IHCs, we investigated whether the development of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> and the induced exocytosis were altered in the absence of Eps8. Exocytosis was estimated by measuring increases in cell membrane capacitance (Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>) following depolarizing voltage steps, which is generally interpreted as an indication of neurotransmitter release from presynaptic cells. The synaptic machinery of IHCs becomes more sensitive to Ca<sup>2+</sup> as they mature, causing synaptic vesicles to be released linearly with increases in Ca<sup>2+</sup> current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson4">[45]</xref>. We found that in the absence of Eps8 the developmental linearization of the exocytotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity in IHCs did not occur. In adult Eps8 knockout IHCs the maximal size of the Ca<sup>2+</sup> current (<italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>) was significantly larger (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) than that of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g008">Figure 8A–C</xref>) but similar to that measured in pre-hearing cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson4">[45]</xref>. However, the corresponding Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub> was similar between the two genotypes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g008">Figure 8B,C</xref>, lower panel). As a consequence the exocytotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence, defined as the variation in Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub> as a function of <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> and displayed as a synaptic transfer function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson4">[45]</xref>, was significantly less linear in the knockout (power of 3.4±0.6, <italic>n</italic> = 5) than in control (power of 1.2±0.1, <italic>n</italic> = 5: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g008">Figure 8D</xref>) adult IHCs and was instead comparable to that of immature cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson3">[44]</xref>. Despite these physiological abnormalities, adult knockout IHCs appeared to show a normal distribution of both Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels and synaptic ribbons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). In order to account for the larger Ca<sup>2+</sup> current in knockout IHCs, it is likely that either the Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel density per spot is larger or single Ca<sup>2+</sup> channel properties, such as open probability and regulation, have been affected.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We have shown that Eps8 is located in the tips of the stereocilia in mammalian IHCs and OHCs and that it is required for regulating hair bundle length, which is crucial for the normal mechano-sensitivity of the transduction apparatus. We have also shown that in the absence of Eps8 IHCs remain immature at the onset of hearing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Interestingly, Eps8 appeared not to influence OHC maturation, despite the fact that they have almost identical developmental requirements as IHCs, including the expression of similar K<sup>+</sup> channels and responses to the efferent neurotransmitter ACh. The relevance of this molecule to hearing is emphasized by the fact that mice lacking Eps8 are profoundly deaf.</p>

        <title>Eps8 Is Required for the Elongation and Maintenance of Cochlear Hair Cell Stereocilia</title>
        <p>Transduction of acoustic stimuli into electrical signals relies on hair bundles being oriented along the axis of mechano-sensitivity, which is critical for the optimal opening of transducer channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Fettiplace1">[1]</xref>. The maturation and maintenance of hair bundle height requires continuous turnover of the actin filaments that form the core of each stereocilium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Tinley1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Rzadzinska2">[46]</xref>. Several stereociliary proteins are known to contribute to the normal development and/or maintenance of hair bundle structure and function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Petit1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Manor1">[47]</xref>, but none of these appear to exert direct control over actin polymerization in hair cell stereocilia. Recently it has been shown that twinfilin 2, an F-actin barbed-end-capping and G-actin-sequestering protein that can inhibit actin polymerization, is expressed at the tips of the shorter stereocilia of IHCs and OHCs. Overexpression of twinfilin 2 in cultured IHCs resulted in a significant reduction of stereocilia length, suggesting that twinfilin 2 limits elongation of the shorter stereocilia in order to maintain the mature staircase architecture of cochlear hair bundles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Peng1">[3]</xref>. Gelsolin is another actin capping protein present at the tip of the shorter stereocilia on OHCs and is crucial for regulating their elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Mburu2">[48]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Here we show that Eps8 is expressed at the tips of stereocilia in mammalian cochlear IHCs and OHCs, which is in agreement with recent findings in OHCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Manor2">[49]</xref>. The absence of Eps8 results in abnormally short stereocilia, particularly those in the tallest row, with IHCs being substantially more affected than OHCs. Therefore, in contrast to twinfilin 2 and gelsolin, Eps8 appears to favor stereocilia elongation. Eps8, like twinfilin 2 and gelsolin, is an actin capping protein able to inhibit the growth of actin filaments at their plus end <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Croce1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Disanza1">[50]</xref>, but it also acts as a cross-linking or bundling protein and regulates microvillar morphogenesis in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Hertzog1">[18]</xref>. Actin-bundling-proteins are required for forming protrusions such as filopodia and microvilli in eukaryotes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Harris1">[51]</xref>. Interestingly, Eps8 can switch between capping and bundling activity, with capping activity activated by Abi-1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Disanza1">[50]</xref> and bundling by IRSp53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Disanza2">[52]</xref>. Recent evidence has indicated that the capping activity of Eps8 is required for the formation of filopodia in hippocampal neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Menna1">[19]</xref>. Although Eps8 has been shown to regulate the length of intestinal microvilli in mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Tocchetti1">[21]</xref>, it is not known whether it controls this via its capping and/or bundling function. The identity of Eps8 interaction partners in hair cells is not known, although our data, together with that of a recently published study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Manor2">[49]</xref>, are consistent with similar activities for Eps8 in hair cell stereocilia growth and maintenance.</p>

        <title>Eps8 Is Not Required for the Mechano-Electrical Transducer Current</title>
        <p>Scanning electron microscopy of Eps8 knockout hair cells revealed the presence of tip links, which are thought to be a pre-requisite for mechano-electrical transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Assad1">[53]</xref>. We found that large transducer currents could be elicited following saturating hair-bundle stimulation in the absence of Eps8, suggesting that the observed tip links are functional and that this novel stereociliary protein is not essential for mechano-electrical transduction in cochlear hair cells. The larger transducer current recorded in Eps8 knockout hair cells, with IHCs being more affected than OHCs, could be explained by the presence of more functional transducer channels per hair bundle. This is conceivable considering the presence of the additional rows of stereocilia, especially in knockout IHCs. If we assume that all additional stereocilia on knockout IHCs have functional transducer channels connected by tip links, then there would be twice the number of transducer channels per bundle, which would account for the larger transducer current. The presence of the resting transducer current and the similar Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the channel in control and knockout hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g005">Figures 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s005">S5</xref>) indicate that Eps8 is not involved in determining the biophysical properties of the transducer channel. This is not true for many other proteins associated with hair bundles and hearing loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Petit1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Schwander1">[54]</xref> including myosin VIIa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Kros1">[24]</xref>, myosin XVa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Stepanyan1">[55]</xref>, and harmonin-b <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Michalski1">[56]</xref>. IHCs from myosin XVa mutant mice have short hair bundles similar to those in Eps8 mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Stepanyan1">[55]</xref>, but they also have a series of additional defects in the transducer apparatus, including absence of tip links and loss of adaptation and Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitivity of the transducer current <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Stepanyan1">[55]</xref>. Nevertheless, the short hair bundles in Eps8 knockout hair cells could have a large impact in adult animals because the relationship between force applied and hair bundle displacement could compromise the ability to detect physiological sound pressures. This scenario is suggested by the CAP I/O relation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s002">Figure S2C</xref>) and in particular by the absence of CM responses in knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s004">Figure S4</xref>). The latter indicates that the much smaller hair bundles of OHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g002">Figure 2</xref>; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Manor2">[49]</xref>), which was the only abnormality observed in these cells, are unlikely to be coupled to the tectorial membrane and therefore would not be stimulated effectively in normal physiological conditions.</p>

        <title>The Absence of Eps8 Prevents the Normal Maturation of Cochlear IHCs</title>
        <p>Prior to the onset of hearing (postnatal day 12 in most rodents) immature hair cells of the mammalian cochlea follow a developmental program that includes the acquisition and/or elimination of different basolateral membrane proteins (e.g. ion channels and synaptic molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Housley1">[57]</xref>) in order to mature into fully functional sensory receptors. These proteins in adult IHCs are directly involved in shaping the receptor potential generated by the opening of the transducer channels and in triggering exocytosis at hair cell ribbon synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Sterling1">[58]</xref>. Although the physiology of hair cells changes progressively through development (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s006">Figure S6</xref>), the most significant and abrupt transition occurs at the onset of hearing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Housley1">[57]</xref>. The prevailing hypothesis is that hair cell functional maturation is controlled by a developmental switch, which is thought to be influenced by spontaneous Ca<sup>2+</sup> action potential activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti3">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Beurg1">[59]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We found that, although the basolateral properties of immature IHCs were indistinguishable between control and Eps8 knockout mice, in adult cells the absence of Eps8 was accompanied by morphological differences, such as a smaller cell size and apparent persistence of axo-somatic efferent connections. There was also a failure in the normal appearance of mature biophysical characteristics, namely K<sup>+</sup> currents (<italic>I</italic><sub>K,f</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>K,n</sub>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti3">[34]</xref>, linear exocytotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson4">[45]</xref>, and the down-regulation of immature-type channels such as those carrying <italic>I</italic><sub>K1</sub>, <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub>, and ACh-responses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001048.s006">Figure S6</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti2">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti4">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti5">[37]</xref>. The possibility that an absence of Eps8 only delays the normal physiological maturation of cochlear hair cells, as previously described in mice lacking thyroid hormone receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Rsch1">[60]</xref>, is unlikely since the observed defects persisted in IHCs from nearly 2-mo-old Eps8 knockout mice.</p>
        <p>Calcium-dependent action potential activity in immature IHCs is required for the expression of the BK current <italic>I</italic><sub>K,f</sub> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Brandt1">[61]</xref> and the linear exocytotic Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson5">[62]</xref> in adult cells. It is also possible that IHC maturation depends on the presence of the resting transducer current in immature cells, especially from the second postnatal week when the endocochlear potential begins to increase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Bosher2">[63]</xref>, since it would depolarize the hair cells and affect the action potential activity. However, the biophysical properties of pre-hearing Eps8 knockout IHCs, including action potential activity and resting mechano-electrical transducer current, appeared similar to those of control cells. This excludes the possibility that in Eps8 knockout mice the developmental switch between immature and adult IHCs is prevented by a functional defect in IHCs during immature stages. Despite the similarities between hair cells, the fact that OHCs appear unaffected in the absence of Eps8 suggests that their functional maturation is regulated somewhat differently to that of IHCs.</p>
        <p>The unconventional myosin VI, which when mutated causes hereditary deafness in mice (<italic>Snell's waltzer</italic>) and humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Schwander1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Dror1">[64]</xref>, is a protein responsible for actin-based motility. In hair cells myosin VI is required for the normal developmental expression of adult-like ion channels/presynaptic proteins, most likely by affecting intracellular trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Heidrych1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Roux1">[66]</xref>. However, in contrast to Eps8 knockout mice, the hair-cell hair bundles in <italic>Snell's waltzer</italic> mice are profoundly disorganized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Self1">[67]</xref>, which is likely to affect the biophysics of mechanoelectrical transduction (i.e. resting transducer current and adaptation) as also previously shown in myosin VIIa mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Kros1">[24]</xref>. A similar phenotype to that of Eps8 knockout mice has been observed in mutant mice lacking the transmembrane protein <italic>Tmc1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti7">[68]</xref>, but in this case both IHCs and OHCs failed to mature. <italic>Tmc1</italic> has been suggested to be involved in intracellular trafficking or, more generally, in the activation or modulation of intracellular signals associated with hair cell maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Marcotti7">[68]</xref>. Based on current experimental evidence, a similar effect on hair cell maturation to that of <italic>Tmc1</italic> could also be postulated for Eps8, whether localized in the stereocilia or in the cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Currently, little is known about the specific role of Eps8 in actin remodeling in mammals. In mice, it has been shown that the absence of Eps8 causes the cytoskeleton to be more refractory to actin depolymerization (i.e. a less dynamic cytoskeleton) and a larger NMDA current in cerebellar granule cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Offenhuser1">[20]</xref>. Eps8 activity has also been described to regulate actin dynamics in response to extracellular (e.g. BDNF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Menna1">[19]</xref>) and intracellular (e.g. IRSp53 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Disanza2">[52]</xref>) factors, suggesting that the absence of IHC maturation in knockout mice could originate from a more general/indirect role of Eps8 in regulating developmental signaling at around the onset of hearing.</p>
        <p>Mutant mice have proven to be a powerful means for identifying the molecular mechanisms responsible for the development and maintenance of normal hearing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Petit1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Manor1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Dror1">[64]</xref>. We found that in the absence of Eps8 mice are deaf and that, in the cochlea, the protein directly influences stereocilia growth and is required for IHC maturation. The exact mechanism by which Eps8 is able to control such a complex developmental program remains a major challenge for future studies.</p>

Superfusion of hair cells with 100 µM ACh (Sigma) was performed with a multi-barreled pipette positioned close to the patched cells. Unless otherwise stated, all recordings were performed near body temperature (35–37°C) and using 1.3 mM Ca<sup>2+</sup> in the extracellular solution. All animals were genotyped as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Offenhuser1">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Voltage and current recordings were obtained using the following intracellular solution (in mM): 131 KCl, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 EGTA-KOH, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 5 Hepes-KOH, 10 sodium phosphocreatine (pH 7.3). The pipette intracellular solution for exocytosis measurements contained (in mM): 106 Cs-glutamate, 20 CsCl, 3 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 EGTA-CsOH, 5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 0.3 Na<sub>2</sub>GTP, 5 Hepes-CsOH, 10 Na<sub>2</sub>-phosphocreatine (pH 7.3); that for mechano-electrical transduction contained (in mM): 135 CsCl, 2.5 MgCl<sub>2</sub>, 1 EGTA-CsOH, 2.5 Na<sub>2</sub>ATP, 10 sodium phosphocreatine, 5 Hepes-CsOH (pH 7.3). Patch pipettes were coated with surf wax (Mr. Zogs SexWax, USA) to minimize the fast patch pipette capacitance transient. Electrophysiological recordings were made using Optopatch (Cairn Research Ltd, UK) or Axopatch 200B (Molecular Devices, USA) amplifiers. Data acquisition was controlled by pClamp software using Digidata 1320A or 1440A boards (Axon Instruments, CA, USA). Recordings were low-pass filtered at 2.5 kHz (8-pole Bessel) or 2.0 kHz (4-pole Bessel), sampled at 5 kHz, and stored on computer for off-line analysis (Origin: OriginLab, USA). Membrane potentials were corrected for the <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> (IHCs: 3.5±0.3 MΩ, <italic>n</italic> = 74; OHCs: 3.4±0.3 MΩ, <italic>n</italic> = 54) and liquid junction potential (Cl- and Glutamate-based intracellular solution: −4 mV and −11 mV, respectively). The overall average voltage-clamp time constant (product of <italic>R</italic><sub>s</sub> and membrane capacitance <italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>) was 27±3 µs for IHCs (<italic>n</italic> = 74) and 24±2 µs for OHCs (<italic>n</italic> = 54).</p>
        <p>Real-time changes in membrane capacitance (Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub>) were measured using the Optopatch as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson4">[45]</xref>. Briefly, a 4 kHz sine wave of 13 mV RMS was applied to IHCs from −81 mV and was interrupted for the duration of the voltage step. The capacitance signal from the Optopatch was amplified (×50), filtered at 250 Hz, and sampled at 5 kHz.

Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub> was recorded while applying 30 mM TEA and 15 mM 4AP (Fluka, UK) and 60 µM linopirdine to reduce K<sup>+</sup> currents. The relation between Ca<sup>2+</sup> entry and exocytosis in IHCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g008">Figure 8D</xref>), estimated using a synaptic transfer function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson1">[42]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson4">[45]</xref>, was obtained by plotting Δ<italic>C</italic><sub>m</sub> against the peak <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> for 50 ms voltage steps from −71 mV to that where the maximal <italic>I</italic><sub>Ca</sub> occurred from the <italic>I</italic>-V curves (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001048-g008">Figure 8B</xref>).

        <p>Mechano-electrical transduction was recorded by mechanically stimulating the hair bundles of immature apical-coil IHCs using a solution-filled pipette (8–10 µm tip diameter) inserted into a piezoelectric disc-driven fluid jet as described before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Gale1">[23]</xref>. The pipette tip was positioned near to the bundles to elicit a maximal transducer current. Saturating mechanical stimuli were applied as 50 Hz sinusoids (filtered at 0.25 kHz, 8-pole Bessel) with ±40 V driving voltages. For these experiments we used KCl- or CsGlutamate-based intracellular solution. Voltage clamp protocols are referred to a holding potential of −84 mV or −82 mV. The effect of endolymph-like Ca<sup>2+</sup> (20–40 µM: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Bosher1">[27]</xref>) was examined by using a solution containing low Ca<sup>2+</sup> (40 µM Ca<sup>2+</sup>, buffered with 4 mM HEDTA). During the experiments in which different extracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations were used (0.04 mM, 1.3 mM, or 5 mM), the hair bundles were topically superfused and the fluid jet pipette was also filled with the same solution.</p>
        <p>The presence of electromotile activity in OHCs was estimated by applying a depolarizing voltage step from the holding potential of −64 mV to +56 mV and cell length change recorded using a CCD camera, with a ×3 magnifier, attached to the microscope (×63 objective). The aim of this experiment was to assess whether Eps8 knockout OHCs retained their electromotile ability. OHC contraction was visually obvious and was typically measured as length change between the patch electrode (positioned just below the cuticular plate) and the nucleus region. Measurements were performed in Photoshop and were calibrated using a microscope grid (20 µm = 520 pixels). Our data (control: 1.19±0.12 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 5; knockout: 1.20±0.22 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 6) are in agreement with previous recordings using a similar technique (13 nm/mV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Canis1">[69]</xref>, giving 1.56 µm contraction for a similar 120 mV range to that used in our study).</p>

In addition to the general anesthesia, lidocaine hydrochloride (Xylocain 2%, AstraZeneca, Wedel, Germany) was subcutaneously injected at sites of surgical intervention. The bony bulla was exposed retro-auricularly through a surgical cut in the skin and a 1 mm hole drilled through the bone at the top end of the bulla, close to the ear canal. The mucosa within the hole was removed and the round window niche visualized, just above the stapedial artery. A silver ball recording electrode was placed on the round window membrane. Subdermal silver wire electrodes were inserted at the vertex (reference) and the back (ground) of the animal. Sound-evoked electrical potentials (i.e. CAP, CM, and SP) were recorded by the active electrode positioned on the round window. CAPs were recorded in free field with click stimuli (100 µs, alternating condensation and rarefaction) and frequency-specific tone bursts (3 ms, 1 ms ramp, alternating phase, 2 kHz to 45 kHz in 1–4 steps per octave, sound pressure levels were below threshold up to 120 dB SPL in 5 dB steps). The electrode signals were averaged for 8–32 repetitions at a stimulus repetition rate of 40/s. The signal was amplified (74 dB), filtered (0.2–5 kHz), and added for alternating phase or polarity to omit the stimulus artifact and cochlear microphonics. SPs were obtained with 20 ms tone bursts, responses filtered from 5 Hz to 5 kHz, averaged 512 times. CMs were recorded for 10 ms tone bursts band pass filtered from 0.2 to 50 kHz, averaged 64 times for stimuli of 4 kHz, 11.3 or 16 kHz, and 32 kHz and sound pressure levels from below threshold to 80 dB SPL in steps of 10 dB.</p>

Since in our recordings the electrode was always positioned at the round window membrane, a change of polarity could reflect a differential change in IHC excitability at a particular location along the tonotopic gradient within the cochlea or a change in the IHC receptor potential due to the high intensity stimulation used to evoke responses in Eps8 knockout mice. However, the latter possibility is unlikely since a change in polarity was not observed when a comparable, high intensity stimulus was presented to wild-type mice (only a loss of threshold and amplitude responses was seen due to a temporary hearing loss caused by the overstimulation).</p>

In adult control animals (6–7 wk old: measurements were from 12 ears/6 mice), the DPOAE signals were found to be within the expected normal range and both the amplitudes (A: 12.5±4.7 dB SPL) and thresholds (B: 0 dB SPL at 11.3 kHz) showed that electromotile activity in control OHCs was normal. In knockout mice (4–5 wk old: measurements were from 15 ears/8 mice), the amplitude and threshold functions were very close to the technical detection limit, suggesting that OHC electromotility could have been affected. The sum of the mechano-electrical transducer currents predominantly produced by the OHCs was also investigated using cochlear microphonics (CM). The mean CM threshold (thick lines) and individual ear CM thresholds (thin lines) in control and knockout adult mice are shown in (C). CM thresholds were normal in wild-type control mice and were increased to stimulus levels close to the intrusion of the stimulus artifact (ca. 80 dB SPL) in Eps8 knockout mice (4–16 kHz, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). These data therefore suggest that OHC activity is likely to be compromised in Eps8 knockout animals.

Otof and Syt IV represent the proposed Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensors involved in exocytosis and vesicle replenishment, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001048-Johnson4">[45]</xref>. Closed circles (green) at the tops of stereocilia represent Eps8. Arrows next to currents indicate the main direction of ion flow.</p>
