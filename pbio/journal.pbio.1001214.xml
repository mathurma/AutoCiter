        <p>Comparison of human, chimpanzee, and macaque brain transcriptomes reveals a significant developmental remodeling in the human prefrontal cortex, potentially shaped by microRNA.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>While multiple studies have reported the accelerated evolution of brain gene expression in the human lineage, the mechanisms underlying such changes are unknown. Here, we address this issue from a developmental perspective, by analyzing mRNA and microRNA (miRNA) expression in two brain regions within macaques, chimpanzees, and humans throughout their lifespan. We find that constitutive gene expression divergence (species differences independent of age) is comparable between humans and chimpanzees. However, humans display a 3–5 times faster evolutionary rate in divergence of developmental patterns, compared to chimpanzees. Such accelerated evolution of human brain developmental patterns (i) cannot be explained by life-history changes among species, (ii) is twice as pronounced in the prefrontal cortex than the cerebellum, (iii) preferentially affects neuron-related genes, and (iv) unlike constitutive divergence does not depend on <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes, but might be driven by human-specific changes in expression of <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulators. We show that developmental profiles of miRNAs, as well as their target genes, show the fastest rates of human-specific evolutionary change, and using a combination of computational and experimental methods, we identify miR-92a, miR-454, and miR-320b as possible regulators of human-specific neural development. Our results suggest that different mechanisms underlie adaptive and neutral transcriptome divergence, and that changes in the expression of a few key regulators may have been a major driving force behind rapid evolution of the human brain.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Species evolution is often depicted as a slow and continuous process punctuated by rapid changes. One example of the latter is the evolution of human cognition–emergence of an exceedingly complex phenotype within a few million years. What genetic mechanisms might have driven this process? Nearly 40 years ago, it was proposed that human-specific gene expression changes, rather than changes in protein sequence, might underlie human cognitive evolution. Here we compare gene expression throughout postnatal brain development in humans, chimpanzees, and macaques. We find that simple changes in gene expression levels, plausibly driven by mutations in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory elements, accumulate at similar rates in all three evolutionary lineages. What sharply distinguishes humans from other species is change in the timing and shape of developmental expression patterns. This is particularly pronounced in the prefrontal cortex, where 4-fold more genes show more human-specific developmental changes than chimpanzee-specific ones. Notably, our results indicate that this massive developmental remodeling of the human cortex, which affects hundreds of genes, might be driven by expression changes of only a few key regulators, such as microRNAs. Genes affected by this remodeling are preferentially associated with neural activity, thereby suggesting a link to the evolution of human cognition.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In multicellular organisms, the evolution of novel characteristics frequently involves gene expression change <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Carroll1">[1]</xref>. Nearly four decades ago, it was hypothesized that the evolution of the human brain could similarly be driven by expression changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-King1">[2]</xref>. In support of this, early comparative studies of adult human, chimpanzee, and macaque transcriptomes reported more human-specific expression changes than chimpanzee-specific changes in the prefrontal cortex (PFC) of the brain, but no such imbalance in other tissues such as blood, liver, or heart <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Enard1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Cceres1">[4]</xref>. Several studies further associated these expression differences with neuron-specific functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Babbitt1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Giger1">[7]</xref>, and a recent analysis of the human, chimpanzee, and macaque PFC transcriptomes reported more human-specific than chimpanzee-specific changes in developmental timing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Somel1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Together, these studies suggest that the human brain transcriptome has evolved at an accelerated rate compared to that of the chimpanzee, possibly reflecting the accelerated rate of human cognitive evolution. Despite the attractiveness of this hypothesis, the ontogenetic and tissue-specific properties of this phenomenon have yet to be investigated. For instance, whether human brain transcriptome acceleration involves species differences that are constitutive across lifespan, or differences in how ontogenesis proceeds, is unclear. In addition, as most existing transcriptome comparisons studied a single brain region, we do not know whether different brain regions exhibit the same rate and kind of evolutionary acceleration. Finally, the molecular basis of human brain transcriptome acceleration, such as the contribution of <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Wittkopp1">[9]</xref>, also remains unknown.</p>
      <p>In the present study we analyzed prefrontal cortex (PFC) and cerebellar cortex (CBC) transcriptomes in humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques of different ages. Both the PFC and CBC are brain regions potentially involved in human-specific behaviors. The cerebellum is important for motor function and memory and has been implicated in human language <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Rilling1">[10]</xref>, while the PFC is associated with such functions as abstract thinking, planning, social intelligence, and working memory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Wood1">[11]</xref>. Using a number of datasets, we found that two types of divergence, both expression differences that are constitutive throughout lifespan as well as expression differences involving changes in developmental patterns, have contrasting functional and evolutionary properties. The accelerated evolution of human brain expression appears to mainly involve remodeling of developmental patterns, which may in turn be shaped by microRNA (miRNA) expression changes. Moreover, this acceleration is not uniform across the human brain and is particularly pronounced in the PFC.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>Using Affymetrix microarrays we measured mRNA expression in the PFC and CBC of 12 to 26 individuals per species. The individual ages varied across a large portion of the species' lifespan, although most samples were chosen from the early postnatal period (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s010">Table S1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Across the approximately 12,000 genes detected in either brain region, species differences could explain approximately 45% of total expression variation, while age could explain 30% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s001">Figure S1B–C</xref>). Both effects were also manifest in principle component analyses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), and were highly reproducible upon comparison with published gene expression datasets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

          <p>(A) Principle components of the two brain regions' transcriptomes based on all expressed genes (CBC:12,853; PFC:12,447). Each individual is represented by a circle; colors represent species (red, human; blue, chimpanzee; green, macaque), and lighter shades indicate younger age. The proportion of variance explained by each component is shown in the axes labels. In both regions, the first component corresponds to macaque-hominid divergence, the second to age differences, while the third component (<italic>z</italic>-axis) separates humans and chimpanzees. (B) Examples of the three types of divergence in the PFC dataset. Each point represents an individual (red, human; blue, chimpanzee; green, macaque), while lines show cubic spline curves. The <italic>x</italic>-axis shows individuals' age in log<sub>2</sub> scale. Gene names are shown on top of each panel. (C) Numbers of genes assigned to the three divergence types (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s011">Table S2</xref>).

      <p>In each brain region and species, we identified genes showing significant expression changes across the lifespan as well as genes showing significant expression divergence among species, using polynomial regression models and analysis of covariance, respectively (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, false discovery rate &lt;10%). We then classified genes showing significant species divergence into the following three types (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g001">Figure 1B</xref>): type I, constant expression across lifespan; type II, variable expression across lifespan, no developmental pattern differences among species; type III, variable expression across lifespan and developmental pattern differences among species (developmental remodeling). We identified approximately 1,000–3,000 genes in each category, with type II being the most common and type III the rarest (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s011">Table S2</xref>).</p>

        <title>Human Developmental Expression Patterns Show Accelerated Evolution</title>
        <p>We estimated the expression divergence among species by calculating distances between species' expression-age trajectories and constructing neighbor joining trees (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We found that the expression divergence in genes showing constant expression or no developmental pattern changes (type I and II), i.e. constitutive divergence, reflected the three species' known phylogenetic relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g001">Figure 1D–E</xref>). Furthermore, human and chimpanzee branch lengths (which represent divergence on the respective lineages) for type I and type II genes were comparable, with average ratios of the human to chimpanzee branch lengths ranging between 1.0 and 1.6 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s012">Table S3</xref>). Thus, the evolutionary rate of constitutive expression divergence roughly reflects the divergence between the two species from their common ancestor.</p>
        <p>By contrast, when we studied species divergence in the <italic>shape</italic> of developmental trajectories among genes that underwent developmental remodeling (type III), we found markedly different results. In the PFC, the human branch was on average 5.2±0.7 times longer than the chimpanzee branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g001">Figure 1D–E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s012">Table S3</xref>). The human branch was even 1.2±0.1 times longer than the “macaque” branch representing divergence between the common ancestor of humans and chimpanzees and contemporary macaques. If gene expression was evolving in a similar way to genomic sequence, the human branch would be expected to be approximately seven times shorter compared to this “macaque” branch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Rhesus1">[12]</xref>. In the CBC, the median human-chimpanzee branch length ratio was 3.5±0.5. Thus, in the CBC, developmental pattern divergence was also significantly greater on the human versus the chimpanzee evolutionary lineage, but to a significantly less extent than in the PFC (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−8</sup>). These results indicate that, while humans and chimpanzees evolved at similar rates with respect to constitutive expression differences, human developmental patterns have become highly differentiated from both chimpanzee and macaque developmental patterns, with 1.5- to 2-fold greater acceleration in the PFC.</p>
        <p>We performed a number of analyses to test the validity of this conclusion, including (a) sub-sampling to equalize mean expression level distributions across the three gene types; (b) selecting the same number of individuals per species, with similar age-distributions across species' lifespan; (c) comparing the numbers of species-specific genes identified by the <italic>F</italic> test, as an alternative to our expression distance measure; (d) controlling for life-history differences among species, such as prolonged childhood and longer lifespan in humans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Kaplan1">[13]</xref>; and (e) repeating mRNA expression measurements in newborn and young adult pooled samples from each species by sequencing RNA with the Illumina platform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s019">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>The excess of human developmental pattern divergence was found to be significant across all tests (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s003">Figure S3B–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s012">Table S3</xref>). Importantly, despite the limited sample size of the RNA-sequencing dataset, type III genes showed significantly more human-specific expression changes compared with the other two types in both brain regions (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s004">Figure S4</xref>) and this excess was significantly higher in the PFC than in the CBC (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001). Considered together, these results indicate that the accelerated pace of developmental remodeling on the human evolutionary lineage is not caused by sampling or technical biases, and cannot be explained by life-history differences among species.</p>

        <p>Could the accelerated evolution of brain developmental patterns on the human lineage reflect adaptive changes underlying human cognitive evolution? To address this possibility, we investigated the functional properties of type I, II, and III genes.

CBC type III genes did not show significant associations with neural functions, but were enriched in more general processes such as “response to hormone stimulus” and “response to hypoxia,” while type I genes were enriched in mRNA processing and splicing-related processes in both brain regions. Type II genes showed no significant functional associations. Further, with respect to expression breadth, type III genes showed the greatest tissue-specificity, and significantly overlapped with neuron-related genes, but not glia-enriched genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s005">Figure S5</xref>). In contrast, expression breadth was significantly above the genome average for type I genes and close to average for type II genes, with no significant enrichment among neuron- or glia-specific genes for either gene type (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Notably, PFC genes associated with neural function through Gene Ontology had ∼1.5 times larger human-chimpanzee branch ratios than non-neural type III genes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.002). In accordance with the general conservation of neuron-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Chimpanzee1">[16]</xref>, regulatory and coding sequences of type III genes, but not the other gene sets, were significantly conserved compared to all genes expressed in the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Overall, developmental remodeling in the PFC showed a clear association with brain-specific functional processes, while no such association could be detected for the other divergence types.</p>

        <title><italic>Cis</italic>-Regulation of Gene Expression Divergence</title>
        <p>We next examined the possible mechanisms underlying PFC expression divergence for the three gene types. Expression divergence could be caused either by <italic>cis</italic>-changes that accumulate in regulatory regions over time and tend to affect each gene independently, or by altered expression, or function, of a few <italic>trans</italic>-regulators affecting the expression of hundreds of genes in a coordinated manner. To determine which mechanism played the more dominant role in human expression evolution, we first tested the correlation between gene expression divergence and sequence divergence in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions on the human, chimpanzee, and macaque evolutionary lineages. To this end we analyzed the proximal promoter, the 3′UTR, and putative enhancer regions, using Ensembl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Hubbard1">[17]</xref> gene annotation, as well as regions defined using histone modification data derived from human cell lines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-ENCODE1">[18]</xref> or human and mouse brain tissue (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Cheung1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Kim1">[20]</xref>.</p>
        <p>On the macaque lineage, which contained the greatest number of sequence changes, we detected a significant positive correlation between promoter sequence divergence and expression divergence for the type I and type II genes (rho∼0.10, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s014">Table S5</xref>). Similarly, we detected a significant and positive correlation between human-specific promoter sequence divergence and human-specific expression divergence across the type I genes, and a positive correlation trend for type II genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). However, we found no significant correlations between promoter divergence and expression divergence on the chimpanzee lineage, or for the type III genes on any lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s014">Table S5</xref>). This observation may be due to the paucity of species-specific mutations resulting in insufficient power in our tests. To overcome this limitation, we tested correlations between regulatory region sequence divergence across mammalian species (pan-mammalian) and species-specific expression divergence. For type III genes, both macaque- and chimpanzee-specific expression divergence correlated significantly and positively with pan-mammalian regulatory sequence divergence. Notably, human-specific expression divergence did not correlate positively with pan-mammalian regulatory sequence divergence, but showed a significant negative correlation, albeit marginally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In other words, whereas regulatory regions of type III genes diverging on the macaque and chimpanzee lineages are less conserved, those diverging on the human lineage are more conserved. This trend of positive association between type III expression divergence and sequence divergence in chimpanzees and macaques, and negative association in humans, was also observed in 3′UTR and enhancer regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s014">Table S5</xref>). Thus, the expression divergence of type I and II genes on all evolutionary lineages, as well as the divergence of type III genes on the chimpanzee and macaque lineages, may well be linked to sequence divergence in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions. By contrast, type III expression divergence (developmental remodeling) on the human evolutionary lineage does not reveal any such trend. This suggests that mutation accumulation in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions might not have been the major contributor to the extensive remodeling of the developmental expression patterns observed in the human PFC.</p>
        <p>The <italic>cis</italic>- and <italic>trans</italic>-expression divergence mechanisms can also be indirectly discerned through their tissue-specificity. While mutations in <italic>cis</italic>-regions tend to affect multiple tissues, <italic>trans</italic>-factor-driven changes tend to be more tissue-specific <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Price1">[21]</xref>. Indeed, we found constitutive divergence (type I and II genes) to be highly correlated between PFC and CBC in all three species, while developmental pattern divergence (type III genes) showed no such correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This result further supports the notion that constitutive divergence (type I and II) is driven largely by changes in <italic>cis</italic>-elements, but this is not the case for developmental pattern divergence in the human PFC.</p>

        <title>MicroRNA Contribute to Human-Specific Developmental Pattern Divergence</title>
        <p>We hypothesized that type III divergence and, in particular, human-specific developmental pattern divergence in the PFC could be driven by <italic>trans</italic>-factors. In support of this notion, we found that type III genes, in comparison to the other gene sets, carry a higher density of predicted miRNA and transcription factor (TF) binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Kel1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Lewis1">[23]</xref> in their regulatory regions, even when accounting for conservation level differences among genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). We next considered whether <italic>trans</italic>-regulators, specifically TFs and miRNAs, also show an increased divergence in developmental patterns on the human lineage. For this, we used expression profiles for 105 TFs from mRNA microarray data that had target prediction information. In addition, we measured expression of ∼200 miRNAs in the PFC and CBC of humans, chimpanzees, and rhesus macaques, in 7 to 12 individuals of different age per species, using Agilent microarrays (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s007">Figure S7A</xref>). We found that although TFs showed comparable human divergence to other genes, for 19 PFC-expressed type III miRNAs the median branch length was 24 times longer for humans than for chimpanzees (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g003">Figure 3C–D</xref>). This effect was stable after correcting for life-history differences among species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s012">Table S3</xref>). By contrast, the median human-chimpanzee branch ratio based on 15 CBC-expressed type III miRNAs was found to equal 3.9. Thus, miRNAs in the PFC show an even greater excess of human-specific developmental remodeling than other transcripts. Despite the limited power of available target prediction algorithms, we also detected greater human-chimpanzee branch ratios among predicted targets of type III TF and type III miRNAs compared to non-target genes (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g003">Figure 3D</xref>).

The colored and grey lines show the cumulative density (<italic>y</italic>-axis) of the expression change magnitude upon transfection (<italic>x</italic>-axis), for target genes predicted by TargetScan among PFC type III genes, and all other type III genes, respectively. The <italic>x</italic>-axis is calculated as the expression level difference between miRNA-transfected and negative control-transfected neuroblastoma cell lines, per gene (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). The <italic>p</italic> values were calculated by one-sided Wilcoxon tests. (B) Excess of negative correlations between miRNAs and their targets identified based on inhibition in the cell line experiments. The colored line shows the distribution of correlations between miRNA-target pairs relative to miRNAs-non-target pairs (observed excess). The grey lines depict the random expectation estimated by 100 permutations of miRNA-non-target pairs. This analysis does not include information from TargetScan predictions. The <italic>p</italic> values were calculated by one-sided Wilcoxon tests.

        <p>We then asked whether the verified type III target genes of the three miRNAs, i.e. the targets predicted by TargetScan that showed negative correlations in our time series and expression inhibition in the transfection experiments, might also be associated with particular functions and/or cell types. We found that targets of all three miRNAs were neuron-related when compared to other miRNA targets (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 in each case, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Furthermore, targets of two out of the three miRNAs tested, miR-454 (<italic>n</italic> = 18) and miR-92a (<italic>n</italic> = 20), showed enrichment in the same KEGG term: “calcium signaling” pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g005">Figure 5E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s018">Table S9</xref>). This is noteworthy, since miR-454 and miR-92a do not share common targets except for one gene, and finding such a functional overlap between two such miRNA target sets is unlikely (<italic>p</italic> = 0.021). Intriguingly, calcium signaling is a major biological processes involved in neuronal plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Polleux1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Wayman1">[27]</xref>, implying a role of miR-92a and miR-454 in regulating genes associated with neurodevelopmental plasticity.</p>
        <p>In a second experiment, we investigated the histological expression patterns of miR-320b, the miRNA showing the strongest enrichment in neuron-related genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). By means of in situ hybridizations with an LNA-containing probe complementary to the mature sequence of this miRNA in human and macaque prefrontal cortex sections (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>), we found that miR-320b preferentially co-localized with neurons in both species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These results are consistent with the proposed regulatory relationship between this miRNA and its neuron-related target genes.</p>

        <title>Constitutive and Developmental Pattern Divergence Exhibit Distinct Characteristics</title>
        <p>Our analysis marks constitutive divergence (represented by type I and II genes) as the most dominant form of expression difference among species. In the primate brain, 85%–90% of genes showing significant expression divergence between humans and chimpanzees fall within this category. Expanding our analysis to a published brain transcriptome time series from two mouse species (<italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>Mus spretus</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Somel1">[8]</xref>, 99% of genes with significant expression divergence can be classified as showing constitutive expression divergence.</p>
        <p>Constitutive expression divergence affects the two brain regions analyzed in a similar manner. Genes showing constitutive divergence tend to have high expression breadth, show no association with tissue-specific functions, and their regulatory sequences evolve as fast as, or faster than, those of other genes. Notably, humans and chimpanzees show approximately equal levels of constitutive divergence in both brain regions studied. Thus, while some constitutive expression differences may underlie adaptive changes in primate brain evolution, the majority could represent transcriptomic drift <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Khaitovich1">[28]</xref>, driven by mutations in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, and affecting multiple tissues. This result supports a previously proposed transcriptome evolution model, in which a large portion of expression divergence among species is shaped by <italic>cis</italic>-changes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Wittkopp2">[29]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Developmental pattern divergence (type III genes), as identified in this study, shows a very different evolutionary mode. First, this is the least frequent divergence type, with less than 15% of genes differentially expressed between human, chimpanzee, and macaque brains showing developmental pattern differences. This might be expected given the general conservation of developmental expression trajectories among primates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s002">Figure S2</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Somel1">[8]</xref>. Second, developmental pattern divergence differs substantially between the two brain regions analyzed, PFC and CBC. Third, developmental pattern differences found in the PFC are associated with neurons and neuronal functions. Fourth, in contrast to type I and II genes, type III genes have highly conserved regulatory and coding sequences. Furthermore, human-specific developmental pattern divergence in PFC shows negative correlation with <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory changes. This is striking, given that evolutionary expression divergence, including both quantitative and developmental pattern differences, is generally positively associated with regulatory and/or coding divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Wittkopp1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Wittkopp2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Kalinka1">[32]</xref>. These results support a scenario, where tissue-specific changes in the expression of <italic>trans</italic>-regulators, such as miRNA, rather than sequence changes in <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, are the driving force underlying developmental remodeling across hundreds of genes.</p>

        <title>A Role for miRNAs in Shaping Developmental Divergence among Species</title>
        <p>While divergence in transcription factor expression and activity has been shown to underlie evolutionary divergence in various contexts (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Frankel1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Reed1">[34]</xref>), relatively little is known about the role of miRNA in transcriptome evolution. It is, therefore, of note that the strongest <italic>trans</italic>-regulatory signal associated with developmental pattern divergence in the primate brain could be associated with miRNAs rather than with TFs. The regulatory effects of the top three miRNAs identified by computational predictions could be further supported by cell line transfections and in situ hybridization experiments. Our analysis further implicates two of these miRNAs in the regulation of genes involved in the calcium signaling pathway in neurons. Given the role played by calcium signaling in neuronal plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Polleux1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Wayman1">[27]</xref>, this result raises the possibility that the observed human-specific developmental expression patterns in the PFC could underlie human-specific cognitive functions such as learning and memory. It would be interesting to test miR-454 and miR-92a as potential regulators of neurodevelopmental plasticity in vivo.</p>
        <p>Another noteworthy aspect of the miRNA experimental results is the spatial expression patterns identified by in situ hybridization. These indicate substantial variation among neurons in the miRNAs' expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g006">Figure 6</xref>), raising the possibility that the identified miRNAs are specific to different neuron subpopulations. Differential miRNA activity among species may thus contribute to brain organization differences, which have been suggested as a major distinction between human and chimpanzee brains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Semendeferi1">[35]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Meanwhile, our work has a number of limitations. First, as our main analysis is based on human microarrays, we exclude any probes that do not match each of the three species' genomes perfectly and uniquely (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Thus, we ignore regions that show copy number variation among species, or are species-specific. Likewise, our analysis is restricted to regulators conserved across the three species. This is important, because fast evolving or human-specific genes, TFs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Nowick1">[36]</xref>, or miRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Berezikov1">[37]</xref> may have significant contributions to the evolution of primate brain development and species divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Zhang1">[38]</xref>. Second, when analyzing the effects of <italic>cis</italic>-regulation on expression divergence, we are constrained by the limited annotation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory regions, and it is conceivable that mutations in a yet unidentified class of neural enhancers drive a substantial portion of developmental pattern divergence in humans. Third, our study is restricted to species differences in postnatal development. This is a critical period in brain ontogeny, when multiple processes, including synaptic maturation and myelination, take place <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-deGraafPeters1">[39]</xref>. Accordingly, expression differences in this period can readily generate phenotypic differences between species. Meanwhile, human-specific expression changes in <italic>earlier</italic> developmental stages could have at least as strong effects on the brain phenotype <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Johnson1">[40]</xref>. The evolution of fetal brain gene expression remains to be studied.</p>
        <p>Despite these limitations, our results extend earlier observations on accelerated evolution of gene expression in the human brain. Specifically, we show that compared with chimpanzees and macaques, humans exhibit extreme developmental remodeling in the PFC and, to a lesser extent, in the CBC. Accelerated divergence of human developmental patterns cannot be explained by neutral drift, and cannot be attributed to life-history differences among species. Mechanistically, these human-specific changes appear driven by changes in expression of <italic>trans</italic>-acting regulators, and specifically miRNA, rather than accumulation of <italic>cis</italic>-regulatory mutations. Assuming a link between gene expression pattern divergence and phenotypic changes in the human brain, these results suggest that our cognitive abilities might be traced to a handful of key regulatory changes that remodeled cortical development.</p>

        <p>For detailed descriptions of the tests applied, justifications of statistics, and detailed results, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s019">Text S1</xref>. We used polynomial regression to model expression changes with age (age-test) and analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to model species differences (differential expression test). In both tests, we fit data to families of models including linear, quadratic, and/or cubic terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Somel1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Faraway1">[43]</xref>. The <italic>F</italic> test was used to assess significance. We used a log<sub>2</sub>-age scale to model expression changes with age. When indicated, we also used ages transformed using linear models of life-history landmarks in order to normalize life-history differences among species. For identifying developmental pattern divergence among species, we used the ANCOVA test on datasets where mean (constitutive) expression differences among species had been subtracted, such that the only remaining difference was differences in trajectory shapes. False discovery rates were estimated by permuting individuals' age or species identity. Confidence ranges for the median ratio reported in the text indicate 95% bootstrap confidence intervals. In the RNA-sequencing experiment, genes were binary coded to show higher divergence in human or chimpanzee lineages; we therefore used the binomial test to compare distributions between gene sets. We used the Wilcoxon signed rank test for comparing log<sub>2</sub>-transformed human-to-chimpanzee branch length ratio distributions between the two gene sets, testing for a median &gt;0 in the distribution. For testing enrichment of a gene set in functional categories or among targets of regulators, we used the hypergeometric test. In functional analyses the <italic>p</italic> values were corrected using the Bonferroni method. We used Spearman rank correlation for comparing sequence and expression divergence estimates. For identifying candidate miRNAs regulating specific gene expression patterns, we used the approach described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Somel2">[44]</xref>. Briefly, we first test an association between targets of each miRNA and a gene set showing a particular gene expression pattern, using the hypergeometric test.

The frequencies were compared using the binomial test. The negative correlations were calculated by (a) using interpolated points from spline curves fit to the miRNA and mRNA expression profiles, using all three species together, and (b) calculating differences between species' curves at interpolated points, for miRNA and mRNA, using all three pairs of differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s019">Text S1</xref>).

        <p>To estimate expression divergence, we first reduced the influence of individual variation within a species by fitting expression trajectories to each species' data points, for each gene independently. We next calculated Euclidean distances among these trajectories and constructed neighbor joining trees based on these distances (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s019">Text S1</xref>). Finally, expression divergence on each lineage was estimated as the length of the corresponding neighbor joining tree branch. Importantly, for type III genes we removed average expression level differences among species from the expression divergence calculation.

        <title>Sequence Divergence Estimates</title>
        <p>For estimating pan-mammalian regulatory site conservation, we used the mean Phastcons 18-way Placental Mammal Conservation Track <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Siepel1">[46]</xref> values. Mean scores were calculated for (a) proximal promoters and (b) 3′UTRs based on Ensembl (v54) annotation; (c) proximal promoters defined by H3K4me3 marks in a human PFC age-series ChIP-Seq experiment, combining all 14 samples together and choosing peaks with posterior possibility ≥0.95 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Cheung1">[19]</xref>; (d) putative enhancer sites based on the presence of H3K4me1 “broad” peaks, presence of DNAseI hypersensitive sites, and the absence of H3K4me3 “broad” peaks (which is a promoter mark) identified in the Encode project, in an epithelial cell line (Hmec) (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/encodeDCC/" xlink:type="simple">http://hgdownload.cse.ucsc.edu/goldenPath/hg18/encodeDCC/</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-ENCODE1">[18]</xref> and assigned to nearest human Ensembl gene within 100 kb; (e) putative enhancer sites defined similar to (d) but showing peaks in a minimum of three cell lines among the seven main cell lines used in the Encode project; and (f) putative enhancer sites bound by the transcriptional activator CBP in a mouse brain ChIP-Seq experiment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001214-Kim1">[20]</xref>. For estimating species-specific mutations for each of these regions, we extracted the corresponding regions from the human (hg18) genome, projected these onto chimpanzee (panTro2) and rhesus macaque (rheMac2) genomes using “Liftover,” and aligned the corresponding sequences with MUSCLE (v3.7, <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.drive5.com/muscle" xlink:type="simple">http://www.drive5.com/muscle</ext-link>). As inflated mutation estimates can arise due to homology or genome alignment problems, we removed the 5% upper fraction of mutation estimates. In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>, the variables (divergence or cell type specificity) were scaled by subtracting the average value across all expressed genes in the tissue, to represent deviation from the transcriptome average. To improve visualization within the same barplot, each variable was also further rescaled by multiplying with a constant.</p>

Cells were incubated in DMEM (Hyclone) + 10% FBS (Hyclone) medium and transfected using the Lipofectamine 2000 (Invitrogen) standard protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s019">Text S1</xref>). Twenty-four hours after transfection, cells were washed twice with PBS and RNA was isolated using Trizol (Invitrogen). Total RNA was labeled and hybridized to Affymetrix HG U133Plus2.0 arrays following standard protocols. Microarray expression data were processed as described above for other datasets. Expression levels for the negative control-transfected cell lines were subtracted from the expression of miRNA-transfected cell line, for each miRNA and cell line type separately, yielding a measure of miRNA effect size. For <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001214-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, we calculated the mean effect size per gene per miRNA across the two cell lines. Treating each cell line separately, as well as together, gave us significant results, and targets verified in each cell line (i.e. TargetScan targets that show inhibition upon transfection) also showed significant overlap (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>

          <p>Micro RNAs with target enrichment among PFC type III genes. Micro RNAs showing predicted target enrichment among PFC type III genes, compared to the other divergent gene types (the background). In total 596 miRNAs in the TargetScan table were tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001214.s019">Text S1</xref>) and only those passing the <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 cutoff are shown. “Test” and “Other” indicate the number of genes in a functional category belonging to the tested gene set or the background, respectively. HT, one-sided hypergeometric test; FDR, false discovery rate estimated from 1,000 permutations, indicating the average number of genes expected to appear significant at a <italic>p</italic> value cutoff by chance.</p>

          <p>Candidate miRNA regulators of PFC developmental remodeling. Micro RNAs and their targets predicted by (i) enrichment of a miRNA targets among PFC type III genes, compared to other divergent gene types (HT <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05), (ii) excess of negative correlations between the miRNA's expression profile and its type III targets' expression profiles, compared to negative correlations (<italic>r</italic>&lt;−0.75) between miRNAs that are not enriched among type III genes and their type III targets (one-sided binomial test <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). We used two kinds of correlation, one based on raw expression profiles, and the other based on expression differences between pairs of species.

HT, one-sided hypergeometric test. Verified targets are defined using TargetScan, negative correlations in the time series, and inhibition by miRNA-transfection in cell lines. miR_320b targets do not show significant enrichment. Only miR-454 targets show significant enrichment using GO annotation (unpublished data). “Union” indicates the union of verified targets for the miR-320b, miR-454, and miR-92a.</p>
