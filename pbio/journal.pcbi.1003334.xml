<abstract>
<p>Experimental visceral leishmaniasis, caused by infection of mice with the protozoan parasite <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic>, is characterized by focal accumulation of inflammatory cells in the liver, forming discrete “granulomas” within which the parasite is eventually eliminated. To shed new light on fundamental aspects of granuloma formation and function, we have developed an <italic>in silico</italic> Petri net model that simulates hepatic granuloma development throughout the course of infection. The model was extensively validated by comparison with data derived from experimental studies in mice, and the model robustness was assessed by a sensitivity analysis. The model recapitulated the progression of disease as seen during experimental infection and also faithfully predicted many of the changes in cellular composition seen within granulomas over time. By conducting <italic>in silico</italic> experiments, we have identified a previously unappreciated level of inter-granuloma diversity in terms of the development of anti-leishmanial activity. Furthermore, by simulating the impact of IL-10 gene deficiency in a variety of lymphocyte and myeloid cell populations, our data suggest a dominant local regulatory role for IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells at the core of the granuloma.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Granulomatous inflammation is a common feature of chronic infectious and non-infectious disease. In the parasitic disease visceral leishmaniasis, the formation of granulomas in the liver is a hallmark of effective cellular immunity and host resistance to infection. Conventional experimental models, however, have inherent limitations in their capacity to assess the dynamics of this complex inflammatory response and in their ability to discriminate the local contribution of different immune cells and mediators to the outcome of infection. To overcome these limitations and to provide a future platform for evaluating how novel drugs might be used to improve host resistance, we have developed a computational model of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> granuloma. Using this model, we show that conventional measures of parasite load potentially mask an underlying heterogeneity in the ability of individual granulomas to control parasite number. In addition, we have used our model to provide novel insights into the relative importance of IL-10 production by different immune cells found within the granuloma microenvironment. Our model thus provides a complementary tool to increase understanding of granulomatous inflammation in this and other important human diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Human visceral leishmaniasis (HVL or Kala azar) is the most severe form of the tropical disease leishmaniasis, and is caused by infection with the protozoan parasites <italic>Leishmania donovani</italic> or <italic>L. infantum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Desjeux1">[1]</xref>. HVL is a systemic disease, with the intracellular (amastigote) stage of the parasite found predominantly, but not exclusively, in mononuclear phagocytes of the spleen, bone marrow and liver of infected individuals. In the absence of treatment, HVL is usually fatal, with ∼40,000 deaths reported annually <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Alvar1">[2]</xref>. However, an estimated 90% of infections do not result in clinical disease. Evidence from epidemiological studies of HIV- <italic>Leishmania</italic> co- infection and from experimental studies indicate an important role for cellular immune mechanisms in controlling sub-clinical infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Kaye1">[3]</xref>. Evidence from studies in humans, from murine models of experimental visceral leishmaniasis (EVL) and from the study of canine visceral leishmaniasis (CVL) all point to an important role for T cell-derived cytokines in maintaining the balance of immunity during subclinical disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Kaye2">[4]</xref>. Furthermore, in each of these settings, there is evidence to suggest that granulomatous inflammation provides a histopathologic correlate of protective immunity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murray1">[5]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Sanchez1">[7]</xref>.</p>
<p>The granuloma represents one of the defining tissue responses associated with chronic inflammation following a variety of microbial (e.g. <italic>Schistosoma</italic>, <italic>Mycobacterium</italic>, <italic>Leishmania</italic>) and non-infectious (e.g. autoimmune, prosthetics) insults. Although generally characterized by the focal accumulation of monocytes and T cells, recent data have indicated that a broad range of leucocytes can be found within these specialized microenvironments, including B cells, NK cells, NKT cells, T cells and dendritic cells. In addition, in some but not all cases, granulomas may progress to caseation, most commonly in tuberculosis, whereby neutrophils are seen in high abundance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Brighenti1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Moore1">[12]</xref>. In EVL, granuloma formation has been shown to be dependent upon multiple cytokines, with the elimination of intracellular <italic>Leishmania</italic> governed by the balance of cytokines that are able to activate (e.g. IFNγ) or deactivate (e.g. IL-10) local macrophage anti-leishmanial activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Kaye2">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murray1">[5]</xref>. However, the relative functional contribution of different cell types producing similar cytokines, and whether these cells/cytokines exert their effects locally or indirectly (e.g. through upstream regulatory pathways operating outside the granuloma environment) remain as important but unanswered questions.</p>
<p>IL-10 is the best studied of the cytokines that have an inhibitory effect on macrophage leishmanicidal activity and serum IL-10 represents a biomarker of disease severity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Verma1">[13]</xref>. The current literature suggests multiple pathways in which IL-10 may operate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Duell1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Saraiva1">[15]</xref>. For example, expression of <italic>Nos2</italic> in macrophages, a key event in the generation of the leishmanicidal effector molecule nitric oxide, is directly inhibited by IL-10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Gazzinelli1">[16]</xref>. Such inhibition may occur through autocrine signaling, with IL-10 being produced by macrophages after direct recognition of parasites or following immune complex binding to macrophage Fc receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Kane1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Lucas1">[18]</xref>. Alternatively, IL-10 may indirectly regulate effector T cell differentiation and/or activation, e.g. by influencing the ability of macrophages and/or dendritic cells to stimulate T cell IFNγ production <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Fiorentino1">[19]</xref>. IL-10-producing DCs have been described in chronic EVL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Owens1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Svensson1">[21]</xref> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells which produce IL-10 (including natural Tregs, Tr-1 and CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells) have all been described in various forms of leishmaniasis in mouse and man <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Owens1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Anderson1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Stager1">[28]</xref>. Given the potentially tissue damaging effects of uncontrolled inflammation, multiple cell populations within the granuloma may also develop self-regulating capacity, again with IL-10 as a component of this response. Thus, CD4<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells and NK cells, which produce cytokines directing classical macrophage activation in the early stages of EVL, develop an IL-10-dependent immunoregulatory function as disease progresses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Stager1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Maroof1">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>What has remained a considerable experimental challenge, however, has been to determine which of these cellular sources of IL-10 is functionally most potent in the local tissue microenvironment, which cells respond to the IL-10 signals and how this dynamic balance of immune effector and regulatory function evolves throughout the course of infection. In HVL, the invasive nature of the methods needed to address these questions is beyond what is practically or ethically achievable, and even in EVL, current methodology is still wanting. Nevertheless, there is an imperative to more fully understand these and related issues, if the information derived from past and future studies are to be effectively translated into new therapeutic approaches around this and other cytokines <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-OGarra1">[30]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>In silico</italic> models do not share the same experimental limits of <italic>in vivo</italic> models and allow more direct control on multiple experimental conditions. Computational and mathematical models of the cellular response to granulomatous infection have been developed previously in the context of tuberculosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Chakravarty1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Ray2">[35]</xref>, sarcoidosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Aguda1">[36]</xref> and leishmaniasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Flugge1">[37]</xref>, but they generally account only for a limited number of leukocyte populations. For example, a recent study used a coloured Petri net approach to model the innate macrophage granuloma that forms during infection of zebrafish with <italic>Mycobacterium</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Carvalho1">[38]</xref>. Here, we describe a stochastic Petri net model of granulomatous inflammation in the liver of mice infected with <italic>L. donovani</italic>, which faithfully reproduces many of the characteristics of experimental infection. Petri nets provide a visual-aided network-oriented modeling process, which simplifies their development and provides visual feedback affording interpretation by a broad audience. Moreover, the underlying mathematical structure of the model can be used to perform a structural validation, which is independent from the actual simulations. This validation assesses different properties of the model and can be used to detect entities that do not interact as intended or actions that will never be performed. These advantages have made stochastic Petri nets popular for the development of systems biology models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Carvalho1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Koch1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>We have applied this methodology to gain a greater insight into the potential importance of macrophage deactivation in regulating the outcome of EVL, using this model to simulate the importance of macrophage deactivation mediated through IL-10. Our results indicate that local leishmanicidal activity is most strongly influenced through the action of IL-10 produced by infected Kupffer cells themselves rather than by infiltrating leucocytes. These results provide new insight into how effector mechanisms may be regulated within the granuloma, and a new tool to interpret how pharmacologic interventions may operate.</p>

<title>The essential features of granulomatous inflammation can be reproduced <italic>in silico</italic></title>
<p>Given the limited modeling work available in the context of EVL, we opted for a high-level population dynamics stochastic Petri net model that characterized many of the entities that are believed to be relevant for the progression of the disease. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g001"><bold>Figure 1</bold></xref> presents a schematic representation of the model dynamics, and more detailed nets are described in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s001">Figures S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s002">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s003">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s004">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s006">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s007">S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s034">Text S1</xref></bold>. The Petri net files are available for use in Snoopy (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s017">Model S1</xref></bold>) and as a SBML compliant .xml file (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s018">Model S2</xref></bold>). We chose to model granulomas as self-contained independently functioning units, i.e. without migration of cells or cytokine from one granuloma to another. Although we acknowledge that such events may occur, current experimental approaches in mice do not allow for these processes to be quantified. We defined a “baseline model” characterized by initial infection in resident Kupffer cells and a set of specific assumptions governing the behavior and inter-relationships between five cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12 and IFNγ), a variety of effector/regulatory CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cell populations, NK and NKT cells and inflammatory monocytes/DC. <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s035">Text S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s019">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s020">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s021">S3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s022">S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s023">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s024">S6</xref></bold> describes the name, value and role of the different parameters used.

Each cytokine was also associated with an ‘effectiveness’ parameter. This permits the same concentration of different cytokines to have different effects on cells, reflecting differences in specific activity, differences in sensitivity of signal transduction pathways and/or different numbers of receptors.</p>

<p>As expected from the central limit theorem <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Mood1">[41]</xref>, the variability in simulated cell number depends on the number of simulations. Therefore, we performed experiments varying the number of independent granulomas. Although the infected liver contains an estimated 500,000 granulomas (based on counting the number of granulomas per unit volume in 2-photon 3D tissue images; data not shown), computational analyses suggested that 50 granulomas for each simulation were sufficient to generate a simulated total tissue parasite burden similar to that observed <italic>in vivo</italic> both in terms of mean and standard deviation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g002"><bold>Figure 2A</bold></xref>). Past studies on granulomatous inflammation have modeled granulomas as self-sustained microenvironments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Ray1">[34]</xref>. While different rationales for this approach exist, no clear biological evidence to support this view is available. Our data indicate that sampling a small subset of independent granulomas is sufficient to characterize the entire tissue response during infection. Although the qualitative variation of parasite burden over time reported by multiple investigators is similar, the absolute parasite burden may vary for a number of factors (e.g. parasite strain, animal husbandry, mouse strain etc.). Therefore, although to validate our model we choose a set of reference data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murray2">[42]</xref>, we compared the qualitative characteristics of the data only, and not the absolute quantitative values obtained. While this approach introduces simplifications over the <italic>in vivo</italic> situation, our results indicate that it provides a simple and manageable way to study the phenomenon of parasite killing within granulomas at an organ level.</p>

<p>To validate our model, we first ran simulations in which key parameters of immune function were measured. Our baseline model produced data that displayed good agreement with the published experimental data, in terms of the number of granuloma CD4<sup>+</sup> and CD8<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g002"><bold>Figure 2B</bold></xref>); the number of NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g002"><bold>Figure 2D</bold></xref>); the percentage of activated CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells with differing functional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g002"><bold>Figure 2E</bold></xref>) and the frequency of activated NKT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g002"><bold>Figure 2F</bold></xref>). Nevertheless, the model did not predict all parameters of granuloma composition with strict accuracy. For example, there was a disparity in the absolute number of NKT cells within <italic>in silico</italic> granulomas compared to that observed in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g002"><bold>Figure 2C</bold></xref>). This disagreement is likely due to biological constraints absent from our model, and indicates the importance of additional experimental work. Nevertheless, statistical analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s036">Text S3</xref></bold> and <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s025">Tables S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s026">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s027">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s028">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s029">S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s030">S12</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s031">S13</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s032">S14</xref></bold>) supports the overall agreement between our simulations and experimental data points in the direction of robust modeling of the immune response.</p>

<title><italic>In silico</italic> modeling provides insight into the dynamics of leucocyte dynamics during infection</title>
<p>Since our <italic>in silico</italic> model allows a detailed characterization of the many biological entities involved in the immune response, we decided to explore their dynamics during infection. The number of non-resident phagocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3A</bold></xref>), CD4<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup> T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3B</bold></xref>), activated NK cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3C</bold></xref>), and activated NKT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3F</bold></xref>) closely follow the dynamics observed for parasite burden. The number of CD4<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>+</sup> T cells is very low when compared to CD4<sup>+</sup>IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>−</sup> T cells in the initial stages of infection, but their numbers become similar at later times (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), perhaps suggesting a connection between IL-10-producing Th1 cells and the low level persistence of infection. A striking difference in kinetics is evident when comparing the activation status of non-resident phagocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3D</bold></xref>) with resident Kupffer cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>). While in Kupffer cells the presence of parasites promotes a very high level of deactivation, non-resident phagocytes are strongly activated. This observation suggests that limiting the capacity of <italic>Leishmania</italic> to deactivate Kupffer cells could have a strong impact on the immune response. Moreover, while non-resident macrophages become strongly polarized, classical activation and deactivation coexists in Kupffer cells, resulting in a more dynamic and unstable equilibrium. Note that due to the very low rates of inflow and death, the number of Kupffer cells is effectively stable over time (data not shown).</p>

<p>Cytokines are effective only within a limited range. Unfortunately, accessing the concentration of cytokines in the granuloma microenvironment is experimentally beyond reach. Our data suggests that the concentration follows the parasite burden for all the modeled cytokines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3G–I</bold></xref>). Notably, IL-10 concentration is much lower than IFNγ concentration over most of the time course of the infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3G</bold></xref>).

<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>The various entities included in the model were extensively parameterized, where possible using data extracted directly from the literature or from our own unpublished results. However, other parameters result from modeling decisions and simplifications and were determined by fitting the data. We therefore performed a sensitivity analysis to assess the robustness of the model. Here, we briefly describe the main points elucidated by sensitivity analysis. However, a more extensive discussion is provided in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s037">Text S4</xref></bold>. Following established methodology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Saltelli1">[43]</xref>, we sampled the parameter space using Latin hypercube sampling and studied the impact of each parameter on the parasite burden using Partial Rank Correlation Coefficients (PRCC). The effect of parameter variation was assessed on the parasite burden at different stages of the infection. As observed above, parasite burden correlates with most of the modeled aspects of the immune response. Hence, using parasite burden maximizes the information derived from the sensitivity analysis. Wherever possible, parameters were varied according to known biological variability. Additionally, given the stochastic nature of the model, a dummy parameter with no effect on the parasite burden was also included in the analysis. This expedient allowed us to disentangle the impact of the intrinsic variability of the model from the variability due to parameter variation.</p>
<p>As shown in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s008">Figure S8</xref></bold>, varying model parameters has different impacts on parasite burden. This was to be expected given the differences in the number of leukocytes within and affecting the granuloma microenvironment. Varying the reproduction rate of the parasite, the effectiveness of IFNγ or the production of NKT-derived IFNγ resulted in a strongly varied parasite burden. However, varying the effectiveness of IL-2, the effectiveness of IL-10 and the chemokinetic effect of T cells did not significantly affect parasite burden. Sensitivity analysis confirmed the importance of many of the parameters believed to be the most important in determining the outcome of infection, again supporting the robustness of the model. However, less obvious results were also observed, and various parameters have remarkably different effects on parasite burden at different stages of the infection. (<bold>Figures S9, S10, S11, S12, S13, S14, S15, S16</bold>). This result stresses the complex dynamics that underlie the immune response during EVL and indicates how a cell with exactly the same behavior can potentially have very different degrees of biological significance at different stages of the infection.</p>

<title>Individual granulomas display distinct dynamic behavior</title>
<p>Experimental data on parasite burden in mice is measured on a total organ basis (obtained from impression smears, limiting dilution analysis or quantitative PCR), with no experimental approaches being available to evaluate parasite number over time within individual granulomas. In contrast, our <italic>in silico</italic> model allows us to examine whether there is heterogeneity in parasite burden over time between individual granulomas. We observed that even under the same initial conditions (each granuloma seeded with 4 amastigotes), the peak parasite burden per granuloma varied greatly amongst individual granulomas (i.e. each represented by a single run of the simulation). More importantly, the dynamics of parasite burden displayed a remarkable variability between individual granulomas. Rather simple behaviors (granuloma G1: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g004"><bold>Figure 4A</bold></xref>) coexisted with more complex ones (granuloma G2: <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g004"><bold>Figure 4B</bold></xref>). Notably, some granulomas (herein referred to as long-lasting) were characterized by an unexpected long-term equilibrium (granuloma G3; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g004"><bold>Figure 4C</bold></xref>), with alternating high and low levels of parasite burden. Surprisingly, granuloma G1, though most effective at clearing parasites and maintaining effective control over recrudescence had the highest peak primary parasite load. This diversity in the parasite load is accompanied by a similar variation in the number of non-resident phagocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g004"><bold>Figures 4D–F</bold></xref>) and activated NKT cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g004"><bold>Figures 4G–I</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>To gain further insights into possible contingencies that can drive the emergence of the different types of granulomas observed, we explored the dynamics of the resident and non-resident phagocytes, the relations between the different populations of Th1 cells and the concentration of cytokines. The levels of classical activation and deactivation of Kupffer cells were comparable in all three granulomas. However, it was notable that the most effective granuloma (G1) was able to reach a relatively high level of activation (∼20%) and this was sustained past week 4 with negligible late deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figure 5A</bold></xref>), whereas granulomas G2 and G3 took more time to reach maximal classical activation and the degree of classical KC activation fell more sharply after the primary peak of parasite load concomitant with a degree of deactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figures 5B and 5C</bold></xref>). The activation of non-resident macrophages follows a similar trend with a high level of activation reached in granuloma G1 by week 4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figure 5D</bold></xref>), while granulomas G2 and G3 again did not reach the same level of classical activation in response to the primary peak of parasite load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figures 5E and 5F</bold></xref>). The number of IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL-10<sup>−</sup> T cells was comparable in all 3 granulomas considered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figures 5G–H</bold></xref>). However, IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL10<sup>+</sup> T cells were practically absent in granuloma G1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figure 5G</bold></xref>), while these cells were present in moderately high numbers in granulomas G2 and G3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figures 5H and 5I</bold></xref>). These findings further support a role for IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL10<sup>+</sup> T cells in the persistence of infection. Nevertheless, IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL10<sup>+</sup> T cells appear quite late in G3, suggesting that they are not the only factor contributing to delayed clearance. Finally, the cytokine concentration is related to the number of Th1 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figures 5J–L</bold></xref>), supporting the importance of T cells in the control of the local environment.</p>

<p>From a biological perspective, our results provide the first demonstration that local immune control within granulomas may be variable, with important implications for how the effector response is regulated. In particular, these results suggest that the local environment within the granuloma shapes the effector response and that granulomas may behave as autonomous units of immune function. Conceptually, this model of autonomous units of immunity is supported by recent data that suggests local antigen-specific re-stimulation is required for T cell effector function <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Muller1">[44]</xref>. Additionally, our model suggests that a limited number of long-lasting granulomas, which would be difficult to detect with standard parasite counting techniques, may provide a reservoir for disease reactivation in murine models of T cell insufficiency <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murray3">[45]</xref> and this has implications for the immunological basis of long-term parasite persistence that warrant further exploration. Although we have not extensively investigated this point to date, the small sample of granulomas sampled suggests that those with highest initial peak parasite burden may actually be the most effective at controlling parasite load over the long term.</p>
<p>From a modeling perspective, the diversity of parasite loads seen in individual granulomas obtained in the simulations supports the power of stochastic models: the same Petri net is able to generate widely diverse parasite numbers in different granulomas over time. However, averaging these burdens leads to a quite characteristic (and mostly deterministic) “shape” for graphs of parasite burden determined at an organ level. The emergence of a definite trend from stochastic interactions is not a new theme, and is a founding principle of statistical thermodynamics. However, the emergence of multi-scale behaviors (stochastic for the microenvironment and deterministic at the organ level) indicates the importance of multi-level studies when trying to understand biological processes.</p>

<title>The impact of <italic>in silico</italic> immunodeficiency on the course of infection</title>
<p>Having established that our model recapitulated many of the features of infection seen in immunocompetent mice, we then went on to explore how well we could recapitulate the differing outcomes of infection as seen in cell or cytokine deficient mice. T cells are considered to be the main mediators of cellular immunity against <italic>Leishmania</italic> and not surprisingly, depletion of T cells in our <italic>in silico</italic> model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g006"><bold>Figure 6A</bold></xref>) led to high parasite burden and a non-healing course of infection, reflecting the course of infection in T cell-deficient mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murray1">[5]</xref>. The cytokine IFNγ is considered fundamental for the classical activation of macrophages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Mosser1">[46]</xref> and mice deficient in IFNγ are unable to mount an adequate immune response and are highly susceptible to EVL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murray1">[5]</xref>. Likewise in our model, inhibiting production of IFNγ from all cells capable of producing this cytokine lead to very high parasite burden and to a non-healing infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g006"><bold>Figure 6B</bold></xref>). In contrast to IFNγ, IL-10 has a negative impact on host resistance, with IL-10 KO mice or mice treated with anti-IL-10R having enhanced resistance to infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murphy1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Murray4">[48]</xref>. Our model also indicated an important role for IL-10 in regulating parasite burden, as blocking the production of IL-10 by all leukocytes resulted in a reduced peak parasite burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>), though to a slightly lesser extent compared to that reported in IL-10 KO mice. Overall, however, the model appeared to faithfully recapitulate many of the key features of EVL observed in various immunodeficient mouse models.</p>

<title>KC-derived IL-10 plays a dominant role in regulating granuloma effector function</title>
<p>In EVL, multiple cellular sources of IL-10 have been described, including IL-10-producing CD4<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Owens1">[20]</xref>, NK cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Maroof1">[29]</xref>, and inflammatory macrophages (monocytes and DCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Owens1">[20]</xref>).

On the basis that our model was able to demonstrate the effects of global IL-10 deficiency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>), we proceeded to conduct a series of predictive studies to identify which cell(s) produced IL-10 with most impact on the effector function of the granuloma (in essence generating a series of conditional cell-specific IL-10 gene deficiencies <italic>in silico</italic>). Our simulation results indicated that removing the capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup> IFNγ<sup>+</sup> Th1 cells, inflammatory monocytes/DC, and IFNγ<sup>+</sup> NK cells to make IL-10 all had perceivable but different impacts on parasite burden (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g007"><bold>Figure 7A</bold></xref>). Removing the capacity of CD4<sup>+</sup> IFNγ<sup>+</sup> Th1 and NK cells to produce IL-10 did not alter the peak parasite burden, but delayed final stages of parasite clearance. In contrast, removing the capacity of myeloid cells (including KCs and inflammatory DC/monocytes) to produce IL-10 had a much more significant impact on parasite burden evident by a reduction in peak tissue parasite load and a more rapid resolution of infection. Qualitatively, the effect of IL-10 depletion from myeloid cells alone was similar to that of global IL-10 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g006"><bold>Figure 6C</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>To further dissect the role of different myeloid cells and the relative contribution of autocrine IL-10 production by infected KC and IL-10 that was derived from inflammatory monocytes/DC, we selectively eliminated IL-10 production by each population. Our results clearly indicated that IL-10 production by KCs had a greater impact on parasite burden compared to IL-10 production by inflammatory monocytes/DC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g007"><bold>Figure 7B</bold></xref>). Indeed, our model predicts the outcome of KC IL-10 deficiency to be as effective in increasing host resistance as total ablation of IL-10 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g006"><bold>Figures 6C</bold></xref><bold> and </bold><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g007"><bold>7B</bold></xref>). Thus, while supporting a role for IFNγ<sup>+</sup>IL10<sup>+</sup> T cells and IL-10<sup>+</sup> NK cells in the regulation of immunity to <italic>L. donovani</italic>, our data suggests that IL-10 production by infected KCs themselves plays the most dominant role in regulating intra-granuloma effector function. This finding is clearly a consequence of the high level of deactivation observed in Kupffer cells at both global (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g003"><bold>Figure 3E</bold></xref>) and local scales (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003334-g005"><bold>Figures 5A–C</bold></xref>), which promotes IL-10 production by these cells.</p>

<title>Concluding remarks</title>
<p><italic>In silico</italic> models are increasingly important tools to elucidate complex biological phenomena. However, selecting the adequate level of abstraction and controlling its complexity can be daunting tasks when studying the diverse biological mechanisms used by the vertebrate immune system. Care is needed in building <italic>in silico</italic> models with clear working hypotheses and extensive validation. In comparison to other <italic>in silico</italic> models of granuloma formation, our model provides a systematic view of the course of infection, without sacrificing the complexity and diversity of the immune response. Our model of course contains a number of explicit simplifications and assumptions, and whilst based on the literature, many of these may be open to alternate interpretation or indeed not operate as hard rules. However, an extensive list of the working hypotheses and an assessment of the effect of the different model parameters by sensitivity analysis (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s037">Text S4</xref></bold>) provides further insight into the working of the model and its robustness. In contrast, a disadvantage of our systemic view is that unlike agent based models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Alden1">[51]</xref>, Petri net models are not able to elucidate the role played by physical interactions among leucocytes within a spatially defined environment. Additionally, in comparison to simpler deterministic models, our analyses are performed only by means of simulations, thus limiting the exploration of the parameter space.</p>
<p>Notwithstanding these limitations, our current model captures many experimentally determined features of the <italic>Leishmania</italic> granuloma and has provided a number of unique and important insights into the aspects of granuloma function that are currently intractable in vivo. First, our observation that individual granulomas display distinct patterns of effector function over time suggests a novel means for the maintenance of persistent parasites in tissues and has implications for understanding parasite recrudescence. Second, the prediction from our model that autocrine IL-10 production by KCs is a major regulator of leishmanicidal activity within granulomas was unexpected, given the recent attention focused on the production of this cytokine by T cells and NK cells, including from our own work. Importantly, it should be noted that our model only simulates events within the granuloma that lead to the control of parasite load and hence does not take into account the possible regulatory effects of IL-10 outside this environment. For example, our model would not capture possible effects of IL-10 on T cell differentiation occurring in other tissues, but which might affect the quality and/or quantity of T cells that enter into the granuloma microenvironment.</p>
<p>Our model also adds to a growing body of modeling literature on macrophage activation. Macrophages have the capacity to assume different states of functional ‘activation’ dependent in part upon the cytokine environment to which they are exposed (variously defined as M1 and M2 or as classical and alternate activation, respectively) with profound implications for the control of intracellular pathogens and the regulation of inflammation (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Cohen1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Tugal1">[53]</xref>). The interplay between classical and alternate activation has been previously modeled in the context of tuberculosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Marino1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Day1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Cilfone1">[55]</xref>. Alternatively activated macrophages (driven by IL-4) are limiting in our model, whereas de-activation resulting from non-cytokine as well as cytokine mediated mechanisms acts as the principal counter balance to classical activation. Nevertheless, taken together these studies are providing novel insights into how macrophage effector function is regulated in a dynamic way over the course of infection and illustrate how changes in the balance of activation phenotypes at the local site can shape the outcome of infection. It remains to be determined whether such information can be harnessed to develop useful and clinically relevant prognostic indicators of disease outcome.</p>
<p>In conclusion, this novel stochastic Petri net model of granuloma formation provides a new tool to complement other approaches to understand the biology of granulomatous inflammation and the determinants of host resistance to <italic>L. donovani</italic>. Whilst our <italic>in silico</italic> studies indicate the potential for enhancing local immunity through disabling IL-10 production in a cell-specific manner, final validation of the predictions made by this model will require the future development of novel KC-specific IL-10 deficient mice.</p>

The following entities were considered by the model: Cytokines (IL-2, IL-4, IL-10, IL-12, and IFNγ), mononuclear phagocytes (Kupffer Cells, non-resident macrophages/monocytes/DC), <italic>L. donovani</italic>-derived peptides associating with MHC and non-classical MHC molecules, NK cells, NKT cells, and CD8<sup>+</sup> and CD4<sup>+</sup> T cells. A detailed description of the dynamics of the above entities is provided in <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s035">Text S2</xref></bold>.</p>

<title>Statistical analysis</title>
<p>Statistical analysis was performed on the mean using Student's t-test with Welch's correction for the degrees of freedom. P-value was calculated for equality test (see <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003334.s036">Text S3</xref></bold> for further details).</p>

<title>Sensitivity analysis</title>
<p>Both Latin hypercube sampling and partial rank correlation coefficients are widely used techniques. A formal presentation of these techniques can be found in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003334-Saltelli1">[43]</xref>. Briefly, PRCC characterizes the strength of the linear relationship between two variables after a correction has been made for the linear effects of the other variables considered by the analysis. Additionally, p-value indicates the probability of getting a correlation as large as the observed value by random chance, when the true correlation is zero. P-values lower than 0.05 (or 0.01) were considered indicative of statistical significance.
