<abstract>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, cortical pyramidal cells are bombarded by asynchronous synaptic input arising from ongoing network activity. However, little is known about how such ‘background’ synaptic input interacts with nonlinear dendritic mechanisms. We have modified an existing model of a layer 5 (L5) pyramidal cell to explore how dendritic integration in the apical dendritic tuft could be altered by the levels of network activity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>. Here we show that asynchronous background excitatory input increases neuronal gain and extends both temporal and spatial integration of stimulus-evoked synaptic input onto the dendritic tuft. Addition of fast and slow inhibitory synaptic conductances, with properties similar to those from dendritic targeting interneurons, that provided a ‘balanced’ background configuration, partially counteracted these effects, suggesting that inhibition can tune spatio-temporal integration in the tuft. Excitatory background input lowered the threshold for NMDA receptor-mediated dendritic spikes, extended their duration and increased the probability of additional regenerative events occurring in neighbouring branches. These effects were also observed in a passive model where all the non-synaptic voltage-gated conductances were removed. Our results show that glutamate-bound NMDA receptors arising from ongoing network activity can provide a powerful spatially distributed nonlinear dendritic conductance. This may enable L5 pyramidal cells to change their integrative properties as a function of local network activity, potentially allowing both clustered and spatially distributed synaptic inputs to be integrated over extended timescales.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In the brains of awake animals, networks are active even when there is no input from the outside world. Neurons embedded within cortical networks experience this intrinsic ongoing firing as ‘background’ synaptic input. While the effect of this background input on the integration properties of neurons has been studied in the cell body region, little is known about how asynchronous background activity affects integration in distal dendrites, which contain nonlinear mechanisms that boost and dampen synaptic input. Our simulations, using a model of a cortical L5 pyramidal cell, show that the nonlinear NMDA receptor conductance activated by distributed background activity could increase the gain of the dendrite, enabling synaptic inputs to be integrated more effectively over the dendritic tree and over longer time intervals than previously thought possible. This mechanism could potentially enable the integrative properties of individual neurons to change as a function of the activity of the network in which they are embedded. Our work suggests that background network activity could play a key role routing and transforming information as it flows through the cortex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Pyramidal cells are the principal excitatory neurons in the cerebral cortex and those in layer 5 (L5) form its primary output <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Douglas1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Somogyi1">[3]</xref>.

A substantial fraction of the long range thalamic and cortico-cortical inputs form synapses onto the highly branched apical tuft in L1 and L2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Cauller1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-RubioGarrido1">[7]</xref>, which is electrically remote from the soma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Williams1">[8]</xref>. The tuft therefore receives many different types of signals including information on different sensory modalities, motor control and emotional state <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Kampa1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Letzkus1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Xu1">[10]</xref>. These inputs are likely to span a wide range of temporal scales, ranging from precisely timed millisecond bursts to more sustained rate-coded signals. This raises the question as to how an individual tufted L5 pyramidal cell combines and transforms such temporally and spatially diverse signals.</p>
<p><italic>In vivo</italic>, cortical neurons are constantly bombarded with synaptic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Anderson1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Waters1">[13]</xref>. This ‘background’ synaptic input reflects both the intrinsic network activity of the thalamocortical system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Tsodyks1">[14]</xref> and extrinsic drive. Background input in cortex typically consists of both excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input in an approximately balanced configuration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Shadlen1">[18]</xref>.

However, little is known about how background synaptic input affects nonlinear dendritic mechanisms in fine dendrites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Silver1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p><italic>In vitro</italic> studies show that voltage-dependent synaptic NMDA receptors (NMDARs) can sustain local regenerative responses called NMDAR spikes in the fine dendrites of pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Major1">[33]</xref>. Such dendritic thresholding units could substantially increase the computational power of the neuron by enabling the dendritic tree to act like a feed-forward neural network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Major1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Poirazi1">[34]</xref>. Dendritic recordings and two-photon uncaging experiments in acute slices indicate that activation of NMDAR spikes requires input from a substantial number of clustered synapses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Nevian1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref> and that activation of multiple branches are required to trigger a Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike in the apical dendrite <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum2">[37]</xref>, which couples the electrically remote tuft to the axon initial segment, where action potentials (APs) are generated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Stuart1">[38]</xref>. On the other hand, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments show that synaptic input evoked by sensory stimuli are dispersed over the dendritic tree of pyramidal cells in visual <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Jia1">[39]</xref> and barrel cortices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Chen1">[40]</xref> as well as spontaneous synaptic input in L5 neurons of motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Hill1">[41]</xref>, casting doubt on whether such highly correlated spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic input occur naturally in cortex, although they have been reported in hippocampus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Takahashi1">[42]</xref>. Moreover, NMDAR spikes are also sensitive to inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Murayama1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Rhodes1">[44]</xref> and are therefore likely to be less robust <italic>in vivo</italic>, where inhibition is stronger <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Haider1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-BorgGraham1">[17]</xref>, than under <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions where inhibition is often reduced or absent. Nevertheless, NMDAR spikes have been reported in L4 spiny stellate neurons of barrel cortex following whisker stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Lavzin1">[45]</xref> and in L2/3 pyramidal cells in somatosensory cortex during hind-limb stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Palmer1">[46]</xref>. Moreover, dendritic patch-clamp recordings from L2/3 pyramidal cells in primary visual cortex suggest that NMDAR spikes contribute to orientation selectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Smith1">[47]</xref>. Large and widespread Ca<sup>2+</sup> transients have been recorded in the tufts of L5 pyramidal cells when sensory input occurs during motor activity, but evidence suggests that Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes rather than NMDAR spikes were responsible <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Xu1">[10]</xref>. Indeed, inhibition of dendritic targeting somatostatin expressing (SOM) interneurons, which have been shown to transiently reduce inhibitory tone in the dendrites of L2/3 cells during active behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>, could underlie the increase in gain of the tuft region of L5 pyramidal cells. These findings show that NMDAR spikes occur in a range of different cortical neurons <italic>in vivo</italic>, but it is unclear to what extent nonlinear NMDAR conductances contribute to synaptic integration in L5 pyramidal cells and what spatio-temporal patterns these cells respond to <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>We have investigated the potential impact of <italic>in vivo</italic>-like background network activity on synaptic integration in L5 cortical pyramidal cells using a morphologically and biophysically detailed model that reproduces a wide range of experimentally measured synaptic, dendritic and somatic behaviours <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>. Our simulations show that asynchronous background synaptic input onto the apical dendrites at rates observed <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-DeKock1">[50]</xref> can profoundly alter the integrative properties of L5 pyramidal cells. Our results suggest that, by activating nonlinear NMDAR conductances distributed over the dendritic tuft, background excitatory input enables pyramidal cells to integrate spatio-temporally distributed patterns of synaptic input in L1 and L2/3 and that the level of background inhibition could tune the spatio-temporal integration window.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To investigate how background network activity influences synaptic integration in tufted L5 cortical pyramidal cells, we adapted an existing model consisting of a detailed morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>) and 9 membrane conductances (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref> <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s011">Text S1</xref>. Supporting Information</bold>). Groups of synaptic inputs were generated with the software neuroConstruct <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gleeson1">[51]</xref> to mimic stimulus-evoked L1/2 input (i.e. cortico-cortico or thalamo-cortical sensory, motor or emotional) and ongoing background network activity onto the apical dendritic tree. Excitatory synaptic inputs were simulated with random Poisson trains of postsynaptic conductances, consisting of a linear AMPA receptor (AMPAR) component and a voltage-dependent NMDAR component, with peak amplitudes and kinetics that matched experimentally measured quantal excitatory postsynaptic current (EPSC) waveforms and the AMPAR/NMDAR ratio in these cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Kumar1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Myme1">[54]</xref>. Single quantal conductances were used because the ∼5 synaptic contacts that typically make up a unitary synaptic connection between two cortical pyramidal cells are usually distributed over different dendritic branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Markram1">[53]</xref>. We first compared integration of excitatory synaptic input in the tuft under quiescent conditions and during modest levels of background excitatory synaptic input, to enable comparison to <italic>in vitro</italic> experimental results. However, to understand the role of background input under more physiological conditions, we then examined the properties of pyramidal cell integration when background excitation and inhibition were balanced, as observed <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Number of synapses required to trigger NMDAR spikes in distal dendritic branches</title>
<p>We examined how many synapses onto an individual terminal dendritic branch in the apical tuft were required to trigger a regenerative NMDAR event in the absence of background synaptic input. This condition roughly approximates the <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions used to study synaptic integration with glutamate uncaging, where background activity is reduced due to long range inputs being severed in acute slices and inhibition is blocked by MNI-glutamate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Fino1">[55]</xref>. Since the most likely location for NMDAR spike generation is in the high impendence terminal branches of the tuft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco2">[56]</xref>, we focused on these dendritic compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1B</bold></xref>). To stimulate a particular branch, synapses were randomly distributed along the branch and near-coincident stimulus-evoked synaptic input was mimicked by driving each synapse with a 200 Hz random train for 5 ms. This resulted in each quantal synaptic input (subsequently referred to as ‘synapse’) firing once, on average. When few coincident synapses were stimulated, the EPSP in the stimulated distal branch was small and increased approximately linearly from the resting potential (−58 mV; similar to −57 mV measured in slices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref>) as the number of synapses increased. However, above 15 synapses, the duration of the EPSP increased dramatically and exhibited a flat top, hallmarks of a local regenerative NMDAR spike (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1C</bold></xref>). We identified the presence of NMDAR spikes in a dendritic branch using a −30 mV voltage threshold criterion (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s001">Fig. S1</xref></bold>). By stochastically varying the spatial and temporal patterns of synaptic input onto a dendritic branch, and measuring the occurrence of NMDAR spikes over 10 trials, it was possible to build an input-output (I-O) relationship for each individual branch. That is, the relationship between the number of stimulated synapses and the probability of generating an NMDAR spike (P(NMDAR spike)). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1D</bold></xref> shows the fits of a sigmoid function (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) to the I-O relationships for all 28 terminal branches in the model (mean length = 72±52 µm). Between 10 and 25 temporally coincident synapses were required to trigger an NMDAR spike with a probability of 0.5 in the terminal branches. On average 18 synapses were required and this increased to 30 coincident synaptic inputs to reliably trigger an NMDAR spike on every trial. These values are in good agreement with experimental estimates from dendritic recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Nevian1">[31]</xref> and glutamate uncaging experiments on L2/3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco1">[35]</xref> and L5 neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref> in acute slices and previous modelling studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Rhodes1">[44]</xref>. Given that the average number of spines per terminal branch is approximately 140, assuming a spine density of 2 µm<sup>−1</sup> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Braitenberg1">[57]</xref>, these simulations suggest that nearly coincident activation of a substantial fraction (13–20%) of the synapses on a terminal branch is required to activate a dendritic spike reliably, under quiescent conditions.</p>

<title>Background excitatory synaptic input reduces the threshold for NMDAR spikes</title>
<p>We next examined how asynchronous background excitatory synaptic input affected integration in the tuft. We did not include background inhibition in these initial simulations, in order to study the effects of background excitatory inputs in isolation. We estimated the rate of background excitatory synaptic input <italic>in vivo</italic> from both anatomical and functional measurements. Tufted L5 pyramidal cells are innervated by ∼15,000 excitatory synaptic contacts (assuming 1 per spine), of which 3500 occur on the apical trunk and dendritic tuft in layers 1–3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Braitenberg1">[57]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkman1">[58]</xref>. Since many of these contacts arise cortically from other L5 and L2/3 pyramidal cells, which typically fire at ∼1 Hz <italic>in vivo</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Margrie1">[49]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-DeKock1">[50]</xref>, a L5 pyramidal cell is expected to experience a background quantal synaptic input rate of ∼1750 Hz on its apical dendritic tree, assuming a release probability of ∼0.5 per synaptic contact <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Hardingham1">[59]</xref>. To mimic a modest level of background excitatory synaptic input, we randomly distributed 900–1500 quantal synaptic inputs over the apical tuft (including the Ca<sup>2+</sup> hot zone; Blue region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>) and drove each synapse with a different 0.85 Hz Poisson train, resulting in a background synaptic input rate of 765–1250 Hz. These modest levels of uncorrelated background excitatory input rarely triggered spontaneous NMDAR spikes (&lt;1% of trials, which were excluded from the analysis whenever possible), but did depolarize the dendritic membrane potential by 2–5 mV, within the range of experimental recordings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Smith1">[47]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1E, F</bold></xref>) and generated voltage noise at the soma with a standard deviation of 0.86–1.26 mV.</p>
<p>We next examined how the branch I-O relationship was affected by background excitatory synaptic input. These simulations revealed that many fewer coincident synaptic inputs were required to trigger an NMDAR spike than for quiescent control conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1G</bold></xref>). On average, the number of synapses required to trigger an NMDAR spike with 50% probability fell from 18 to 6 in the presence of 1500 background synapses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1H</bold></xref>). A lower threshold for NMDAR spike generation and an increased in slope (gain) of the branch I-O relationship was also observed with background input when the time window for synaptic input was increased from 5 to 15 ms and the input frequency scaled down to maintain ∼1 quantal conductance per synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1I</bold></xref>). These simulations show that NMDAR spikes can be triggered reliably in terminal branches by much smaller numbers of nearly-coincident synaptic inputs (i.e. activation of 4–7% of the total synapses) in the presence of modest levels of background excitatory synaptic input, than under quiescent conditions.</p>

<title>Background excitatory input decreases the number of stimulated branches required to trigger action potentials</title>
<p>To investigate whether background excitatory synaptic input also affects the spike output of the pyramidal cell model, we determined the number of stimulated branches required to trigger somatic APs. To do this we randomly selected a group of N branches within our set of 28 terminal branches in the tuft and simultaneously stimulated each branch with 30 near-synchronous synaptic inputs (5 ms window) to ensure a high probability of triggering an NMDAR spike in each branch under all conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1H</bold></xref>). We then systematically altered the number of stimulated branches and determined whether the neuron fired APs or not. This rather artificial synaptic input configuration was chosen to quantify the impact of excitatory background input when multiple branches were stimulated. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A</bold></xref> shows an example where stimulation of 4 apical branches produced only a subthreshold somatic potential during quiescent control conditions. Systematically increasing the number of stimulated branches, while averaging across many combinations of branches to minimize branch specific effects, revealed that in the absence of background input 11 near-synchronous stimulated NMDAR spikes were required to trigger APs with 50% probability, and 15 were required to trigger an AP reliably (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>By contrast, in the presence of background excitatory synaptic input, the relationship between the probability of triggering APs (P(AP)) and the number of stimulated dendritic branches exhibited a lower activation threshold and was much steeper (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g002"><bold>Fig. 2A, B</bold></xref>). Indeed, the number of stimulated branches required to trigger an AP with 50% reliability was reduced from 11 to &lt;4 for 1500 background excitatory synapses. The enhanced efficacy of NMDAR spikes was not dependent on the strong activation of individual branches, since reducing the number of synapses per stimulated branch from 30 to 15 still produced a leftward shift in the I-O relationship (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g002"><bold>Fig. 2B</bold></xref>, grey). Thus, even the modest level of background excitatory input used here substantially increased the efficacy of NMDAR spikes in triggering APs. These results suggest that, in the absence of inhibition, modest levels of background excitatory synaptic input arising from ongoing network activity could increase the probability of NMDAR spikes occurring in the dendritc tuft and increase AP generation.</p>

<title>Background excitatory input extends the temporal integration window in pyramidal cells</title>
<p>To examine how the L5 pyramidal cell model integrated inputs on longer time scales than the nearly coincident synaptic input examined so far, we desynchronized the stimulation of different dendritic branches located over the apical tuft. To do this we stimulated each branch with a near-synchronous (5 ms) burst of synaptic input, but activated different branches at random times within a time window that ranged from 5 ms to 200 ms and examined how desynchronization of branch activation affected the probability of triggering APs. In the absence of background excitatory input, 4 stimulated branches produced only a subthreshold response (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g003"><bold>Fig. 3A1</bold></xref>).

<title>Background excitatory synaptic input enables integration of spatially and temporally distributed excitatory synaptic input</title>

<title>Synaptic integration during balanced background excitatory and inhibitory synaptic input</title>
<p>So far we have examined how synaptic integration in the apical tuft of a L5 pyramidal cell model is altered by background excitatory synaptic input.

Moreover, distributed inhibition has been shown to be particularly effective in shunting excitation in branched structures such as the dendritic tuft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gidon1">[69]</xref>.</p>
<p>To examine how synaptic integration in L5 pyramidal cells might operate under more physiological conditions, when network activity delivers balanced excitatory and inhibitory background synaptic input, we added 60 SOM-like GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated synapses and 13 neurogliaform (NGF) cell-like mixed GABA<sub>A</sub>/GABA<sub>B</sub> synapses onto the apical dendritc tree. These inputs were driven at firing rates reported for passive touch whisker experiments in awake animals and are likely to reflect the upper end of the rates observed during active touch, which fall to about half this level on average <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>.

Although the inhibitory synapses were fewer in number than the excitatory synapses, their higher firing rate and slower kinetics effectively counterbalanced the AMPAR component of the 1500 excitatory synapses, producing a time averaged GABAR/AMPAR conductance ratio of 1.5, comparable to that estimated from synaptic currents <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Haider1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Liu1">[71]</xref>.

<p>When the balanced background synaptic input included SOM-type and NGF (SOM+NGF) mediated inhibition, the NMDAR spike threshold was reduced compared to quiescent conditions, but not as strongly as during background excitation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g005"><bold>Fig. 5A</bold></xref>).

<p>For spatially distributed synaptic input, the number of nearly synchronous inputs required to trigger APs was only marginally higher for 2×SOM-only balanced background inhibition than background excitation alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D1, D2</bold></xref>). However, for combined SOM+NGF inhibition, the number of synapses required to trigger an AP burst increased, indicating that the presence of the slow inhibitory component was effective at lowering dendritic gain for spatially distributed synaptic inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D1, D2</bold></xref>). The fact that NMDAR spikes were evident in the voltage recordings from the terminal branches indicates that nonlinear dendritic integration underlies the AP output during distributed input in the presence of SOM+NGF inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g005"><bold>Fig. 5B2</bold></xref>). Balanced background inhibition mediated by SOM+NGF was also effective at counteracting asynchronous inputs, increasing the number of spatially distributed inputs requited to trigger an AP burst with P(AP) = 0.5, from 100 with background excitation alone to 170 for a temporal window of 100 ms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g005"><bold>Fig. 5D1,D2</bold></xref>). Nevertheless, this was still far lower than under quiescent condition when 273 synapses were required. These simulations show that GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor-mediated inhibitory conductances can counteract the effects of background excitatory input on synaptic integration in the dendritic tuft by raising NMDAR spike threshold and lowering the dendritic gain. Our simulations predict that during periods of lighter dendritic inhibition, for example when both sensory and motor systems are engaged <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Xu1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>, the presence of balanced background synaptic input increases dendritic gain and extends the spatio-temporal integration properties of L5 pyramidal cells.</p>

<title>Mechanisms underlying the changes in spatio-temporal integration during background excitatory input</title>
<p>Several dendritic mechanisms could be involved in the network activity-dependent changes in synaptic integration we observe, but two are likely to be particularly important. Background excitatory inputs activate glutamatergic synapses that: 1) depolarize the dendrite (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1F</bold></xref>) and 2) generate glutamate-bound but mostly silent NMDARs over the dendritic tree. Depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Major1">[33]</xref>, glutamate spillover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Chalifoux1">[72]</xref> and glutamate-bound NMDARs from paired-pulse synaptic activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Polsky2">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gmez1">[74]</xref> have been shown to facilitate the generation of local NMDAR spikes in basal dendrites. In contrast to these relatively local effects, background network activity confers a spatially distributed NMDAR conductance that could provide an additional nonlinear resource for regenerative activity across the dendritic tree.</p>
<p>Since the threshold of NMDAR spikes is voltage-dependent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Major1">[33]</xref>, we first examined the effect of the depolarization induced by excitatory background activity on NMDAR spike properties. To do this we applied spatially distributed current injections (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s003">Fig. S3A1</xref></bold>) that depolarized the apical tree to a level comparable to that during background excitatory synaptic input (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s003">Fig. S3A3</xref>, inset</bold>). Current injections accounted for a substantial part of the change in the single-branch I-O relationship observed with background input (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s003">Fig. S3A2</xref></bold>). However, when spatially distributed AMPAR-only synapses were used to depolarize the apical tree to a comparable level of depolarization obtained with 1500 AMPAR/NMDAR synapses, they were less effective at altering the branch I-O relationship, due to the shunt introduced by these conductances (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s003">Fig. S3A2</xref></bold>). Similarly, AMPAR-only background activity that generated comparable dendritic depolarization only accounted for a fraction of the changes observed in the neuronal I-O relationship in response to clustered (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s003">Fig. S3A3</xref></bold>) and spatially distributed inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g004"><bold>Fig. 4C</bold></xref>). Moreover, current injections that produced depolarisations comparable to that obtained during background synaptic input at the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-spike initiation zone and at the soma recovered only a small part of the leftward shift in the neuronal I-O relationship (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s003">Fig. S3B, C</xref></bold>). These results show that, while depolarization is important in determining NMDAR spike threshold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Major1">[33]</xref>, when depolarization is mediated by AMPAR-only background synaptic conductance it does not fully account for the lowering of NMDAR spike threshold or the increased efficacy of apical input in triggering APs during background input. This suggests that the spatially distributed NMDAR conductance arising from background network activity is also playing a key role in synaptic integration.</p>

<title>Propagation and multiplication of dendritic regenerative events during background excitatory synaptic input</title>
<p>The finding that spatially distributed NMDAR conductance arising from background excitatory synaptic input contributes to the lengthening of dendritic spikes, suggests that glutamate-bound NMDARs in the vicinity of stimulated branches are recruited by depolarization. To investigate the extent of this effect, we monitored the voltage in each terminal branch, while triggering an NMDAR spike in only one branch at a time, with and without the background input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g007"><bold>Fig. 7A</bold></xref><bold>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s009">Movie S1</xref></bold>). In the absence of background input, triggering an NMDAR spike in branch 11 with 30 nearly synchronous synaptic inputs produced a large voltage depolarization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g007"><bold>Fig. 7B</bold></xref>, lower red trace) that spread into the neighbouring branch (10) producing a similar voltage profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g007"><bold>Fig. 7B</bold></xref>, black trace). However, the voltage in more distant branches (12 and 13) was markedly attenuated. When the same branch was triggered in the presence of background excitatory synaptic input (upper red trace) both the duration of the NMDAR spikes in branches 10 and 11 were extended and an additional regenerative event was observed in branch 12 and branch 13 (blue traces), suggesting that glutamate-bound NMDARs had become unblocked in neighbouring branches. Since it is difficult to distinguish between regenerative events and passive voltage propagation in the presence of background input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g007"><bold>Fig. 7C</bold></xref>), we used a more stringent voltage threshold criterion to identify regenerative events in neighbouring branches (peak<sub>background</sub>−peak<sub>control</sub>≥13 mV). The average number of additional activated branches ranged from 0.46 with 900 background excitatory inputs, to 2.19 with 1500 background excitatory inputs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g007"><bold>Fig. 7D</bold></xref>). These results show that additional regenerative events can be generated in neighbouring branches during background synaptic activity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s009">Movie S1</xref></bold>). This nonlinear dendritic amplification potentially explains why fewer stimulated branches are required to trigger APs in the presence of background excitatory synaptic input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g004"><bold>Fig. 4A</bold></xref>).</p>

<title>Lowered threshold, extended duration and spread of regenerative NMDAR events during background excitatory synaptic input in a passive L5 pyramidal cell model</title>
<p>L5 pyramidal cells contain several nonlinear voltage-dependent dendritic conductances that could interact with synaptic input in complex ways. We therefore examined whether any of the basic changes in synaptic integration we observed in the presence of background excitatory input occurred in a passive L5 model, where all the non-synaptic nonlinear conductances were replaced by a uniform passive leak conductance. Although there were some differences between the resting potential of this passive model compared to the active model (the passive model is more hyperpolarized) asynchronous background synaptic input lowered NMDAR spike threshold and elongated the duration of NMDAR spikes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g008"><bold>Fig. 8A, B</bold></xref>). These results confirm that synaptic AMPAR and NMDAR conductances are sufficient to change NMDAR spike threshold and duration during asynchronous excitatory background synaptic input.</p>

<p>We also examined whether propagation of regenerative events into neighbouring dendritic branches that we observed during background excitatory input could be generated by synaptic AMPARs and NMDARs in the passive model. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g008"><bold>Fig. 8C</bold></xref> shows an example where we stimulated a branch and examined the response in the other distal branches of the tuft. Regenerative events in neighbouring branches were less evident, nevertheless the voltage depolarization in neighbouring dendritic branches during background input was larger than the linear sum of the depolarizations observed with the stimulus alone and the background input alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g008"><bold>Fig. 8C, D</bold></xref>). This suggests that, in the presence of background excitatory input, the spread of voltage depolarization from the stimulated branch has a nonlinear regenerative component. Indeed, the duration of the voltage depolarisations in neighbouring branches also increased and some continued to build up well after the peak depolarization in the stimulated branch (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g008"><bold>Fig. 8E</bold></xref>). As for the full active model, regenerative events were observed in neighbouring branches when a single branch was stimulated during background input (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g008"><bold>Fig. 8F</bold></xref>).</p>
<p>These results suggest that synaptic AMPARs and NMDARs activated by background excitatory input can mediate active propagation into neighbouring branches, under certain conditions. However, the presence of dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances in real cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum3">[75]</xref> and in the original model are likely to facilitate this process. The spread of NMDAR-mediated regenerative events across branches and the increased decay time are likely to be interlinked: spread of voltage into neighbouring branches recruits NMDAR conductance activated by background input, potentially triggering a regenerative event. Recruitment of NMDAR conductances will help sustain the depolarization, lengthening the NMDAR spike duration, which in turn propagates more effectively through the dendritic tree. Simulations show that during background activity, a few synchronous distributed inputs can trigger an ‘avalanche’ of activity in multiple branches that feeds and sustains the depolarization for more than one hundred milliseconds. These events, through the recruitment of Ca<sup>2+</sup> currents in the trunk, can then initiate somatic APs (See <bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s010">Movie S2</xref></bold>). Propagation of voltage and activation of spatially distributed NMDAR conductance in neighbouring branches can therefore account for the increased efficacy of NMDAR spikes and the extended spatio-temporal integration we observe in the L5 pyramidal cell model, during background excitatory synaptic input.</p>

<title>Effect of inhibition on NMDAR spike initiation, duration and regeneration in the tuft</title>
<p>Having established that depolarization and spatially distributed NMDAR conductances are principally responsible for extending spatio-temporal integration during background excitatory synaptic input, we next examined how inhibition counteracts these effects. Comparison of individual NMDAR spikes during background excitatory synaptic input and during balanced background synaptic input, showed that the presence of SOM+NGF inhibition had little effect on their amplitude but did shorten their duration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Rhodes1">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g009"><bold>Fig. 9A</bold></xref>).

Moreover, SOM+NGF inhibition was more effective than 2×SOM at truncating NMDAR spikes, explaining why GABA<sub>B</sub> receptor inhibition was effective in modulating temporal integration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). However, NMDAR spike duration was still substantially longer in the presence of SOM+NGF based balanced background synaptic input than under quiescent conditions (Kolmogorov–Smirnov test, P&lt;0.05; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g009"><bold>Fig. 9B</bold></xref>).</p>

<p>We next examined the effect of background excitation and inhibition on the spread of NMDAR spikes into neighbouring branches. The average fractional increase in the number of branches exhibiting regenerative potentials was reduced from 2.19 to 1.2 when inhibition was added to background excitation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g009"><bold>Fig. 9C</bold></xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our simulations suggest that the background synaptic input arising from the ongoing cortical network activity observed <italic>in vivo</italic>, can extend the spatial and temporal properties of dendritic integration in L5 pyramidal cells. Spatio-temporal integration depends on background network activity, because it introduces spatially distributed synaptic NMDAR conductance over the dendritic tree and depolarizes the dendrites. Increasing the background excitatory synaptic input to levels expected <italic>in vivo</italic> has three main effects: 1) the number of coincident synaptic inputs required to trigger an NMDAR spike in a branch is reduced; 2) the duration of NMDAR spikes is increased, and 3) NMDAR-mediated regenerative events spread and trigger additional regenerative events in neighbouring dendritic branches. These mechanisms markedly reduce the number of spatially distributed synapses or stimulated terminal dendritic branches required to trigger APs. Inclusion of fast (GABA<sub>A</sub>) and slow (GABA<sub>B</sub>) receptor-mediated inhibitory conductances in the background synaptic input in an approximately balanced excitatory/inhibitory configuration only partially counteracted these effects. Our results show that <italic>in vivo</italic>-like balanced background input could enable L5 pyramidal cells to integrate spatially distributed and/or temporally dispersed synaptic inputs onto the tuft more effectively. Our findings suggest that the activity state of the cortical network can dynamically control the integrative properties of L5 pyramidal cells by adjusting the density of glutamate-bound NMDARs on the dendritic tree. This prediction has important implications for cortical processing.</p>

<title>Mechanisms underlying dendritic integration in active networks</title>
<p>Our simulations show that spatially distributed synaptic NMDAR conductances arising from ongoing network activity extend spatial and temporal integration in the dendritic tuft of L5 pyramidal cells. This network activity-dependent nonlinear dendritic mechanism is distinct from the well-documented effects of noise and linear synaptic conductances on neuronal I-O relationships <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Shu1">[20]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Chance1">[23]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Mitchell1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Prescott1">[27]</xref>. While AMPAR-mediated conductances do contribute to integration, they summate poorly during asynchronous input due to their rapid decays (τ = 2 ms), producing a mild dendritic depolarization, voltage noise and reduced membrane resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Destexhe2">[19]</xref>. By contrast, the slow kinetics of NMDARs (τ = 70 ms) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Myme1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Wang1">[76]</xref> summate effectively, allowing background network activity to set the density of NMDAR conductance on the dendritic tree. The dynamic nature of the spatially distributed NMDAR conductance contrasts with the properties of other spatially distributed voltage-dependent dendritic conductances (e.g. Na<sup>+</sup>, Ca<sup>2+</sup> and K<sup>+</sup> channels), which are typically modulated slowly, through plasticity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Losonczy1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Makara2">[79]</xref> and homeostatic mechanisms, although the effective number of channels available could change rapidly with voltage due to inactivation.</p>
<p>Several properties of the GluN2A/B containing NMDARs present in L5 pyramidal cells are important for dendritic integration in the presence of background synaptic activity. Their strong block by Mg<sup>2+</sup> below −60 mV <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Jahr1">[80]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Nowak1">[81]</xref> prevents their involvement in signalling except when the dendritic branch on which they are located is depolarized. This, together with their high affinity for glutamate, means that GluN2A/B-containing NMDARs can remain glutamate bound and ‘silent’, yet primed and ready to contribute current if the voltage of the dendritic branch depolarizes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Polsky2">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gmez1">[74]</xref>. The steep voltage dependence of the NMDAR conductance introduces a highly nonlinear threshold, enabling regenerative depolarization, while the slow kinetics of the conductance extends the time course of local EPSPs beyond the local effective membrane time constant of the fine dendritic branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Nevian1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco2">[56]</xref>. Our simulations show that these properties of NMDARs enable them to extend spatial and temporal integration in L5 pyramidal cells during <italic>in vivo</italic>-like network activity. Moreover, our control simulations indicate this effect is robust across a range of NMDAR kinetics: the slower the decay of the synaptic NMDAR conductance the longer the absolute window for temporal integration in the absence of other counteracting conductances (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s004">Fig. S4</xref></bold>). However, faster NMDAR kinetics would reduce the impact of background synaptic input unless there was a proportionally higher background input rate or a larger NMDAR/AMPAR peak amplitude ratio to maintain the same time-averaged NMDAR conductance. Another key property of NMDARs that sets them apart from nonlinear dendritic Na<sup>+</sup> conductances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Johnston1">[82]</xref> is the fact that they remain active during bursts of backpropagating APs and the sustained depolarisations during up-states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Plotkin1">[83]</xref>.</p>
<p>By increasing the gain of dendritic integration, background excitation could trigger an unconstrained positive feedback loop, integrating over longer timescales and resulting in prolonged global activation of the dendritic tuft. In practice, cortical microcircuits operate in a balanced configuration with inhibition closely tracking excitation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Haider1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Shadlen1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Liu1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Pfeffer1">[84]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Atallah1">[85]</xref>. Indeed, strong inhibition targeted to the tuft <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Murayama1">[43]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref> may be required to dampen excessive NMDAR excitation during highly active network states and prevent dendritic ‘chain reactions’ from reaching critical levels. Consistent with this, recent experimental evidence shows that apical inhibition has a stronger effect on the I-O relationship of CA1 pyramidal neurons than somatic inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-LovettBarron1">[68]</xref>. The apical dendrites of pyramidal cells receive inhibition from SOM expressing interneurons, which include Martinotti cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>. SOM-expressing interneurons respond to synaptic inputs from neighbouring pyramidal cells and deliver fast GABA<sub>A</sub> receptor mediated inhibition to the tuft region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Silberberg1">[63]</xref>. Interestingly, <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings show that SOM cell firing is suppressed for about 1 s during active whisker touch behaviour, suggesting that the tuft region is disinhibited during this behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>. Consistent with this, the G<sub>exc</sub>/G<sub>inh</sub> ratio is higher during <italic>in vivo</italic> up-states <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Waters1">[13]</xref>, and engaging the motor and sensory circuits together during whisker touch behaviour results in global tuft activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Xu1">[10]</xref>. Our simulations, which reproduced the excitation/inhibition balance and the firing rates of SOM and NGF cells measured in awake animals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>, show that inhibition reduces NMDAR spike threshold. However, our simulations of asynchronous background inhibition cannot rule out the possibility that fast feed-forward inhibition could veto NMDAR spike generation more effectively if it is present in L1 and L2 and targeted to the same branches as the excitation. Our simulations suggest that slow GABA<sub>B</sub>-mediated inhibition arising from NGF cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Jiang1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Tams1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Wozny1">[65]</xref> is particularly effective at truncating NMDAR spikes and reducing dendritic gain. This, together with the fact that the firing rate of NGF cells is elevated during active touch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>, suggests that NGF mediated inhibition may be particularly well placed to control spatio-temporal integration in the tuft (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g005"><bold>Fig. 5</bold></xref>). Such co-variation of background excitatory and inhibitory conductances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Atallah1">[85]</xref> in recurrent cortical networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Murayama1">[43]</xref> is likely to extend the dynamic range over which pyramidal cells can operate by adjusting their integrative properties to match the excitatory drive. These findings extend previous work showing that inhibitory conductances can terminate NMDAR spikes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Rhodes1">[44]</xref> by showing how background inhibition arising from specific interneuron types could counteract the effects of background excitation and shape spatio-temporal integration in L5 pyramidal cells. Our results suggest that during active whisking the lowered level of inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>, could promote NMDAR-mediated distributed signalling, while strong dendritic inhibition could keep it in check at other times, thereby preventing runaway excitation.</p>

<title>Potential interactions between background synaptic input, NMDAR spikes and voltage-gated dendritic conductances</title>
<p>The dendrites of pyramidal cells contain many different voltage-gated conductances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Spruston1">[86]</xref>. While it was not possible to explore all possible interactions between background input and the 9 conductances in our model, the simulations we carried out do point to some general principles of interaction and highlight specific conductances that could play a key role in shaping the properties of spatiotemporal integration. At the most basic level, some excitatory dendritic conductances in the model such as the Na<sup>+</sup> and Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances clearly aid background induced regenerative activity (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s005">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). Indeed, we found that Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes occur in the tuft during strong tuft stimuli, and help to electrically couple the tuft to the soma, as found experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum2">[37]</xref>. By contrast, increasing I<sub>h</sub> reduced the NMDAR spike threshold in the presence of background input, but had negligible effect on NMDAR spike duration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s005">Fig. S5</xref></bold>). Indeed, more complex effects are seen when conductances have activation and/or inactivation properties with significant voltage dependences around −55 mV, because background synaptic input depolarizes the dendrite by several millivolts compared to the quiescent condition. For example, transient A-type K<sup>+</sup> conductances inactivate strongly over this voltage range making their impact weaker than expected (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s006">Fig. S6</xref></bold>). By contrast, the sustained slow K<sup>+</sup> conductance (delayed rectifier) strongly activates during NMDAR spikes and truncates their duration (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s006">Fig. S6</xref></bold>). Increasing the K<sup>+</sup> conductances to match levels recently reported experimentally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref>, increased the threshold of NMDAR spikes, limited their spread to neighbouring branches and was particularly effective at reducing their decay time (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s007">Fig. S7</xref></bold>). However, the time course of the resulting dendritic spikes generated under these conditions was markedly different from NMDAR spikes recorded experimentally in L5 pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref> and another recent study estimated much lower densities of K<sup>+</sup> conductances in the tuft region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Almog1">[87]</xref> comparable to that in the original L5 model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Larkum1">[29]</xref>. Nevertheless, slow K<sup>+</sup> conductances appear well placed to modulate spatio-temporal integration in L5 pyramidal cells. SK type channels in spines, which are activated by local Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx though NMDARs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-NgoAnh1">[88]</xref>, may also truncate NMDAR spikes (<bold><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003590.s008">Fig. S8</xref></bold>). Thus the level of expression of the various dendritic conductances and their precise voltage and Ca<sup>2+</sup> dependencies are likely to tune the spatio-temporal integration. Irrespective of the natural configuration of the dendritic conductances present <italic>in vivo</italic>, our results using a passive L5 model, show that the spatially distributed NMDAR conductance arising from ongoing network activity will extend spatio-temporal integration unless other dendritic conductances are specifically configured to counteract this basic property. Indeed, spatially distributed glutamate-bound NMDARs arising from ongoing network activity extend the toolbox of dendritic conductances available to pyramidal cells, potentially enabling them to perform a wider range of behaviours.</p>

<title>Enhanced spatial and temporal integration during background network activity</title>
<p>The fine dendrites of pyramidal cells have traditionally been thought to act as coincidence detectors on fast time scales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Softky1">[89]</xref>, due to their fast local membrane time constant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Nevian1">[31]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Williams2">[90]</xref>. However, when depolarized, slowly decaying synaptic NMDAR conductances set the dendritic EPSP waveform, extending the integration window to tens of milliseconds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco1">[35]</xref>. The voltage dependent properties of NMDARs have also been shown to extend the time window for integration, underlying the supra-linear response of the second of a pair of synaptic inputs onto the basal dendrites of L5 pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Polsky1">[32]</xref>. Moreover, temporal integration can be extended further when pairs of bursts are used <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Polsky2">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gmez1">[74]</xref>. Our simulations extend these findings by showing that a spatially distributed NMDAR conductance arising from <italic>in vivo</italic>-like background synaptic input can extend both the spatial and temporal integration in L5 pyramidal cells by providing both depolarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Prescott1">[27]</xref> and a spatially distributed NMDAR conductance that sustains the NMDAR spike plateau depolarization. Interestingly, these mechanisms act in the opposite direction to passive membrane properties, which reduce the temporal integration window during elevated synaptic input, due to increased membrane shunting by synaptic conductances.</p>
<p>Our simulations show that background synaptic input can lower the number of coincident synaptic inputs required to trigger an NMDAR spike in a distal branch. This suggests that NMDAR spikes are much more likely to occur <italic>in vivo</italic> during network activity than <italic>in vitro</italic> when the network is largely quiescent. Another important consequence of spatially distributed NMDAR conductance arising from background network activity is that it enables active propagation of NMDAR-mediated regenerative events into neighbouring branches, resulting in a multi-branch regenerative plateau potential. This prediction is consistent with recent <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings of NMDAR spikes in L2/3 pyramidal cells, which reported that 83% of events occurred in multiple branches <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Palmer1">[46]</xref>. Spatially distributed NMDAR conductance is therefore well suited for integrating excitatory input that is distributed across the branches of the dendritic tree <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Jia1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Chen1">[40]</xref>. Our simulations show that under <italic>in vivo</italic>-like levels of background input our L5 model could integrate spatially and temporally dispersed synaptic input. This suggests that spatial clustering of synaptic inputs required for triggering NMDAR spikes under quiescent <italic>in vitro</italic> conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Branco1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Fino2">[64]</xref> may not be necessary <italic>in vivo</italic>. Hence, while spatial clustering of synaptic input onto the dendrites of pyramidal cells has been found <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Takahashi1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Rah1">[91]</xref>, our results suggest it is not a prerequisite for activating the tuft of L5 pyramidal cells. Indeed, our finding that network activity extends spatio-temporal integration may explain how NMDAR spikes contribute to orientation selective tuning in L2/3 pyramidal cells in mouse V1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Smith1">[47]</xref>, when the synaptic inputs onto these cells are spatially distributed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Jia1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Widespread NMDAR spikes have been reported in the dendrites of L4 spiny stellate neurons of rat barrel cortex, during whisker deflection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Lavzin1">[45]</xref>. The multiple hot spots of Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx observed are consistent with a small number of distributed thalamo-cortical inputs being amplified by the dendritic NMDAR conductance arising from local network activity, but alternative scenarios are also possible. In L2/3 pyramidal cells in somatosensory cortex, both spontaneous and hind paw-evoked NMDAR spikes are localized to ∼30 µm regions of the dendritic tree and usually encompass multiple branches. These events are effective at triggering APs but do not appear to involve a dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spike <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Palmer1">[46]</xref>. More widespread [Ca<sup>2+</sup>] signals have been observed in the tuft of L5 pyramidal cells in awake animals performing active whisker touch, when vibrissal sensory input is combined with L1 input arising from the primary motor cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Xu1">[10]</xref>. Similar tuft responses could be reproduced <italic>in vitro</italic> when apical trunk Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes were paired with dendritic tuft depolarization or synaptic input. This suggests that <italic>in vivo</italic> tuft plateau potentials and Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx are caused by apical dendritic Ca<sup>2+</sup> spikes spreading into the tuft when it is depolarized by L1 input. Although, Ca<sup>2+</sup> conductances are clearly important <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Xu1">[10]</xref>, network activity-dependent distributed NMDAR conductance could also contribute to this widespread Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx. Indeed, recent <italic>in vivo</italic> recordings from CA1 pyramidal cells show that both NMDARs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels are required to generate the slow, widespread regenerative dendritic events that underlie complex spike bursts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Grienberger1">[92]</xref>. These results suggest that the densities of both glutamate-bound NMDARs and Ca<sup>2+</sup> channels can set the spatial spread of regenerative dendritic events in pyramidal cells. Our results highlight the role of spatially distributed NMDAR conductances in pyramidal cells under <italic>in vivo</italic> conditions, by showing how they could enable these cells to integrate both spatially clustered and spatially distributed inputs over longer timescales than previously thought.</p>

<title>Implications for cortical processing</title>
<p>The finding that synaptic input and nonlinear membrane conductances can produce local regenerative dendritic events has lead to the idea that individual dendritic branches can operate as independent thresholding units <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Major1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Polsky2">[73]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Wei1">[93]</xref> enabling a pyramidal cell to act as a powerful pattern separator <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Poirazi1">[34]</xref>. In this scenario, individual branches could act as feature detectors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Losonczy1">[77]</xref> and neuronal firing could report the coincident occurrence of these features. However, our results showing that NMDAR spikes can spread into neighbouring dendritic branches suggest that they may not operate independently and are more effective at triggering APs than anticipated, consistent with recent experimental findings <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Palmer1">[46]</xref>. This enhancement in spatio-temporal integration during network activity is likely to come at the cost of loss of power to discriminate different spatial patterns of synaptic input. That said, our results do not exclude the possibility that L5 pyramidal cells can still act as coincidence detectors and perform pattern discrimination, since our simulations show that altering the level of dendritic inhibition or the density of voltage-gated channels on the dendrite can tune the spatio-temporal properties of the tuft. Coincidence detection and pattern discrimination could be enhanced by raising the threshold for dendritic spikes, truncating their duration and decoupling dendritic branches. This could be achieved by expressing high levels of K<sup>+</sup> channels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Harnett1">[36]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Cai1">[94]</xref>, which have been shown to compartmentalize dendritic responses in CA1 pyramidal cells and through experience-dependent adjustment of synaptic weights onto specific branches through NMDAR-dependent Ca<sup>2+</sup> influx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gordon1">[95]</xref>. Moreover, recent work suggests that GIRK channels can also modulate NMDAR spike duration in a branch specific manner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Makara1">[78]</xref>. Our results suggest that these slowly modulated dendritic mechanisms are complemented, <italic>in vivo</italic>, by faster dynamic modulation conferred by the background synaptic excitation and inhibition arising from ongoing network activity. Thus, both the past and the present activity state of the network determines which spatio-temporal patterns of synaptic input a L5 pyramidal cell can respond to.</p>
<p>Network activity-dependent spatio-temporal integration could have important implications for cortico-cortical and thalamo-cortical signalling. While global network activity is maintained at a relatively constant level due to tight inhibitory control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Haider1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Shadlen1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Liu1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Atallah1">[85]</xref>, the activity of sub-networks of excitatory neurons is likely to vary widely, due to common receptive field properties and preferential local synaptic connectivity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Ko1">[96]</xref>. If the elevated activity in L2/3 pyramidal cell ensembles observed during sensory input <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Ko1">[96]</xref> increases synaptic input onto the apical dendrites of subsets of L5 pyramidal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Feldmeyer1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Williams3">[97]</xref>, the resulting increase in NMDAR conductance will enable those L5 pyramidal cells to integrate both spatio-temporally clustered and dispersed signals. This property suggests that the tuft could combine different modalities, such as motor, sensory and emotional state, which span a wide range of timescales. This effect is predicted to be particularly strong when the apical tuft is disinhibited, as has been observed when motor and sensory systems are engaged together <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Gentet2">[48]</xref>. Although speculative, network-dependent enhancement of spatio-temporal integration could also enable L5 pyramidal cells to communicate selectively across sensory and motor cortical areas, in a context dependent manner. Such reconfigurable functional network connectivity has been reviewed in the context of neuronal gain modulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Haider2">[98]</xref> and could be involved in high-level cortical function including attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Wang1">[76]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Crick1">[99]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Salinas1">[100]</xref> and learning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003590-Letzkus1">[9]</xref>.

<p>Two groups of synaptic input were defined. Those that mimicked a stimulus-evoked event and those that mimicked asynchronous background network activity. For simulations where specific dendritic branches were stimulated, one of the 28 terminal branches was randomly selected and the stimulus evoked quantal synaptic inputs randomly placed along it. For spatially distributed stimulus-evoked inputs, quantal synaptic inputs were randomly distributed over the entire apical tuft (Blue region, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003590-g001"><bold>Fig. 1A</bold></xref>) Each stimulus-evoked input was driven by an independent Poisson train with a frequency that was inversely related to duration of the stimulus, thereby maintaining an average of a single quantal conductance per synapse, independent of stimulus duration. For background excitatory synaptic input, 900–1500 glutamatergic synapses were placed randomly over the apical dendritic region (starting from ∼500 µm from soma). Each of these synapses was driven independently with a Poisson train with a mean rate of 0.85 Hz.

<p><bold>Movie 1 shows the membrane voltage in the Layer 5 Pyramidal cell model during nearly synchronous stimulus evoked synaptic stimulation with 30 synapses on a terminal dendritic branch (each synapse firing at 200 Hz from 100–105 ms).</bold> The voltage response to the synaptic input is shown under 3 conditions: 1) Control with no background activity. 2) With background activity from 1500 excitatory synapses firing randomly at 0.85 Hz. 3) With balanced background synaptic input including inhibition from SOM-like (GABA<sub>A</sub>) and NGF-like (GABA<sub>A</sub> and GABA<sub>B</sub>) mediated inhibition. While the spread of depolarisation in the control case is limited to the stimulated branch and its near neighbours, the excitatory background input causes regenerative depolarisation in branches further away. The spread of depolarisation is also widespread for balanced background synaptic input, but the presence of inhibition shortens the duration compared with background excitation alone.</p>
