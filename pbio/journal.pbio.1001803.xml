<abstract>
<p>DNA repair mechanisms are essential for preservation of genome integrity. However, it is not clear how DNA are selected and processed at broken ends by exonucleases during repair pathways. Here we show that the DnaQ-like exonuclease RNase T is critical for <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> resistance to various DNA-damaging agents and UV radiation. RNase T specifically trims the 3′ end of structured DNA, including bulge, bubble, and Y-structured DNA, and it can work with Endonuclease V to restore the deaminated base in an inosine-containing heteroduplex DNA. Crystal structure analyses further reveal how RNase T recognizes the bulge DNA by inserting a phenylalanine into the bulge, and as a result the 3′ end of blunt-end bulge DNA can be digested by RNase T. In contrast, the homodimeric RNase T interacts with the Y-structured DNA by a different binding mode via a single protomer so that the 3′ overhang of the Y-structured DNA can be trimmed closely to the duplex region. Our data suggest that RNase T likely processes bulge and bubble DNA in the Endonuclease V–dependent DNA repair, whereas it processes Y-structured DNA in UV-induced and various other DNA repair pathways. This study thus provides mechanistic insights for RNase T and thousands of DnaQ-like exonucleases in DNA 3′-end processing.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>DNA repair relies on various enzymes, including exonucleases that bind and trim DNA at broken ends. However, we know little about how an exonuclease precisely selects and trims a DNA broken end in specific repair pathways. In this study, the enzyme RNase T, previously known for its involvement in processing RNA substrates, is shown to also possess DNase activity. RNase T is a DnaQ-like exonuclease and is characterized in this work as the exoDNase responsible for trimming the 3′ ends of structured DNA in various DNA repair pathways. Based on the high-resolution crystal structures of RNase T-DNA complexes, an insightful working model is provided showing how RNase T processes bulge, bubble, and Y- structured DNA in various DNA repair pathways. RNase T thus represents a unique structure-specific exonuclease with multiple functions not only in processing 3′ overhangs of duplex RNA during RNA maturation, but also in processing 3′ ends of bubble, bulge, and Y-structured DNA during DNA repair. These findings advance our understanding of the precise function of an exonuclease in DNA repair and suggest possible roles for thousands of members of DnaQ superfamily exonucleases in DNA repair and replication.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>It is well known that DNA repair mechanisms maintain genomic integrity and are essential for cell survival. Damaged DNA can be restored by a variety of DNA repair processes, such as direct reversal, base excision, nucleotide excision, mismatch, and recombination repair pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Morita1">[1]</xref>. Although diverse proteins play different roles in these pathways, DNA repair is generally accomplished by a coordinated effort via several types of DNA enzymes, including endonucleases that nick DNA near the damaged site, exonucleases that trim DNA from the broken end, helicases that unwind duplex DNA, polymerases that make new strand DNA with correct sequences, and ligases that seal the restored DNA strands. Among all these DNA enzymes, the molecular functions of exonucleases, which bind at the 3′ or 5′ end of DNA and cleave one nucleotide at a time, are least understood. How they select, rather than randomly bind to, a broken end of DNA and process it up to the site for the next-step processing remains to be investigated.</p>
<p>Here we use the bacterial exonuclease RNase T as a model system to study the processing of DNA in various DNA repair pathways. RNase T is a member of the DnaQ-like 3′–5′ exonucleases with a DEDDh domain that contains four acidic DEDD residues (D23, E25, D125, and D186) for binding of two magnesium ions, and one histidine residue (H181) for functioning as the general base in the active site for the hydrolysis of the 3′-terminal phosphodiester bond of a nucleic acid chain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Yang1">[2]</xref>. The family of DnaQ-like exonucleases constitutes thousands of members, all with exonuclease activity either processing RNA during RNA maturation, interference, and turnover, or processing DNA during DNA replication, degradation, repair, and recombination. A number of the DnaQ-like exonucleases have been shown to play a role in DNA repair. Usually the DEDDh domain can be linked to a DNA polymerase domain for proofreading during DNA replication, such as the DnaQ domain of the ε subunit of <italic>E. coli</italic> pol III holoenzyme and the exonuclease domain of human pol δ, ε, and γ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Bebenek1">[3]</xref>. Mutations in or deletion of the proofreading 3′ exonuclease domain for these polymerases are either lethal or induce high mutation rates and high incidence of cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Shevelev1">[4]</xref>. The DEDDh domain can also be linked to a helicase domain and functions in processing of broken DNA strands during DNA repair and recombination, such as that of human WRN <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Perry1">[5]</xref>. Mutations in the DEDDh exonuclease domain of WRN are associated with Werner syndrome that results in premature aging and increased risk of cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Uhrhammer1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>However, most of the DEDDh domain functions as an autonomous protein and is not linked to a polymerase or a helicase domain. Some of these exonucleases participate in DNA 3′-end processing in DNA repair, such as ExoI and ExoX from <italic>E. coli</italic> and TREX1 and TREX2 from human <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Burdett1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Mazur1">[9]</xref>. ExoI and ExoX are monomeric enzymes that digest single-stranded DNA in mismatch and DNA recombination repair pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Thoms1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Cheng1">[12]</xref>, whereas the human TREX1 and TREX2 are dimeric enzymes, likely processing single-stranded DNA in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Yang2">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Chen1">[14]</xref>. Mutations in TREX1 are linked to the autoimmune diseases Aicardi-Goutieres syndrome and systemic lupus erythematosus, probably due to the accumulation of nonprocessed intermediate DNA during replication and repair pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-ODriscoll1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Stetson1">[17]</xref>. The crystal structures of ExoI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Misra1">[18]</xref>, TREX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-deSilva1">[19]</xref>, and TREX2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-deSilva2">[20]</xref> reveal that they all bear a classical α/β fold of the DEDDh domain; nevertheless, their precise functions in DNA processing remain uncertain.</p>
<p>RNase T has also been implicated in the UV-repair pathways based on the observations that the cells lacking RNase T are less resistant to UV radiation and overexpression of RNase T can rescue the UV sensitivity of the ExoI knockout <italic>E. coli</italic> strain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Padmanabha1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Viswanathan3">[22]</xref>. Yet RNase T was originally recognized as an RNase based on its indispensable role in tRNA 3′-end processing during tRNA maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Deutscher1">[23]</xref>. RNase T also performs the final trimming for various stable RNA, including 5S and 23S rRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Li1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Li2">[25]</xref>. RNase T can digest both DNA and RNA and it has a unique specificity that its exonuclease activity is reduced by a single 3′-terminal C or completely abolished by a dinucleotide 3′-terminal CC in digesting either DNA or RNA, referred to as the C effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Zuo1">[26]</xref>. Moreover, its exonuclease activity is inhibited by duplex structures, referred to as the double-strand effect; therefore, a 3′ overhang of a duplex DNA or RNA is only digested near the duplex region by RNase T <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Zuo1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao1">[27]</xref>. Previous crystal structures of RNase T in complex with various single-stranded DNA (3′-terminal G versus C) and double-stranded DNA (1 versus 2 nucleotide 3′ overhang) reveal the structural basis for C effect and double-strand effect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao2">[28]</xref>. The binding of an uncleavable substrate, such as a single-stranded DNA with a 3′-terminal C or a duplex DNA with a short 2-nucleotide 3′ overhang, induces an inactive conformational change in the active site and thus inactivates the exonuclease activity. Therefore, in digesting a duplex DNA with a 3′ overhang, RNase T can accurately differentiate its cleavable or noncleavable substrates based on the C effect and double-strand effect, and it produces a precise final product of a duplex with a 1-nucleotide (if the last base pair in duplex region is AT) or 2-nucleotide (if the last base pair in duplex region is GC) 3′ overhang if the CC dinucleotide is not present within the 3′ tail, or else it stops at the 3′-CC end. RNase T hence is capable to trim various precursor RNA to produce mature RNA with a precise 3′ overhang depending on the structure and sequence of these precursors: 1 nt for 5S rRNA, 2 nt for 23S rRNA, 4 nt for 4.5S RNA, and 4 nt for tRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao2">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>In fact, RNase T is a more efficient DNase than RNase in that it digests DNA with a 10-fold efficiency as compared to RNA (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s002">figure S2</xref> in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao2">[28]</xref>), supporting its possible cellular role in DNA processing. However, it is not certain if RNase T indeed processes DNA in DNA repair, and if it does, how it selects and processes its DNA substrates. To determine the molecular function of RNase T, we show here by biochemical and structural approaches that it is a structure-specific DNase capable of digesting intermediate structured DNA during DNA repair. We found that RNase T not only digests bubble and bulge DNA in Endonuclease V (Endo V)–dependent DNA repair but also digests Y-structured DNA in UV-induced DNA repair pathways. The crystal structures of RNase T in complex with a bulge and a Y-structured DNA further demonstrate how this dimeric enzyme elegantly binds and processes these structured DNA molecules in different ways. Our results reveal, for the first time, the precise molecular role of an exonuclease in the 3′ end DNA processing and may hint at the molecular function for other members of DnaQ-like exonucleases.</p>

<title>RNase T-Deficient Cells Are Sensitive to DNA Damaging Agents</title>
<p>To confirm the possible roles of RNase T in DNA repair, we measured the chronic and acute sensitivity of the RNase T knockout <italic>E. coli</italic> strain (Δ<italic>rnt</italic>)?against various DNA-damaging agents, including hydrogen peroxide (H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>), methyl methanesulfonate (MMS), 4-nitroquinoline-1-oxide (4NQO), mitomycin C (MMC), and UV light. A number of exonucleases that have been shown to play a role in DNA repair, including ExoI (Δ<italic>exoI</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Burdett1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Thoms1">[10]</xref>, ExoX (Δ<italic>exoX</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Burdett1">[7]</xref>, PNPase (Δ<italic>pnp</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Cardenas1">[29]</xref>, and RecJ (Δ<italic>recj</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Shimada1">[30]</xref>, were tested in parallel for a comparison (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001803-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s001">Figures S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s002">S2</xref>). The wild-type K-12 strain resisted all DNA-damaging agents when present at a chronic dose, whereas RNase T-deficient strain (Δ<italic>rnt</italic>) had a slow growth phenotype and was sensitive to the chronic dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>, MMS, 4NQO, and UV-C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). The RNase T-deficient strain (Δ<italic>rnt</italic>) was also sensitive to the acute dose of H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> in various concentrations from 20 to 80 mM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). The sensitivity of Δ<italic>rnt</italic> strain to UV-C was different from those observed in the previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Padmanabha1">[21]</xref>; therefore, we further confirmed the UV and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> sensitivity by <italic>rnt</italic>-rescued experiments, which restored the resistance of Δ<italic>rnt</italic> cells against UV-C and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This result shows that the sensitivity of the RNase T knockout cells to UV-C and H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub> is indeed due to the deficiency of RNase T.</p>

(C) The single-stranded DNA containing a methylated, deaminated, oxidized base or an abasic site at the 3′-terminal end (5′-GAGTCCTATA<bold><underline>X</underline></bold>-3′) were incubated with RNase T in the DNA digestion experiment. RNase T digested single-stranded DNA with a 3′-terminal methylated and deaminated base, including O<sup>4</sup>-methylthymine (O<sup>4</sup>-mT), O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (O<sup>6</sup>-mG), uracil, and hypoxanthine (Inosine). However, the single-stranded DNA with a 3′-terminal oxidized base, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxo), or an abasic site was more resistant to RNase T. The cleavage stopped at dincucleotide -CC- because the exonuclease activity of RNase T was inhibited by 3′-terminal CC sequence.</p>

<p>In comparison to the known DNA-repair exonucleases, RNase T had a wider sensitivity to various DNA-damaging agents.

<p>To further characterize the role of RNase T in DNA repair pathways, the single-stranded DNA containing a methylated, deaminated, or oxidized base, or an abasic site at the 3′-terminal end (5′-GAGTCCTATA<bold><underline>X</underline></bold>-3′) were incubated with RNase T in the DNA digestion experiment. We found that RNase T digested the DNA with a methylated base—O<sup>4</sup>-methylthymine (O<sup>4</sup>-mT) and O<sup>6</sup>-methylguanine (O<sup>6</sup>-mG)—and a deaminated base—uracil and hypoxanthine. However, the DNA with a 3′-terminal oxidized base, 8-oxoguanine (8-oxo), and an abasic site were more resistant to RNase T digestion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This result suggests that RNase T can function as an exonuclease in the excision step for methylated and deaminated bases in BER and AR.</p>

<title>RNase T Processes Bulge and Bubble DNA Without Sequence Preference</title>
<p>The next question we tackled was what types of DNA that can be processed by RNase T in DNA repair, besides the single-stranded DNA with a lesion. RNase T is not an appropriate exonuclease for digesting single-stranded DNA since its exonuclease activity is easily blocked by any C within a DNA strand. A variety of intermediate structured DNAs are generated during DNA repair, such as bulge, bubble, and Y-structured DNA. Bulge DNAs are produced in frameshift DNA mutations during DNA replication of repetitive sequences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Viswanathan4">[41]</xref>, whereas bubble DNA are generated in mismatch replication or deamination of DNA bases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Dalhus1">[42]</xref>. Y-structured DNAs are generated in various DNA repair pathways, such as mismatched DNA repair and DNA recombination (see Discussion). To test if RNase T processes these intermediate structured DNA, we incubated RNase T with different DNA and found that RNase T can digest Y-structured DNA and blunt-end bubble DNA with an I-T or I-G bubble (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In digesting the Y-structure DNA, the exonuclease activity of RNase T was blocked by the duplex structure—that is, double-strand effect—and RNase T generated a final product of 1-nucleotide 3′ overhang duplex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In digesting bulge and bubble DNA, the double-strand effect did not occur, and the blunt-end bulge and bubble DNA was cleaved by RNase T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2A</xref>).</p>

<title>RNase T digests Y-structured, bubble, and bulge DNA and works with Endo V in DNA repair.</title>
<p>(A) RNase T digested Y-structured DNA and inosine-containing bubble DNA (sequences listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s010">Table S1</xref>). (B) RNase T could not digest a duplex DNA with a 3′-CC overhang. However, RNase T digested a bulge DNA and a Y-structured DNA with a 3′-CC sequence. The 3′ tails are numbered and the corresponding cleavages are indicated by arrowheads on the right of the gel. (C) Endo V–dependent DNA repair is initiated by Endo V cleavage at the 3′ side of the second phosphodiester bond to the DNA lesions, such as deoxyriboinosine and insertion/deletion DNA. The mispaired I-T site has a bubble DNA structure, whereas the insertion/deletion DNA has a bulge DNA structure. (D) RNase T worked with Endo V to restore an inosine to cytosine. The heteroduplex DNA plasmid contained a mispaired I-G that could be cleaved by XhoI and AlwNI into two linear 4.1- and 3.1-kb fragments if I-G was repaired to C-G. This heteroduplex plasmid was repaired more efficiently (86.7%) following incubation with Endo V, RNase T, KF exo<sup>−</sup> (the DNA polymerase I Klenow fragment with defective exonuclease activity), and ligase than incubation with Endo V, DNA polymerase I, and ligase (61.4%).</p>

<p>We further tested the sequence preference of RNase T in digesting the structured DNA. In digesting a classical duplex DNA with a short 3′ overhang, the exonuclease activity of RNase T was blocked by a dinucleotide 3′-end CC sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). In contrast to the duplex DNA, the bulge and Y-structured DNA with terminal 3′-CC were processed by RNase T into a final product with a 1-nucleotide 3′ overhang (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Therefore, in digesting bubble and bulge DNA, RNase T has no sequence preference, and it removes the last paired nucleotide of any sequence to generate a 1-nucleotide 3′ overhang. In digesting Y-structured DNA, RNase T also has no sequence preference and processes the 3′ tail of any sequence close to the duplex region to generate a 1-nucleotide 3′ tail as the final product.</p>

<title>Crystal Structure Reveals How RNase T Binds and Processes Blunt-End Bulge DNA</title>
<p>We were intrigued by how RNase T could bind and process a bubble or bulge in DNA with a blunt end. Previous studies showed that the double-strand effect of RNase T requires a 3′ overhang of a duplex with a length of more than 2 nucleotides for inserting into the active cleft for digestion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s007">Movie S1</xref>). To reveal how RNase T binds and processes a DNA bulge with a blunt end, we co-crystallized RNase T with two bulge DNA molecules, one with a 3′-end TC and one with a 3′-end CC sequence in acidic conditions, pH 5.5 and pH 6.0, respectively (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s011">Table S2</xref>). RNase T only digests nucleic acids in basic conditions because the general base H181 has to be deprotonated to activate a nucleophilic water for hydrolysis. Therefore, due to the low pH, the bulge DNA in the crystal were not cleaved by RNase T. The crystal structure of the two complexes was solved by X-ray diffraction methods at a resolution of 1.8 and 2.0 Å, respectively (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g003">Figure 3</xref>). In the RNase T–bulge DNA complex structures, the dimeric RNase T bound to two bulge DNAs, with the 3′ end of DNA binding at the active site of each protomer (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g004">Figure 4</xref>). The bulge DNA was bound between the two RNase T protomers, in a way similar to that of the classical duplex DNA with a 3′ overhang <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao2">[28]</xref>.</p>

(C) Schematic diagram of three different binding modes for RNase T bound to a bulge DNA (this study, PDB ID codes 4KB0 and 4KB1), a duplex DNA with a short 3′ overhang (previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Zuo1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Hsiao1">[27]</xref>, PDB ID codes 3NH2 and 3VA3), and a Y-structured DNA (this study, PDB ID code 4KAZ). For clarity, only one of the two DNA molecules bound to RNase T is shown. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s007">Movies S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s008">S2</xref>.</p>

<p>However, in contrast to the previous duplex DNA complex, the aromatic side chain of Phe29 was inserted into the bulge and stacked with the two neighboring GC base pairs in both of the bulge DNA complexes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g004">Figure 4A and 4B</xref>). In the previous duplex DNA complex, Phe29 was stacked with the 5′-end base of the opposite nonscissile strand, and the stacking stopped the further cleavage of the scissile strand at the 3′ end, resulting in the double-strand effect (see the schematic comparison in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). The crystal structure of the bulge DNA complex revealed how RNase T can overcome the double-strand effect by inserting Phe29 into the bulge so that the 3′-end scissile phosphate was moved accordingly into the active site (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s008">Movie S2</xref>). We found that the active site of the bulge DNA complex indeed had an active conformation with two bound Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions, and the general base His181 was located close to the scissile phosphate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g004">Figure 4B</xref>).</p>
<p>The crystal structure of the bulge DNA complex also revealed how RNase T could overcome the C effect. The 3′-end cytosine was paired with the 5′-end guanine, and this base pairing prevented Glu73 from interacting with the 3′-end C to induce the C effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Therefore, the bulge DNA could be processed by RNase T without any sequence preference. Moreover, the 5′ end of bulge DNA was not hindered by any residue and could further extend (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), suggesting that RNase T can cleave bulge DNA with a long single-stranded region at the opposite strand, similar to those DNA in the frameshift DNA mutations (see Discussion) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Viswanathan4">[41]</xref>. The crystal structure thus reveals at the atomic level how RNase T binds and processes a bulge DNA with a blunt end without a sequence preference.</p>

<title>RNase T Is Likely a Downstream Exonuclease That Follows Endo V Nicking</title>
<p>The bubble and bulge DNA can be produced by Endo V, which makes a nick at the 3′ side one base pair away from a damage site with a deaminated base in the alternative DNA repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Dalhus1">[42]</xref>. Endo V also processes mismatched DNA, hairpin-containing DNA, bulge DNA, and flap DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Yao1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Yao2">[45]</xref>, however the downstream process following Endo V nicking has not been characterized. The bulge DNA in our crystal structures had a conformation similar to the bubble DNA produced by Endo V nicking, suggesting that RNase T might be the downstream exonuclease of Endo V, responsible for removing the last base-paired nucleotide at the 3′ end to release the single-stranded DNA or the damaged DNA bases, such as hypoxanthine, xanthine, and uracil (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2D</xref>).</p>
<p>To test this possibility, we prepared the hypoxanthine-containing—that is, inosine-containing—heteroduplex DNA for examination of Endo V–dependent inosine excision repair <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Lee1">[46]</xref>. The heteroduplex DNA plasmid contained the I-G base pair with an AlwNl cutting site and a potential XhoI cutting site. Once the inosine was restored to cytosine, the plasmid could be cleaved by AlwNl and XhoI into two linear double-stranded DNA molecules of 4.1 and 3.1 kilobases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). The I-G–containing plasmid was then incubated with Endo V, RNase T, ligase, and the Klenow fragment exo<sup>−</sup> (Polymerase I Klenow fragment with a defected 3′–5′ exonuclease activity). The inosine in the plasmid was restored to cytosine with a higher repair efficiency (86.7%) as compared with those incubated with the wild-type DNA Polymerase I with a proofreading exonuclease domain (61.4%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The repair efficiency was positively correlated with the RNase T concentration and the time of incubation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Interestingly, ExoI and ExoX could not work with Endo V to restore the inosine to cytosine (unpublished data). These results show that RNase T can work with Endo V in the Endo V–dependent DNA repair.</p>

<title>Crystal Structure Reveals How RNase T Processes Y-Structured DNA in a Unique Way</title>
<p>Beside bubble/bulge DNA, RNase T also processed Y-structured DNA, which can be generated during various DNA repair pathways, such as mismatch repair and DNA recombination. However, it remained unknown how an exonuclease can specifically process the 3′-end tail of the intermediate Y-structured DNA. To reveal how RNase T binds and processes a Y-structured DNA, we co-crystallized RNase T with a Y-structured DNA and solved the complex crystal structure at a resolution of 1.9 Å (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g003">Figure 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g005">Figure 5</xref>). In the crystal structure, the Y-structured DNA was bound to RNase T in a unique way, different from those of the bulge DNA and the duplex DNA that were bound between the two protomers with one strand of DNA bound to one protomer (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). In contrast, both strands of the Y-structured DNA were bound to a single protomer, one Y-structured DNA bound to protomer A and the other DNA molecule bound to protomer B (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g005">Figure 5</xref>). This unique binding mode can avoid the hindrance produced by Phe29, which might stack with the 5′-end base of the opposite nonscissile strand if the Y-structured DNA was bound in a way similar to that of a duplex DNA. Therefore, in this complex, the opposite nonscissile strand of the Y-structured DNA rotated about 180° to interact with the same protomer of RNase T (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). Several residues, including Gln169, Asp174, Phe175, and Ser177, interacted with the nonscissile strand forming hydrogen bonds with the first and second phosphates in the 5′-overhang region, making it fit snugly onto the molecular surface of RNase T (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s005">Figure S5</xref>).</p>

The schematic diagram in the upper left panel shows the Y-structure DNA with a dotted line indicating the disordered DNA region in the crystal structure (PDB ID code 4KAZ). The left bottom panel shows that the 3′ terminal C in the Y-structured DNA (in blue) did not form hydrogen bonds with Glu73 and did not shift and induce inactive conformational changes in the active site as compared to that of a single-stranded DNA with a 3′-C (PDB ID code 3V9Z, in green).

<p>The 3′ tail of the Y-structured DNA in the crystal structure had a dinucleotide 3′-CC sequence. However, the 3′-CC did not induce the C effect and inhibit the exonuclease activity of RNase T. A close look at the crystal structure of the Y-structured DNA complex showed that the 3′-end C did not interact with Glu73 as it did in the duplex complexes (left panel in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Moreover, the scissile phosphate of the 3′-end C did not shift away from the active site, and as a result, two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions were bound in the active site in an active conformation (right panel in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). Therefore, due to the unique binding mode, the C effect did not occur when RNase T was bound to a Y-structured DNA with a 3′-end CC. In summary, this crystal structure reveals how RNase T binds a Y-structured DNA in a unique way and how it processes the 3′ tail of any sequence close to the duplex region (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s009">Movie S3</xref>).</p>

In digesting duplex DNA with a short 3′ overhang, RNase T processed DNA into a specific length close to the duplex region, generating a final duplex product with a 1-nt 3′ overhang at low concentrations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). ExoX also digested duplex substrates but was less specific, generating various end products with 3′ overhangs of different lengths. On the contrary, ExoI could not digest the duplex substrates at the low concentration (0.02 µM) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). At the high exonuclease concentrations (0.1 and 1 µM), both ExoI and ExoX digested the duplex DNA substrates in the single-stranded and double-stranded regions into small nucleotides. However, RNase T still retained its specificity, only cleaving in the 3′ overhang but not in the duplex region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). These results suggest that RNase T is a highly specific exonuclease that targets the 3′ overhang of structured DNA and produces a precise final product. On the other hand, ExoX is less specific and generates 3′ overhangs of different lengths in digesting duplex substrates with 3′ overhangs, whereas ExoI is specific for single-stranded DNA.</p>

<p>Besides DNA digestion assays, the gel shift assays further showed that RNase T bound with similar affinities to single-stranded DNA, duplex DNA with 4-, 6-, and 10-nucleotide 3′ overhangs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s006">Figure S6</xref>). In contrast, ExoI had lower binding affinity for duplex DNA with short 3′ overhangs, such as 4 and 6 nucleotides, in agreement with its low activity for these substrates. ExoX also preferred to bind to single-stranded DNA, but not duplex DNA with short 3′ overhangs at similar concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001803.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Combining these results of the exonuclease activity and DNA-binding assays, we conclude that RNase T is the ideal exonuclease for trimming the 3′ overhang of structured DNA closely to the duplex region, including Y-structured DNA and duplex DNA, whereas ExoI and ExoX mainly process single-stranded DNA in DNA repair.</p>

<p>Our structural and biochemical data of RNase T show that it can bind and digest bulge/bubble and Y-structured DNA. Moreover, RNase T can work with Endo V, DNA Polymerase I (Klenow fragment exo<sup>−</sup>), and ligase to restore an inosine to cytosine in a heteroduplex DNA molecule <italic>in vitro</italic>. The crystal structures of RNase T bound with a blunt-end bulge DNA further show how RNase T removes the last base pair at the 3′ end by a special Phe-inserting binding mode. All these results suggest that RNase T may function as the downstream exonuclease of Endo V in alternative DNA repair. Taking together these lines of evidence, we suggest that RNase T likely recognizes these bulge and bubble DNA structures generated by Endo V and trims at the 3′ end of the nicked site to remove the last base pair next to the lesion. The single-stranded DNA or damaged DNA is then released for the next step of processing (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g007">Figure 7A</xref>).</p>

<title>Possible roles of RNase T in Endo Vdependent, mismatch, and UV-induced DNA repair.</title>
<p>&amp;lparA)Endo V makes a nick at the 3′ side one base pair away from the damaged sites, including insertion loops and deaminated sites. RNase T further trims the bulge and bubble DNA and removes the last base-paired structure to release the single-stranded DNA insertions or damaged DNA base for the next-step processing. ExoI, ExoX, and RNase T further trim the flapped 3′ overhang, followed by DNA polymerase and ligase activity to complete the repair pathway. (B) In the mismatch DNA repair pathway, a Y-structured DNA is produced after processing by MutS, MutL, and MutH. It is likely that ExoI and ExoX trim the long 3′ tail with the help of SSB and RNase T is responsible for the final trimming of the short 3′ overhang of the Y-structured DNA. (C) In the UV-induced DNA repair by replication restart pathway, the damaged DNA are bound and annealed by RecA and RecFOR. As a result, the Y-structured DNA (in the orange box) is generated that can be further digested by RNase T. (D) The Y-structured DNA can be generated in gap-filling homologous recombination and (E) RecA-dependent homologous recombination. RNase T may remove the short 3′ overhang of these Y-structured DNA in these UV-induced DNA repair pathways.</p>

<p>After removing the 3′-end base-paired nucleotide by RNase T, insertion DNA, hairpin DNA, and deaminated DNA lesions are released as single-stranded DNA. These single-stranded insertion DNA and hairpin DNA are probably further trimmed by the single-strand-specific exonucleases, such as ExoI and/or ExoX, with the help of single strand binding protein (SSB) and helicases. RNase T can further digest the 3′-end short overhang close to the duplex region in a way that we observed in the crystal structure of the Y-structured DNA complex. Deaminated DNA lesions are likely also removed by RNase T since we show that RNase T can digest single-stranded DNA containing oxidized bases and deaminated bases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). It has been shown that the dimeric Exo I from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> shares a sequence homology to RNase T and plays a similar role in digesting damaged DNA with methylated and deaminated bases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Shimada1">[30]</xref>. It is very likely that Exo I from <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> is a functional homologue of RNase T and both of them play key roles in DNA repair. Therefore, after nicking by Endo V, the single-strand-specific exonucleases and structure-specific RNase T likely work together to further trim DNA from the broken end. After this trimming, polymerases and ligases can complete the DNA repair pathway.</p>

<title>RNase T Digests Y-Structured DNA in Various DNA Repair Pathways</title>
<p>RNase T plays crucial roles in various DNA repair pathways, as shown by the sensitivity of the <italic>rnt</italic> knockout strain to a wide range of DNA-damaging agents. The indispensable role of RNase T might be due to its unique specificity for structured DNA that are generated during various DNA repair pathways. For instance, UV radiation can lead to single/double-strand breaks and base modifications, such as cross-linked pyrimidine dimers, photoproducts, and thymine glycols, and as a result, three different UV-induced DNA repair pathways are initiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Rosenstein1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Griffiths1">[63]</xref>. In the first pathway, the base modification induced by UV may stall replication forks. In such a case, RecFOR and RecA bind to the lagging strand template and the invasion-containing leading strand to promote double-strand formation and repair by NER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Michel1">[64]</xref>. During this process, the Y-structured DNA formed on the leading strand requires a structure-specific exonuclease, very likely RNase T, to trim its 3′ overhang (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g007">Figure 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>In the second pathway, UV radiation can induce single-strand breaks that can be repaired by homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Morimatsu1">[65]</xref>. During this process, Y-structured DNA is formed as an intermediate during gap-filling recombination (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). ExoI was reported to promote this RecA-dependent 5′-end strand exchange by digesting the 3′ competitor strand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Bedale1">[66]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Konforti1">[67]</xref>. However, ExoI cannot digest the 3′ overhang close to the duplex region, and thus most likely RNase T is responsible for processing the Y-structured DNA intermediates in the gap-filling recombination pathway.</p>
<p>In the third pathway, the double-strand breaks induced by UV radiation are generally repaired by the RecA-dependent homologous recombination in bacteria <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Cromie1">[68]</xref>. This DNA repair pathway is initiated by RecBCD or RecJ to generate 3′ overhangs and is followed by RecA and RecFOR to promote strand invasion. DNA repair synthesis is then primed by PolI and PolIII from the invaded strand of the D-loop structure. RuvC resolvase cleaves the Holliday junctions that are synthesized after branch migration and LigA seals the nick to complete the homologous recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Morita1">[1]</xref>. In this process, ExoI was reported to affect RecBCD-mediated recombination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Zahradka1">[69]</xref> since the 3′–5′ exonucleases are required to degrade the 3′ tail of the intermediate Y-structured DNA after RecA dissociation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Dermic1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Razavy1">[51]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Persky1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Thoms2">[71]</xref>. Yet ExoI is not an appropriate exonuclease for digesting the 3′ tail near the duplex region. Based on our results, we suggest that most likely RNase T is involved in digesting the 3′ tail close to the duplex region in the UV-induced DNA homologous recombination (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g007">Figure 7E</xref>). Moreover, in comparison with FEN1, which is a flap endonuclease that binds DNA with one 3′-flap nucleotide and cleaves one nucleotide into the double-stranded DNA at the 5′ flap end to produce a ligatable product during DNA replication and repair <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Tsutakawa1">[72]</xref>, RNase T is likely required to produce a DNA with a short 3′ overhang with one or two nucleotides that can be further processed in DNA homologous recombination.</p>
<p>Besides UV-induced DNA repair, RNase T may also participate in other DNA repair processes that require a structure-specific 3′–5′ exonuclease, such as MMR. It has been shown that ExoI and ExoX are essential for methyl-directed mismatch repair in <italic>E. coli</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Burdett1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Thoms1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Cheng1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Marinus1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Feng1">[50]</xref>. These two monomeric exonucleases are responsible for removing the 3′ single-stranded tail in Y-structured DNA during MMR (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001803-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). However, they cannot process the 3′ single-stranded tail close to the double-stranded region <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Morita1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Marinus1">[49]</xref>. ExoI only processes DNA with a long single-stranded region (over 13 nucleotides) in a processive manner, while a SSB stimulates its exonuclease activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Breyer1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Lu1">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Lu2">[74]</xref>. ExoX, however, interacts with MutL during MMR and is not specific for processing Y-structured DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Viswanathan1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Cheng1">[12]</xref>. On the other hand, the RNase T homolog <italic>Thermus thermophilus</italic> ExoI is suggested to excise the 3′ overhang of a Y-structured DNA and plays a role in MMR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001803-Shimada1">[30]</xref>. Therefore, it is very likely that RNase T processes the 3′ tail of the Y-structured DNA in MMR in <italic>E. coli.</italic> Our structure and biochemical assays show that the C effect does not occur when RNase T digests short 3′ overhang of a Y-structured DNA, and hence RNase T is capable of processing any sequence of the 3′ overhang of a Y-structured DNA during MMR. Therefore, we propose here that the monomeric ExoI and ExoX work with a helicase or SSB to process long 3′ tails, while the dimeric RNase T further trims the short 3′ overhang of Y-structured DNA during MMR.</p>
<p>In conclusion, RNase T is a unique structure-specific exonuclease responsible for processing the 3′ ends of structured DNA in various DNA repair pathways. RNase T has an ideal dimeric architecture for binding and processing the 3′ end of various structured DNA in diverse ways, including duplex, bulge/bubble, and Y-structured DNA. Therefore, this intriguing exonuclease has multiple functions not only for processing duplex RNA during RNA maturation, but also processing bubble/bulge and Y-structured DNA during DNA repair. The diverse functions and different specificities of RNase T are closely correlated to its dimerization architecture and various binding modes against different substrates. We provide solid data here showing how the dimeric RNase T processes structured DNA in DNA repair that will serve as a model for understanding the molecular functions of thousands of members of DnaQ-like exonucleases.</p>

<p><bold>The crystal structure of the RNase T in complex with bulge DNA.</bold> (A) The molecular surface of RNase T shows that the 5′ end of the bulge DNA is not hindered by RNase T and can further extend. (B) The 3′ end of the bulge DNA did not form hydrogen bonds with Glu73 (left panel), in contrast to that of single-stranded DNA with a 3′-end C (right panel, PDB ID code 3V9Z). (C) The active site of RNase T-bulge DNA complex reveals two Mg<sup>2+</sup> ions in the active conformation (left panel), and therefore, RNase T can digest a bulge DNA with a 3′-C. On the other hand, the active site of RNase T-ssDNA complex has only one Mg<sup>2+</sup> ion in the inactive conformation, and therefore RNase T cannot digest a ssDNA with a 3′-end C (right panel).</p>
