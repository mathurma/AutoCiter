<title/>
<p>In order to develop into effective researchers, educators, and science professionals, students must internalize basic principles of scientific reasoning and experimental design. Scientific reasoning skills can improve with training <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000578-Bao1">[1]</xref>, but they can be difficult to impart as abstract concepts in the classroom. Here, we discuss the potential for using the game of Mastermind as a tool to help students develop logic skills, design effective experiments, and discuss scientific reasoning in the classroom or lab.</p>
<p>The English code-breaking game known as Bulls and Cows, popularized as the board game Mastermind, has been adapted for applications in fields such as mathematics, computing, and psychology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000578-Knuth1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000578-Goodrich1">[9]</xref>. Mastermind has been proposed as a tool for teaching logic in mathematics courses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000578-Mitchell1">[10]</xref>, but the problem-solving skills emphasized by the game are also relevant to the life sciences. We propose that the game can be used to teach specific lessons and spark discussions about scientific reasoning, covering topics such as sound experimental design, hypothesis-testing, careful interpretation of results, and the effective use of controls.</p>
<p>In certain respects, the game simulates an experimental research project, but it can be played in minutes, at no cost. Advanced language skills, prior scientific training, and lab facilities are not required. See <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000578.s001">Text S1</xref> for a full explanation of the rules of the game. Briefly, the “codemaker” creates a secret code, which the “codebreaker” attempts to discover in as few turns as possible. In the examples provided here, the code is an ordered sequence of four colors, selected from six possible colors: R<sc>ed</sc>, B<sc>lue</sc>, G<sc>reen</sc>, Y<sc>ellow</sc>, O<sc>range</sc>, and P<sc>ink</sc>. The codebreaker takes a guess at the code (i.e., performs an experiment), interprets the feedback provided by the codemaker (i.e., the result of the experiment), and uses this information to design the next experiment. Because winning depends on reducing the 6<sup>4</sup> = 1,296 possible solutions to one in the fewest possible experiments, sound logical reasoning and good experimental design are essential. The game therefore provides a simple, practical framework for the discussion and practice of important scientific skills. It's also fun to play. In this report, we will describe opportunities for lessons and discussions concerning scientific reasoning that often occur during gameplay. We will also present ideas for adapting the game as a classroom or lab exercise.</p>

<p>Based on experiment 1, either R<sc>ed</sc> is in first position and B<sc>lue</sc> is in third or fourth, or B<sc>lue</sc> is in second and R<sc>ed</sc> is in third or fourth.</p>

<title>Five Teachable Moments during Gameplay</title>
<p>The following examples of situations that commonly occur in games of Mastermind, adapted from actual student games, present opportunities for discussions about scientific reasoning and experimental design.</p>
<sec id="s3a">
<title>Lesson 1: Well-controlled experiments allow strong, specific conclusions</title>
<p>In the game shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000578-g002"><bold>Figure 2</bold></xref>, notice how only one color is changed in each successive experiment:</p>
<fig id="pbio-1000578-g002" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g002</object-id><label>Figure 2</label><caption>
<title>A game opening illustrating Lesson 1.</title>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g002" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>Comparing the first two results, we conclude that Y<sc>ellow</sc> is in the code (but not in fourth position) and P<sc>ink</sc> is out, since replacing Y<sc>ellow</sc> with P<sc>ink</sc> resulted in the loss of a white dot. Similarly, comparing result 3 with result 1, we see that G<sc>reen</sc> must be in third position, since removing G<sc>reen</sc> causes the loss of a black dot. We can further deduce that the code contains R<sc>ed</sc> (in second and/or fourth position) or B<sc>lue</sc> (in first and/or fourth position), but not both. Because each experiment serves as a useful comparison for the others, we have reduced the viable hypotheses from 1,296 to 18 in only three tries.</p>
<p>Ask students to list the viable hypotheses and to design a follow-up experiment that will eliminate at least half of the remaining possible solutions.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3b">
<title>Lesson 2: Over-interpretation of data leads to false conclusions</title>
<p>Consider the game shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000578-g003"><bold>Figure 3</bold>:</xref></p>
<fig id="pbio-1000578-g003" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g003</object-id><label>Figure 3</label><caption>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g003" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The codebreaker may conclude, “Changing the G<sc>reens</sc> to Y<sc>ellows</sc> didn't change the result; therefore R<sc>ed</sc> and B<sc>lue</sc> must be in the code, and G<sc>reen</sc> and Y<sc>ellow</sc> are out.” If so, the next result (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000578-g004"><bold>Figure 4</bold></xref>) will be a surprise:</p>
<fig id="pbio-1000578-g004" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g004</object-id><label>Figure 4</label><caption>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g004" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The codebreaker made an unsafe assumption; in fact, the code is <bold>YGYG</bold>. This is an opportunity to point out that <underline>all</underline> reasonable interpretations that are consistent with the data must be considered. Ask students: What <italic>exactly</italic> does that result tell you? What is strictly ruled in or ruled out? Can you now get more information from previous experiments?</p>
</sec><sec id="s3c">
<title>Lesson 3: The value of negative data</title>
<p>Consider the opening move in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000578-g005"><bold>Figure 5</bold>:</xref></p>
<fig id="pbio-1000578-g005" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g005</object-id><label>Figure 5</label><caption>

</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g005" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>A novice codebreaker may say “Bad luck! I struck out.” This presents an opportunity to point out the value of negative results: they are wonderful for invalidating hypotheses. Once students see that 94% of the possible solutions have been eliminated with one experiment, they may appreciate the usefulness of “striking out.” Ask students to find an example of an informative negative result in a research article.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3d">
<title>Lesson 4: Good experimental design saves time in the long run</title>
<p>Compare the following three opening strategies:</p>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000578-g006"><bold>Figure 6</bold></xref> we see a poorly designed, poorly controlled set of experiments. No firm conclusions can be drawn, because too many variables have changed in each experiment. For instance, no colors can be ruled in or out.</p>
<fig id="pbio-1000578-g006" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g006</object-id><label>Figure 6</label><caption>
<title>Opening strategy A, illustrating Lesson 4.</title>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g006" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000578-g007"><bold>Figure 7</bold></xref>, fewer colors are tested per experiment, and no colors have changed position. This allows firm conclusions to be drawn from the results, reducing the number of possible solutions to eight. (The remaining viable hypotheses are GORY, GOYR, GPRY, GPYR, OGRY, OGYR, PGRY, and PGYR.)</p>
<fig id="pbio-1000578-g007" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g007</object-id><label>Figure 7</label><caption>
<title>Opening strategy B, illustrating Lesson 4.</title>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g007" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000578-g008"><bold>Figure 8</bold></xref>, the codebreaker's approach is admirably systematic, but inefficient <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000578-Knuth1">[2]</xref>. Up to five experiments will be needed just to test all of the colors, with nothing learned about position.</p>
<fig id="pbio-1000578-g008" position="float"><object-id pub-id-type="doi">10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g008</object-id><label>Figure 8</label><caption>
<title>Opening strategy C, illustrating Lesson 4.</title>
</caption><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000578.g008" xlink:type="simple"/></fig>
<p>The advantages and disadvantages of different approaches will naturally emerge in discussion among teammates, leading to debates about the best experimental design in a given situation.</p>
</sec><sec id="s3e">
<title>Lesson 5: Rather than seeking to confirm your hypothesis, test it as severely as possible. If a hypothesis is invalid, discard it immediately</title>
<p>We begin each game with 1,296 plausible models, and our goal is to invalidate 1,295 of them as quickly as possible. <italic>Confirmation bias</italic>—favoring one interpretation in the absence of evidence, or in the face of contradictory evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000578-Nickerson1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000578-Fugelsang1">[12]</xref>—leads to unsound assumptions and wasted time and effort. We make no claims about the effectiveness of Mastermind in “correcting” confirmation bias, but the game at least presents opportunities to discuss this important issue, and demonstrates that when evidence contradicts a hypothesis, one must abandon or modify the hypothesis and move forward.</p>
</sec></sec><sec id="s4">
<title>Implementation in the Classroom or Lab</title>
<p>Mastermind can be played at little or no cost on a whiteboard, notebook, or a purchased or improvised game board. Any kind of symbols can be used, including colors, letters, numerals, shapes, or objects such as colored thumbtacks; the Mastermind family of board games uses colored pegs. Colors make the game more visually interesting and may engage visual learners, but using letters or numerals allows the game to be played remotely by web or email, and simplifies assigning specific game problems to students. The Advanced Mastermind board game (made by Pressman Toys in the USA) uses eight colors and a code length of five, but fewer colors and shorter codes can be used on the same board, allowing a wide range of difficulty.</p>
<p>Mastermind is traditionally a two-player game, but we find that it works well as a team exercise, in which students collaborate to break the code. Encourage students to talk through the logic underlying their conclusions, and to debate strategies for the next experiment. In our experience with playing against a mixed class of graduate students and undergraduates, and with casual games in the lab, some students will strongly advocate certain hypotheses, and others will look for flaws in their reasoning. The instructor can comment on students' logic without giving away the code. However, if you disagree with a student's strategy, it can be more instructive to let it fail, rather than shooting it down. Of course, this approach is often impractical with real lab experiments.</p>
<p>We ask those who try Mastermind in science teaching to post comments to this article. We especially encourage new ideas for adapting the game to the classroom or lab, new teachable moments, and evaluations of the game's instructional value.</p>
