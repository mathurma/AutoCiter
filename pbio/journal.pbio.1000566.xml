<p>The coordination of growth within and between organs contributes to the generation of functionally integrated structures and well-proportioned animals and plants. Though these issues have fascinated biologists for centuries, the responsible molecular mechanisms remain largely uncharacterized. In this work, we have used the <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing primordium to show that adjacent cell populations grow and proliferate in a coordinated manner. By reducing growth rates in specific territories within the developing wing, we showed that the tissue responds as a whole and that in adjacent cell populations the growth and cell cycle rates are concomitantly reduced, thus maintaining tissue proportions and normal wing shape. Interestingly, we show that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> tumour suppressor protein dp53 and apoptotic machinery play a key role in coordinating this tissue-wide response. Both growth and proliferation rates are regulated in a coordinated and non-autonomous manner by the activity of dp53, whilst the apoptotic pathway has a specific and non-autonomous role in regulating cell proliferation rates. Our studies describe a novel mechanism for regulating tissue growth in developing organs that may ultimately be relevant for other processes involving coordination of growth, such as tissue renewal, regeneration, and cancer.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>In multicellular organisms, coordination of growth between and within organs contributes to the generation of well-proportioned organs and functionally integrated adults. Although the mechanisms that help to coordinate the growth between different organs start to be unraveled <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Stern1">[1]</xref>, the underlying molecular mechanisms that contribute to generating well-proportioned adult organs remain largely unknown.</p>
<p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, primordia of the adult head, thorax, and terminalia are established in the embryo as imaginal discs, which grow and proliferate within the feeding larva, fuse during metamorphosis, and give rise to the adult animal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Cohen1">[2]</xref>. Even though the size, shape, and pattern of each adult structure are genetically determined in an autonomous manner by each imaginal disc, several humoral mechanisms contribute to coordinating the growth between imaginal discs to generate a well-proportioned adult fly. Insulin-like growth factors (IGF) and Target of Rapamycin (TOR) kinase signaling couples the nutritional status of the animal with the growth of each imaginal disc, and steroid and neuropeptide hormones coordinate the termination of growth with developmental timing (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Edgar1">[3]</xref>). Damage or growth retardation of imaginal tissue induces, through the activity of steroid and neuropeptide hormones, a larval developmental delay to ensure that termination of growth is coordinated among growing tissues and all organs attain a characteristic final size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Stieper1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Halme1">[5]</xref>. Similarly, the activity of IGFs modulates the growth of each imaginal disc to give rise to well-proportioned adult flies, with variable sizes depending on nutritional status (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Hietakangas1">[6]</xref>).</p>
<p>Here we used the wing imaginal disc to first analyze whether adjacent cell populations within an organ grow in a coordinated manner to give rise to a well-proportioned structure and afterwards to determine the molecular mediators involved in this coordination. The wing disc is a mono-layered epithelium that grows about a thousand-fold in mass and cell number during larval development. After metamorphosis, it gives rise to the adult wing, a flat structure with a species-specific shape, size, and pattern. By reducing the growth rates of defined territories within the developing wing primordium and analyzing the non-autonomous response throughout development of the adjacent cell populations, we demonstrate that adjacent cell populations respond as a whole by decreasing their growth and proliferation rates. This non-autonomous response occurs independently of where growth is affected, and it is functional throughout development. We underscore a central and non-autonomous role of <italic>Drosophila</italic> p53 (dp53) and the apoptotic machinery in these processes. While the decrease in growth and proliferation rates are regulated in a coordinated and non-autonomous manner by the activity of dp53, effector caspases have a non-autonomous role in reducing proliferation rates. These new findings indicate the existence of a stress response mechanism involved in buffering local variations in growth in order to maintain the relative contribution of each cell population to the final organ and that tissue size and cell cycle proliferation can be uncoupled and are regulated by two different mechanisms downstream of dp53.</p>

<title>Adjacent Cell Populations Attain a Final Size in a Coordinated Manner</title>
<p>In order to address whether adjacent cell populations grow and acquire a final size in a coordinated manner, we quantified the size and shape of adult wings when tissue growth was reduced in defined territories of the developing wing. Growth, defined as accumulation of cell mass, can be modulated by changing the biosynthetic capacity of cells (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Grewal1">[7]</xref>). In <italic>Drosophila</italic> larvae, starvation of dietary nutrients leads to smaller adult flies. Starvation modulates tissue size by reducing insulin/TOR signaling, which leads to the inhibition of ribosome synthesis, a decrease in nucleolar size, and a reduction in protein synthesis capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Grewal1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Hall1">[8]</xref>. Thus, a set of genes with well-known growth inhibitory functions in ribosome function, protein biosynthesis, or insulin signaling were expressed with the Gal4/UAS system in specific territories of the developing wing primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). A cold-sensitive version of the Ricin toxin A chain (Ricin<sup>cs</sup>), a protein toxin that belongs to the ribosome inactivating proteins that binds and reduces the translational activity of 28S rRNA and thus protein synthesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Stirpe1">[9]</xref>, was used to impair growth, as its activity can be easily modulated in time by changes in temperature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Moffat1">[10]</xref>. 4E-BP is an important repressor of translation levels and can be inactivated by the protein kinase TOR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Hay1">[11]</xref>. 4E-BP binds eIF4E and impairs the recruitment of the 40S ribosomal subunit to the cap structure present at the 5′-end of all eukaryotic cellular mRNAs. To reduce elF4E activity and impair growth, we used a constitutively active form of 4E-BP (4EBP<sup>AA</sup>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Teleman1">[12]</xref>) that cannot be phosphorylated by TOR. Finally, the activity of the insulin/TOR pathway was reduced by expression of the tumor suppressor gene PTEN, a conserved negative regulator of the pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Goberdhan1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Huang1">[14]</xref>. A collection of Gal4 drivers expressed in distinct domains of the developing wing primordium was used to induce the expression of Ricin<sup>cs</sup>, PTEN, and 4EBP<sup>AA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figures 1B, C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s001">S1</xref>). Larvae containing the <italic>Gal4</italic> driver and the <italic>UAS-Ricin<sup>cs</sup></italic> transgene were initially grown at 18°C (restrictive temperature) until early second instar and then switched to 29°C (permissive temperature) until eclosion of the resulting adult flies. Expression of PTEN and 4EBP<sup>AA</sup> was achieved by growing the larvae at 25°C. Larvae expressing an <italic>UAS-GFP</italic> transgene and the corresponding <italic>Gal4</italic> driver were subjected to the same temperature schemes and used as controls. Expression of Ricin<sup>cs</sup>, 4EBP<sup>AA</sup>, or PTEN caused a clear reduction in total wing area in all the genotypes analyzed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figures 1B, C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s006">Table S1</xref>). Interestingly, these wings conserved normal shape, proportions, and vein patterning. The maintenance of shape and wing proportions suggests that the size of the neighboring cell populations not expressing the transgene is reduced in a non-autonomous manner. In order to quantify these non-autonomous effects, we focused our attention on those Gal4 drivers expressed either in the anterior (A, <italic>ci-Gal4</italic>, <italic>ptc-Gal4</italic>, and <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic>) or posterior (P, <italic>en-Gal4</italic>, and <italic>hh-Gal4</italic>) compartments, cell populations that do not mix and give rise to defined structures of the adult wing (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-GarcaBellido1">[15]</xref>, e.g. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Both compartments, the one expressing the growth-reducing transgene and the adjacent one, decreased in size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s001">S1</xref>). A size reduction of 11%–14% was observed in the A compartment when Ricin<sup>cs</sup>, 4EBP<sup>AA</sup>, or PTEN were expressed in P cells with the <italic>en-gal4</italic> driver (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−3</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s007">Table S2</xref>). A similar reduction was detected in the P compartment (14%–32%) when these transgenes were expressed in A cells with the <italic>ci-Gal4</italic> driver (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−2</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s007">Table S2</xref>). Similar results were obtained with <italic>hh-Gal4</italic>, <italic>ptc-Gal4</italic>, and <italic>dpp-Gal4</italic> drivers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The observed non-autonomous effects in tissue size are most likely a local response to a signal coming from the growth-depleted territory rather than a more general response of the whole larvae induced by the insult to the imaginal cells, since expression of PTEN with a Gal4 driver expressed in the developing wing but not in other tissues (<italic>spalt<sup>PE</sup>-gal4,</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Barrio1">[16]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1G</xref>) gave rise to smaller wings (82.3%±2.1%; <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−9</sup>) without a large impact on the overall size of the animal, as visualized by quantification of adult weights (103%±8%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.02) and pupal lengths (101%±4%; <italic>p</italic> = 0.08) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1G–I</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s006">Table S1</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Stieper1">[4]</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) Drosophila insulin-like peptides (DILPs) bind to the Insulin Receptor (dInR) and induce tissue growth by increasing the protein biosynthetic capacity of the cells. Three proteins, with well-known growth inhibitory functions in insulin signaling (PTEN) or protein biosynthesis (Ricin<sup>cs</sup>, a cold sensitive version of Ricin-A, and 4E-BP<sup>AA</sup>, an activated form of 4E-BP), were expressed with the Gal4/UAS system in specific territories of the developing wing disc. (B, C) Cuticle preparations of adult wings expressing GFP, Ricin<sup>cs</sup>, 4E-BP<sup>AA</sup>, or PTEN under the control of a range of Gal4 drivers. The reduction in wing size caused by Ricin<sup>cs</sup>, 4E-BP<sup>AA</sup>, or PTEN expression when compared to GFP-expressing wings is shown. Expression domains of Gal4 drivers are shown in wing discs expressing the <italic>UAS-lacZ</italic> transgene and stained for β-Galactosidase activity (blue, A) or depicted in blue (C). Localized transgene expression induced a significant reduction in adult wing size when compared to GFP-expressing wings raised in the same conditions (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s006">Table S1</xref>). (D) Time-lapse experiments showing the coordinated reduction of tissue size throughout development. Animals expressing GFP or Ricin<sup>cs</sup> in the <italic>ci-gal4</italic>-expressing domain (A compartment) were transferred to 29°C at different developmental time points until adult eclosion. Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression induced a coordinated reduction in tissue size in both A (blue) and P (gray) compartments. The areas of the A and P compartments were significantly reduced when compared to GFP control wings raised at 29°C (<italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−4</sup>; see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s009">Table S4</xref>).

Error bars indicate standard deviation. The horizontal line shows the size or cell density values of the normalized control GFP-expressing wings. Areas were significantly reduced in the transgene-expressing and non-expressing domains (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s007">Table S2</xref>). Cell densities were significantly increased in those bars labeled by one or two asterisks (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s008">Table S3</xref>, * <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05 and ** <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01).

<p>We next took advantage of the temperature sensitivity of the <italic>Ricin<sup>cs</sup></italic> transgene to conduct time-lapse experiments. Larvae expressing Ricin<sup>cs</sup> in the A compartment with the <italic>ci-gal4</italic> driver were initially grown at 18°C and switched to 29°C at different developmental stages until adult eclosion. The size of the resulting adult wings was measured. The reduction in size of the nearby P compartment ranged from 5% to 32% depending on when larvae were switched to the restrictive temperature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figures 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s001">S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s009">Table S4</xref>). Longer exposure to Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression gave rise to the strongest phenotypes, thereby suggesting that the non-autonomous effects are operative throughout development (see below). We also noted that the non-autonomous reduction in size of the P compartment was proportional to the reduction in size of the A compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>The non-autonomous reduction in tissue size could be a consequence of reduced cell growth, reduced cell number, or both. To address this issue, we quantified cell densities in the adult wing by counting the number of hairs (each cell differentiates a hair) in a defined area in the two compartments. Cell densities were slightly increased to various degrees in the transgene-expressing compartment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figures 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s001">S1</xref>). The increase in cell densities ranged from 1.7% to 19%, depending on the Gal4 driver and the UAS-transgene used (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s008">Table S3</xref>). In the non-expressing transgene compartment, a significant increase in cell densities was observed mainly in those wing discs with the highest reduction in tissue size (<italic>ci-gal4; UAS-Ricin<sup>cs</sup></italic>, 111.6%±2.2%; <italic>p</italic>&lt;10<sup>−13</sup>). Thus, changes in cell size contributed in a smaller extent to the non-autonomous reduction in tissue size and mainly in those situations where this reduction was above a certain threshold.</p>

<title>Targeted Depletion of Growth Induces a Non-Autonomous Reduction in Growth and Proliferation Rates in Adjacent Cell Populations</title>
<p>The results presented so far indicate that growth depletion in defined territories of the wing induces a non-autonomous reduction in tissue size in nearby territories. In order to gain insight into whether this non-autonomous response is an active mechanism that takes place throughout development, we monitored the size of the A and P compartments throughout development after targeted expression of Ricin<sup>cs</sup> in P cells. Larvae expressing Ricin<sup>cs</sup> or GFP in the P compartment (with the <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driver) were grown at 18°C and switched to 30°C from early second instar to late third instar stages. The size ratio between the transgene-expressing (P) and non-expressing (A) compartment was first quantified at a range of time points after induction of Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression. The P/A ratio was roughly maintained throughout the induction period in GFP-expressing wing discs (blue dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing discs, this ratio was smaller in the first 48 h after transgene expression but reached a similar value in mature wing discs (red dots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Martin1">[17]</xref>). These results suggest that during development the Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing P compartment was relatively smaller than the nearby compartment, but both compartments reached a similar size ratio to that observed in control wing discs at the end of larval development. We next quantified and compared the absolute size of both compartments in GFP- and Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing wing discs. Interestingly, not only was the Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing P compartment already smaller 24 h after transgene expression, but also the adjacent A compartment showed a decrease in size when compared to GFP control wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). As observed in adult wings, the A and P compartments of Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing mature wing discs were smaller than those of control GFP-expressing wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), even though the Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing animals extended their larval period for about 24 h before entering metamorphosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>

<p>We next induced neutral clones of cells at the beginning of the Ricin<sup>cs</sup> induction period (early second instar) and examined the size of these clones 72 and 96 h later in third instar wing discs. The size of the clones in the A compartment was measured in <italic>en-gal4; UAS-Ricin<sup>cs</sup></italic> wing discs and was compared to the size of control clones induced in the A compartment of <italic>en-gal4; UAS-GFP</italic> wing discs subjected to the same temperature schemes. In Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing wing discs, the size of the clones visualized 72 or 96 h after clone induction was, respectively, one-half or two-thirds smaller than the size of clones quantified in GFP-expressing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). All together, the results presented so far indicate that growth rates are non-autonomously reduced when growth is depleted in defined territories of the developing wing.</p>
<p>In order to gain insight into whether cell proliferation rates are also regulated in a non-autonomous manner, we analyzed cell cycle progression in developing wing primordia exposed to transgene expression. Larvae expressing Ricin<sup>cs</sup> in the P compartment (with the <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driver) were grown at 30°C from early second (48 h AEL) to mid-late third instar stages (96 h AEL) and the expression of markers for each cell cycle stage was then analyzed. Larvae expressing GFP in the P compartment were subjected to the same temperature schemes and used as controls. S phase progression was first monitored. Imaginal discs were exposed to BrdU for 45 min, and its incorporation was subsequently analyzed. BrdU incorporation was strongly reduced in the adjacent A compartment, while it was not significantly affected in the Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2D, E</xref>). Similar non-autonomous effects in BrdU incorporation were observed by expression of PTEN or 4E-BP<sup>AA</sup> in the A or P compartment (with the <italic>en-Gal4</italic> and <italic>ci-Gal4</italic> drivers, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2N–P</xref>). Consistent with the observation that the non-autonomous effects in tissue size were not exclusive to the A and P compartments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1</xref>), a non-autonomous reduction in BrdU incorporation levels was also observed when driving expression of Ricin<sup>cs</sup> in other domains in the wing primordium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figures 2M</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s002">S2</xref>). Similarly, the non-autonomous reduction in BrdU incorporation were also observed at earlier stages of wing development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2Q</xref>), thereby indicating that the non-autonomous effects in proliferation rates were operative throughout development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). The observed non-autonomous effects in BrdU incorporation are most likely a local response to a signal coming from the growth-depleted territory rather than a more general response of the whole larvae, since targeted expression of Ricin<sup>cs</sup> with the <italic>ap-Gal4</italic> driver, which is expressed in the dorsal compartment of the developing wing, caused a non-autonomous reduction in BrdU incorporation in wing cells while other imaginal tissues not expressing the transgene (e.g. eye) or expressing it late in development (e.g. leg) incorporated BrdU at normal levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2R, S</xref>).</p>
<p>Next, using in situ hybridization, we monitored the expression levels of <italic>cyclin E</italic> (<italic>cycE</italic>) and <italic>string</italic> (<italic>stg,</italic> the <italic>Drosophila cdc25</italic> homolog), two genes that act in wing disc cells as rate-limiting factors of G1/S and G2/M transitions, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Edgar2">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Milan1">[20]</xref>. Consistent with the non-autonomous reduction in BrdU incorporation levels, <italic>cycE</italic> mRNA levels were reduced in the A compartment of wing discs expressing Ricin<sup>cs</sup> in P cells (with the <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driver, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2F, G</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>stg</italic> mRNA levels were also reduced in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2H, I</xref>), suggesting that the G2/M transition was also compromised or delayed in a non-autonomous manner. Consistent with this view, mitotic activity, monitored with an antibody against a phosphorylated form of histone H3 at serine 10 (PH3) that labels mitotic figures, was reduced in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2J, K</xref>). The number of PH3-positive cells observed in the A compartment of <italic>Ricin<sup>cs</sup></italic>-expressing wing discs decreased by 50% compared to GFP-expressing discs (<italic>p</italic> = 0.02, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2L</xref>), whereas a similar number of PH3-positive cells was observed in the P compartment of both genotypes (<italic>p</italic> = 0.6, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2L</xref>). Although we noted a slight increase in <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>cycE</italic> mRNA levels in cells expressing Ricin<sup>cs</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2G, I</xref>), no detectable changes in mitotic activity or BrdU incorporation were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2E, J, L</xref>).</p>
<p>The non-autonomous reduction in mitotic activity, BrdU incorporation, and <italic>cycE</italic> and <italic>stg</italic> mRNA levels observed suggest that a general reduction in proliferation rates, without any obvious arrest in any particular cell cycle stage, is non-autonomously induced when growth is impaired in a defined territory of the developing wing. In order to confirm this hypothesis, we used a fluorescence-associated cell sorter (FACS) to collect data about the cellular DNA content of dissociated cells from 96 h AEL wing discs and analyzed the cell cycle profile of these cells. A forward scatter (FSC) analysis was also carried out to compare cell sizes. Cell cycle profiles and cell sizes of A cells dissociated from wing discs expressing Ricin<sup>cs</sup> and GFP or GFP alone (with the <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driver) in the P compartment were very similar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Comparable results were obtained with the <italic>ci-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s002">Figure S2</xref>). All together these data indicate that upon growth depletion in defined territories of the wing primordium, the adjacent cell populations reduced their growth and proliferation rates, giving rise to smaller structures with a smaller number of cells. The slight non-autonomous reduction in cell size contributes to a small extent to the non-autonomous reduction in adult tissue size (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g001">Figure 1E, F</xref>) and is most probably occurring during post-larval stages, since no major change in cell size was observed in imaginal tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>We noticed that the levels of BrdU incorporation, <italic>stg</italic> and <italic>cycE</italic> expression, and mitotic activity were largely unaffected in the transgene-expressing compartment when compared to GFP control wing discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2</xref>). This might reflect a process of compensatory proliferation due to the large number of cells being lost by cell death (see below) or by other means.</p>

<title>A Non-Autonomous Role of Effector Caspases in Regulating Proliferation Rates</title>
<p>In mammalian cells, inhibition of the insulin/TOR pathway or inhibition of protein biosynthesis increases the activity of the tumor suppressor gene p53 (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Mayo1">[21]</xref>) and induces the activation of the apoptotic machinery that breaks down cells in a highly controlled fashion by the action of caspases, a specialized class of cysteine proteases. Non-apoptotic functions of activated caspases have been previously described, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrate caspases have been reported to regulate cell proliferation in various ways (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Fan1">[22]</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Li1">[23]</xref>). Thus, we first monitored the contribution of the apoptotic machinery to the non-autonomous regulation of tissue growth and cell proliferation rates observed in developing wing discs and resulting adult wings.</p>
<p>We performed a TUNEL assay to label DNA strand breaks induced by apoptotic cell death. A clear increase in TUNEL-positive cells was observed in those territories expressing <italic>Ricin<sup>cs</sup></italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3A, B</xref>), PTEN, or 4E-BP<sup>AA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3D, E</xref>) as well as in adjacent cells. We next used an antibody against the activated form of human Caspase 3, a marker of Caspase-9-like Dronc activity in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Fan2">[24]</xref>. We observed increased levels of Dronc activity in those territories expressing the transgene as well as in adjacent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3C</xref> and unpublished data). The increase in TUNEL-positive cells and Dronc activity raises the question of whether apoptosis participates in the non-autonomous response observed in developing wing primordia and adult wings. Caspase activities are regulated by inhibitor-of-apoptosis proteins (IAPs), and in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, DIAP1 binds and inhibits Dronc and the effector caspases DrICE and Dcp-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3Q</xref>, reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Xu1">[25]</xref>). The <italic>Drosophila</italic> pro-apoptotic genes <italic>hid</italic>, <italic>grim</italic>, and <italic>reaper</italic> bind and repress DIAP1, thus alleviating repression of initiator and effector caspases. In order to analyze the contribution of caspases to the non-autonomous effects in proliferation rates, we tested the requirement of various elements of the genetic cascade that drives apoptosis in <italic>Drosophila</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3Q</xref>). When apoptosis was reduced in the whole tissue by halving the dose of <italic>hid</italic>, <italic>grim</italic>, and <italic>reaper</italic> (in <italic>Df(H99)/+</italic> wing discs) or by depleting <italic>dronc</italic> expression (in <italic>dronc<sup>l29</sup></italic> wing discs), a clear reduction in TUNEL-positive cells was observed upon Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3B</xref> with 3H, I). Interestingly, the non-autonomous reduction in BrdU incorporation levels caused by Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression was largely rescued in these discs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3M, N</xref> and compare with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). We then expressed <italic>DIAP1</italic> and <italic>p35</italic> in the same domain as Ricin<sup>cs</sup> to analyze whether caspase activation is required in the growth-depleted territory or in the neighboring cell populations. DIAP1 represses both DrIcE and Dronc, while the baculovirus protein p35 specifically represses effector caspases DrIce and Dcp-1 and maintains fully active Dronc (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Xu1">[25]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3Q</xref>). Expression of either DIAP1 or p35 in the same domain as Ricin<sup>cs</sup> caused a clear autonomous reduction in the number of TUNEL-positive cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3J</xref> and unpublished data) as well as a clear non-autonomous rescue of BrdU incorporation levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3O</xref> and unpublished data). A similar non-autonomous rescue in the expression levels of <italic>cycE</italic> and <italic>string</italic> mRNA and in the number of mitotic figures was observed upon p35 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3K, L, P</xref>). Similar results were obtained when PTEN or 4E-BP<sup>AA</sup> were co-expressed with p35 in different domains of the wing disc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3F, G</xref>). We then used FACS and FSC analysis to characterize the cell cycle profile and the size of A cells upon expression of Ricin<sup>cs</sup> and GFP, or Ricin<sup>cs</sup> and p35 in the P compartment (with the <italic>en-Gal4</italic> driver, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Similar cell cycle profiles and cell sizes were obtained in both genotypes. Comparable results were obtained with the <italic>ci-Gal4</italic> driver (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The capacity of p35 expression to rescue the non-autonomous reduction in BrdU, <italic>string</italic>, and <italic>cycE</italic> levels and in mitotic activity caused by <italic>Ricin<sup>cs</sup></italic> expression, even though Dronc is fully active under these conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Xu1">[25]</xref>, suggests that effector caspases, such as DrIce and Dcp-1, are required in the growth-depleted territory to induce a non-autonomous reduction in cell proliferation rates in the nearby cell populations.</p>
<p>We next analyzed the resulting adult wings when the activity or expression of various elements of the apoptotic machinery was depleted in Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing larvae. The autonomous reduction in tissue size was not rescued and the cell densities were either unaffected or increased when apoptosis was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3R, S</xref>), thereby suggesting that effector caspases do not play a major role in the autonomous reduction in tissue size caused by Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression. Surprisingly, the non-autonomous reduction in tissue size was not rescued either (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3R</xref>). Nevertheless, and consistent with the role of effector caspases in regulating cell proliferation rates in nearby territories, cell densities were significantly increased in these territories in all the genetic backgrounds tested (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g003">Figure 3S</xref>). The non-autonomous reduction in cell size is most probably occurring during post-larval stages, since no major change in cell size was observed in imaginal tissues (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s002">Figure S2</xref>). These results imply that growth and proliferation rates are independently regulated and that the decrease in cell proliferation rates does not play a major role in the observed reduction in tissue size. While effector caspases are required in the growth-depleted territory to induce a non-autonomous reduction in cell proliferation rates in the nearby cell populations, the non-autonomous reduction in tissue size relies on a caspase-independent mechanism.</p>

<title>A Non-Autonomous Role of dp53 in Regulating Growth and Proliferation Rates</title>
<p>The transcription factor and tumor suppressor p53, a short-lived, non-abundant protein in healthy cells, plays a major role in regulating the response of mammalian cells to stress, in part through the transcriptional activation of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle regulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Levine1">[26]</xref>.

We did not find any evidence of increased <italic>dp53</italic> mRNA levels in the transgene-expressing cells (unpublished data), thus suggesting that the activation of dp53 is post-transcriptional. The increase in the number of TUNEL-positive cells caused by expression of Ricin<sup>cs</sup> was largely rescued by reducing the activity of dp53 in the whole wing disc (in <italic>dp53<sup>ns</sup></italic> mutant larvae) or in the transgene-expressing domain (co-expressing dp53<sup>DN</sup> or dp53<sup>dsRNA</sup>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g004">Figure 4E–H</xref>). Most interestingly, the effects of Ricin<sup>cs</sup> on the levels of BrdU incorporation and on the number of mitotic PH3-positive cells were also largely rescued by dp53 depletion (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g004">Figure 4I–M</xref>). These results indicate that dp53 and the effector caspases are required in the growth-depleted territory to non-autonomously reduce the proliferation rates in neighboring cell populations.</p>

<p>We next analyzed the resulting adult wings when the activity or expression of <italic>dp53</italic> was depleted in the domains expressing Ricin<sup>cs</sup>. Consistent with the observation that the apoptotic machinery and effector caspases do not play a major role in the autonomous reduction in tissue size caused by expression of these transgenes, the autonomous reduction in tissue size was still observed and the cell densities were either unaffected or increased when <italic>dp53</italic> activity was reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). However, and in contrast to the apoptotic machinery and the effector caspases, dp53 exerts a fundamental role in the non-autonomous regulation of tissue size. The non-autonomous reduction in tissue and cell size caused by Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression was either weaker or not observed when dp53 activity was depleted in the transgene-expressing domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g005">Figure 5A</xref>), and the resulting adult wings were not well-proportioned and exhibited a clear asymmetric shape with respect to the AP boundary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In other words, in a situation of reduced dp53 activity in the Ricin<sup>cs</sup>-expressing compartment, the neighboring compartment exhibited a size nearly identical to the one observed in GFP control wings. These results indicate that, upon growth depletion, dp53 exerts a fundamental and non-autonomous role in reducing the size of the adjacent cell populations. In order to address whether growth rates are also regulated in a non-autonomous manner by the activity of dp53, we induced neutral clones of cells at the beginning of the Ricin<sup>cs</sup> induction period (early second instar) and examined, 72 h and 96 h later, the size of clones located in the A compartment of wing discs expressing GFP, or Ricin<sup>cs</sup> and GFP, or Ricin<sup>cs</sup> and dp53<sup>dsRNA</sup> in the P compartment (with the <italic>en-gal4</italic> driver, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g004">Figure 4N</xref>). Interestingly, the non-autonomous reduction in clone size caused by Ricin<sup>cs</sup> expression was largely rescued by co-expression of dp53<sup>dsRNA</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g004">Figure 4N</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing primordium increases about a thousand-fold in cell mass and cell number during larval development. Even though molecules of the Wnt, TGF-β, and Hedgehog families are well known to organize tissue growth and patterning of this primordium and to play a fundamental role in the generation of an adult wing with a species-specific size, shape, and patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Affolter1">[31]</xref>, the molecular mechanisms that contribute to buffering local variations in tissue growth caused by different types of stress and help to generate well-proportioned adult wings under these circumstances remain largely unknown. Here we underscore a new role of <italic>dp53</italic> and the apoptotic machinery in these processes. Depletion of the insulin pathway or the protein biosynthetic machinery in defined territories of the developing wing primordium induces an autonomous reduction in growth rates as well as a non-autonomous decrease of growth and cell proliferation rates in the adjacent cell populations. This non-autonomous response occurs independently of where growth is affected and is functional throughout development. We present evidence that targeted depletion of the insulin pathway or the protein biosynthetic machinery induces the activation of dp53 and consequently the apoptotic machinery. While growth and proliferation rates are regulated in a coordinated and non-autonomous manner by the activity of dp53, effector caspases have a unique role, downstream of dp53, in reducing proliferation rates in adjacent cell populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000566-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Thus, tissue growth and proliferation rates can be uncoupled and are regulated by two different mechanisms downstream of dp53. These new findings underscore a new role of dp53 and effector caspases in buffering local variations in tissue growth and in maintaining the relative proportions of distinct cell populations within a tissue to give rise to a functional adult structure.</p>
<p>Independent lines of evidence support the view that adjacent cell populations are able to buffer local variations in tissue growth caused by different means, and not only when the activities of the insulin pathway or the protein biosynthetic machinery are compromised. The halteres and wings of <italic>Drosophila</italic> are homologous thoracic appendages, which share common positional information provided by signaling pathways. The activity in the haltere discs of the <italic>Ultrabithorax</italic> (<italic>Ubx</italic>) <italic>Hox</italic> gene establishes the differences between these structures, their different size being an obvious one (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Maeda1">[32]</xref>). In <italic>Contrabithorax</italic> mutant wings in which one compartment is reduced in size due to the transformation to haltere by the ectopic expression of Ubx, the adjacent compartment adjusts its final size and results in a smaller wing territory <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-GonzalezGaitan1">[33]</xref>. Similar non-autonomous effects in tissue size were observed when inducing clones of cells with reduced EGF-Receptor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-GarcaBellido2">[34]</xref>, upon depletion of the <italic>dMyc</italic> proto-oncogene or over-expression of the <italic>hippo</italic> tumor-suppressor gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that in other situations in which growth is being challenged, the tissue might not respond as a whole. In these situations, we speculate that dp53 is inactive or not activated. We would like also to point out that the dp53 dependent mechanism described in this work might be functional to buffer local and slight variations in growth rates. Above a certain threshold in the reduction of tissue size, this mechanism might not be sufficient to generate well-proportioned organs.</p>
<p>In vertebrates and invertebrates, p53 and caspase-dependent cell death also play a fundamental role in regeneration (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Schoppy1">[35]</xref>) as well as in response to stress or tissue damage, whereby the damaged tissue undergoes extra cell proliferation to compensate for cell loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Li1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Chera1">[36]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-PerezGarijo1">[38]</xref>. Upon tissue damage in <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, a feedback loop mediated by dp53 and the initiator caspase Dronc is required in undifferentiated dying cells to induce cell proliferation in surrounding cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Wells1">[30]</xref>. A specific role of effector caspases has been described in differentiated neurons to induce, upon tissue damage, cell proliferation in surrounding cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Fan3">[39]</xref>. These non-autonomous effects are mediated by the ectopic activation of signaling molecules of the Wnt, TGF-β, and Hedgehog families. In contrast, we did not find any clear change in the expression of Wnt, TGF-β, or Hedgehog in the growth-depleted territory or in the activity of their signaling pathways in adjacent cell populations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000566.s004">Figure S4</xref> and unpublished data). Also, while dp53 and caspases have a role in inducing cell proliferation within the damaged tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Wells1">[30]</xref>, our data indicate that the same molecules reduce growth and proliferation rates in adjacent unaffected cell populations. These observations suggest that different types of signaling molecules induced or activated by dp53 and caspases exert different effects in the damaged tissue and in nearby ones. It is interesting to note in this context that effector caspases have been recently shown to promote wound healing and tissue regeneration in mice by mediating the cleavage of iPLA2 (Calcium-independent Phospholipase A2) to trigger the production of the growth signal Prostaglandin E2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Li1">[23]</xref>. Whether the non-autonomous reduction in cell proliferation rates is due to the caspase-dependent cleavage and activation of specific signaling molecules or whether dying cells release a variety of signaling molecules as a consequence of cell demolition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Zitvogel1">[40]</xref> that could have a general role in the reduction of cell proliferation rates remains to be solved. Similarly, the signaling molecules that mediate the non-autonomous role of dp53 in regulating tissue growth remain to be identified.</p>
<p>Finally, we would like to highlight the central role of p53 in tissue homeostasis and stress response. While the role of p53 in regulating the response of mammalian cells to stress through the transcriptional activation of genes involved in apoptosis and cell cycle arrest is cell-autonomous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000566-Junttila1">[41]</xref>, we speculate that the non-autonomous role of dp53 defined in this study also makes a major contribution to stress response and tissue homeostasis. Upon tissue damage, neighboring populations of healthy cells might reduce their growth and proliferation rates until damaged cells have been recovered. The combined autonomous and non-autonomous activities of p53 might be fundamental in tissue homeostasis.</p>
