      <abstract>
        <p>A key challenge in genetics is identifying the functional roles of genes in pathways. Numerous functional genomics techniques (e.g. machine learning) that predict protein function have been developed to address this question. These methods generally build from existing annotations of genes to pathways and thus are often unable to identify additional genes participating in processes that are not already well studied. Many of these processes are well studied in <italic>some</italic> organism, but not necessarily in an investigator's organism of interest. Sequence-based search methods (e.g. BLAST) have been used to transfer such annotation information between organisms. We demonstrate that functional genomics can complement traditional sequence similarity to improve the transfer of gene annotations between organisms. Our method transfers annotations only when functionally appropriate as determined by genomic data and can be used with any prediction algorithm to combine transferred gene function knowledge with organism-specific high-throughput data to enable accurate function prediction.</p>
        <p>We show that diverse state-of-art machine learning algorithms leveraging functional knowledge transfer (FKT) dramatically improve their accuracy in predicting gene-pathway membership, particularly for processes with little experimental knowledge in an organism. We also show that our method compares favorably to annotation transfer by sequence similarity. Next, we deploy FKT with state-of-the-art SVM classifier to predict novel genes to 11,000 biological processes across six diverse organisms and expand the coverage of accurate function predictions to processes that are often ignored because of a dearth of annotated genes in an organism. Finally, we perform <italic>in vivo</italic> experimental investigation in <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and confirm the regulatory role of our top predicted novel gene, <italic>wnt5b</italic>, in leftward cell migration during heart development. FKT is immediately applicable to many bioinformatics techniques and will help biologists systematically integrate prior knowledge from diverse systems to direct targeted experiments in their organism of study.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Due to technical and ethical challenges many human diseases or biological processes are studied in model organisms. Discoveries in these organisms are then transferred back to human or other model organisms. Traditional methods for transferring novel gene function annotations have relied on finding genes with high sequence similarity believed to share evolutionary ancestry. However, sequence similarity does not guarantee a shared functional role in molecular pathways. In this study, we show that functional genomics can complement traditional sequence similarity measures to improve the transfer of gene annotations between organisms. We coupled our knowledge transfer method with current state-of-the-art machine learning algorithms and predicted gene function for 11,000 biological processes across six organisms. We experimentally validated our prediction of <italic>wnt5b</italic>'s involvement in the determination of left-right heart asymmetry in zebrafish. Our results show that functional knowledge transfer can improve the coverage and accuracy of machine learning methods used for gene function prediction in a diverse set of organisms. Such an approach can be applied to additional organisms, and will be especially beneficial in organisms that have high-throughput genomic data with sparse annotations.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Defining the role of proteins in pathways is among the key challenges of human genomics. Many successful approaches have been developed for prediction of protein function and pathway membership <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Guan1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Kim1">[6]</xref>, however they rely on prior knowledge in the organism of interest to make new predictions (i.e. at least some genes in the organism already annotated to the pathway) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-PenaCastillo1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Greene1">[11]</xref>. These approaches rely on identifying characteristic behavioral patterns, in functional genomic datasets, phylogenetic profiles, or genomic feature studies of genes that are known to participate in a pathway, then use these patterns to predict additional pathway members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Hughes1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Jensen1">[14]</xref>. For example, gene expression and protein interaction profiles can be used by machine learning methods to associate novel genes to pathways based on previously known pathway members <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Barutcuoglu1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Vazquez1">[16]</xref>. The potential of such computational approaches to direct experiments has been demonstrated in studies investigating mitochondrial biogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Hess1">[17]</xref> and seed pigmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Lee1">[18]</xref>. Other common exploratory methods, such as hierarchical clustering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Eisen1">[19]</xref>, don't directly use known gene annotations to learn a prediction classifier, however they often use existing annotations to interpret the resulting cluster of genes (e.g. gene enrichment analysis) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Subramanian1">[20]</xref>. However in many organisms including human, pathways and processes where functional annotations of genes are most needed often have few or no prior experimentally confirmed annotations, making novel predictions of genes that may participate in such a process difficult or impossible. Thus, our study describes a method to robustly increase the set of prior gene annotations, which has the potential to improve all function prediction methods by increasing the accuracy of their predictions and enabling wider coverage of pathways and biological processes.</p>
      <p>Many of these processes are well studied in <italic>some</italic> model organism, but not necessarily in an investigator's organism of interest. Even when applying a conservative examination of only the closely related and heavily studied mammalian species human, mouse, and rat, processes represented in one species are often not well-characterized in another (summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g001">Figure 1</xref> and a full list of processes available in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002957.s005">Text S1</xref>). For example, the process <italic>cellular glucose homeostasis</italic>, an increasingly important process due to the role of cellular metabolism in cancer development, has less than 5 gene annotations in human, yet has 31 in mouse, a commonly used model organism for cancer studies. These processes (referred to in the text as <italic>understudied processes</italic>) are not well studied in a particular organism of interest (i.e. very few genes are annotated) but might be well characterized in some other organism.</p>

          <p>Each node represents the number of experimentally annotated biological processes in an organism. Each edge value corresponds to the number of experimentally annotated processes in the source organism that lack any experimental annotations in the target organism. Thus, the directed edges between nodes indicate the direction of potential annotation transfer between organisms. For example, 3,245 processes with annotations in mouse have no experimentally annotated genes in rat.</p>

      <p>A longstanding solution to improving the prediction accuracy of understudied processes has been to transfer functional annotations from organisms where the process is better characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Eisen2">[21]</xref>. The critical challenge in accurately transferring functional knowledge between organisms is identifying the appropriate genes for the transfer: those genes that share not only sequence similarity, but also conserved pathway roles. Large-scale automated methods have so far exclusively used sequence homology to identify functionally conserved genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Li1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-OBrien1">[23]</xref>. However, the relationship between sequence similarity and function is not trivial. For example, human angiopoietin-4 (ANGPT4), an important angiogenesis growth factor, has been shown to activate TEK (tyrosine-protein kinase receptor), while the mouse sequence-ortholog (Angpt4) has been shown to inhibit TEK <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Valenzuela1">[24]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our previous work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Chikina1">[25]</xref>, we developed a cross-organism gene functional similarity measure, which relied on the concept that functional genomics data can be used to resolve homologous relationships among closely related genes. The approach summarizes the compendium of genomics data in each organism into functional relationship networks to identify genes that do not simply share sequence similarity but also functional behavior in large collections of heterogeneous functional data, and are thus functionally analogous (referred to in text as <italic>functional analogs</italic>). In this current study, we present a novel knowledge transfer method, Functional Knowledge Transfer (also referred to in text as FKT and outlined in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g002">Figure 2</xref>), which leverages the mapping of functional analogs to direct cross-organism annotation transfer for function prediction. FKT can be especially beneficial for existing and future machine learning methods studying biological processes with sparse annotations in any given organism of interest. By transferring experimental knowledge between genes that have been identified as functional analogs, our method extends beyond simple annotation transfer by sequence similarity. Experimental functional annotations are only transferred for genes that are not just similar in sequence, but also in their functional behavior derived from a large and relatively comprehensive compendium of genomic data.</p>

          <p>(A) A functional relationship network is constructed for each organism through Bayesian integration of heterogeneous genomic data (e.g. expression, TF motif binding, physical interaction assays). (B) Functionally analogous gene pairs (i.e. functional analogs) are identified by computing a gene pairwise functional similarity score introduced in Chikina et. al between all sequence homologs. Functional similarity is measured by the statistical significance of the number of common TreeFam gene families in the functional relationship network neighbors of each homologous gene pair. (C) Next, experimentally confirmed biological process annotations for each gene are transferred to its functional analogs. (D) For each biological process the extended set of gene annotations (which include direct gene annotations, if available, and cross-annotated genes) can be used as training examples for machine learning methods (SVM used in this study) to make novel gene membership predictions. (E) Top predicted genes are carried over for experimental validation.</p>

      <p>In this study, we show that FKT improves the prediction accuracy of machine learning algorithms, particularly for biological processes with few existing annotations in an organism of study. We compare FKT to annotation transfer by sequence similarity (BLAST) and demonstrate the superior performance of our method in improving gene function prediction performance. The consistent improvement and high performance across various state-of-the-art classification algorithms demonstrates our approach is robust to different learning models, which is crucial for wide applicability.</p>
      <p>We apply FKT to gene function (i.e. biological process) prediction in six metazoan organisms (<italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Rattus novegicus</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>) and show that FKT is robust enough for the automated transfer of annotations among these diverse organisms and accurate function prediction. Finally, we demonstrate an application of FKT to discovering novel biology by coupling the knowledge transfer with a Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict proteins involved in left-right asymmetry regulation during heart development in <italic>Danio rerio</italic>. We correctly predict several proteins in the pathway and experimentally confirm the first evidence of <italic>wnt5b</italic>'s role in the process. A comprehensive application of FKT to 11,000 biological processes, along with the functional relationship networks for all six organisms, are available through the IMP web-server portal accessible at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imp.princeton.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://imp.princeton.edu</ext-link> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Wong1">[26]</xref>.</p>

      <p>In <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g002">Figure 2</xref>, we outline the pipeline for FKT and the subsequent gene function predictions (details provided in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section below). Briefly, we first integrated high and low-throughput experimental data such as gene expression data, protein-protein interaction data, protein domain and transcription factor binding motif information into functional networks for each of seven organisms (<italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic> was also included as an annotation source). Next, we calculated a network-based functional similarity score as described in our prior work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Chikina1">[25]</xref> but extended here to additional organisms and data sources, between all ortholog and paralog pairs in a Treefam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Li1">[22]</xref> gene family to identify the targets for annotation transfer. Homologs with high functional similarity scores were determined to be functional analogs. Next, we applied FKT by transferring all gene-process annotations between functional analogs and merge these with existing annotations (if available) in an organism. To test the predictive power of FKT, the set of transferred and organism-specific annotations were used to train a Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Noble1">[27]</xref> and predict new genes to all biological processes in six metazoan organisms. Functional network connection weights (i.e. the inferred probability that two genes co-function in the same biological process), were treated as input features to the classifier (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Additional state-of-art machine learning methods (L1-regularized logistic regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Fan1">[28]</xref> and Random forest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Breiman1">[29]</xref>) were trained and evaluated to test the robustness of FKT performance improvement. Finally, we demonstrate the power of our approach with an <italic>in vivo</italic> experiment validating the predicted role of wnt5b in establishing correct heart asymmetry in <italic>Danio rerio</italic>.</p>

        <title>Functional knowledge transfer enables accurate gene prediction for pathways with few or no known genes</title>
        <p>Most modern machine-learning methods that predict novel members of a biological pathway require a set of genes already known to participate in the pathway. These approaches are therefore limited to predicting genes to biological processes with sufficient prior knowledge in an organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Hwang1">[30]</xref>. For example, in the MouseFunc competition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-PenaCastillo1">[7]</xref> (a broad competition focused on the performance of biological process prediction approaches), terms with less than three gene annotations were considered infeasible to predict and not included.</p>
        <p>We address this constraint by leveraging knowledge across species, which allows us to take advantage of known biology from a model organism where the pathway of interest may be better studied. We applied our functional cross-annotation strategy (FKT) to biological processes with few known genes (annotation sizes of &lt; = 5 and &lt; = 15) in six metazoans and evaluated the predictive performance of an SVM trained with these annotations. To evaluate our performance, we constructed a three-year temporal holdout of experimental annotations. We used only biological process annotations added to Gene Ontology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Ashburner1">[31]</xref> before 5/11/2008 (all dates in mm/dd/yyyy format) in learning the functional networks, transferring annotations across organisms, and predicting gene-process participation. New experimental annotations added to Gene Ontology between 5/11/2008 to 5/11/2011 were held-out and used for evaluation. In total, 3,207 GO biological process terms across the six organisms acquired new gene annotations in the subsequent three years. We evaluated the accuracy of our predictions with the gene-process assignments made during the hold-out time period in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g003">Figure 3</xref> (evaluation results of all GO terms in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002957.s007">Text S3</xref>). We observed substantial improvement using FKT when compared with only using the direct annotations for an organism. Improvement was evident across all six organisms, suggesting that even well characterized model organisms (e.g. mouse) can benefit from genomic-data-driven knowledge transfer. In addition, by holding out gene-process annotations acquired within the last three years, we could evaluate our ability to predict genes to processes which had no known genes in an organism prior to the hold out date (i.e. before 5/11/2008). Even though these processes were uncharacterized at that time, they subsequently became the focus of a directed experiment and thus were deemed biologically relevant and experimentally feasible in the organism. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g003">Figure 3</xref>, FKT gene predictions to these processes performed competitively even compared to biological processes with known gene annotations. Furthermore, these results were robust to the evaluation timeframe (1-year temporal holdout shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002957.s001">Figure S1</xref>).</p>

        <p>We hypothesized that our transfer method could improve prediction performance for a wide range of machine learning methods. Machine learning algorithms are often based on distinct learning models and assumptions, thus any widely applicable annotation transfer method must be robust to not only the biological variability (e.g. different organisms or pathways) but also to this modeling variability. Thus in addition to SVM, we evaluated two widely used state-of-the-art learning methods: L1-regularized logistic regression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Fan1">[28]</xref> and Random forest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Breiman1">[29]</xref>. We trained both classification methods with and without FKT and evaluated on the held-out set of annotations. FKT improved prediction accuracy across each machine-learning algorithm and organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g004">Figure 4</xref>). In particular, these improvements were consistent across biological process annotation sizes (&lt; = 5 and &lt; = 15). Altogether, these results indicated that FKT could recover biological processes that would be otherwise missed by most prediction methods, and that the transfer had wide applicability - improving performance across diverse organisms and machine learning algorithms.</p>

These predictions included gene-process membership for 8,091 GO biological processes currently without experimental annotations in at least one organism. Supervised machine learning methods would be unable to predict novel genes to these biological processes without annotation transfer. They represent a wide range of biological pathways and processes ranging from development and metabolism to immune response and response to various stimuli (a complete list of these GO terms is in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002957.s006">Text S2</xref>, categorization and specificity of these terms are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002957.s002">Figure S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002957.s003">S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>For example, the biological process <italic>regulation of exit from mitosis</italic> (GO:0007096) represents a crucial mitotic cell cycle process that enables cells to regulate their exit from M phase.

Our functional cross-annotation method has identified a total of 18 genes in <italic>Danio rerio</italic> with functional analogs annotated to this process (11 from yeast, 5 fly, 1 mouse and 1 rat), enabling novel predictions of gene membership to this process.</p>

Methods that employ only sequence similarity would be unable to predict this because <italic>cdh2</italic> homologs have not been annotated to this process in other model organisms. Furthermore, prediction methods without FKT will miss this finding because there are no existing <italic>Danio rerio</italic> annotations to this process.

        <title>Cross-annotation among functional analogs improves prediction accuracy for small processes</title>
        <p>To compare our functional transfer method, which applied a more specific annotation transfer, to commonly used methods that used only sequence homology, we evaluated a method that did not leverage functional similarity and a baseline method without any cross-annotation. In this sequence-only method, all homologous gene pairs (reciprocal BLAST best hit gene pairs) were targets for annotation transfer - any biological process annotated to a gene was transferred to its reciprocal best-hit gene in all organisms. To obtain a representative set of gene-process annotations for evaluation, we conducted a threefold cross-validation on genes that had experimental biological process annotations, and evaluated the SVM classifier prediction performance on each corresponding held-out set of biological process annotations. The results of the comparison showed that although both methods improved performance for small processes, FKT showed greater performance gains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g005">Figure 5</xref>, evaluation results of all GO terms in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002957.s007">Text S3</xref>).

An additional advantage of a functional genomics similarity approach, as shown in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Chikina1">[25]</xref>, is the ability to differentiate functional differences in tissue specificity between sequence homologs.

        <title><italic>In vivo</italic> validation of <italic>Danio rerio</italic> gene <italic>wnt5b</italic> involvement in the establishment of heart asymmetry</title>
        <p>In all vertebrates, the heart develops with a distinct left-right (L-R) asymmetry during embryonic morphogenesis. Deviations in left-right heart development can lead to complex congenital heart defects that are among the most common human neonatal diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Ramsdell1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-vanderLinde1">[47]</xref>. During cardiac morphogenesis in <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, two distinct stages of cell migrations lead to the final asymmetries of the heart. In the first stage, called “heart jogging”, myocardial cell migration within the cardiac cone place the ventricular cells to the left side, while atrial cells remain near the midline. In the second stage of “heart looping”, the heart tube bends and forms a loop that places the ventricle to the right of the atrium. Although the steps of cell migration progression leading to left-right heart asymmetry are beginning to be explored <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Baker1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-deCamposBaptista1">[51]</xref>, an understanding of how it is achieved mechanistically is still lacking.</p>
        <p>In Gene Ontology, the biological process term “determination of heart left right asymmetry” (GO:0061371) represents the developmental pathways regulating heart jogging and looping. To validate our prediction method (FKT coupled with SVM), we investigated the top five predicted genes that had not already been annotated to this GO term: <italic>sox32</italic>, <italic>wnt5b</italic>, <italic>ndr1</italic>, <italic>tbx1</italic> and <italic>lft1</italic>. We found existing literature evidence confirming the involvement of four of the five genes (<italic>sox32</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Wang1">[52]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Alexander1">[55]</xref>, <italic>ndr1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Rebagliati1">[56]</xref>, <italic>tbx1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Hami1">[57]</xref>, and <italic>lft1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Feldman1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Smith2">[60]</xref>). Although there existed experimental results confirming the role of these genes in influencing heart asymmetry, these results had not yet been curated by GO annotators. For example, in a knock-out experiment of our top predicted gene (<italic>sox32</italic>/<italic>casanova</italic>), <italic>Danio rerio</italic> embryos had fewer dorsal forerunner cells which led to defects in Kupffer's vesicle formation and subsequent left-right patterning of the heart, confirming that <italic>sox32</italic> was required for proper establishment of heart asymmetry. The only gene among the top five without existing experimental support was <italic>wnt5b</italic>, our second ranked prediction after <italic>sox32</italic>. Previous work had shown the involvement of <italic>wnt5b</italic> in cell migration during gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Goudevenou1">[61]</xref> but the gene had not been specifically associated with heart left-right asymmetry regulation. To experimentally validate our prediction of <italic>wnt5b</italic> to left-right heart determination, we knocked down its function by means of morpholino antisense oligonucleotides (MO) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Corey1">[62]</xref>.</p>
        <p>A significantly greater proportion of embryos where <italic>wnt5b</italic> was knocked down with a morpholino (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002957-g006">Figure 6</xref>) had a defective heart jogging phenotype (Fisher's exact test p-value&lt;0.001). In total, 48% of morpholino treated embryos showed either right-sided heart jog or midline jog comparable to previous genes known to be involved in this biological process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Lopes1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Aamar1">[65]</xref>.

      <p>This study demonstrates that state-of-the-art machine learning methods coupled with our functional knowledge transfer method can accurately prioritize novel genes of understudied processes. Previous methods have focused on incorporating functional genomic data primarily as input data <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Troyanskaya1">[66]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Huttenhower1">[69]</xref>. In contrast, here we demonstrate that the prevalence of understudied processes and the abundance of genomic data provide an opportunity to improve the accuracy of cross-organism annotation transfer and extend prediction coverage to processes with no prior annotations. We now integrate FKT into our IMP web-server <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Wong1">[26]</xref>. This makes IMP a web interface for exploratory analysis covering all organisms included in this study across 10,653 biological processes (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://imp.princeton.edu" xlink:type="simple">http://imp.princeton.edu</ext-link>). Functional knowledge transfer allows IMP to also include gene predictions for processes currently unannotated in an organism. Although in our current study we have experimentally followed up on our top predicted gene, all of our predictions in IMP are shown with estimated probabilities allowing biologist to draw a threshold dependent on how much the assay costs, and how important it is to find true positives (versus not finding false positives). In addition, the website includes the Bayesian functional relationship networks that were used for mapping functional analogs and used as input features to the machine learning methods. In particular, to the best of our knowledge, we include the first zebrafish (<italic>Danio rerio</italic>) functional relationship network.</p>
      <p>We anticipate that our approach can be extended beyond the six organisms shown in this study, as it is especially beneficial in organisms that have high-throughput genomic data with sparse annotations (e.g. frog, slime mold). Next-generation sequencing is further increasing the diversity of organisms that are measured on the genome-scale, and functional knowledge transfer can help us understand and annotate the roles of genes in such emerging model systems. Functional knowledge transfer allows for accurate hypothesis generation and experiment guidance even for pathways with no previous experimental knowledge in a given organism, thus benefiting human biology, broadly studied organisms such as mouse and fly, and newly adopted model systems.</p>

      <p>We developed a functional knowledge transfer method and applied this method to predicting gene functions in six organisms using a functional network based classification strategy. In summary, data integration was performed using a regularized naive Bayes classifier, which summarized the data compendium into organism specific function relationship networks. Edges in functional relationship networks represented, given all collected data from that organism, the posterior probability of a gene pair co-functioning in the same biological process. Next, a collection of organism specific experimental annotations supplemented with cross-annotated gene annotations (based on both sequence and functional similarity) was used as gold standard for each GO biological process to train a GO term specific SVM with the functional relationship network as features. To test for robustness across different machine learning algorithms, L1-regularized logistic regression and Random forest were also evaluated by coupling both algorithms with the functional knowledge transfer method. Final predictions were made on a total of 10,653 unique biological processes. We experimentally validated our method's predictions for the determination of heart left-right asymmetry in <italic>Danio rerio</italic>.

          <title>Generating functional relationship networks</title>
          <p>To summarize the processed heterogeneous genomic data, we generated one global functional relationship network per organism. We applied Bayesian integration, specifically a naïve Bayes classifier, to systematically deal with differences in accuracy and relevance of each data source for predicting gene functional relations. Gene pairs co-annotated to a set of 433 expert selected Gene Ontology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Ashburner1">[31]</xref> biological process fringe terms were used as known functionally related genes (i.e. positive examples) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Huttenhower1">[69]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Myers2">[85]</xref>. Gene pairs not co-annotated to any terms in the GO fringe, KEGG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Kotera1">[86]</xref>, PID <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Schaefer1">[87]</xref> or Biocyc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Caspi1">[88]</xref> were considered as unrelated (i.e. negative examples) except in the following cases:</p>
          <list list-type="order">
            <list-item>
              <p>A gene pair was annotated to terms overlapping with a hypergeometric P-value below 0.05</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>A gene pair was annotated to a set of ‘negative’ GO terms that define minimal relatedness (as described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Huttenhower1">[69]</xref>)</p>
            </list-item>
          </list>
          <p>If a gene pair met either of the two conditions, it was excluded from unrelated pair generation (i.e., they were neither related nor unrelated for training). Thus this formed a set of global related and unrelated gene pairs to be used for training and evaluation.</p>
          <p>One binary regularized naive Bayes classifier was trained per Gene Ontology fringe term (i.e. biological process/context). Each naive Bayes classifier contains one class node determining the membership of a gene-pair to the biological process and organism specific dataset nodes conditioned on the class node. When integrating large number of genomic datasets, the naive Bayes assumption of conditional independence among datasets can no longer be justified. We have shown that a mutual information based parameter regularization for naive Bayes classifiers can alleviate the conditional dependency among datasets <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Huttenhower1">[69]</xref>. In this work, we make modifications to our prior method by directly estimating the conditional dependency between a dataset by limiting the mutual information calculation between datasets to gene-pairs that are not functionally related. This heuristic enables us to estimate the conditional dependency between datasets without having to regress out the incomplete functional relation class node information. Specifically, the heuristic sum of shared information <italic>U<sub>k</sub></italic> is now:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>I<sub>pairs</sub></italic><sub>∈<italic>negatives</italic></sub> is the mutual information between dataset <italic>D<sub>k</sub></italic> and <italic>D</italic><sub>i</sub> among gene pairs not known to have a functional relationship (i.e. negative gene pair examples) and <italic>H</italic> is the single dataset entropy. Then we use the exponential decreased ratio (α<sub>k</sub>) to weight a given dataset's likelihood function. Finally, the naive Bayes functional relationship posterior probability for gene pair <italic>i,j</italic> is the following:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e004"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e005"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where the weighted dataset likelihood function is <italic>P<sup>*</sup></italic>, <italic>d<sub>k</sub>(g<sub>i</sub>, g<sub>j</sub>)</italic> is the experimental value for gene pair <italic>i,j</italic>, |<italic>D<sub>k</sub></italic>| is the total number of discretization levels and <italic>n<sub>s</sub></italic> is a pseudocount set to 3 in our integration based on cross-validation results.</p>
          <p>Finally, with biological process specific functional relation networks predicted by each naive Bayes classifier, we averaged the edge probabilities from each process specific functional network to generate the final global functional relationship network.</p>

        <title>GO biological process gold standard construction through cross-annotation</title>
        <p>In total, 10,653 GO biological process terms were predicted for new gene annotations covering six organisms, <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>, <italic>Mus musculus</italic>, <italic>Rattus novegicus</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Danio rerio</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans.</italic> We limited the positive examples for each GO term to propagated experimental GO annotations with GO evidence codes EXP, IDA, IPI, IMP, IGI and IEP (all “NOT” annotations were removed). In addition, to leverage the research strengths across organisms, we transferred gene annotations among six organisms plus yeast, first based on sequence similarity and second filtered by function similarity. In detail, we start with all sequence paralog and ortholog gene relations within each TreeFam <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Li1">[22]</xref> gene family. Next, based on our previous algorithm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Chikina1">[25]</xref>, we filtered for functional analogs among all paralog and ortholog gene pairs using our functional relationship networks. We define a functional analog to be a gene pair that has a significant number of overlapping TreeFam gene families among its closest gene neighbors in the global functional relationship network (a functional network is converted into a binary network by using a probability cutoff of 0.5). We defined a gene pair's score as the following:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e006"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>m</italic> and <italic>n</italic> are the number of TreeFam gene families in each gene <italic>G1</italic> and <italic>G2</italic>'s direct neighborhood in the functional network, <italic>k</italic> is the number of overlapping TreeFam gene families between gene <italic>G1</italic> and <italic>G2</italic> gene neighbors and <italic>N</italic> is the total number of TreeFam gene families around gene <italic>G1</italic> and <italic>G2</italic>. The functional similarity score is the probability of observing greater or equal to the number of overlapping gene families by chance, thus can be interpreted as a hypergeometric p-value. We used a score cutoff of &lt; = 0.01 to consider a gene pair as functional analogs.</p>
        <p>Finally, all experimental annotations are propagated between functional analogs. In total, our supervised functional knowledge transfer allowed us to make predictions for 8,091 additional GO biological processes, thus extending our predictions beyond simply well-studied and well annotated processes and pathways.</p>

        <title>Biological process prediction with network based SVM</title>
        <p>We used the augmented gold standard genes by functional knowledge transfer and functional relation network as features into state-of-art machine learning algorithm Support Vector Machine (SVM) to predict novel biological process gene annotations. Our functional relation network based SVM method has shown to outperform methods that directly input the raw data into the SVM or a simplistic sum of the functional networks to the positive examples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Guan2">[89]</xref>.</p>
        <p>For each biological process, the feature space was constructed as the weights in the functional relation network. Thus for each gene example, all gene edge weights connecting to the example gene were used to create the feature vector. Therefore, each organism feature count will be equal to the number of genes in the organism. The set of feature vectors for training examples were used to train a linear SVM according to the standard formulation:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e007"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e008"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <italic>n</italic> is the of training example genes, <italic>w</italic> is the gene weight vector, <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> is the training label of gene <italic>i</italic> and <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> is the edge weight vector connecting gene <italic>i</italic> to all genes in the functional network.</p>

        <title>Additional machine learning algorithms</title>
        <p>To validate that the observed performance improvement was not specific to any single learning algorithm, we applied the functional knowledge transfer to two additional widely used machine learning methods: L1-regularized logistic regression and Random forest. Regression analysis coupled with regularization has been a broadly used approach to control for the bias-variance trade-off <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Hoerl1">[91]</xref>. In particular, L1-regularization has been successfully used in many methods for shrinkage and feature selection applications, most famously in the works of LASSO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Tibshirani1">[92]</xref>. By coupling L1-regularization with a logit link function, conditional probabilities of a gene membership to a biological process can be computed based on selected genes of predictive power. The predictive gene weight vector <italic>w</italic> was obtained by the following regression problem:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002957.e009"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002957.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where λ&gt;0 is the regularization parameter, <italic>y<sub>i</sub></italic> is the training label of gene <italic>i</italic> and <italic>x<sub>i</sub></italic> is the edge weight vector connecting gene <italic>i</italic> to all genes in the functional network.</p>
        <p>Random forest classifiers are a combination of decision trees that are aggregated to make a final prediction. Random forest algorithms have been shown to produce improved prediction accuracy compared to a single decision tree by better estimating the contribution of each predictor through random sampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Breiman1">[29]</xref>. In genomic applications, Random forest has gained interest due to the many high-dimensional genomic learning problems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-DiazUriarte1">[93]</xref>.

        <title>Performance evaluation</title>
        <p>For performance evaluations for GO terms with no prior annotation, we used a three-year temporal holdout set of gene annotations for each GO biological process (one-year holdout results shown in supplemental material). The held-out gene annotations were preserved throughout the prediction pipeline (functional network integration and SVM predictions) to avoid any overestimation of performance. Although we train our SVM classifiers using the augmented cross-annotated gold standard, only the non-transferred experimental GO term annotations were used for evaluation with all transferred annotations excluded.</p>
        <p>The GO gene association files used to create our gold standard was downloaded from Gene Ontology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002957-Ashburner1">[31]</xref> on 5/11/2011 (all dates in mm/dd/yyyy format). To generate an accurate temporal three-year holdout we downloaded the GO gene association version archived at 5/11/2008. All annotations were propagated and only experimental examples newly annotated after 5/11/2008 for each GO term was used in the temporal evaluation. Accordingly, any GO term that had no gene annotations on 5/11/2008, but subsequently accumulated new annotations were used to evaluate our performance in predicting terms with no-known prior annotations.</p>
        <p>To compare performance between knowledge transfer methods, we conducted an evaluation by performing a threefold cross-validation among genes that had experimental biological process annotations. This set of evaluation annotations represents a random sampling of the current knowledge base as of 5/11/2011. Identical to our temporal holdout, all evaluation annotations for each holdout were withheld from our prediction pipeline to avoid any performance over-estimation.</p>
