<abstract>
<p>The contribution of basal and luminal cells to cancer progression and metastasis is poorly understood. We report generation of reporter systems driven by either keratin-14 (K14) or keratin-8 (K8) promoter that not only express a fluorescent protein but also an inducible suicide gene. Transgenic mice express the reporter genes in the right cell compartments of mammary gland epithelia and respond to treatment with toxins. In addition, we engineered the reporters into 4T1 metastatic mouse tumor cell line and demonstrate that K14+ cells, but not K14− or K8+, are both highly invasive in three-dimensional (3D) culture and metastatic <italic>in vivo</italic>. Treatment of cells in culture, or tumors in mice, with reporter-targeting toxin inhibited both invasive behavior and metastasis <italic>in vivo</italic>. RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), secretome, and epigenome analysis of K14+ and K14− cells led to the identification of <italic>amphoterin-induced protein 2</italic> (<italic>Amigo2</italic>) as a new cell invasion driver whose expression correlated with decreased relapse-free survival in patients with TP53 wild-type (WT) breast cancer.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Most, if not all, cancer-related deaths result from metastasis. The differentiation states of the cancer epithelial cells are thought to be a critical determinant of metastasis. Epithelial cancer cells with a basal cell type are more aggressive in forming metastasis than cancer cells with luminal cell type. Very little is known about how the differentiation states impact metastasis or the molecular mechanisms involved. In this study, we develop and characterize new reporters that fluorescently mark cells in luminal or basal status. These reporters are also coupled to “suicide genes,” which can be used to inducibly and selectively eliminate cells expressing the reporters. We find that elimination of the basal cell type dramatically decreases metastasis and identify amphoterin-induced protein 2 (Amigo2) as a new regulator of cell invasion in basal cells.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Carcinomas are defined as cancers of epithelial cell origin. All carcinomas contain cancer cells in multiple differentiation statuses such as luminal and basal. Keratins (cytokeratins, abbreviated as K) are intermediate filament proteins that are expressed in a differentiation status–specific manner in luminal (K7, K8, K18, K19) or basal (K5, K6, K14, K17) epithelial cells and are routinely used as diagnostic markers for cancer tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref002">2</xref>]. It is thought that cancer epithelia are plastic to an extent and can interconvert between basal and luminal differentiation states during initiation, progression of cancer, and in response to treatment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref003">3</xref>]. Therefore, there is a significant need for experimental model systems that facilitate the study of this plasticity and assess the importance of the epithelial differentiation state in modulating the biology of cancer cells.</p>
<p>Despite advances in treatment, patients with breast cancer often relapse and develop metastatic disease, which accounts for over 90% of the 450,000 breast cancer–related deaths each year worldwide [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref005">5</xref>]. Tumor metastasis is a poorly understood, complex, multistep process by which tumor cells disseminate from primary tumors to form secondary tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref006">6</xref>]. Understanding the key molecular determinants that regulate the metastatic process is fundamental to identifying ways to limit the spread of and to target metastatic breast cancer.</p>
<p>Majority of breast carcinomas express luminal keratins, and a subset express basal keratins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref009">9</xref>]. Basal keratin expression correlates with higher tumor grade, poor prognosis, and reduced relapse-free and overall survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref010">10</xref>]. Among the breast cancer subtypes, basal-like (BL) breast carcinomas express both basal and luminal keratins and are associated with aggressive clinical behavior and increased frequency of metastasis compared to luminal subtypes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref011">11</xref>]. Recent observations show that collective invasion needs K14-positive leading cells for efficient dissemination and metastases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref012">12</xref>]. Conversions of luminal to basal lineage have been observed <italic>ex vivo</italic> in mouse breast cancer models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref012">12</xref>], suggesting that lineage plasticity of cancer cells may be involved in the metastatic process. However, the relative contribution of basal versus luminal breast cancer epithelia for tumor progression and metastasis remains unknown.</p>
<p>The goal of the present study is to develop and characterize reporter systems that are more versatile than the frequently used causes recombination (CRE)-based systems. Using the same K14 and K8 promoter used in the CRE expression systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref013">13</xref>], we generated K14 and K8 reporters that coexpress fluorescent proteins and toxin receptors in culture and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The reporters not only mark K14 and K8 positive cells but also enable inducible elimination of specific populations using diphtheria toxin (DT) or ganciclovir (GCV). We demonstrated that elimination of K14 reporter–positive cells decreases invasive phenotype <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor growth and metastatic load <italic>in vivo</italic>, using 4T1 mammary carcinoma cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref014">14</xref>], a syngeneic, orthotopic transplantation model of metastatic breast cancer. Molecular characterization of K14 reporter cell lines led to the identification of <italic>Amigo2</italic> as a novel mediator of invasion, which demonstrates the utility of the reporter system for understanding biology of metastasis and as a discovery tool to identify novel molecular regulators of cancer metastasis.</p>
<p>Our reporter system has significant benefits over the more frequently used CRE recombinase–based systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref013">13</xref>]. Whereas CRE-based systems are effective in tracing the lineage of marked cells, they do not have the capacity to report plasticity between K8 and K14 differentiation states. Using fluorescence proteins with a very short half-life, we report our ability to monitor changes in K8+ or K14+ status. In addition, we report coexpression of K8 and K14 reporters that can not only allow monitoring transitions between differentiation states but also permit elimination of one cell type while sparing the other. Since differentiation state plasticity plays a critical role in development and cancer, having the ability to eliminate cells in a specific differentiation state is of significant importance. Thus, our model provides the ability to track and control plasticity and hence will provide unprecedented opportunity for those interested is studying K8+ and K14+ epithelial lineages during development and disease.</p>

<p>The 4T1 mouse mammary carcinoma cell line is comprised of both basal and luminal epithelial cells and forms aggressive BL tumors that metastasize to multiple organs when orthotopically injected into the mammary fat pad of syngeneic BALB/c mice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref014">14</xref>]. The K14.GFP reporter was cotransfected with a selection marker containing plasmid, and antibiotic-resistant cell populations were used to enrich for GFP-positive cells by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS). GFP expression was colocalized to endogenous K14, as determined by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Over time, the FACS-sorted K14.GFP+ cell population gave rise to a GFP-negative (K14.GFP−) population, suggesting that the K14-positive lineage was not terminally differentiated. In contrast, the K14.GFP− cell population did not give rise to a K14.GFP+ population, even when cultured for extended periods (&gt;50 days), suggesting a hierarchical relationship between K14-positive and K14-negative states under normal cell culture conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). The K14.GFP− population, generated from the K14.GFP+ population, retained the reporter plasmid in the genomic DNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s001">S1B Fig</xref>), demonstrating that the K14.GFP promoter was present but not active in K14.GFP− cells.</p>
<p>In monolayer cultures, K14.GFP− cells formed the characteristic cobblestone epithelial morphology, with clearly identifiable cell–cell contacts, whereas the K14.GFP+ cell population was pleomorphic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). The presence of rounded cells in the K14.GFP+ population prompted us to investigate whether K14.GFP+ and K14.GFP− cells differ in their proliferation rates. Surprisingly, cell proliferation measured using 3-(4,5-dimethylthiazol-2-yl)-2,5-diphenyltetrazolium bromide (MTT) assay or changes in total cell number or 5-ethynyl-2′-deoxyuridine (EdU) incorporation combined with DNA staining for cell cycle analysis did not show any difference between K14.GFP+ and K14.GFP− cell populations. (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). K14-positive cancer cells are associated with aggressive behavior in culture and <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref012">12</xref>]. Consistent with this logic, about 50% of K14.GFP+ and wild-type (WT) cells formed invasive structures, bearing multiple invasive projections when plated in a 3D culture on a bed of a 1:1 mixture of Matrigel/Collagen-I (M/Col-I). In contrast, less than 10% of K14.GFP− cells formed invasive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>). To determine if the expression of DTR would provide us the ability to eliminate K14.GFP+, we treated cells with DT. DT addition to the K14.GFP+ population resulted in an almost complete loss of structures with invasive protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1G and 1H</xref>), whereas DT did not affect WT or K14.GFP− cells, demonstrating the utility of DT treatment to eliminate K14+ cells with invasive properties.</p>
<p>Previous studies have shown that K14+ cells are present at the leading edge of invasive protrusions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref012">12</xref>]. To understand the relationship between our K14.GFP reporter expression and cell invasion, we monitored GFP expression in 3D culture. We observed that GFP-expressing cells were present at both invasive protrusions and in noninvasive 3D structures, demonstrating that our K14.GFP reporter marks cells irrespective of the invasion behavior (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1I</xref>). We also noted that not all GFP-expressing cells were lost upon DT treatment in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g001">Fig 1I</xref>) and in monolayer cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s001">S1E Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>All mice were euthanized 4 weeks after injections when the largest tumor reached 1.5 cm in diameter. Tumors derived from control or K14.GFP+ cells had a significantly larger mass compared to those generated by K14.GFP− cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Histological examination of tumors showed that both K14.GFP+ or K14.GFP− cells were similar with regard to the cellular morphology, tissue organization, and extent of necrosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). However, examination of lung sections revealed that metastatic burden was significantly increased in mice injected with K14.GFP+ cells compared to those injected with K14.GFP− cells, as quantified by percentage of total lung area occupied by tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>). Lung metastasis was also enhanced for K14.GFP+ cells relative to that of control cells; however, the difference was not statistically significant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Although both tumor size and lung metastasis were greater for the K14.GFP+ group, correlation coefficient analysis of matched pairs of primary tumors and lung metastases from all groups showed that lung metastasis did not correlate with primary tumor mass (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g002">Fig 2E</xref>), demonstrating that the increase in lung metastasis is not simply due to the increase in mass of the primary tumor in mice injected with K14.GFP+ cells. Thus, K14.GFP+ cell populations form more aggressive tumors <italic>in vivo</italic> with increased metastatic potential compared to K14.GFP− cells.</p>
<p>Next, we investigated cell proliferation and cell death in primary tumors to understand why K14.GFP+ cells form faster-growing primary tumors. Surprisingly, neither Ki67 (a proliferation marker) nor cleaved caspase-3 (an apoptosis marker) was significantly different between K14.GFP+ and K14.GFP− tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s002">S2B Fig</xref>). Since increase in tumor size can be due to increased vascularization, we also evaluated the expression of the endothelial marker CD31 in the K14.GFP+ and K14.GFP− tumors, but no significant difference was found (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). These results are consistent with the lack of a difference in cell proliferation rates between K14.GFP+ and K14.GFP− cell lines in culture. It is likely that differences in the size of tumors derived from K14.GFP+ or K14.GFP− are due to cell intrinsic or extrinsic factors, which remain to be understood (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec013">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>Characterization of K14.GFP in tumors and metastasis</title>
<p>As expected, tumors generated from K14.GFP+ cells had high frequency of K14-positive cells compared to tumors generated from K14.GFP− cells, as determined by immunofluorescence. Coimmunostaining with anti-GFP antibodies showed colocalization of GFP with K14 immunostaining in tumors generated from K14.GFP+ cells but not in tumors generated from K14.GFP− cells or DT treated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g002">Fig 2J</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).

<title>K14 and K8 reporters for labeling and selective elimination of cell populations</title>
<p>During DT-mediated depletion of K14.GFP+ cells in monolayer cultures, 1% to 2% of GFP-positive cells remained, even after prolonged DT treatment (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s001">S1E Fig</xref>). We reasoned that this may be because of the long half-life (approximately 26 hours) of the GFP protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref022">22</xref>]. To rule out the effect of protein half-life on the presence of GFP-positive cells, we generated a new set of reporters carrying a fast-maturating and short-half-life (2.0 hours) fluorescent protein coupled with a suicide gene. In addition to K14, we also generated a reporter to mark K8-positive cells. The fluorescent protein and toxin were chosen such that they can be coexpressed in the same cell to better monitor changes in the cell differentiation state.

<p>To directly compare K14+ and K8+ cells, we established populations of K14.tRFP- and K8.tGFP-positive cells by performing 2 sequential rounds of FACS sorting. Similar to the K14.GFP+, the K14.tRPT+ (referred to as K14+) population gave rise to K14.tRPT− (referred to as K14−) cells over time, but the K14− cells did not generate K14+ cells. In contrast, K8+ cells did not show any significant decrease in the percentage of reporter-positive cells over multiple passages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s004">S4A Fig</xref>). Endogenous K8 and K14 in the K8+, K14+, and K14− monolayers colocalized with tGFP and K14 expression with tRFP expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s004">S4B and S4C Fig</xref>, respectively).</p>
<p>As expected, K14+ cell populations had a less organized monolayer as compared with K14− or K8+ populations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g003">Fig 3C</xref>). As observed for K14.GFP+ cells, almost 50% of K14+ cells formed highly invasive structures of variable size in M/Col-I basement membrane matrix, whereas the K8+ and K14− population showed almost exclusively noninvasive structures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g003">Fig 3C and 3D</xref>). Consistently, K14+ were found to migrate faster than K14− in a scratch assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s004">S4D Fig</xref>).

<p>To demonstrate the utility of the inducible killing strategy, we exposed monolayers to GCV for K14 reporter–expressing TK and to DT for K8 reporter–expressing DTR.

<title>K14 reporter–expressing cells have features associated with mesenchymal transition</title>
<p>To determine if the invasive behavior in culture and the metastatic properties <italic>in vivo</italic> are associated with mesenchymal characteristics in K14 positive cells, we compared K14+ and K14− cells for changes in expression of epithelial and mesenchymal markers. Among the mesenchymal markers analyzed, we observed a 3.0-fold increase in the levels of vimentin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g003">Fig 3F</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis showed an increase in vimentin expression in the majority of the K14+ cells, demonstrating that increase in vimentin protein levels is not restricted to a subpopulation of K4+ cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Interestingly, although β-catenin protein levels did not change, immunofluorescence analysis demonstrated a loss of cell–cell junction localization in K14+ cells and a gain in cytoplasmic and nuclear signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g003">Fig 3G</xref>). Similar changes in vimentin expression and β-catenin localization were observed in K14.GFP+ cell monolayers and tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>).

<p>Because epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT) has been linked with increased cancer stem cell properties [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref024">24</xref>], we reasoned that it could be the reason why K14.GFP+ tumors are bigger than K14.GFP−.

DT administration induced a lethal response within 48 hours for the K8.tGPD line, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g004">Fig 4C</xref>) likely due to elimination of differentiated epithelial cells in most of the internal organs. In K14.tRPT mice, both high and low doses of GCV caused massive weight loss or a lethal response. Nontransgenic mice did not show any phenotype in response to DT or GCV administration. Hematoxylin and eosin (H&amp;E) analysis of the liver of DT-treated K8.tGPD mouse showed a decreased number of cells compared to DT-treated WT mouse (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s008">S8C Fig</xref>). For K14.tRPT-positive but not WT mice, GCV-treated mammary gland showed a loss of the mammary ductal organization and an increased lymphocyte infiltration, likely due to inflammation induced by GCV-induced cell death and a significant change in adipose tissue where the normal fat tissues were replaced by brown fat–like tissues, presumably due to the large consumption of energy to compensate for cell loss, which turns energy-storing mature fat cells into energy-burning brown fat cells. (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s008">S8D Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>These results demonstrate that the transgenic mice express the reporter in the right compartments and that the suicide genes that respond to the stimuli making cells from these mouse models can be used in orthotopic transplantation or <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation settings as powerful tools for the investigation of epithelial lineage biology in culture and <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>

<title>Molecular characterization of differences between 4T1 K14+ and K14− cell lines</title>
<p>To gain insight into the molecular basis for the phenotypic differences in invasive, tumorigenic, and metastatic behaviors observed between K14+ and K14− cells, we conducted secretome, RNA sequencing (RNA-seq), and epigenome analysis.</p>
<p>Secreted proteins can modify the extracellular matrix and are therefore potential key candidates to influence invasion and metastasis. Mass spectrometry analysis of conditioned media (CM) from WT, K14.GFP+, and K14.GFP− cells identified approximately 1,900 proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s011">S1 Data</xref>). The Collagen VI subunit A (<italic>Col6a1</italic>) was the most differentially secreted protein between K14.GFP+ and K14.GFP− cells (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004049.t001">Table 1</xref>), with an approximately 10-fold increase in abundance for K14.GFP+ compared to K14.GFP− cells. Immunoblot analysis of CM confirmed that <italic>Col6a1</italic> was highly secreted by K14.GFP+ cells and relatively undetectable in K14.GFP− cells’ CM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). Two recent secretome studies reported that secreted <italic>Col6a1</italic> levels are increased for several strongly metastatic cancer cell lines relative to their less-metastatic counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref027">27</xref>]. <italic>Serpine2</italic> was also found to be more secreted by K14+ cells, and its expression and secretion have been correlated with metastatic disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref028">28</xref>]. Other proteins that showed at least 4-fold difference in levels are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004049.t001">Table 1</xref>.

<title><italic>Amigo2</italic> and breast cancer</title>
<p>To determine if differential expression of <italic>Amigo2</italic> is observed in other models of breast cancer, we used HCC1143, a human breast cancer cell line that is known to express both luminal and basal keratins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref042">42</xref>]. To facilitate transduction of human cells, we regenerated K8 and K14 reporter in a self-inactivating (SIN) lentiviral-based expression vector (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g005">Fig 5E</xref>) that constitutively coexpresses a blue fluorescence protein (tBFP). Cells were transduced and sorted first for tBFP and subsequently for expression of either tRFP (K14) or tGFP (K8) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s009">S9B Fig</xref>). Consistent with what we found for 4T1 cells, HCC1143 K14.tRFP+ populations had significantly higher levels of <italic>Amigo2</italic> mRNA compared with the K14− population (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g005">Fig 5F</xref>), demonstrating the relationship between K14 status and <italic>Amigo2</italic> expression in human breast cancer cells.</p>
<p>To gain insight into the role of <italic>Amigo2</italic> in human breast cancer, we analyzed the relationship between <italic>Amigo2</italic> levels in different breast cancer subtypes.

<title><italic>Amigo2</italic> as a regulator of invasive behavior</title>
<p>To determine if <italic>Amigo2</italic> regulates cell invasion, we knocked down its expression in 4T1 cells. <italic>Amigo2</italic> knock-down (AM2 KD) cells have a dramatic decrease in the protein levels of <italic>Amigo2</italic> and a 90% decrease in mRNA expression as compared to the control vector (VECT)-transduced cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).

To rule out any possible off-target effects of the short hairpin RNA (shRNA), we rescued the <italic>Amigo2</italic> expression by transducing the human <italic>Amigo2</italic> cDNA (or a VECT control) into the 4T1 AM2 KD (<italic>Amigo2</italic> knock-down rescue [AM2 KD-RE] and <italic>Amigo2</italic> knock-down control vector [AM2 KD-VECT], respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004049.g006">Fig 6D</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>In this study, we generated and characterized novel reporter systems that combine the ability to track cells using a fluorescence protein expression with the more unique ability to selectively eliminate them using a toxin treatment. This strategy allowed us to select for K14+ mammary tumor cells and to demonstrate that they are indeed more invasive in culture and more tumorigenic and metastatic <italic>in vivo</italic>. By depleting K14+ cells <italic>in vivo</italic>, we demonstrated that K14+ cells are required for metastasis. Consistently, K14− and K8+ showed reduced invasion ability and a more organized epithelial-like monolayer than the K14+ population. Our studies also demonstrate the limits of differentiation plasticity, as K14− cells were unable to generate K14+ cells, whereas K14+ cells were capable of generating K14− or K14+ cells. To broaden the utility of the reporter system, we generated transgenic models and demonstrated that our promoters are active in the appropriate cellular compartment of the mammary gland and that K8.tGFP expression also matches endogenous K8 protein–expressing cells in lungs. Although the percentage of reporter-positive cells in our transgenic model is lower than the CRE-based systems previously reported, we would like to highlight that our platform is a “real-time” readout of the promoter activity, which creates opportunity to study plasticity of differentiation states. In the CRE-based lineage-tracing models, CRE is induced during the prolonged labeling periods (several days to a week), and the cells and their progenies are permanently marked irrespective of changes in its differentiation states. Furthermore, the combination of reporter and toxin gene expression <italic>in vivo</italic> makes these models valuable for all fields of biology involving K14 and K8 lineages. Since differentiation state plasticity plays a critical role in development and cancer, having the ability to eliminate cells that are present in a given differentiation state at the given time window is of significant importance for almost all types of carcinoma in multiple organs.</p>
<p>Orthotopic transplantation of K14− 4T1 cells resulted in formation of tumors that were smaller in size compared to K14+ or WT cells. Surprisingly, we did not observe any difference in the cell proliferation rates between K14− and K14+ cells in culture or <italic>in vivo</italic> (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004049.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref>). Although it is not clear why K14− cells form smaller tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>, there may be two possible explanations. First, albeit being transplanted into syngeneic background mice, K14+ cells may be better at evading immune systems compared to K14− cells and hence grow better <italic>in vivo</italic>. Second, a more provocative possibility relates to an interesting hypothesis proposed by a recent study that suggests that tumor growth rate can be substantially altered by changes in dispersal rate of cancer cells even in the absence of any change in doubling time [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref044">44</xref>]. Given that K14+ cells express mesenchymal state markers and demonstrate increased ability to migrate, it is possible that K14+ cells are more efficient in forming tumors <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additional experiments are needed to understand why K14− cells form smaller tumors compared to K14+ cells.</p>
<p>Previous studies demonstrate that K14− can become K14+ to lead the invasive front during metastasis of mouse mammary tumor virus polyomavirus middle T-antigen (MMTV-PyMT) luminal metastatic mouse model of breast cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref012">12</xref>]. In our studies, we did not observe any significant impact on either primary tumor mass or metastatic lesions upon orthotopic injection of K14− treated with DT to deplete K14+ cells that could be generated from K14− cells. This observation suggests that plasticity of differentiation state may be a context-dependent phenomenon or that the K14− cells transition to a K14+ state without involving activation of the K14 reporter.</p>
<p>We demonstrate the utility of the platform to gain new molecular insights by comparing K14+ cells to K14− by RNA-seq and secretome analysis. We identified a number of genes differentially expressed or secreted. Many of these genes were previously reported to be associated with either bad prognosis or with invasion and/or metastatic phenotypes in human breast cancer, validating the power of the platform. In addition, we report the identification of <italic>Amigo2</italic> as a new mediator of invasion in breast cancer. Interestingly, <italic>Amigo2</italic> knockdown in 4T1 suppresses invasive behavior, but its overexpression in K14− cells was not sufficient to induce invasion, demonstrating that <italic>Amigo2</italic> is necessary but not sufficient for the invasiveness. <italic>Amigo2</italic> is an adhesion molecule that was first identified in 2003 and has been found to play a role in axon development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref040">40</xref>].

<title>Construction of the reporters</title>
<p>The K14-Cre plasmid containing the human <italic>KRT14</italic> (<italic>K14</italic>) gene promoter followed by the rabbit β-globin intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref018">18</xref>] was kindly provided by Jos Jonkers (Netherlands Cancer Institute, Netherlands). The pEGFP-N1 vector was obtained from Clontech. The <italic>K14</italic> promoter–driven EGFP-P2A-DTR (K14-EPD) reporter construct was generated by multisite Gateway cloning (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. The K14-β-globin entry clone was made by PCR amplification using sequence from K14-Cre as a template. The EPD entry clone was made by overlap extension PCR using EGFP and DTR cDNA templates and inserting P2A peptide coding sequence in between. The SV40pA entry clone was made by overlap extension PCR using oligonucleotides matching the late polyadenylation signal sequence (pA) of Simian virus 40 as a template. The three entry clones—K14-β-globin, EPD, and SV40pA—were recombined into a Gateway-compatible pBluescript KS+ destination vector to produce the final construct, pBS-K14β-EPD-SV40pA. The <italic>K14</italic> promoter–driven TurboRFP (K14-tRFP) reporter construct was generated in a similar manner, except using cDNA template for fast-maturating destabilized red (orange) fluorescent protein TurboRFP (tRFP, pTurboRFP-dest1; Evrogen) instead of EGFP, and DTR was replaced by herpes simplex virus TK. The K8 construct was also generated in a similar manner. The 3.5-kb sequence upstream the ATG codon of the murine K8 gene was obtained from the BAC clone RP23-254K21 (BACPAC Resources Center, Children’s Hospital Oakland Research Institute) using the forward primer 5′-GGTGGATCACTTGCCCCCTCCGTTTG-3′ and the reverse primer 5′-GGGACAGCGCCCAGCGAAGGCCC-3′ as previously done [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>K8 promoter was followed by the rabbit β-globin intron [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004049.ref018">18</xref>], a fast-maturating and short-half-life turbo green fluorescent protein (tGFP, pTurboGFP-dest1 vector; Evrogen), a P2A followed by a DTR, and sv40polyA signal as described above. The two turbo constructs were also modified by adding a neomycin (for K14) and a hygromycin (for K8) resistance to allow selection.</p>
<p>SIN constructs were generated by PCR amplification from promoter to the end of the suicide gene. Primers were flanked with attB1 and attB2 sequence to allow gateway cloning into the destination SIN lentiviral vector pLBC2-B-RFCA.</p>

If not specified, 3D cultures of 4T1 cells were grown embedded in a matrix of Matrigel or M/Col-I. Briefly, 96-well plates (BD Falcon) were coated with 30 μL of Matrigel or M/Col-I. The plate was put for 30 minutes at 37°C. Cells were added on top of the matrix in 20 ul of Matrigel or Matrigel:Collagen. After 30 minutes at 37°C, growing media supplemented with 5% Matrigel were added to the well. From day 3 to day 5, 3D structures were monitored for invasive protrusions. All cells were grown in a humidified atmosphere with 5% CO<sub>2</sub> at 37°C. For DTR-mediated cell ablation in culture, cells were treated with 2.5 or 5 ng/ml DT (in 10 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.5, 1 mM Na<sub>2</sub>EDTA) for 2 to 7 days. For TK-mediated ablation, cells were treated with 1 or 5 ug/ml GCV for 5 to 7 days.</p>

After 48 hours, cells were replated in fresh growth medium containing 400 μg/ml Zeocin (Life Technologies), which was replenished every 4 days for a total of 16 days. Zeocin-resistant clones were pooled, replated, and expanded in the presence of Zeocin for an additional 7 days (pre-sort), and then EGFP-expressing cells were isolated by FACS (sort-1) using a MoFlo XDP High-Speed Cell Sorter (Beckman Coulter) equipped with a 488-nm laser. After 7 passages, these cells were subjected to a second round of FACS (sort-2) from which both the EGFP+ and EGFP− cells were collected. Cells were allowed to recover from sorting stress and then frozen down in batches. Except where indicated, all experiments using sorted cells were performed within 2 weeks after thawing. All cell lines were tested and found to be negative for mycoplasma and viral contamination by PCR. Turbo cell lines were generated in a similar manner, except selections were carried out with G418 (life technology) or Hygromicin (Roche) for K14 or K8, respectively.
