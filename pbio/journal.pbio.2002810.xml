<abstract>
<p>Driven by oncogenic signaling, glutamine addiction exhibited by cancer cells often leads to severe glutamine depletion in solid tumors. Despite this nutritional environment that tumor cells often experience, the effect of glutamine deficiency on cellular responses to DNA damage and chemotherapeutic treatment remains unclear. Here, we show that glutamine deficiency, through the reduction of alpha-ketoglutarate, inhibits the AlkB homolog (ALKBH) enzymes activity and induces DNA alkylation damage. As a result, glutamine deprivation or glutaminase inhibitor treatment triggers DNA damage accumulation independent of cell death. In addition, low glutamine-induced DNA damage is abolished in ALKBH deficient cells. Importantly, we show that glutaminase inhibitors, 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON) or CB-839, hypersensitize cancer cells to alkylating agents both in vitro and in vivo. Together, the crosstalk between glutamine metabolism and the DNA repair pathway identified in this study highlights a potential role of metabolic stress in genomic instability and therapeutic response in cancer.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Cancer cells residing within the intratumoral microenvironment are subject to severe glutamine shortages. Herein, we provide mechanistic insight by which glutamine deficiency leads to cellular sensitivity to alkylating agents. We find that glutamine deficiency inhibits the DNA repair activity of the ALKBH enzymes, leading to accumulation of DNA alkylation damage and thereby increasing cellular sensitivity to alkylating agents. This study provides a critical molecular basis to combine glutaminase inhibitors with alkylating agents for more effective treatment of cancers. These findings extend our understanding of the role of metabolic stress, in particular glutamine deficiency, in tumor development and therapeutic response.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Metabolic alterations exhibited by cancer cells can potentiate tumorigenesis and promote cell survival [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref002">2</xref>]. Unlike normal cells, cancer cells favor aerobic glycolysis, also known as the Warburg effect, to support rapid proliferation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref003">3</xref>]. As most glucose is converted into lactate, cancer cells become heavily dependent on glutamine as a major carbon and nitrogen source [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref004">4</xref>]. Glutamine metabolism supports rapidly proliferating cells by facilitating the biosynthesis of different amino acids and nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref005">5</xref>]. Moreover, glutamine supports the increased energetic demand and suppresses accumulated reactive oxygen species (ROS) exhibited in cancer cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref006">6</xref>]. Specifically, glutamine is diverted to synthesize the tricarboxylic acid (TCA) cycle intermediate, alpha-ketoglutarate (αKG), to replenish the truncated TCA cycle and maintain healthy NADH and NADPH levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref008">8</xref>]. Moreover, the amino acid drives the production of glutathione (GSH), a major antioxidant, to protect cancer cells from ROS accumulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref009">9</xref>]. Inhibition of glutamine metabolism with small molecule inhibitors results in an energetic crisis leading to cellular death in some cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref010">10</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref011">11</xref>].</p>
<p>On the other hand, the increased glutamine uptake in cancer cells coupled with poor vascularization in tumors often leads to severe glutamine shortage in the tumor microenvironment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref013">13</xref>]. For example, metabolomics studies on human pancreatic cancer patient samples have clearly demonstrated that glutamine, besides glucose, is one of the most depleted metabolites in tumors compared to adjacent healthy tissues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref013">13</xref>]. In addition, core regions of solid tumors display extreme glutamine deficiency compared to peripheral regions in melanoma xenografts and transgenic mouse tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref014">14</xref>]. Interestingly, many cancer cells appear to adapt to this strong metabolic stress through multiple mechanisms, including p53 and IKKβ activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref017">17</xref>]. However, it remains unclear how glutamine deficiency observed in tumors impacts tumor development and therapeutic response.</p>
<p>Genomic instability plays a significant role in tumorigenesis and aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref018">18</xref>]. While cellular DNA is constantly exposed to both endogenous and exogenous DNA damaging agents, the damages are regularly repaired by the robust DNA damage repair pathways [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref019">19</xref>]. The AlkB homolog (ALKBH) enzymes are dioxygenases that directly reverse DNA alkylation damage caused by both endogenous and exogenous sources and help maintain genomic integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref021">21</xref>]. Interestingly, ALKBH overexpression in cancer promotes drug resistance, leading to poor prognosis in multiple cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref023">23</xref>]. For example, ALKBH2 overexpression induces cellular resistance to alkylating agent treatment in glioblastoma and promotes cancer progression in bladder cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref024">24</xref>]. Moreover, ALKBH3 overexpression promotes alkylation damage resistance in prostate cancer and apoptotic resistance in pancreatic cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref025">25</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref027">27</xref>]. In response to DNA alkylation damage, the Fe(II)dependent ALKBH enzymes use αKG as a key substrate to directly remove alkyl groups from DNA adducts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref021">21</xref>]. The requirement of αKG by the ALKBH enzymes to repair DNA alkylation damage underlines the potential crosstalk between cellular metabolism and the DNA damage repair pathway. Because glutamine catabolism directly contributes to cellular αKG pools in many cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref014">14</xref>], it will be of interest to examine whether glutamine deficiency affects the DNA repair function of the αKG-dependent ALKBH enzymes.</p>
<p>In this study, we found that glutamine deficiency inhibits the ALKBH enzymes from repairing DNA alkylation damage, leading to DNA damage in the absence of the genotoxic agent. Importantly, our results demonstrate that targeting glutamine metabolism significantly sensitizes cancer cells to alkylating agent treatments both in vitro and in vivo. Together, our study reveals a previously unidentified role of glutamine deficiency in modulating the DNA damage response and provides a molecular basis for combinational therapy using glutaminase inhibitors and alkylating agents.</p>

<title>Glutamine deficiency specifically triggers DNA damage accumulation independent of cell death</title>
<p>To determine the impact of glutamine deficiency on genomic integrity, we first asked whether glutamine depletion leads to accumulation of DNA damage. Mouse embryonic fibroblast (MEF) cells and prostate cancer PC3 cells were cultured in complete or glutamine free medium for 24 hours followed by immunofluorescence for γH2AX, an established biomarker for DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref028">28</xref>]. We found that glutamine withdrawal led to a significant induction of γH2AX in both MEF and PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Using immunoblotting, we found that low glutamine-induced γH2AX signal was both dose dependent and time dependent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Consistently, glutamine withdrawal resulted in striking accumulation of DNA damage as marked by γH2AX in multiple cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Compared to glutamine deprivation, starvation of any other amino acid failed to induce γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Unlike glutamine deprivation, deprivation of glucose for the same amount of time failed to induce γH2AX in both MEF and EB3 cells, supporting that glutamine deficiency specifically induces DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1D</xref>).</p>

<p>Although prolonged glutamine starvation triggers cell death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref029">29</xref>], γH2AX induction was detected when the majority of cells were still viable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). To further confirm that glutamine deficiency induces γH2AX independent of cell cycle arrest and cell death, we assessed γH2AX levels in MEF cells cultured in low glutamine conditions or low glucose conditions over time. Glutamine deficiency dramatically induced γH2AX on day 1 and peaked on day 2 when apoptotic cell death was not detected. In contrast, the γH2AX induction in low glucose conditions was marginal compared to low glutamine conditions and possibly caused by the activation of apoptotic cell death as marked by the induced cleaved poly (adenosine diphosphate-ribose) polymerase (PARP; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Interestingly, we found that low glutamine and low glucose inhibited cell proliferation to a similar extent, suggesting that cell cycle arrest may not significantly contribute to the DNA damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). In addition, immunofluorescence for γH2AX and the apoptotic marker, cleaved caspase-3, further revealed that the majority of γH2AX-positive cells were not apoptotic cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). To further confirm that glutamine deprivation-induced γH2AX is independent of apoptosis, we used <italic>Bax</italic><sup>-/-</sup> /<italic>Bak</italic><sup>-/-</sup> MEF cells, which lack apoptotic machinery (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s001">S1D Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref030">30</xref>]. We found that glutamine deprivation still promotes γH2AX in apoptosis-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1F</xref>). Lastly, although γH2AX is a reliable marker for DNA damage, γH2AX is also induced during DNA replication stress [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref031">31</xref>] and cellular death [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref032">32</xref>]. To examine whether glutamine depletion triggers physical breaks in DNA, we performed immunofluorescence to detect γH2AX and 53BP1 colocalizations, which occur at DNA double strand breaks (DSB) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref034">34</xref>]. Similar to doxorubicin (Doxo) treatment that induced DSBs, glutamine depletion triggered γH2AX and 53BP1 foci colocalization in both MEF and PC3 cells, demonstrating that glutamine depletion can result in DSBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1G</xref>). Consistently, DNA damage–induced signaling pathways are increased upon glutamine deprivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">Fig 1H</xref>). Taken together, these results demonstrate that glutamine deficiency specifically triggers DNA damage accumulation independent of cell death.</p>

<title>Inhibition of glutamine metabolism with a glutaminase inhibitor triggers DNA damage accumulation both in vitro and in vivo</title>
<p>Glutamine withdrawal not only hinders glutaminolysis but also affects other functions of intracellular glutamine including, but not limited to, protein synthesis and mTOR regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref036">36</xref>]. To determine whether inhibition of glutaminolysis alone can trigger DNA damage, we assayed for the induction of γH2AX by immunofluorescence in PC3 cells after treatment with the glutaminase inhibitor, 6-Diazo-5-oxo-L-norleucine (DON). The drug treatment significantly induces γH2AX in PC3 cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). In addition, the glutaminase inhibition in PC3 cells induced robust DSBs as indicated by the γH2AX and 53BP1 colocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g002">Fig 2C</xref>). Moreover, different glutaminase inhibitors, such as DON and Bis-2-(5-phenylacetamido-1,3,4-thiadiazol-2-yl)ethyl sulfide (BPTES), induced γH2AX in multiple cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g002">Fig 2D</xref>). Importantly, DON and BPTES also induced DNA damage in apoptosis-deficient cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g002">Fig 2E</xref>). To determine whether inhibition of glutamine metabolism also triggers DNA damage in vivo, we treated HT1080 xenograft tumors with DON. Immunohistochemistry (IHC) staining revealed that DON treatment dramatically induced γH2AX levels, but not cleaved caspase-3 levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g002">Fig 2F</xref>). Using immunoblotting, we also confirmed dramatic γH2AX induction in the DON-treated tumors compared to control-treated tumors in HT1080, PC3, and HCT116 xenograft tumors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g002">Fig 2G–2I</xref>). Therefore, similar to glutamine starvation, inhibition of glutamine metabolism also triggered DNA damage both in vitro and in vivo.</p>

<title>Glutamine deficiency inhibits ALKBH activity and induces endogenous DNA alkylation damage</title>
<p>ALKBH enzymes require αKG as an essential cofactor to repair DNA alkylation damage and maintain genomic integrity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref038">38</xref>]. Because glutamine deficiency leads to dramatic reduction of intracellular αKG levels, we next investigated if such metabolic stress inhibits the DNA damage repair by ALKBH enzymes. We first performed enzymatic activity assays for ALKBH3 using extracted intracellular metabolites from cells cultured in complete medium or low-glutamine medium. Both αKG and the extracted metabolites from control cells robustly promoted the ALKBH3 enzyme to remove methyl groups from 3-methyl cytosine (3meC) adducts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref>). In contrast, extracted metabolites from glutamine-deprived cells failed to support ALKBH3 enzymatic activity in both MEF and EB3 cell lines, suggesting that glutamine deprivation inhibits the activity of ALKBH enzymes through the alteration of intracellular metabolites, but not other signaling pathways. To further determine whether glutamine deficiency inhibits ALKBH enzymes to repair alkylated DNA adducts in the cells, we performed dot blot analysis with a 3meC-specific antibody to measure global genomic 3meC in cells cultured in complete medium or glutamine-free medium. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g004">Fig 4C</xref>, glutamine deficiency significantly induced 3meC in cells to a similar extent as methyl methanesulfonate (MMS) treatment, consistent with the ALKBH activity and γH2AX levels. Importantly, glutamine deficiency–induced 3meC accumulation was largely rescued by DM-αKG supplementation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g004">Fig 4D</xref>). Furthermore, glutamine deprivation failed to induce further alkylation damage, as marked by 3meC levels in the ALKBH3 depleted cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p>

<title>Glutamine deficiency sensitizes cells to alkylating-agent–induced DNA damage</title>
<p>We next sought to determine whether glutamine deficiency can sensitize cells to alkylating-agent–induced DNA damage. We cultured cells that were initially exposed to the alkylating agent, MMS, for 1 hour in complete medium or low glutamine medium. Induction of γH2AX was absent in the nontreated cells but was present after MMS treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). For cells cultured in complete medium, the γH2AX signal peaked 3 hours after MMS treatment but diminished after 6 hours upon removal of the drug. In contrast, γH2AX signals in low glutamine conditions remained high after the drug removal even after 9 hours later, while low glutamine alone at 9 hours had no effect on γH2AX (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g005">Fig 5A</xref>). These results indicate that low glutamine conditions inhibit the ability of ALKBH enzymes to repair DNA damage caused by the alkylating agent. Consistently, immunofluorescence of γH2AX revealed that glutamine deficiency potentiated DNA damage caused by the alkylating agent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g005">Fig 5B</xref>). Interestingly, glutamine starvation did not affect the DNA damage caused by other classes of chemotherapy, including the topoisomerase inhibitor Doxo and CPT, suggesting that glutamine deficiency only affects alkylation damage repair, but not other DNA damage repair pathways (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g005">Fig 5C</xref>). To further determine whether glutamine deficiency attenuates ALKBH activities to repair methylated DNA adducts upon alkylating agent treatment, we cultured alkylating agent–treated cells in either complete or glutamine-free medium and measured global genomic 3meC levels. The 3meC levels increased after MMS treatment for 1 hour. The drug was then washed out and cells were cultured in complete medium or glutamine-free medium for 8 hours. Intriguingly, MMS treatment in combination with glutamine starvation at 8 hours resulted in the highest induction of 3meC compared to the single treatments, highlighting that glutamine deficiency potentiates alkylating-agent–induced DNA damage by directly interfering with the ALKBH enzymes to repair alkylation damage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g005">Fig 5D</xref>). Furthermore, the addition of cell permeable DM-αKG largely blocked MMS-induced γH2AX, suggesting that glutamine deficiency potentiates the MMS effect via αKG reduction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g005">Fig 5E</xref>).</p>

<title>Inhibition of glutamine metabolism hypersensitizes cells to alkylating agents</title>
<p>Alkylating agents, one of the earliest classes of chemotherapy, remain as frontline therapies for multiple types of aggressive cancer [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref039">39</xref>]. To investigate the effect of glutamine deficiency on cellular response to alkylating agents, we treated Ras-transformed MEF cells with different glutaminase inhibitors in combination with alkylating agents. Inhibition of glutamine metabolism with either DON or BPTES hyper-sensitized cancer cells to MMS treatment at multiple doses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Importantly, low glutamine conditions and glutaminase inhibitor treatment had similar effects on cellular response to alkylating agents, suggesting that these glutaminase inhibitors function via inhibition of glutamine catabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Consistently, impairing glutamine metabolism in combination with the alkylating agent resulted in robust apoptotic cell death compared to the single treatment as measured by cleaved caspase-3, cleaved PARP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6B</xref>), and Annexin/PI staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6C and 6D</xref>). Interestingly, the glutaminase inhibitor treatment failed to sensitize cancer cells to other DNA damaging agents, such as Doxo or CPT, indicating that inhibition of glutamine metabolism only affects methylation damage repairs, but not DSB repairs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Additionally, we confirmed the striking synergistic killing seen in human fibrosarcoma cells HT1080. The glutaminase inhibitor BPTES significantly sensitized cancer cells to both MMS and the clinical alkylating agent lomustine (CCNU), confirming that the combination works on a broad range of alkylating agents and across a broad range of cancers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6E and 6F</xref>). Overexpression of ALKBH enzyme in prostate cancer and glioblastoma results in cell resistance to alkylating agents, leading to poor prognosis, as shown in multiple studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref024">24</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref027">27</xref>]. Therefore, we further tested whether inhibition of glutamine metabolism can indirectly inhibit ALKBH and restore cancer cell sensitivity to alkylating agents. Significantly, the combination treatment of MMS and BPTES resulted in a striking synergistic killing of PC3 cells, which have high expression levels of ALKBH3 compared to other prostate cancer cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref027">27</xref>]. Moreover, we confirmed that the ALKBH enzymes primarily mediated the combinational effect because the knockdown of ALKBH3 was sufficient to sensitize the PC3 cells to alkylating agents and abolish the effect of glutaminase inhibitor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). In addition, we also found that αKG plays a critical role in cell survival upon alkylating agent treatment as the addition of DM-αKG prevented MMS-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">Fig 6I</xref>). Importantly, exogenous DM-αKG abolished the ability of low glutamine to sensitize cells to MMS treatment, suggesting that glutamine deprivation sensitizes cancer cells to alkylating agent via the depletion of αKG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s006">S6A and S6B Fig</xref>).</p>

Once the tumors reached an average tumor size of 60 mm<sup>3</sup>, the mice were treated with PBS control, DON, MMS, or a combination of DON and MMS, and the tumor volumes were measured over time. MMS treatment alone and a low dose of DON treatment did not dramatically affect tumor growth. However, the combination treatment significantly impaired tumor growth compared to the single drug treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). We also found that DON treatment significantly depleted αKG levels in tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s007">S7A Fig</xref>). Additionally, IHC analysis with the proliferation marker Ki-67 revealed that combination drug treatment effectively inhibited cancer cell growth, while single drug treatment only had a marginal effect on cell proliferation, consistent with tumor growth over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). While MMS or DON single treatments marginally induced γH2AX, the combination of DON and MMS treatment significantly induced γH2AX levels, suggesting that glutaminase inhibitor enhanced the DNA damage induced by the alkylating agent in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). To further confirm the potential clinical applicability of the drug combination, we performed an additional in vivo experiment with MMS and CB-839, a specific and effective glutaminase inhibitor, which is currently in clinical trials. To determine the combinational effect on tumor growth, mice harboring tumors were treated with 200 mg/kg of CB-839 once a day, which is half the dose used in the previous publication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref040">40</xref>]. We found that the CB-839 treatment significantly depleted αKG levels in tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Importantly, combination treatment suppressed tumor growth and reduced tumor weight more effectively than the single drug treatment alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Together, these results suggest that inhibition of glutamine metabolism offers a substantial therapeutic benefit when combined with alkylating agents.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Poorly organized vasculature regions of tumors are often subjected to glutamine limitation, yet the impact of the metabolic stress on tumor development and drug response remains largely unknown. In this study, we found that glutamine deficiency inhibits ALKBH enzymes from repairing DNA alkylation damage. As a result, glutamine deficiency triggers robust DNA damage accumulation both in vitro and in vivo (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g001">1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g002">2</xref>). Importantly, inhibition of glutamine metabolism with small molecule inhibitors hyper-sensitizes cancer cells to alkylating agents both in cell culture and animal models (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g006">6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g007">7</xref>). Together, the study reveals previously unidentified roles of glutamine deficiency in potentiating genomic instability and modulating drug response in cancer.</p>
<p>We identified a novel crosstalk between glutamine metabolism and the DNA damage response. Our data reveal that glutamine deficiency, through diminishing αKG levels, inhibits the DNA repair ALKBH enzymes (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g004">4</xref>). It is well established that glutamine can be diverted to synthesize the TCA intermediate αKG in many cancer cell types to fuel the truncated TCA cycle and maintain redox homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref041">41</xref>]. However, recent studies indicated that glutamine’s contribution to the TCA is both environment and tumor specific. For example, although it has been shown that glutamine is not a major source of αKG in gliomas and lung tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref043">43</xref>], other studies support that glutamine metabolism is the main source of TCA intermediates in vivo in liver tumors, kidney tumors, and melanoma [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref045">45</xref>]. Indeed, metabolomics analysis using <sup>13</sup>C-glutamine tracing have demonstrated that αKG is directly derived from glutamine in MYC-driven tumors and KRas-driven tumors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref037">37</xref>]. Here, we measured αKG levels upon glutaminase inhibitor treatment in vivo and found that both DON treatment and CB-839 treatment significantly reduced intracellular αKG levels in prostate cancer xenograft tumors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2002810.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In addition, our results indicate that low-glutamine–mediated αKG depletion blocks the DNA repair activity of ALKBH (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g003">3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g004">4</xref>). To repair DNA methylation damage, the ALKBH enzymes transfer a methyl group from the DNA adduct onto αKG and release succinate and formaldehyde as by-products [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref020">20</xref>]. We demonstrated that the reduced αKG availability is sufficient to inhibit ALKBH activity leading to both endogenous DNA alkylation damage and sensitivity to alkylating agents. Importantly, this effect is only specific to glutamine limitation, but not genotoxic stress or glucose starvation. Consistently, the oncometabolite 2-hydroxyglutarate, produced by mutated isocitrate dehydrogenase (IDH) enzymes, is an αKG structural analog that competitively binds and inhibits many αKG dependent enzymes including ALKBH [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref046">46</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref047">47</xref>].</p>
<p>Our results provide insights into the mechanism by which metabolic stress, such as glutamine deficiency, contributes to tumorigenesis. It is well established that glutamine metabolism via GSH production contributes to the suppression of ROS and ROS-induced DNA damage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref049">49</xref>]. Surprisingly, we now show that glutamine metabolism plays an important role in maintaining genomic integrity by maintaining the ALKBH activity instead of suppressing ROS accumulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g003">Fig 3</xref>). A variety of alkylating agents from the environment as well as by-products of intracellular metabolism, such as S-adenosylmethionine (SAM) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref050">50</xref>] often lead to intracellular alkylation damage, which is estimated to be equivalent to the exposure of 20 nM MMS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref039">39</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref051">51</xref>]. The ALKBH enzymes contribute significantly to the repair of these sites of alkylation damage, as ALKBH3 knockdown alone is sufficient to induce alkylated DNA adducts in some cancers, as demonstrated in previous reports and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2002810.g004">Fig 4</xref> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref027">27</xref>]. Our data indicate that glutamine deficiency in tumors inhibits the repair of endogenous DNA damage mediated by the ALKBH enzymes leading to the accumulation of alkylated DNA adducts and DSBs. Thus, metabolic stress, such as glutamine deficiency, may contribute to genomic instability and promote tumorigenesis.</p>
<p>Lastly, our study provides an important molecular basis for combinational therapy to sensitize cells to alkylating agent treatment using glutaminase inhibitors. Alkylating agents remain important frontline antineoplastic drugs for many highly aggressive and metastatic cancers despite high toxicity and carcinogenic potential [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref039">39</xref>]. However, malignant cells often become resistant to such treatments due to robust DNA repair machineries [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref052">52</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref053">53</xref>]. For example, ALKBH enzymes have been shown to be overexpressed in some human cancers to promote drug resistance and tumor progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref024">24</xref>]. Our study demonstrates that targeting glutamine metabolism inhibits the DNA repair activity of the ALKBH enzymes and sensitizes cancer cells to alkylating agent treatment. Therefore, this novel combination drug treatment can improve efficacy and minimize the side effects of alkylating agents. In addition, glutaminase inhibitor treatment, by indirectly inhibiting the ALKBH enzymes, may serve as an effective strategy to block the oncogenic function of ALKBH enzymes and restore cancer cell sensitivity to alkylating agents. Moreover, a new glutaminase inhibitor, CB-839, is well tolerated in patients and has passed phase 1 clinical trials for multiple cancers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2002810.ref055">55</xref>]. Our data here provide a new direction to use CB-839 clinically to sensitize cancer cells, particularly cancers with ALKBH overexpression, to alkylating agents.</p>
