        <p>Several critical events dictate the successful establishment of nascent vasculature in yolk sac and in the developing embryos. These include aggregation of angioblasts to form the primitive vascular plexus, followed by the proliferation, differentiation, migration, and coalescence of endothelial cells. Although transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) is known to regulate various aspects of vascular development, the signaling mechanism of TGF-β remains unclear. Here we show that homeodomain interacting protein kinases, HIPK1 and HIPK2, are transcriptional corepressors that regulate TGF-β–dependent angiogenesis during embryonic development. Loss of HIPK1 and HIPK2 leads to marked up-regulations of several potent angiogenic genes, including <italic>Mmp10</italic> and <italic>Vegf</italic>, which result in excessive endothelial proliferation and poor adherens junction formation. This robust phenotype can be recapitulated by siRNA knockdown of <italic>Hipk1</italic> and <italic>Hipk2</italic> in human umbilical vein endothelial cells, as well as in endothelial cell-specific TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) conditional mutants. The effects of HIPK proteins are mediated through its interaction with MEF2C, and this interaction can be further enhanced by TGF-β in a TAK1-dependent manner. Remarkably, TGF-β-TAK1 signaling activates HIPK2 by phosphorylating a highly conserved tyrosine residue Y-361 within the kinase domain. Point mutation in this tyrosine completely eliminates the effect of HIPK2 as a transcriptional corepressor in luciferase assays. Our results reveal a previously unrecognized role of HIPK proteins in connecting TGF-β signaling pathway with the transcriptional programs critical for angiogenesis in early embryonic development.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>An essential step during early embryonic development is to establish elaborate vascular networks that provide nutrients to ensure the proper growth of the embryos. This process, known as angiogenesis, requires coordinated regulation of cell proliferation, migration, and differentiation in endothelial cells, which provide the inner-most linings of blood vessels. It is well accepted that transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) and its downstream signal pathways are required to regulate endothelial cell growth, but the exact mechanisms remain poorly characterized. Using mouse genetics and in vitro angiogenesis assays, we show that transcriptional cofactors in the homeodomain interacting protein kinase (HIPK) family are activated by TGF-β to control the expression of target genes that regulate proliferation and adherent junction formation in endothelial cells. Our study also identifies a highly conserved tyrosine residue in HIPK proteins that is required to transduce TGF-β signal. These results provide new insights into the mechanism of TGF-β signaling in angiogenesis, and how this process may be exploited to develop therapeutic targets that control angiogenesis during development and in disease conditions.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Vascular morphogenesis is controlled by an intricate interplay of extrinsic factors and their downstream signaling mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Carmeliet1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Rossant1">[2]</xref>. At the early stage of vascular development, several critical events dictate the successful establishment of nascent vasculature in yolk sac and in the developing embryos. These include aggregation of angioblasts to form the primitive vascular plexus, followed by the proliferation, differentiation, migration, and coalescence of endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Rossant1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Coultas1">[3]</xref>. Subsequently, branching morphogenesis and arteriovenous specification further facilitate the maturation of an interconnecting and fully functional network of blood vessels to provide nutrients to the entire organism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-You1">[4]</xref>. Many of the mechanisms that govern the normal vascular development can also be recapitulated in angiogenesis that occurs during disease conditions, including tumorigenesis, metastasis, stroke, and tissue repair after injury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Carmeliet1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Qin1">[5]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Transforming growth factor–β (TGF-β) represents a family of highly conserved cytokines that have profound effects in regulating epithelial–mesenchymal transition (EMT), vascular morphogenesis, and cellular and organismal functions during development and in disease conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Massague1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Moustakas1">[8]</xref>. Indeed, genetic analyses in mouse and human have shown that mutations involving components of the TGF-β signaling pathway affect many aspects of vascular morphogenesis during development and in adult life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-tenDijke1">[9]</xref>. For instance, loss-of-function analyses of TGF-β1, TGF-β type I receptor ALK1 or ALK5, or TGF-β type II receptor (TβRII) in mouse reveal a distinct role of each of these signaling components in regulating the proliferation, differentiation, and survival of endothelial cells and smooth muscle cells. These analyses further indicate that the outcome of the deletion involving different components of the TGF-β signaling pathway can be cell context-dependent. Furthermore, the timing of targeted deletion and the presence of genetic modifiers can also affect the phenotypic manifestations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Pardali1">[7]</xref>. With respect to the roles of TGF-β signaling in endothelial functions, TGF-β type I receptors ALK1 and ALK5 have been shown to have opposite effects, with ALK1 contributing to the proliferation and migration of endothelial cells and ALK5 inducing the maturation of blood vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Goumans1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Goumans2">[11]</xref>. While the underlying mechanisms for distinct effects of ALK1 and ALK5 are still unclear, it is possible that the signaling downstream of the TGF-β type I receptors may diverge due to the involvement of Smad and non-Smad-dependent mechanisms that regulate the transcription of angiogenesis-related genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Massague2">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Homeodomain interacting protein kinase 2 (HIPK2) is a transcriptional cofactor in the downstream of TGF-β/BMP signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Zhang1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Jin1">[17]</xref>. Interestingly, loss of HIPK2 reduces cellular responses to TGF-β during neuronal development and in mouse models of renal fibrosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Zhang1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Jin1">[17]</xref>. While mice lacking HIPK1 show no detectable defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Kondo1">[18]</xref>, simultaneous loss of HIPK1 and HIPK2 leads to severe growth retardation and early embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Isono1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Aikawa1">[20]</xref>. Although the study by Aikawa and colleagues has implicated vascular defects in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> double mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Aikawa1">[20]</xref>, the detailed mechanism responsible for the phenotypes remains unclear. It is also unclear if HIPK1 and HIPK2 can cooperatively regulate TGF-β signaling and thereby contribute to the angiogenesis during early embryonic development.</p>
      <p>Here, we show that HIPK1 and HIPK2 cooperatively suppress the expression of angiogenic genes that are critical for endothelial proliferation and adherens junction formation. Loss of HIPK1 and HIPK2 leads to a marked up-regulation of VEGF and MMP10, and early embryonic lethality due to excessive proliferation and poor adherens junction formation in the endothelial cells. Consistent with these results, siRNA knockdown of <italic>Hipk1</italic> and <italic>Hipk2</italic> results in similar phenotype in human umbilical vein endothelial cells (HUVECs). Furthermore, endothelial cell-specific deletion of TβRII results in phenotypes similar to those in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants. The mechanism of HIPK1 and HIPK2 involves their interaction with HDAC7 to suppress MEF2C-mediated transcriptional activation of <italic>Mmp10</italic> and <italic>Vegf</italic>. Importantly, the activity of HIPK critically depends on the TGF-β-TAK1 mechanism, which promotes the phosphorylation of HIPK2 on a highly conserved tyrosine residue in the kinase domain. Together, these results provide novel insights into the role of HIPK1 and HIPK2 in the signal transduction mechanism downstream of TGF-β and the transcriptional control of angiogenic gene expression during the critical stages of vascular morphogenesis.</p>

        <title>Increased Proliferation and Poor Adherens Junction Formation in Endothelial Cells Lacking HIPK1 and HIPK2</title>
        <p>To determine if HIPK1 and HIPK2 cooperatively regulate gene expression, we analyzed vascular development in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants. In contrast to the previous report <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Aikawa1">[20]</xref>, CD31 (PECAM-1) staining in the yolk sacs of E9.5 <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants showed an excessive growth of endothelial cells, with reduced avascular areas, reduced vascular branch points, increased fragment length, and a significant increase in BrdU incorporation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g001">Figure 1A–E,H</xref>).

Electron microscopy further revealed that the adherens junctions in the endothelial cells of <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants were significantly smaller and showed reduced density per unit area compared to those in control (<italic>Hipk1<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g001">Figure 1I–K</xref>). Despite these defects, the endothelial cells in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants showed no evidence of disruption or disorganization, and blood cells remained confined within the vessels with no evidence of vascular leakiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g001">Figure 1I–I</xref>'). Another prominent phenotype in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants was the absence of blood vessel growing into the neural tubes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g001">Figure 1G–G</xref>'), which may have contributed to the increase in cell death and reduced proliferation in the neural progenitors in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Isono1">[19]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To investigate the molecular bases of the <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutant phenotype, we used the CodeLink Mouse Whole Genome Bioarrays to characterize gene expression profiles in E9.5 control (<italic>Hipk1<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>), <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2<sup>+/+</sup></italic>, <italic>Hipk1<sup>+/</sup></italic><sup>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup>, and <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> embryos.

        <title>HIPK1 and HIPK2 Suppress MEF2C-Mediated Transcriptional Control of <italic>Mmp10</italic> and <italic>Vegf</italic> Expression</title>
        <p>To further investigate the mechanisms of HIPK1/2, we focused on the transcription of <italic>Mmp10</italic> and <italic>Vegf</italic> because of their well-established functions in angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Rossant1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Chang1">[25]</xref>. Previous studies indicate that MEF2C promotes the transcription of <italic>Mmp10</italic> by binding to the upstream promoter. Interestingly, transcriptional corepressor HDAC7 suppresses MEF2C-dependent activation of <italic>Mmp10</italic> and that loss of HDAC7 leads to severe vascular phenotype and embryonic lethality similar to those in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Chang1">[25]</xref>. Since HIPK proteins have been implicated as transcriptional corepressors, we reasoned that HIPK1 and HIPK2 might suppress the transcription of <italic>Mmp10</italic> through its participation in the transcriptional complex involving HDAC7-MEF2C. Due to the role of HIPK2 in the TGF-β signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Zhang1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Harada1">[15]</xref>, it is possible that HIPK1/2 may regulate <italic>Mmp10</italic> gene expression through Smad-dependent mechanisms. Alternatively, HIPK1/2 may function downstream of TGF-β downstream kinase, TAK1, which regulates vascular development during early embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Jadrich1">[26]</xref>. Within the 1 kb upstream regulatory sequences of the <italic>Mmp10</italic> gene, we identified one Smad-binding element (SBE) site in position −221 to −215, close to the previously reported MEF2 recognition motif (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TAAAATA</named-content>) (position −80 to −73) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Interestingly, however, unlike MEF2C, Smad2/3/4 by itself did not activate the transcriptional activity of <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Rather, Smad2/3/4 modestly suppressed both wild-type <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter and <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> mutating the SBE site (<italic>Mmp10-mSBE-Luc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s002">Figure S2</xref>), suggesting that the inhibitory effects of Smad2/3/4 on <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter were most likely nonspecific. Furthermore, the presence of TGF-β did not change these results (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In contrast to Smad2/3/4, MEF2C showed similar effects in promoting the transcriptional activity of wild-type <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> and <italic>Mmp10-mSBE-Luc</italic>, whereas mutating the MEF2-binding elements in <italic>Mmp10</italic>-luciferase reporter completely abolished the effects of MEF2C on this reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Chang1">[25]</xref>. These results supported the idea that the SBE site in the promoter of <italic>Mmp10</italic> was dispensable for MEF2C-mediated regulation of <italic>Mmp10</italic> gene expression, and that HIPK2 may regulate <italic>Mmp10</italic> transcription via MEF2C-dependent mechanism.</p>
        <p>Consistent with its role as a transcriptional corepressor, HIPK2 showed a dose-dependent suppression of MEF2C-mediated activation of the <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). The corepressor effects of HIPK2 required its kinase activity since the kinase inactive mutant HIPK2-K221A failed to suppress MEF2C-dependent activation of <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter. Furthermore, the corepressor activity of HIPK2 required the protein–protein interaction domain (amino acids 582–898) because HIPK2 mutant protein lacking the C-terminal sequence from amino acid 898 to 1189 (HIPK2-Δ898) could still suppress <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter, whereas further deletion from amino acid 582 to 1189 (HIPK2-Δ582) completely abolished the corepressor effects of HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Similar to HIPK2, HIPK1 could also suppress the MEF2C-dependent activation of <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter. Although HIPK1 by itself was less effective compared to HIPK2 (unpublished data), HIPK1 and HIPK2 showed additive effects in suppressing the <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). To further characterize the transcriptional corepressor effects of HIPK2, we used siRNA to knock down the endogenous <italic>Hipk2</italic> expression in HEK293T cells and showed that lowering HIPK2 levels resulted in further up-regulation of MEF2C-mediated activation of <italic>Mmp10</italic>-<italic>Luc</italic> activity without affecting the levels of MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Together, these results supported the novel role of HIPK1 and HIPK2 as transcriptional corepressors in MEF2C-mediated activation of <italic>Mmp10</italic> expression.</p>
        <p>To determine if MEF2C and HIPK2 can also regulate the transcription of <italic>Vegf</italic>, we identified a potential MEF2 binding site in the <italic>Vegf</italic> locus (position −2679 to −2672) and generated a luciferase reporter that contained 4.5 Kb promoter sequence of <italic>Vegf</italic> gene (<italic>Vegf-Luc</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2H</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Using similar approaches, we showed that MEF2C could indeed activate <italic>Vegf-Luc</italic> activity. Interestingly, MEF2C-mediated activation of <italic>Vegf-Luc</italic> could be suppressed by HIPK2 in a dose-dependent manner. Similar to the results from <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic>, mutating the MEF2 binding element in <italic>Vegf-Luc</italic> reporter almost completely abolished the effects of MEF2C and HIPK2 (<italic>mVegf-Luc</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). Furthermore, HIPK1 and HIPK2 also showed additive effects in suppressing the <italic>Vegf-Luc</italic> activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2I</xref>). Although the effect of HIPK2 on <italic>Vegf-Luc</italic> reporter was not as robust as in <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic>, these results were consistent with the previous results that the transcriptional controls of <italic>Vegf</italic> expression are a tightly regulated process such that loss of one <italic>Vegf</italic> allele or a slight increase in <italic>Vegf</italic> expression could result in marked abnormalities in angiogenesis during early embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Carmeliet2">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Ferrara1">[28]</xref>.</p>

        <title>TGF-β Promotes Corepressor Complex Formation Between MEF2C and HIPK2 in the Regulation of <italic>Mmp10</italic> Expression</title>
        <p>To further characterize the role of HIPK2 in the transcriptional control of <italic>Mmp10</italic> expression, we expressed MEF2C and HIPK2 in HEK293T cells and used co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) to show that HIPK2 could indeed be detected in a complex with MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, upper panels). In addition, similar co-IP experiments using protein lysates from <italic>wild-type</italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEF) also showed that the endogenous HIPK2 proteins could be detected in a complex with MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, bottom panel). Consistent with the requirement of HIPK2 kinase activity in the transcriptional control of <italic>Mmp10</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figure 2E</xref>), the protein complex formation between kinase-inactive HIPK2-K221A and MEF2C was significantly reduced compared to <italic>wild-type</italic> HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3A</xref>), whereas the MEF2C protein levels were comparable in cells expressing wild-type HIPK2 and kinase inactive HIPK2-K221A. The trace amount of MEF2C detected in the complex with HIPK2-K221A showed smaller molecular mass, suggesting that HIPK2 may affect the posttranslational modifications of MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Indeed, treatment of alkaline phosphatase abolished the upward shift of MEF2C by HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s005">Figure S5</xref>), supporting the idea that the stable complex formation between HIPK2 and MEF2C required phosphorylation of MEF2C. To further characterize the involvement of HIPK2 and MEF2C in the regulation of <italic>Mmp10</italic> gene expression, we performed chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays using native chromatin extracts from HUVEC and showed that endogenous MEF2C, HIPK1, and HIPK2 proteins were bound to the MEF2 site on the <italic>Mmp10</italic> promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). Similar results could also be detected in mouse brain microvascular endothelial (bEnd.3) cells (unpublished data).</p>

            <p>(A) Co-IP assays using protein lysates from HEK293T cells expressing HIPK2 and MEF2C show that HIPK2 can be detected in a protein complex with MEF2C (upper panels). Similar protein complex formation between endogenous HIPK2 and MEF2C can also be detected in <italic>wild-type</italic> MEF cells (lower panel).

        <p>Given that HDAC7 suppresses MEF2-mediated expression of <italic>Mmp10</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Chang1">[25]</xref>, we reasoned that HIPK2 might interact with the HDAC7-MEF2 transcriptional corepressor complex. Indeed, co-IP results using protein lysates from HEK293T cells overexpressing HIPK2, HDAC7, and MEF2C showed that HIPK2 and HDAC7 could each be detected in protein complexes with MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Interestingly, however, the interaction between HIPK2 and MEF2C appeared to be reduced, but not completely eliminated, by the increasing amount of HDAC7. Conversely, the interaction between HDAC7 and MEF2 could also be reduced by the progressive increase in HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These results suggested that the recruitment of transcriptional corepressor complex to MEF2C might depend on the equilibrium between HIPK2 and HDAC7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Lemon1">[29]</xref>. Indeed, increasing the level of HIPK2 led to a progressive suppression of MEF2C-mediated activation of <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter activity in the presence of HDAC7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). To further determine if the corepressor activity of HIPK2 was dependent on HDAC7, we used a HDAC7 mutant that lacked the MEF2 interacting domain (HDAC7-ΔMEF) and therefore could not suppress MEF2-mediated transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Chang1">[25]</xref>. Interestingly, HIPK2 could suppress <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> activity in the presence of HDAC7-ΔMEF, suggesting that the transcriptional corepressor activity of HIPK2 could be independent of HDAC7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). Consistent with these results, HIPK2 continued to suppress MEF2-mediated <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> activity in HEK293T cells in which the endogenous HDAC7 expression was reduced by siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Similarly, HDAC7 could still suppress the <italic>Mmp10-Luc</italic> reporter activity in HEK293T cells treated with <italic>Hipk2</italic> siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3E</xref>).</p>
        <p>Several previous studies have indicated that HIPK2 and TAK1 cooperatively regulate the transcriptional activity of c-Myb through phosphorylation and proteasome-dependent degradation in the Wnt-1 signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-KaneiIshii1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Kurahashi1">[31]</xref>.

Consistent with this idea, co-IP assays showed that the presence of TAK1 and TGF-β enhanced the interaction between MEF2C and HIPK2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3F</xref>). Moreover, the presence of TAK1 and TGF-β enhanced the corepressor effects of HIPK2 on MEF2C-mediated activation of the <italic>Mmp10</italic> luciferase reporter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). Consistent with these results, co-IP assays in HUVEC cells detected protein complex formation among endogenous HIPK2, TAK1, and MEF2C under normal growth conditions.

To further characterize the role of HIPK2 in TGF-β signaling pathway, we performed immunoprecipitation–in vitro kinase (IP-IVK) assays and found that, under normal growth condition, HIPK2 showed a basal level of γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP incorporation. The addition of TGF-β further promoted the γ-<sup>32</sup>P-ATP incorporation in HIPK2 by 2- to 3-fold within 30′ to 1 h after treatment and remained higher than basal level for 24 h (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). This effect was completely abolished in kinase-inactive HIPK2-K221A mutants or by TGF-β type I receptor ALK5 inhibitor SB431542 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>).

Indeed, co-IP assays showed that TAK1 and HIPK2 formed a protein complex, and that the TAK1-HIPK2 complex formation could be further enhanced by TGF-β treatment (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3F,H</xref>). These results were further supported by immunofluorescent confocal microscopy showing that TGF-β treatment promoted co-localization of HIPK2 and phospho-TAK1 in the nucleus of HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

        <title>TGF-β-TAK1 Signaling Phosphorylates HIPK2 on the Highly Conserved Tyrosine-361 Residue in the Kinase Domain</title>
        <p>The robust effects of TGF-β-TAK1 on HIPK2 phosphorylation raised the possibility that TGF-β could induce phosphorylation on specific amino acids in HIPK2 and thereby influence its transcriptional corepressor effects. Examinations of the amino acid sequence in the activation loop of the kinase domain of HIPK2 revealed a region from positions 346 to 371 that were highly conserved in HIPK1, HIPK2, and HIPK3 and among other species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g005">Figure 5A,B</xref>). Since phosphorylation in the tripartite Ser-Thr-Tyr residues in positions 359, 360, and 361 of HIPK2 are similar to those identified in the activation loop of other MAP kinases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Akella1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Pearson1">[37]</xref>, we reasoned that TGF-β or TAK1 might promote phosphorylation on these amino acids in HIPK2.

        <p>To further confirm that TGF-β-TAK1 promotes the phosphorylation of HIPK2 on Y361, we used a phospho-Y361–specific antibody (HIPK2-P-Y361) in Western blot analyses with cell lysates from HIPK2-TAK1–expressing HEK293T cells treated with or without TGF-β (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g006">Figure 6A</xref>).

      <p>Perturbations to the TGF-β signaling mechanisms are known to have serious impacts on cardiovascular development in mice and in human diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Pardali1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-tenDijke1">[9]</xref>. The manifestations of mouse mutants with targeted deletion in TGF-β signaling components, however, are quite complex and, in some instances, seemingly conflicting. One possible contributing factor to such complexity is that different TGF-β receptors can trigger multiple, divergent downstream signaling via Smad and non-Smad-dependent mechanisms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Massague2">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Derynck1">[39]</xref>. In addition, the temporal and context-dependent effects of TGF-β on different cell types in the vasculature can further contribute to the final phenotypic outcomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Pardali1">[7]</xref>. TGF-β is known to either promote or antagonize endothelial proliferation and migration during vasculogenesis. Although the disparate outcomes of TGF-β are likely due to the differences in how TGF-β type I receptors ALK1 and ALK5 transduce its downstream signals, the exact mechanisms downstream of these receptors are not entirely clear <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Goumans1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Goumans2">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results reveal a previously unrecognized mechanism involving the cooperative role of HIPK1 and HIPK2 in the downstream of TGF-β–TAK1 signaling pathway that regulates the expression of a number of potent angiogenic genes during early embryonic development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g008">Figure 8</xref>). First, based on the morphological analyses and gene expression profiling in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants, and the results from siRNA knockdown of <italic>Hipk1</italic> and <italic>Hipk2</italic> in Matrigel angiogenesis assays using HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g001">Figures 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g007">7</xref>), our data indicate that HIPK1 and HIPK2 act cooperatively to regulate a set of angiogenic genes, including <italic>Mmp10</italic> and <italic>Vegf</italic>, that are critical for the early stage of vascular development. This is further supported by a series of in vitro biochemical assays that validate HIPK2 and HDAC7 as important transcriptional corepressors that regulate the expression of <italic>Mmp10</italic> and <italic>Vegf</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">3</xref>). Consistent with these results, EM analyses also show that the endothelial cells in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants exhibit defects in the adherens junction formation similar to those described in <italic>Hdac7</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g001">Figure 1I–K</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Chang1">[25]</xref>. While HIPK2 and HDAC7 have synergistic effects in suppressing the transcription of <italic>Mmp10</italic>, each can work independently to suppress MEF2C-mediated gene expression. Surprisingly, the effect of HIPK2 and HDAC7 in MEF2C-mediated transcriptional control of <italic>Mmp10</italic> expression seems to depend on a delicate balance of protein–protein interaction in the transcriptional complex because increasing abundance of HIPK2 can reduce the presence of HDAC7 in complex with MEF2C and vice versa. One possible explanation for the antagonistic effect of HIPK2 and HDAC7 is that both may compete for the same or similar binding site in MEF2C, which can reach equilibrium as more HIPK2 or HDAC7 are recruited to the complex. This is particularly appealing because the transcriptional machinery involves dynamic assembly of large protein complexes that include transcriptional corepressors, such as HIPK2 and HDAC7 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Lemon1">[29]</xref>. Alternatively, and not mutually exclusive, it is possible that HIPK2 and HDAC7 may cross-regulate each other through posttranslational modifications, such as phosphorylation or acetylation, which are likely to change the equilibrium of transcriptional complex formation.</p>
      <p>The role of HIPK2 as a transcriptional corepressor of MEF2C proteins is further supported by the protein complex formation between MEF2C and HIPK2 in HEK293T cells. Such protein complex formation between endogenous HIPK2 and MEF2C can also be detected in <italic>wild-type</italic> MEF and HUVEC cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Interestingly, the interaction between HIPK2 and MEF2C seems to require the kinase activity of HIPK2 because significantly fewer MEF2C proteins are detected in a complex with kinase inactive HIPK2-K221A. Furthermore, the MEF2C proteins that do interact with HIPK2-K221A have lower molecular mass compared with those in complex with <italic>wild-type</italic> HIPK2, suggesting that HIPK2 may posttranslationally modify MEF2C and thereby inhibits the transcriptional activity of MEF2C. In support of this idea, alkaline phosphatase treatment reduces the HIPK2-induced high molecular mass migration of MEF2C in SDS-PAGE (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Although there is no evidence that MEF2C is a direct phosphorylation substrate for HIPK2, it is possible that HIPK2 may activate other protein kinases, such as Cdk5 and GSK3β <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Gong1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Wang1">[41]</xref>, to phosphorylate MEF2 and thereby promote the pro-differentiation function of MEF2 in endothelial cells.</p>
      <p>One remarkable finding from this study is the identification of TGF-β and TGF-β–activating kinase 1 (TAK1) as upstream mechanisms that regulate the interaction between HIPK2, HDAC7, and MEF2C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g004">4</xref>). These results indicate that TAK1 have two distinct roles in regulating HIPK2 functions. First, using immunoprecipitation–in vitro kinase (IP-IVK) assays, we show that both TGF-β and TAK1 can activate HIPK2 by phosphorylating the tyrosine on position 361 (Y361), a highly conserved residue among all HIPK members in the activation loop of the kinase domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g005">Figure 5</xref>). These results are further verified using a phospho-HIPK2 specific antibody, HIPK2-P-Y361 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Strikingly, HIPK2 with a tyrosine-to-phenylalanine mutation (HIPK2-Y361F) on this amino acid completely loses its ability to suppress MEF2C-dependent transcriptional activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Second, and quite unexpectedly, we discover that kinase inactive TAK1 blocks HIPK2 function by promoting the degradation of HIPK2 through proteasome-dependent mechanisms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Consistent with these results, treatment with TAK1 inhibitor 5Z-7-Oxozeaenol also promotes HIPK2 degradation in HEK293T cells (Y.S., unpublished observations). These results suggest that, in the absence of signal from TGF-β–TAK1, dephosphorylated HIPK2 proteins may undergo rapid turnover via proteasome pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g008">Figure 8</xref>). Alternatively, kinase inactive TAK1 may alter intracellular transport of HIPK2 and promote proteasome-mediated degradation of HIPK2. Given the closely interconnected functions between TAK1 and HIPK2, it is perhaps not surprising that loss of TAK1 results in early embryonic lethality due to defects in vascular morphogenesis similar to those in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Jadrich1">[26]</xref>.</p>
      <p>While our results highlight the robust effects of HIPK1 and HIPK2 as corepressors in the MEF2C-dependent transcriptional activation of angiogenic genes, there are several indications that HIPK proteins may have broader functions in regulating the outcome of TGF-β signaling. For instance, HIPK2 has been shown to serve as a transcriptional coactivator in the Smad2/3/4-SBE reporter assays and in JNK-mediated functions, which critically regulate the decision of survival and apoptosis in dopaminergic neurons and in tumor cells, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Zhang1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Hofmann1">[16]</xref>. In addition, HIPK2 can also function as a corepressor in Ski-dependent suppression of BMP-Smad1/4-induced transcriptional activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Harada1">[15]</xref>. Given the complexity of TGF-β signaling mechanisms, it is possible that the final outcomes of HIPK2 functions will likely be context-dependent. In support of this view, loss of HIPK1 and HIPK2 leads to down-regulation of several genes critical for the control of cell cycle progression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g008">8</xref>). Although the magnitudes of reduction in these genes are not as drastic as the up-regulation of angiogenic genes, many of these genes have been well-documented to be the transcriptional targets in the canonical TGF-β–Smad pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001527-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001527.s008">Table S1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001527-Pardali2">[42]</xref>. It will be interesting to determine if HIPK1 and HIPK2 may regulate the transcriptional control of these target genes, thus establishing these kinases as novel mediators connecting the Smad and non-Smad signaling pathways downstream of TGF-β. Finally, the gene expression data in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants also reveal a significant, albeit modest, down-regulation of <italic>Alk1</italic>, <italic>Alk5</italic>, and <italic>Hdac7</italic> transcripts. While it is unclear if HIPK1 and HIPK2 can also directly regulate the transcription of these genes, based on the well-characterized functions of these genes, their down-regulation could certainly amplify the vascular defects in <italic>Hipk1</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup><italic>;Hipk2</italic><sup>−<italic>/</italic>−</sup> mutants.</p>
