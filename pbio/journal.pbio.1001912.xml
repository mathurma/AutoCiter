<abstract>
<p>Schlemm's canal (SC) plays central roles in ocular physiology. These roles depend on the molecular phenotypes of SC endothelial cells (SECs). Both the specific phenotype of SECs and development of SC remain poorly defined. To allow a modern and extensive analysis of SC and its origins, we developed a new whole-mount procedure to visualize its development in the context of surrounding tissues. We then applied genetic lineage tracing, specific-fluorescent reporter genes, immunofluorescence, high-resolution confocal microscopy, and three-dimensional (3D) rendering to study SC. Using these techniques, we show that SECs have a unique phenotype that is a blend of both blood and lymphatic endothelial cell phenotypes. By analyzing whole mounts of postnatal mouse eyes progressively to adulthood, we show that SC develops from blood vessels through a newly discovered process that we name “canalogenesis.” Functional inhibition of KDR (VEGFR2), a critical receptor in initiating angiogenesis, shows that this receptor is required during canalogenesis. Unlike angiogenesis and similar to stages of vasculogenesis, during canalogenesis tip cells divide and form branched chains prior to vessel formation. Differing from both angiogenesis and vasculogenesis, during canalogenesis SECs express <italic>Prox1</italic>, a master regulator of lymphangiogenesis and lymphatic phenotypes. Thus, SC development resembles a blend of vascular developmental programs. These advances define SC as a unique vessel with a combination of blood vascular and lymphatic phenotypes. They are important for dissecting its functions that are essential for ocular health and normal vision.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Schlemm's canal serves as a drainage tube for fluid from the anterior chamber of the eye and is directly relevant to glaucoma, a disease that causes vision loss in over 70 million people. Aqueous humor enters the canal and then drains into connected veins. Molecular understanding of the development of Schlemm's canal and its drainage functions has remained limited. We provide a detailed characterization of Schlemm's canal development, and in so doing discover a novel process of vascular development that we name “canalogenesis.” We show that although the process requires a functional KDR receptor, which is also critical in blood vessel development, the endothelial cells of Schlemm's canal have a unique hybrid molecular phenotype, expressing proteins that are characteristic of both blood and lymphatic vessels. Of note, the expression of <italic>Prox1</italic>, a master regulator of lymphatic fate, and other lymphatic proteins are largely restricted to specialized cells of the inner wall of Schlemm's canal through which the aqueous humor passes as it exits the eye. Thus, <italic>Prox1</italic> and other lymphatic proteins may be critical for the functional specialization of these cells for aqueous humor drainage. Schlemm's canal is thus a unique vessel with a combination of blood vascular and lymphatic characteristics.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Although Schlemm's canal (SC) has central roles in ocular physiology and homeostasis, its development, mature phenotype, and molecular processes are poorly understood <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Tamm1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Streilein1">[3]</xref>. SC has a critical role in aqueous humor drainage (AQH) from the eye, a process that regulates the intraocular pressure (IOP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Tamm1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Overby1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Johnson1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Ramos1">[5]</xref>. Abnormal resistance to AQH drainage results in IOP elevation, a key factor contributing to glaucoma <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Overby1">[2]</xref>. Glaucoma is one of the most common neurodegenerative diseases and will affect an estimated 80 million people by the end of this decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Quigley1">[6]</xref>. SC is also important for anterior chamber associated immune deviation (ACAID), a form of immune tolerance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Streilein1">[3]</xref>. During ACAID, immune cells are exposed to an antigen in the eye and then exit the eye via SC. From SC they return to the systemic circulation via blood vessels to which SC is connected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Cone1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Niederkorn1">[8]</xref>. After exiting SC, these cells induce a systemic suppression of immune responses to that antigen. Thus, SC is a unique and important vessel that needs to be better understood.</p>
<p>SC is a flattened tube made of endothelial cells, which encircles the anterior portion of the eye. It is embedded within the ocular wall in the region connecting the cornea and sclera that is known as the limbus. Specifically, SC is located in tissue of the iridiocorneal angle (angle formed by the iris and cornea) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Overby1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-DvorakTheobald1">[9]</xref>. The inner wall of SC consists of morphologically specialized endothelial cells and their basement membrane, which provide a final barrier to the drainage (outflow) of AQH and the exit of immune cells from the eye <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Tamm1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Overby1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Cone1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Niederkorn1">[8]</xref>. SC endothelial cells (SECs) and their specialized basement membrane are likely to contribute a key source of resistance to AQH outflow. As immune cell behavior is modulated by interactions with endothelial cells, SECs are likely to have important molecular roles in immune tolerance. However, many mechanistic questions about the functions of SC remain unanswered.</p>
<p>Determining the origin and phenotype of the SC and its endothelial cells is key to understanding its roles in ocular homeostasis and immune regulation. Based on a variety of features including marker expression, nature of cellular junctions, direction of fluid flow, and cellular morphology, SECs have similarities and differences to both blood endothelial cells (BECs) and lymphatic endothelial cells (LECs) and may be a unique endothelial cell type <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Ramos1">[5]</xref>. However, studies investigating the expression of lymphatic markers detected none in both human and mouse SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Birke1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Watanabe1">[12]</xref>. Thus, the molecular nature of SECs remains controversial.</p>
<p>SC is proposed to develop from blood vasculature, but further investigation of its tissue origins is required as existing models of SC development differ significantly. In the first model, SC forms from a blood filled venous plexus anterior to the trabecular anlage (the anlage that gives rise to the trabecular meshwork, which is adjacent to SC in mature eyes) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Mann1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Smelser1">[17]</xref>. In the second model, SC forms from blood vessels originating from a more superficial limbal plexus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Hamanaka1">[18]</xref>. Our previous studies suggested that SC forms by the penetration of existing vessels to a location adjacent to the trabecular anlage and that they anastomose to make SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Smith1">[19]</xref>. These previous studies are limited by the use of techniques that sample small regions of tissue in two-dimensional sections (using light and electron microscopy). They provide no molecular detail about mechanisms and have not considered or tested a lymphatic origin for SC.</p>
<p>To allow a modern, more detailed and extensive analysis of the SC phenotype and its developmental origins, we developed a new limbal whole-mount procedure and applied lineage-specific fluorescent reporter genes, high-resolution confocal microscopy, and three-dimensional (3D) rendering to study large regions of the developing limbus. We show that in addition to expressing markers of BECs, developing and mature SECs express PROX1. PROX1 (prospero-related homeobox1) is well established to be an important regulatory protein, which is necessary and sufficient for acquiring a lymphatic fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Wigle1">[20]</xref>. Furthermore, we discover that SC develops by a previously unknown process, which has commonalities and differences to the three described processes of vascular development—vasculogenesis, angiogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis.</p>

<title>Developing and Adult SC Can Be Visualized in 3D Whole Mounts</title>
<p>The ocular drainage structures are delicate and easily damaged. This has impeded studies of their development in unsupported tissue preparations. Surmounting these impediments, we developed a whole-mount procedure for the limbus and anterior portion of the eye. This procedure allows us to study the entire mouse limbus and SC in 3D (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s001">Figure S1</xref>). This method permits high-resolution in situ analysis of not only the entire adult SC but also the developing SC at a cellular level, and in the context of all limbal vessels and tissue. It overcomes substantial shortcomings of analyzing conventional sections, including the study of limited tissue expanses and the difficulties of accurately interpreting data from thin sections. It allows vascular connections between vessels types to be directly visualized.</p>

<p>To clarify the orientation of the images presented throughout this article, we use a 3D-coordinate system to align the conventional view of the SC and limbus in sagittal section to whole-mount images (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s001">Figure S1</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s001">Figure S1</xref> also introduce a depth coding procedure that is used in other figures, and relates tissue depths to the conventional view of SC. This procedure codes tissues in different colors based on their relative distance from the external ocular surface.</p>

<title>Whole-Mounted SC Is Readily Visualized Using Endomucin and Collagen IV</title>
<p>Endomucin is an endothelial sialomucin. In humans, both BECs and LECs express it <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Samulowitz1">[21]</xref>. In contrast, in mice it is most highly expressed in BECs of veins and capillaries and expressed at low or undetectable levels in other mouse endothelial cell types including LECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Fu1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Morgan1">[23]</xref>. Immunostaining with an endomucin antibody shows that adult mouse SECs express this sialomucin at readily detectable levels, though often lower than that in BECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1A and B</xref>). It is not detectable in mature mouse LECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s002">Figure S2</xref>). As far we are aware, this is the first report of endomucin expression in SECs.</p>
<p>Adult SC is evident as a flat vessel running along the length of the limbus. In cross-section, its width varies from 50–200 µm. The vascular, basement membrane marker Collagen IV is also robustly produced by SC, and it highlights the characteristic anatomy of its inner and outer walls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1C–E</xref>). When Z-depth is color-coded, SC codes as cyan to blue. A prominent vascular plexus runs parallel and superficial to SC (codes magenta to red, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref>), and we call it the limbal vascular plexus (LVP). Branches of the LVP penetrate to the depth of SC with some connecting to SC as collector channels for AQH. Other vessels that exit the eye run at right angles to the LVP and connect with it. These vessels are often filled with red blood cells (RBCs) and are the episcleral vessels (not shown).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2c">
<title>SECs Express BEC Markers and Have Continuous Cell Junctions</title>
<p>To facilitate studies of SC, and to further define the vascular markers expressed by it, we evaluated the expression of green fluorescent protein (GFP) transgenes controlled by vascular marker promoters and assessed other markers by immunolabeling. In addition to endomucin, SECs express a panel of vascular markers including <italic>Tie2</italic>, <italic>Kdr</italic> (<italic>Vegfr2</italic>), <italic>EfnB2</italic>, CD31 (PECAM1), CD34, and VE-cadherin (VECAD) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Of these, CD31, CD34, and VECAD were previously identified in human SC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Watanabe1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Heimark1">[24]</xref>. <italic>Tie2</italic> and CD34 are detected in BECs but not LECs under normal conditions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Baluk1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Srinivasan1">[26]</xref>, whereas CD31 is expressed at much lower levels in LECs than BECs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Baluk1">[25]</xref>. Resembling BECs, our data show robust expression of <italic>Tie2</italic>, CD31, and CD34 in SECs. KDR is an important vascular marker that is expressed in both BECs and LECs. VECAD is an adherence junction protein expressed in BECs and LECs and is critical in regulating junctional permeability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Vestweber1">[27]</xref>. VECAD localization between cells of blood vessels is continuous, contributing to an impermeable junction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Baluk2">[28]</xref>. In contrast, VECAD has a discontinuous button-like localization in initial lymphatics, which are highly permeable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Baluk2">[28]</xref>. In SC, VECAD localization resembles that of blood vessels and it serves as a useful marker for identifying SC with its distinct inner and outer wall morphology (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g002">Figure 2B and C</xref>). <italic>Efnb2</italic> is expressed in arterial endothelial cells and LECs but not in venous endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Wang1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Wang2">[30]</xref>. Existing models suggest that SC is derived from veins and so expression of <italic>Efnb2</italic> may reflect differentiation towards a lymphatic phenotype. Our results thus show that the mouse SCE expresses common endothelial markers with important characteristics of BECs.</p>

<title>SC Expresses Lymphatic Markers PROX1 and FLT4 But Not LYVE1</title>
<p>PROX1 and LYVE1 are commonly used as markers of a lymphatic lineage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Kato1">[31]</xref>. Given morphologic similarities between SC and lymphatics, we assessed expression of these molecules in SECs. Using immunostaining, we discovered that PROX1 expression is readily detectable in SECs of the inner wall but is not detectable in SECs of the outer wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s003">Figure S3</xref>). Thus, PROX1, the master regulator of lymphatic phenotypes, may have a pivotal role in controlling the differentiation and maintenance of the functionally specialized inner wall SECs. To independently confirm <italic>Prox1</italic> expression and to provide a fluorescent tool for analyzing SC, we produced transgenic mice expressing GFP from the <italic>Prox1</italic> promoter (<italic>Prox1-GFP</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Gong1">[32]</xref>. Using these mice, we confirmed <italic>Prox1</italic> expression in inner wall SECs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s004">Figure S4</xref>). Again, expression was predominantly in the inner wall, but low levels of expression were detectable in some outer wall cells (possibly due to less specificity of GFP expression from the transgene or greater sensitivity of this assay). These experiments indicate that the <italic>Prox1</italic> promoter is transcriptionally active in adult SECs with predominant expression in the inner wall cells. These results show for the first time that PROX1 is expressed in the SC, although at lower levels than in lymphatics. FLT4 (VEGFR3) is another key protein required for lymphatic development and also serves as a marker for lymphatics. FLT4 transcription is controlled by PROX1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Petrova1">[33]</xref>. Using immunostaining, we determined that FLT4 expression mirrors PROX1 expression, localizing predominantly in the inner wall of SC with low levels of expression in outer wall cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In contrast to PROX1 and FLT4, LYVE1 is not produced by SECs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). SC also does not express a commonly used lymphatic marker, podoplanin (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s005">Figure S5</xref>). Overall, the above data indicate that SC is a unique vessel with a blend of blood vessel and lymphatic phenotypes.</p>

<title>SC Is Not Derived from Lymphatics</title>
<p>Given limitations of previous studies and the earlier erroneous belief that the eye lacked lymphatic vessels, it remains possible that SC is derived from lymphatics. We used a <italic>Lyve1-Cre</italic> transgene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Pham1">[34]</xref> along with the <italic>ROSA-mTmG</italic> reporter gene <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Muzumdar1">[35]</xref> to indelibly label cells that are derived from LYVE1-expressing cells. In cells expressing both the <italic>Lyve1-Cre</italic> and <italic>mTmG</italic> transgenes, the CRE recombinase deletes a constitutively expressed <italic>tdTomato</italic> transgene flanked by <italic>loxP</italic> sites. This irreversibly activates expression of a <italic>GFP</italic> transgene, and this expression is passed on to descendent cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). LYVE1 is first expressed in cells of the cardinal vein at embryonic day 9.5 and is the first indicator of these cells committing to a lymphatic fate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Oliver1">[36]</xref>. Thus, the <italic>Lyve1-Cre mTmG</italic> mouse serves not only as an indicator of lymphatic expression but also of previous activation of a lymphatic developmental program. Our lineage tracing experiment clearly indicates that SECs and their progenitors do not express LYVE1 during development (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g004">Figure 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Thus, SC arises using a program different from embryonic lymphangiogenesis, and SECs are not derived from lymphatics.</p>

<title>SC Is Not Derived from the Neural Crest</title>
<p>For some time, it has been suggested that SC is derived from mesoderm but not neural crest cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Johnston1">[37]</xref>. More recently, this was supported in mouse eyes using <italic>Cre</italic>-based lineage tracing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Gage1">[38]</xref>. Because a lacZ reporter and conventional sections were used, a mixed contribution of progenitor cell types including some neural crest cells could have been missed. Thus, we have revisited the possibility of a partial neural crest contribution by analyzing the entire SC following lineage tracing using both <italic>Wnt1-Cre</italic> and <italic>ROSA-mTmG</italic> transgenes. Our results confirm previous findings and clearly demonstrate that neural crest cells do not contribute to SC development, even though the surrounding tissues have a strong neural crest contribution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g005">Figure 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s007">Figure S7</xref>).

Together our results are consistent with a common mesodermal origin of both SC and the limbal vasculature, and they support a developmental model where SC arises from limbal blood vessels.</p>

<title>SC Develops from Blood Vessels of the Limbus</title>
<p>Hypothesizing that SC develops from limbal blood vessels and revaluating the existing developmental models, we studied SC development in the context of all limbal vasculature. Because <italic>Kdr</italic> is expressed in both BECs and SECs, we used <italic>Kdr-GFP</italic> heterozygous mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Ema1">[39]</xref> to visualize the limbal vessels and developing SC (<italic>Kdr</italic> heterozygous mice are established to have normal vascular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Shalaby1">[40]</xref>). Moreover, we found that the SC of <italic>Kdr-GFP</italic> heterozygous mice develops normally when compared to C57BL/6J mice (e.g., <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We established that the LVP in a P1 eye is complex and runs completely around the eye just below the external ocular surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s008">Figure S8</xref>). Deep within the limbus and close to the inner surface of the ocular wall there is another vascular bed. These vessels run radially in a direction perpendicular to the LVP. We named these vessels the “radial vessels” (RVs, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s008">Figure S8</xref>). SC will form in the tissue between these vascular beds, a region that we name the “intermediate zone” (IZ). At this age, the IZ is ∼40 µm thick (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g006">Figure 6A and B</xref>). Signs of SC development are evident at P1, as endothelial sprouts penetrating into the IZ. Importantly, these sprouts emanate from both the LVP and RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g006">Figure 6B</xref>).

At this stage, the LVP circumscribes the eye superficially about 20 µm below the outer surface of the eye.

<title>Endothelial Sprouts Penetrate into the IZ Using Tip Cells</title>
<p>Tip cells are specialized endothelial cells that are critical in angiogenesis. They are present at the leading edge of vascular sprouts and lead the migration of endothelial cells from the parental vessel into the surrounding tissue. They are characterized by long filopodia (which integrate environmental cues) and a characteristic polar morphology. They are followed by other specialized endothelial cells know as stalk and phalanx cells that connect the sprout to the parent vessel <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Gerhardt1">[41]</xref>. Tip and stalk cells are not stable cell fates but shuffle and interchange status during the sprouting process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Jakobsson1">[42]</xref>. We discovered that the leading cells of the sprouts that penetrate into the IZ have a characteristic tip cell morphology with long filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g006">Figures 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g007">7</xref>). For clarity, and because they give rise to SC, we call these cells “SC-tip cells.” It is worth noting that these sprouts form in the context of active angiogenic remodeling within the LVP (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s011">Figure S11</xref>). Angiogenesis is initiated by interaction of VEGFA peptides with their receptor KDR. Here we show that KDR and its ligand VEGFA-164 localize to the developing SC at an age of active tip cell formation and interaction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s009">Figure S9</xref> shows VEGFA-164 localization).</p>

<title>SC-Tip Cells Interact with Each Other, Forming Cell Clusters</title>
<p>In angiogenesis, pairs of tip cells interact with each other using their filopodia. Macrophages chaperone the filopodial interactions to accomplish anastomosis and the formation of a new vascular branch as the sprouts fuse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Fantin1">[43]</xref>. Using endomucin and VECAD labeling of P2 eyes, we found that SC-tip cells interact with each other through their filopodia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g008">Figure 8</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s010">Figure S10</xref>). In most cases, the interacting filopodia have an attendant macrophage (arrowheads, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g008">Figure 8A</xref>). Thus, similar to angiogenesis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s011">Figure S11</xref>), macrophages appear to chaperone filopodial interactions of SC-tip cells. In angiogenesis, VECAD interactions between tip cells promote adhesion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Geudens1">[44]</xref>. Thus, filopodial VECAD is expected to make adhesive contacts between SC-tip cells. In contrast to angiogenesis, where tip cells interact with each other and their attached sprouts anastomose, groups of SC-tip cells interact with each other without anastomosis of their sprouts and without new tube formation. Instead, the SC-tip cells adhere to each other and interlace in the IZ, while maintaining a flattened morphology and giving rise to tip cell clusters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g009">Figure 9</xref>). By P3, the interacting SC-tip cells have formed tip cell clusters in the IZ throughout the limbus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g010">Figure 10</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s012">Figure S12</xref>). Many of these clusters are still attached to the LVP, RV, or both LVP and RV (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g010">Figure 10</xref>). However, not all of the cell clusters are connected to blood vessels. In these cases, it is not clear if connections to blood vessels were already pruned or if some of these clusters originated separately from other undefined progenitors. The number of tip cell clusters continues to increase. Between P3 and P4, the clusters combine with each other to form a continuous flattened chain of cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g011">Figure 11</xref>). Although this chain lacks any tubular morphology, we have named it the rudimentary SC (rSC) because it encircles the entire limbus. By P3.5 to P4, the number of cells in the rSC increases and it becomes more branched within its original tissue plane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g011">Figure 11</xref>). This process resembles vasculogenesis in that cells divide and form branched chains prior to vessel formation. The rSC is still connected to the LVP and RV.</p>

<title>rSC Regionally Expresses PROX1 and Forms Flattened Tubes</title>
<p>As shown above, the adult SC expresses <italic>Prox1</italic>.

During lymphatic development, one of the earliest detectable events is the activation of <italic>Prox1</italic> expression. Unlike lymphatic development, <italic>Prox1</italic> is not expressed at the earliest stages of SC development.

The level of <italic>Prox1</italic> expression increases with an increase in tubular morphology (compare region between arrowheads and arrows, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g012">Figure 12</xref>). At this stage, most of the tubes are flattened, but regionally they are filled with RBCs, reflecting continued connection to blood vessels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g012">Figure 12</xref>). Thus, expression of <italic>Prox1</italic> correlates with the transition from a flattened chain of sprouting cells to a tube. Importantly, PROX1 expression remains lower than in lymphatics and is not easily detectable by immunostaining. As in the adult SC and discussed above, LYVE1 expression is absent in the developing SC.</p>

<title>SC Increases in Size by Continued Sprouting and Cell Proliferation</title>
<p>The developing SC increases in girth with obvious growth until P17 and with subtler increases afterwards. The continued development and growth of SC involves sprouting from the rSC. Sprouts from rSC are first detected at P4.5. By P5, the PROX1-expressing (PROX1<sup>+</sup>) tubular regions have remodeled into a flattened core running centrally along the developing SC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g013">Figure 13</xref>). By this stage, the flattened core has no detectable internal space and no longer contains RBCs. Sprouting continues and sprouts appear to loop back and connect to the main vessel or other sprouts. These sprouts do not end with an obvious tip cell but have long filopodia that are not restricted to their leading cell. Filopodia are also obviously evident on cells along the main body of the developing SC (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s013">Figure S13</xref>). This is different to both classic angiogenic sprouting and the initial sprouting into the IZ during SC development where filopodia are restricted to tip cells. The filopodia appear to be important for adhesion of sprouts to each other and to the main trunk of the developing SC. These sprouts lack detectable PROX1 expression. By P9 no sprouts are discernable. Cell proliferation, detected using the proliferation marker Ki67 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Gerdes1">[45]</xref>, is also important to the growth of SC and is readily detected at assessed ages from P3 to P7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g014">Figure 14</xref>). Cell proliferation is not restricted to the sprouting regions. By P9 almost all cells express PROX1. At P10, lumen formation and differentiation to a mature cellular architecture is occurring at some locations, with loss of PROX1 expression beginning to be evident in outer wall cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g015">Figure 15</xref>). SC has a largely mature appearance by P17, but minor remodeling occurs later.</p>

<title>SC Development Requires KDR Signaling</title>
<p>To begin to define the molecules necessary for SC development, we tested the functional importance of the tyrosine kinase receptor KDR (alias VEGFR2, a receptor for vascular endothelial growth factor, or VEGF). VEGF is an important signaling protein in both vasculogenesis and angiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Bautch1">[46]</xref>. VEGF interacts with KDR on the surface of tip cells to elicit the angiogenic program <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Adams1">[47]</xref>. To inhibit KDR function, we injected a specific rat-derived inhibitory antibody called DC101 that binds KDR and competitively inhibits VEGF signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Prewett1">[48]</xref>. This antibody is a valuable inhibitory tool not only because of its proven specificity but also because homozygous genetic disruption of KDR results in embryonic lethality <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Shalaby1">[40]</xref>, whereas heterozygous disruption of KDR has no effect on SC development (see above and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g002">Figure 2</xref>). We injected DC101 and control antibodies into heterozygous <italic>Kdr-GFP</italic> mice. DC101 injection into these mice resulted in an almost complete absence of SC. However, this result is difficult to interpret because there was also serious disruption of the LVP and RV (not shown). Given this drastic effect on the LVP and RV, it may not be possible to use homozygous conditional gene knockouts of KDR without significant confounding effects on the vasculature from which SC arises.</p>
<p>To test the effects of KDR inhibition without these confounding complications, we tested two doses of DC101 in mice that have no mutations in KDR. DC101 was first injected into <italic>Tie2</italic>-<italic>GFP</italic> mice. KDR inhibition from P0 to P6 clearly disrupted SC development, with the higher of two doses of DC101 having the most profound effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g016">Figure 16</xref>). Injection of a nonspecific control antibody had no effect on SC. We next injected DC101 into C57BL/6J mice from P0 to P12. Again, KDR inhibition substantially impeded SC development, whereas the control antibody had no effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g017">Figure 17</xref>). Importantly these doses of DC101 had no discernible effect on the LVP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001912.s014">Figure S14</xref>) and RV (not shown). Injection of DC101 after P5 had no obvious effect on SC development, indicating that the critical window of KDR signaling is at earlier ages. These results clearly demonstrate that KDR signaling plays a critical role in the early development of SC.</p>

<p>(A) Whole mounts from <italic>Tie2-GFP</italic> mice injected with either a control (nonspecific IgG) or KDR (alias VEGFR2) inhibiting antibody (DC101). The antibodies were injected from P0 to P5 and the tissues studied at P6. Images are Z-projections of stitched confocal stacks encompassing the entire limbus. The images were oriented identically based on the location of a distinctive blood vessel that is always located close to the asterisk but outside of the images. GFP<sup>+</sup> tissues in the stacks have been depth coded. SC is coded in shades of blue (cyan to violet). Elements of the LVP are hued magenta. (Left) Control. The control had no effect on SC development and is indistinguishable from untreated eyes. At this stage, SC has a braided appearance but variable robustness in different regions, as it has formed to different degrees around the eye. Although there is variability, it is typically robust in the boxed regions on the left in these images. It is often less distinct around the 2 to 4 o'clock position and in the region around 9 o'clock. (Middle) 25 mg/kg DC101. SC is generally less developed and appears more tube-like than braided, and it is more fragmented. (Right) 50 mg/kg DC101. SC development is profoundly affected. It is highly fragmented, appearing as low complexity cellular clusters. (B) Higher magnification of boxed regions in (A). Although the control has regional variation in width and robustness of braiding, the DC101 treatment results in substantial developmental retardation. Thus, KDR has an important role in early SC development. Scale bar, (A) 300 µm and (B) 40 µm.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>SC is an important and highly specialized vessel but is poorly understood. Here we present new tools that will facilitate future studies of SC, and we present valuable information about its development and molecular phenotype. Importantly we discover that SC has a unique molecular phenotype and develops by a previously unknown sequence of vascular development that we name “canalogenesis” (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g018">Figure 18</xref>). SECs have features resembling both blood and lymphatic vasculature, and its endothelial cells have molecular similarities to both cell types. For the first time, we establish that both the developing and mature SC express the lymphatic master controller PROX1, which is likely of critical importance for inducing and maintaining key features of SC's functional specialization. We also demonstrate a critical requirement for KDR signaling early during canalogenesis.</p>

<p>Canalogenesis has similarities to three well-characterized developmental processes of vessel formation—namely, angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis. Although early steps of canalogenesis have key similarities to angiogenesis, including endothelial sprouting and tip cells, later steps of canalogenesis are distinct. In angiogenesis, tip cells, at the end of endothelial sprouts, interact together resulting in anastomosis of sprouts producing patent, vascular branches. During canalogenesis, however, several tip cells interact and adhere together to form clusters of tip cells without either anastomosis or formation of a new tube. Cells in these clusters divide, producing a chain of cells prior to lumen formation. This process resembles stages of vasculogenesis, where endothelial cell clusters derived from angioblasts form a chain of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Schmidt1">[49]</xref>. In both canalogenesis and vasculogenesis, the chain of cells forms a tube (a new capillary in the case of vasculogenesis). However, unlike vasculogenesis, PROX1 expression is activated in the endothelial cell chains during canalogenesis, and the PROX1<sup>+</sup> cells remodel to form a tube. The branching of cellular chains that acquire a tube-like morphology also has similarities to the formation of the lymph sac during lymphangiogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Yang1">[50]</xref>. Although the branching cells are PROX1<sup>−</sup> in canalogenesis, they are PROX1<sup>+</sup> in lymphangiogenesis. Thus, the timing of PROX1 expression differs between these processes. Canalogenesis also differs from lymphangiogenesis in that LYVE1 is not expressed in the developing SC. Thus, canalogenesis combines elements of angiogenesis, vasculogenesis, and lymphangiogenesis but is significantly different from any one of them.</p>
<p>At a molecular level, we have identified an early and critical requirement for KDR functions during SC development. Localization of VEGFA-164 to the developing SC indicates that this molecule is a ligand for KDR (as it is in angiogenesis). Because KDR is expressed in the adult SC, VEGFA may regulate SC permeability or mediate other functional roles. This is consistent with a recent report that mice heterozygous for mutations in both <italic>Kdr</italic> and <italic>Flt1</italic> (<italic>Vegfr1</italic>) have elevated IOP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Sano1">[51]</xref>. Together with our study, this suggests that mutations in genes coding for proteins critical for SC development will cause high IOP and increase the risk of glaucoma. At this point, it is unclear if other VEGF receptors such as FLT1 (VEGFR1) and FLT4 (VEGFR3) play a role in development of the SC. Of these, FLT4 is important for lymphatic development and is a key marker of mature lymphatics. FLT4 expression is activated by PROX1. Therefore, FLT4 may play a functional role in SC development. Importantly and supporting this, we demonstrate that FLT4 is expressed in SC with its expression mirroring the polar distribution of PROX1 (greater in the inner wall compared to the outer wall of SC). Thus, the FLT4 ligands VEGFC and VEGFD may play key roles in SC development and maintenance/adult function. SC also expresses the angiopoietin receptor TIE2. The TIE2/angiopoietin pathway is crucial in angiogenesis, lymphangiogenesis, blood vessel maturation, endothelial health, and regulating vascular homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Augustin1">[52]</xref>. Thus, TIE2 and angiopoietins could play a role in both SC formation and regulation of SC permeability.</p>
<p>Recently, the <italic>Caenorhebditis elegans</italic> homologue of PROX1 (PROS-1) was shown to play a role in formation of the tubular excretory canal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Kolotuev1">[53]</xref>. Given the concurrence of PROX1 expression with tube formation in the developing SC, it seems possible that PROX1 plays an important role in tubulogenesis in the rSC. The triggers for <italic>Prox1</italic> expression remain unclear. <italic>Prox1</italic> expression could be triggered by mechanical stimuli, as yet unidentified hemodynamic changes, cell morphologic changes, or cell–cell interactions in the branching rSC. Recently, both cell–cell interactions and mechanical stimulation by fluid flow have been shown to regulate the expression of <italic>Prox1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Sabine1">[54]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Kim1">[56]</xref>. Thus, AQH outflow may be a factor maintaining PROX1 expression in the adult SC and at developmental stages when it functionally drains AQH. It does not seem possible that AQH flow initially induces PROX1 expression during P4, however, as the trabecular anlage remains a compressed mass of cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Smith2">[57]</xref>. Even if the still developing ciliary body <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Smith2">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Sommer1">[60]</xref> produces AQH at this stage, this cellular mass would not allow flow of this fluid to the developing SC.</p>
<p>Although there are additional components, our findings are in line with earlier models from human and mouse tissues, where SC develops from superficial blood vessels that penetrate deep into the sclera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Hamanaka1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Smith1">[19]</xref>. A significant addition is that we establish a significant contribution to SC from two vascular beds, the superficial LVP and the deep RVs. In agreement with our previous study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Smith1">[19]</xref>, we show that lumen formation in the developing SC occurs discontinuously and initiates at P10. Unique features of SC development are the polarization of <italic>Prox1</italic> expression to the inner wall compared to the outer wall and the accompanying differentiation of the unique cell types in each wall. We are unaware of any other vascular-derived tubular structure developing this way.</p>
<p>In adult SC, PROX1 is enriched in the inner wall cells and is likely important for its high degree of functional specialization. Inner wall cells are long and thin and readily deformed by pressure changes in the eye, likely reflecting specialization for mechanical sensing. The flow of AQH subjects the SECs to shear stress, especially near collector channels, which connect SC to the venous system. PROX1 is thus ideally positioned in inner wall cells to act as a regulator of AQH flow. PROX1 may control junctional permeability of the inner wall by controlling expression of VECAD as it does in lymphatic vessels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Johnson2">[61]</xref>. PROX1 also regulates responses to fluid shear stress in LECs and is linked to mechanosensory signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Sabine1">[54]</xref>. Modulation of PROX1 by pressure-dependent shear forces/strain could modulate the expression levels of downstream genes such as VECAD or alpha 9-integrin, which are produced by the inner wall cells of SC (unpublished results). This mechanism would allow SC permeability or cell adhesion to be responsive to pressure changes in the eye.</p>
<p>We also demonstrate that endomucin, a protein that plays a role in leukocyte rolling and is an early marker of vascular endothelial cells, is expressed in SC cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Kanda1">[62]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Liu1">[63]</xref>. Other vascular cell surface molecules such as CD34, CD31 are also expressed in SECs, and at levels similar to those in BECs. Along with other cell surface proteins, these molecules may modulate the behavior of immune cells that interact with SECs as they exit the eye. Thus, these molecules may modulate immune tolerance associated with the eye. Immune cells have been implicated in glaucoma and may mediate early neural damage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Howell1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Wax1">[66]</xref>. It is possible that in addition to its influence on IOP, SC may influence glaucoma by modulating immunity.</p>
<p>In summary, this study provides novel insights into SC, clearly demonstrating that it is a unique vessel with a combination of blood vascular and lymphatic phenotypes, which develops by a previously unknown sequence of vascular developmental events. Overall, it provides new molecular insights and new tools that will greatly facilitate our understanding of the complex functions of this important canal.</p>

<title>GFP imaging</title>
<p>While imaging the <italic>Prox1-GFP</italic> SC, we noted that at all stages of development, the distribution and amount of the GFP marker varied within SECs. Sometimes it marks the entire cell, but other times it is more restricted to the nucleus. Cell expressing any trace of GFP were considered to be PROX1<sup>+</sup>. In addition, the cells expressing <italic>EfnB2</italic> were identified by nuclear fluorescence in the <italic>EfnB2-GFP</italic> transgenic, where the GFP is fused to histone H2B <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Davy1">[71]</xref>. To ascertain there were no changes in <italic>Kdr-GFP</italic> mice, SC was stained with endomucin and compared to B6 SC. At least six eyes were analyzed and the limbus partially imaged.</p>

<title>Confocal Microscopy</title>
<p>Microscopy was performed using an LSM SP5 or SP8 confocal microscope (Leica) using either a 20×0.7 NA multi-immersion objective or 63×1.4 NA glycerol immersion objective. The Mark and Find mode was used to automate collection of images encompassing the entire limbus and generated a folder full of Z stacks at various individual overlapping positions along the limbus. The SP8 confocal was also used when specialized settings such as the highly sensitive photon counting mode was required.</p>

<title>Postprocessing of Images</title>
<sec id="s4e1">
<title>3D rendering</title>
<p>Individual confocal Z stacks (.lsm files) were processed directly using Imaris 7.6 (BitPlane AG, Zurich, Switzerland). Either the maximum intensity projection setting or the blend setting in Surpass mode of Imaris was used for 3D rendering. Controls and experimental image sets were treated identically. Images were oriented so that structures of interest were visible. Multiposition Z stacks generated using the Mark and Find setting on the confocal microscope were first imported into Imaris and converted into Imaris files (.ims files). The resulting Imaris files were then stitched to generate a comprehensive Z stack encompassing the limbus using XuvTools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Emmenlauer1">[73]</xref>. The stitch was exported as an Imaris file and processed appropriately. When making figures, the snapshot feature of Imaris was used to collect images at high resolution (1024×1024 pixels, 300 dpi). When appropriate, planes encompassing specific regions such as the SC or LVP were projected after eliminating extraneous planes by using either the Crop 3D or clipping plane functions of Imaris.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4e2">
<title>Orthogonal images</title>
<p>The Section view of Imaris allows one to visualize a Z stack from the XY, XZ, and YZ perspective all at once. To obtain specific orthogonal regions (XY, XZ, or YZ), a cross-hair can be placed at a point of interest in any of the three perspectives to obtain a plane along the cross-hair lines. In Expand mode, the cross-hairs can be expanded to provide a thick slice rather than a single plane. Expand mode can also be used to select subregions in a stack such as the SC plane.</p>
</sec><sec id="s4e3">
<title>Z-depth coding</title>
<p>Depth coding Z stacks was performed using the Z-code stack plugin for FIJI <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Schindelin1">[74]</xref>. Multichannel confocal stacks were imported into Imaris. The appropriate channel displaying the marker of interest was extracted by deleting other channels. Z-depth coding was initiated by using FIJI functionality within Imaris. Z-depth coding assigns different colors to the individual planes of a Z stack. We have used the ICE lookup table (LUT), where colors range from cyan to red. In this coding scheme, the first plane of a stack is colored cyan and the last plane red.</p>

<title>Functional Studies Using Antibody Inhibition</title>
<p>For inhibition of KDR signaling in vivo, the anti-KDR function-blocking rat monoclonal antibody DC101 (6.33 mg/ml, BioXCell, West Lebannon, NH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Prewett1">[48]</xref> or control rat IgG antibodies (Jackson ImmunoResearch) was injected subcutaneously as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001912-Tammela1">[75]</xref>. The antibody was injected for a dose of either 25 or 50 mg/kg using a 33-gauge needle and Hamilton syringe. For most experiments, the antibody was injected daily at approximately 9 AM during the following periods: P0–P5, P0–P11, or P6–P11. For P0–P11 injections, 20 wild-type eyes were analyzed and complete or partial image sets of the limbus were collected for 6–8 eyes for each treatment and time point. Six wild-type eyes were analyzed for each of the P0–P5 and P6–P11 injections. For the <italic>Kdr-GFP</italic> heterozygotes, 12 eyes were analyzed up to P12.</p>

<p>Orientation, depth coding, and whole mounting. (A) Sagittal section of the adult mouse eye stained with hematoxylin and eosin. The dotted line indicates the plane through which the front of the eye is separated from the posterior segment during dissection. XYZ coordinates are shown to provide orientation for all other figures throughout the article. (B) Higher magnification of the limbal region (red box in A), demonstrating the relative locations of trabecular meshwork (TM) and SC drainage structures in the iridocorneal angle. C, cornea; RPE, retinal pigmented epithelium; Ch, Choroid. The color scale indicates the relative color of depth-coded tissues in relation to the external surface of the eye in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1</xref> and all other figures where depth coding is used. Superimposing this scale on this conventional sectional view provides orientation for the location of SC and other structures in the 3D enface views elsewhere in the article. Note that redder colors represent tissues closer to the surface of the eye, whereas the cyan coded tissues are closer to the TM. SC is adjacent to the TM and due to mild local variation in its tissue depth color codes in blue to cyan. The blood vessels (BVs) that comprise the LVP are closer to the ocular surface than SC and depth code as magenta (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001912-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). (C) Whole mounting procedure. The eye is enucleated and the anterior eye cup dissected away along the cutting plane. Next, the lens, iris, and ciliary body are removed from the anterior eye cup. Centripetal cuts are made to relax the cup so that it lies flat. Red brackets indicate the location of the limbus and provide further orientation in relation to (B). The dark band around the periphery of the whole mount represents the pigment of the RPE, which remains due to the plane of separation of the cup from the rest of the eye. For all XYZ coordinates, the wedge indicates the dimension into and out of the plane of the paper, while the other coordinates are in the plane off the paper. Scale bar, (A) 1 mm and (B) 100 µm.</p>
