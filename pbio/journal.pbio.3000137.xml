<abstract>
<p>Tripartite motif (TRIM) proteins belong to a large family with many roles in host biology, including restricting virus infection. Here, we found that TRIM2, which has been implicated in cases of Charcot–Marie–Tooth disease (CMTD) in humans, acts by blocking hemorrhagic fever New World arenavirus (NWA) entry into cells. We show that <italic>Trim2</italic>-knockout mice, as well as primary fibroblasts from a CMTD patient with mutations in <italic>TRIM2</italic>, are more highly infected by the NWAs Junín and Tacaribe virus than wild-type mice or cells are. Using mice with different <italic>Trim2</italic> gene deletions and TRIM2 mutant constructs, we demonstrate that its antiviral activity is uniquely independent of the RING domain encoding ubiquitin ligase activity. Finally, we show that one member of the TRIM2 interactome, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPA), a known inhibitor of phagocytosis, also restricts NWA infection and conversely that TRIM2 limits phagocytosis of apoptotic cells. In addition to demonstrating a novel antiviral mechanism for TRIM proteins, these studies suggest that the NWA entry and phagocytosis pathways overlap.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>New World arenaviruses (NWAs) are rodent-transmitted viruses that cause high mortality when they evolve the ability to infect humans. Although these clade B pathogenic viruses are known to bind to transferrin receptor 1 and other receptors on the cell surface, the steps leading to their entry into the cell are not well determined. We show that a host factor identified in a previous small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen, tripartite motif 2 (TRIM2), limits NWA endocytosis into cells. Moreover, we show that a member of the TRIM2 interactome, signal regulatory protein α (SIRPA), which is well-known for inhibiting phagocytosis by macrophages, interacts with TRIM2 and also blocks NWA infection. This finding suggests that there are common mechanisms that regulate virus endocytosis and phagocytosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Arenaviruses are enveloped single-stranded RNA viruses whose entry is mediated by the viral glycoprotein (GP), generated by proteolytic processing of a precursor into the envelope proteins GP1, GP2, and stable signal peptide (SSP), a third subunit required for virus–cell fusion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref001">1</xref>]. The clade B New World arenaviruses (NWAs), including Junín and Machupo viruses—the causative agents of Argentine and Bolivian hemorrhagic fever, respectively—use human but not mouse (<italic>Mus</italic>) transferrin receptor 1 (TfR1) for cell entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref002">2</xref>], whereas the Old World arenaviruses (OWAs) Lassa virus and lymphocytic choriomeningitis virus (LCMV) use alpha-dystroglycan [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref003">3</xref>]. NWAs also enter cells via TfR1-independent means and use receptors other than TfR1 to infect sentinel cells of the immune system, their probable initial in vivo targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref006">6</xref>]. Other clade B NWAs, such as Tacaribe virus, use TfR1s from their own host but not the human receptor (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref007">7</xref>]). The T-cell immunoglobulin and mucin (TIM) receptor has also been implicated in mediating entry via binding of phosphatidyl serine on the virus membrane (reviewed in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref008">8</xref>]), and we suggested that voltage-gated calcium channels (VGCCs) serve as additional NWA entry receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref009">9</xref>]. Subsequent to GP interaction with receptors on the cell surface, trafficking to a late endosomal compartment is required for virus entry [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref013">13</xref>]. Although it is generally accepted that OWAs enter cells via a macropinocytosis-like process that is clathrin- and dynamin-independent, whether this is also the case for NWAs is less clear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref014">14</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref015">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In a small interfering RNA (siRNA) screen for host factors that play a role in Junín virus entry, we identified a number of host genes that alter infection, including tripartite motif 2 (TRIM2), which was antiviral [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref009">9</xref>]. TRIM2 knockdown resulted in a 3- to 5-fold increase in infection levels by the replication-competent vaccine strain of Junín virus (Candid 1) and by gammaretrovirus pseudoviruses bearing either the Junín (Parodi strain) or Machupo GP as the only NWA protein, suggesting that TRIM2-mediated restriction works at an entry step [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref009">9</xref>]. TRIM2 did not affect entry by pseudoviruses bearing retroviral envelope proteins or the rhabdovirus vesicular stomatitis virus (VSV) GP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref009">9</xref>].</p>
<p>The human genome encodes at least 70 TRIM proteins, many of which function as antiviral restriction factors acting at different stages of the virus replication cycle, including uncoating, transcription, and virion release, as well as indirectly by playing a role in cellular antiviral responses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref016">16</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref019">19</xref>]. TRIM proteins are characterized by an N-terminal RBCC domain, consisting of a RING domain with potential ubiquitin E3 ligase activity, 1–2 zinc-binding B-box motifs, and a central coiled-coil (CC) domain involved in protein–protein interaction. The C-terminal domains of TRIM proteins are more variable, with approximately 10 different motifs present in the various family members. TRIM2 belongs to subgroup VII, which contains filamin (FIL) domains and NCL-1, HT2A, and Lin-41 (NHL) repeats at their C terminus; only 4 mammalian TRIM proteins belong to this subgroup: TRIM2, TRIM3, TRIM32, and TRIM71 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref020">20</xref>]. Little is known about the biology of these 4 proteins. TRIM3 has been implicated in the transport of cellular cargo [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref021">21</xref>], TRIM71 in microRNA and mRNA biology [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref023">23</xref>], and TRIM32 is thought to play a role in muscle filaments; mutations in TRIM32 are associated with limb-girdle muscular dystrophy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref024">24</xref>].</p>
<p>TRIM2 is highly expressed in the brain. As with other TRIMs, the TRIM2 RING domain encodes E3 ubiquitin ligase activity. TRIM2 binds neurofilament light chain (NEFL) subunit through its RBCC and FIL domains [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref025">25</xref>]. Knockout mice deficient in TRIM2 were reported to develop NEFL buildup in central nervous system axons accompanied by progressive neurodegeneration, tremor, and ataxia, which was attributed to an inability to degrade NEFL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref025">25</xref>]. TRIM2 has also been implicated in rare peripheral neuropathies in humans, part of the Charcot–Marie–Tooth diseases (CMTDs); patients lacking functional TRIM2 protein developed peripheral axonal neuropathy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref027">27</xref>].</p>
<p>TRIM2 interacts with several other cellular proteins. It interacts with Bcl-interacting mediator of cell death (BIM/BCL2l11) and regulates its degradation in the proteasome and with myosin5A (MYO5A) through its NHL domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref028">28</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref029">29</xref>]. In a yeast 2-hybrid screen, TRIM2 was also shown to bind signal regulatory protein α (SIRPA/SHPS1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref030">30</xref>]. SIRPA is a transmembrane glycoprotein that plays a critical role in the phagocytosis of cells by macrophages; binding of SIRPA on phagocytic cells to CD47 on the surface of target cells inhibits their engulfment [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref031">31</xref>]. SIRPA’s cytoplasmic domain contains 4 tyrosine motifs that, when phosphorylated, become binding sites for the SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2, which in turn get activated, initiating a cascade that blocks phagocytosis. Phosphorylation of SIRPA is regulated by various growth factors and integrin activation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Here, using <italic>Trim2</italic>-knockout mice with different deletions, we show that TRIM2 functions in vivo to suppress NWA infection. Moreover, we show that TRIM2 reduces virus uptake into cells and that one of its interacting partners, SIRPA, functions as an antiviral factor. In in vitro and in vivo studies, we found that TRIM2’s antiviral activity at minimum requires the FIL domain and not the RING domain encoding ubiquitin ligase activity. These studies thus define a novel antiviral function for TRIM proteins and suggest a link in mechanism between virus endocytosis and phagocytosis.</p>

<title>TRIM2 restricts NWA infection</title>
<p>We previously showed that siRNA-mediated depletion of TRIM2 in human U2OS or 293T cells resulted in increased infection by either Junín or Machupo virus GP-pseudotyped murine leukemia virus (MLV) or the Junín vaccine strain Candid 1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref009">9</xref>]. To determine if TRIM2 overexpression also altered infection, we transfected a TRIM2 expression vector into U2OS cells and then infected them with pseudoviruses bearing the Junín GP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) or with Candid 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Western blot analysis of extracts made from cells transduced in parallel confirmed TRIM2 overexpression and knockdown, respectively (inset, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). TRIM2 overexpression resulted in decreased infection by Junín pseudoviruses as well as Candid 1, and as we showed previously, treatment with TRIM2 siRNA increased infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>). Depletion of either TfR1 (the viral entry receptor in human cells) or the viral nucleoprotein (NP) resulted in decreased Candid 1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).

<p>We also tested whether TRIM2 affected infection by the NWA Tacaribe virus and pseudoviruses bearing the GPs from the OWAs Lassa virus and LCMV. TRIM2 overexpression or knockdown had no effect on Lassa or LCMV GP pseudovirus infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In contrast, TRIM2 knockdown increased and overexpression decreased infection by Tacaribe virus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Knockdown of the calcium channel α2δ2 (CACNA2D2) subunit of the VGCC, which we previously showed was needed for infection by NWAs but not OWAs, reduced infection by Tacaribe virus, whereas TfR1 knockdown had no effect on Tacaribe infection, as this virus does not use this receptor on human cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref034">34</xref>].

<title>TRIM2-knockout mice are more susceptible to infection</title>
<p>Mice and murine cells can be infected by both the pathogenic and vaccine strains of Junín virus, although mouse TfR1 does not function as a receptor [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref035">35</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref036">36</xref>]. To determine if TRIM2 acted as an in vivo restriction factor, we created mice with targeted deletion of <italic>Trim2</italic>, using clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeat (CRISPR)/CRISPR-associated 9 (Cas9). Two guide RNAS were used, one targeting exon 3 and the other targeting exon 9 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s001">S1A Fig</xref>). Three independent strains were developed from the knockout injections: A, which deleted sequences between the 2 guide RNAs and potentially expresses only the RING domain because of a stop codon introduced by the deletion; B, which contains the RING domain but has a large internal deletion and then goes back in frame and retains the 3 terminal NHL repeats; and C, which deleted 30 amino acids, including the C’-terminal portion of the RING domain, and then retains the rest of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Western blot analysis of brains from these mice, using an antibody that recognizes the CC domain, showed no protein from strains A and B and a slightly smaller protein in strain C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). There were 2 TRIM2 isoforms detected in the wild-type and C extracts, likely the result of alternative splicing of a first coding exon or to protein modification (see below). Although no protein was detected in strains A and B with this antibody, RT-qPCR analysis using primers to exon 11/12 showed that both made RNA containing this region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s001">S1C Fig</xref>). We also subcloned the cDNAs for the deleted <italic>Trim2</italic> in strains B and C and showed that they encoded proteins of the predicted sizes (see below).

<p>We first tested primary bone marrow–derived macrophages (BMDMs) and fibroblasts from these mice for their ability to be infected by Candid 1, Tacaribe virus, and LCMV. BMDMs from both the A and B knockout strains were infected at about 10-fold higher levels with Candid 1 than were those from parental C57BL/6 mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g002">Fig 2C</xref>); fibroblasts derived from the knockout mice were also more highly infected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s002">S2A Fig</xref>). Tacaribe virus also infected BMDMs from the A and B knockout mice at about 5-fold higher levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), whereas infection by LCMV was similar in knockout and wild-type cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g002">Fig 2E</xref>).</p>
<p>We then tested whether in vivo infection would be affected by TRIM2 deletion. We showed previously that Candid 1 predominantly infects astrocytes and microglia after intracranial inoculation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref037">37</xref>]. Mice of each genotype received intracranial inoculations of Candid 1, and 5 d post infection (dpi), their brains were harvested and analyzed for viral RNA levels and virus titers. Both the A and B knockouts showed significantly higher levels of infection than did C57BL/6 mice (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g002">2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s002">S2B</xref>). Similar results were obtained when newborn mice received intraperitoneal inoculations of Tacaribe virus, and their spleens were examined for infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g002">2G</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s002">S2C</xref>).

<title>TRIM2 decreases virus internalization</title>
<p>Junín virus infection requires binding of the viral GP to the cell surface receptor TfR1 in human cells and to the VGCC in mouse cells. We showed previously that siRNA knockdown of TRIM2 did not alter TfR1 expression or TfR1-mediated uptake of transferrin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref009">9</xref>], suggesting that TRIM2 does not alter the normal biological function of TfR1. Although TRIM2 is a cytoplasmic protein, it could have an indirect effect on TfR1 or other surface receptors like the VGCC such that they no longer bind Junín virus. We next performed a virus-binding assay with fluorescein isothiocyanate (FITC)-labeled Candid 1 and U2OS human cells, which express high levels of TfR1, and showed that TRIM2 depletion had no effect on binding (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g004">Fig 4A</xref>).

Virus was stripped from cells, and internalized viral RNA levels were determined by RT-qPCR. Viral RNA levels were reduced by 50% in cells overexpressing TRIM2 compared to untransfected cells or cells transfected with a control green fluorescent protein (GFP) expression plasmid (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g004">Fig 4B</xref>).

<title>The TRIM2 FIL domain is important for its antiviral activity</title>
<p>The results presented thus far showed that both mouse and human TRIM2, which are 93% identical at the amino acid level, inhibited NWA infection.

<p>We also tested whether the C construct, which retains antiviral activity but is deleted for part of the RING domain, retained auto-ubiquitinylation activity as was previously reported for TRIM2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref025">25</xref>]. The 293T cells were cotransfected with myc-tagged wild-type TRIM2 or C expression vectors, along with a hemagglutinin (HA)-tagged ubiquitin construct. Following immunoprecipitation with anti-HA, western blots were performed using anti-myc antibodies. The wild-type construct was heavily ubiquitinylated, whereas the C construct showed much lower levels of ubiquitinylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s001">S1D Fig</xref>).

<p>To determine if any of these factors also affected NWA infection, we used siRNAs to diminish their expression in U2OS cells. Depletion of SIRPA but not the other proteins caused increased Candid 1 infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). We also tested whether knockdown of any of these genes would affect infection in human monocyte-like cells, the likely initial targets of Junín virus infection in vivo. THP-1 cells were differentiated with 25 nM of phorbol 12-myristate 13-acetate (PMA) and treated with siRNAs to SIRPA, BIM, and MYO5A. Again, only TRIM2 and SIRPA depletion resulted in increased infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). SIRPA and TRIM2 knockdown but not BIM or MYO5A also increased Candid 1 infection of primary BMDMs isolated from wild-type or strain C mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g006">Fig 6D</xref>); NEFL expression in THP-1 cells and primary macrophages was undetectable by RT-qPCR, and therefore, siRNA knockdown was not tested. SIRPA overexpression in U2OS cells blocked Candid 1 infection to a similar extent, as TRIM2 overexpression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s006">S6A Fig</xref>) and SIRPA knockdown also increased infection by Parodi-GP pseudotyped MLV (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s006">S6B Fig</xref>). However, knockdown of SIRPA in strain A or B mice did not further increase infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g006">Fig 6D</xref>), nor was SIRPA surface expression diminished in the TRIM2 knockout mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s003">S3B Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>SIRPA and TRIM2 also colocalized in transfected U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g007">Fig 7A</xref>); this colocalization was not affected by NWA infection (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s006">S6C Fig</xref>). Using the deletion constructs described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g005">Fig 5A</xref>, we also found that TRIM2 coimmunoprecipitated via the FIL or NHL but not the RBCC domain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Finally, to confirm that the TRIM2’s inhibition of infection relied on its interaction with SIRPA, we treated U2OS cells overexpressing TRIM2 with SIRPA siRNA and infected them with Candid 1. SIRPA knockdown in the context of TRIM2 overexpression restored infection levels almost to that seen in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Taken together, these data suggested that TRIM2 and SIRPA function in the same pathway to restrict NWA internalization.</p>

<title>SIRPA phosphorylation decreases upon NWA infection</title>
<p>SIRPA is expressed on the surface of antigen-presenting cells such as macrophages and plays a critical role in phagocytic engulfment of tumor and other cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref031">31</xref>]. Upon binding to CD47 on tumor cells, the cytoplasmic tail of SIRPA becomes tyrosine-phosphorylated, and SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases are recruited and activated, initiating dephosphorylation of downstream substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref040">40</xref>]. SHP-1 is predominantly expressed in hematopoietic cells, whereas SHP-2 is more ubiquitously expressed. We next tested whether SHP-2 also played a role in regulating NWA infection using siRNA knockdown in U2OS cells. SHP-2 depletion resulted in a large decrease in Candid 1 and Tacaribe virus infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g008">8A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s007">S7A</xref>).</p>
<p>These data suggested that phosphorylation of SIRPA or TRIM2 might play a role in infection; whereas the biological significance of SIRPA phosphorylation is well-established, TRIM2 phosphorylation has not been previously reported. We thus tested whether endogenous TRIM2 and SIRPA were tyrosine-phosphorylated. Brain extracts from A, B, C, and wild-type mice were immunoprecipitated with anti-phosphotyrosine antisera, and anti-TRIM2 and anti-SIRPA antisera were used to detect protein on western blots. A single TRIM2 isoform, corresponding to the upper band of the doublet, was immunoprecipitated from the extracts from the C and wild-type mice but not the A or B mice (top panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). SIRPA was also phosphorylated in the brains of all the mice. Similar results were seen when TRIM2 or SIRPA was overexpressed in U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s007">S7B Fig</xref>). Next, we tested whether infection with Candid 1 altered phosphorylation of TRIM2 or SIRPA. SIRPA phosphorylation was detected in the infected brains of strains A and B but was greatly decreased in strain C or wild-type mice upon infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). A similar decrease in phosphorylation of endogenous SIRPA was seen after Tacaribe virus infection of TRIM2-transfected U2OS cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s007">S7D Fig</xref>). TRIM2 phosphorylation was not altered by Candid 1 or Tacaribe virus infection. Moreover, when we coimmunoprecipitated TRIM2 and SIRPA, we found that the interaction between TRIM2 and SIRPA decreased upon infection (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g008">8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.3000137.s007">S7C</xref>).

<p>Finally, we tested whether loss of TRIM2 affected phagocytosis of apoptotic cells by macrophages, a process known to be down-regulated by SIRPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref042">42</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Arenavirus infection requires binding of the viral GP to cell surface receptors followed by trafficking to acidic endosomes, where virus fusion occurs and capsids are released into the cytoplasm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref038">38</xref>]. Although the general steps in the NWA entry pathway have been elucidated, the cellular proteins involved in this process have not been identified, particularly with regard to factors that might limit virus entry. Here, we show that TRIM2, a member of a relatively understudied TRIM subfamily, acts to limit internalization of NWAs but not OWAs and that it does this by interacting with SIRPA, a protein known to be involved in phagocytosis, a specialized form of endocytosis.</p>
<p>TRIM proteins are known to affect different stages of viral infection, including uncoating, viral gene transcription, release from the cells, and intrinsic/innate immune responses, and many of these activities require the ubiquitin ligase activity conferred by the RING domain [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref018">18</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref019">19</xref>]. TRIM2 itself has been implicated in the ubiquitination and degradation of several interacting partners through its RBCC domain, including BIM and NEFL [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref025">25</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref029">29</xref>]. In contrast, we found that TRIM2 inhibition of NWA infection both in vitro and in vivo was independent of the RBCC domain and instead required the FIL domain. Indeed, the C mutant, which lacked auto-ubiquitination through partial deletion of its RING domain, still behaved as a restriction factor in vitro and in vivo. Mice bearing this gene deletion had no neurological disease, suggesting that NEFL degradation also does not play a role in the neuropathology seen in CMTD patients.</p>
<p>Many TRIMs are found in the cytoplasm and do not colocalize with commonly used cellular markers for subcellular compartments such as the Golgi apparatus, endocytic vesicles, clathrin-coated pits, mitochondria, intermediate filaments, tubulin, and actin; the exceptions are TRIM1/midline 2 (MID2) and TRIM18/MID1, which localize to microtubules [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref043">43</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref044">44</xref>]. TRIM2 belongs to the subgroup of cytoplasmic filamentous TRIMs that also do not colocalize with known compartment markers, including tubulin [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref044">44</xref>]. The filamentous structures might be involved in cargo transport of virus particles and contribute to TRIM2 restriction activity. For example, TRIM3, another subgroup VII member, plays a role in the cytoskeletal-associated-recycling/transport complex and binds to the kinesin motor protein kinesin family member 21B (KIF21B) as well as MYO5, a microtubule-associated motor protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref021">21</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref045">45</xref>]. TRIM2 also associates with MYO5A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g006">Fig 6A</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref028">28</xref>]. Although siRNA knockdown of MYO5A did not affect Junín virus infection in vitro, it is possible that other motor proteins are involved in TRIM2 activity.</p>
<p>Of the proteins in the TRIM2-interactome, only SIRPA showed anti-NWA activity. Like TRIM2, SIRPA is expressed in both myeloid and neuronal cells. A major role for SIRPA is the inhibition of phagocytosis upon binding to CD47 on host cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref031">31</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref046">46</xref>]. The cytoplasmic domain of SIRPA contains 4 tyrosine motifs that harbor the consensus binding sites for the SH2 domains of SHP-1 and SHP-2 phosphatases, which upon SIRPA binding subsequently dephosphorylate downstream targets, thereby regulating phagocytosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref031">31</xref>]. Phosphorylation of SIRPA is regulated by various growth factors such as epidermal growth factor and integrin activation and is greatly increased in cells overexpressing catalytically inactive SHP-2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref047">47</xref>]. Our data demonstrated that TRIM2 and tyrosine-phosphorylated SIRPA constitutively interact in vivo and that such interaction is diminished upon Junín virus infection. We also showed that SIRPA phosphorylation is decreased upon infection; although TRIM2 also contains phosphotyrosines, infection did not lead to its dephosphorylation. Whether infection leads to SIRPA dephosphorylation and disassociation from TRIM2 or follows the dissociation is currently under investigation. However, similar interactions have been reported for TRIM2’s interaction with BIM; TRIM2 binds to BIM only when it is phosphorylated by p42/p44 mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref029">29</xref>]. TRIM2 binds to membrane acidic phospholipids found on the cytosolic side of membranes, which may bring it into contact with SIRPA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref048">48</xref>]. Taken together, these data suggest that phosphorylated SIRPA binds to TRIM2 and that this complex blocks virus internalization; dephosphorylation of SIRPA, either directly by SHP-2 or by other cellular phosphatases activated by infection, leads to dissociation of the complex and allows infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.3000137.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Although we have not yet demonstrated how infection triggers this response, we as well as others have shown that arenaviruses interact with several Toll-like receptors (TLRs), and SHP phosphatases have been implicated in both TLR- and retinoic acid–inducible gene I (RIG-I)-mediated signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.3000137.ref052">52</xref>]. However, SHP-2 is involved in many pathways, so the inhibition of infection found in cells depleted for SHP-2 may not be directly linked to its interaction with SIRPA. We also found that loss of TRIM2 lead to increased macrophage engulfment of apoptotic cells, a process known to be regulated by SIRPA, suggesting that there is overlap in the pathways used for NWA entry and phagocytosis.</p>

<p>In conclusion, we show that TRIM2, which belongs to a subfamily in which other members play a role in cargo trafficking, interacts with SIRPA, a known modulator of phagocytosis, and that this interaction plays a role in limiting NWA entry, an antiviral function heretofore not described for TRIM proteins. Whether TRIM2 affects the other known functions of SIRPA, including phagocytosis, is currently under investigation. The results of these studies could lead to a better understanding of its role in macrophage and neuronal cell function in addition to its role in virus entry.</p>

To further determine small deletions or mismatches at the endogenous target arising from dsDNA break repair via NHEJ, we performed T7 endonuclease 1 (T7EN1) cleavage assay on genomic DNA. PCR amplification of exon 2 (5′-GCTTTTTCTACTACTTGGTGGCC-3′ and 5′-CCCGTGATTTCTGTGTTAGTTCA-3′) and exon 9 (5′-AGCTTCAGGTTGGTTTCTGGA-3′ and 5′-GACATCATGCAAATGTGAGCAGA-3′). The PCR products were then denatured and reannealed; the annealed PCR products were treated with T7EN1, as recommended by the manufacturer (NEB) and analyzed on 2% agarose gels. The exact deletions found in each strain were determined by sequencing genomic DNA (all strains) and cDNA (strains B and C) generated from total cellular RNA (sequences showing the deletion and coding regions are deposited in a Mendeley dataset at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/d2vwry7j3x.2" xlink:type="simple">http://dx.doi.org/10.17632/d2vwry7j3x.2</ext-link>).</p>
