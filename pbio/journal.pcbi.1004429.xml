<abstract>
<p>Recent genome-wide experiments in different eukaryotic genomes provide an unprecedented view of transcription factor (TF) binding locations and of nucleosome occupancy. These experiments revealed that a large fraction of TF binding events occur in regions where only a small number of specific TF binding sites (TFBSs) have been detected. Furthermore, <italic>in vitro</italic> protein-DNA binding measurements performed for hundreds of TFs indicate that TFs are bound with wide range of affinities to different DNA sequences that lack known consensus motifs. These observations have thus challenged the classical picture of specific protein-DNA binding and strongly suggest the existence of additional recognition mechanisms that affect protein-DNA binding preferences. We have previously demonstrated that repetitive DNA sequence elements characterized by certain symmetries statistically affect protein-DNA binding preferences. We call this binding mechanism <italic>nonconsensus protein-DNA binding</italic> in order to emphasize the point that specific consensus TFBSs do not contribute to this effect. In this paper, using the simple statistical mechanics model developed previously, we calculate the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy for the entire <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> genomes. Using the available chromatin immunoprecipitation followed by sequencing (ChIP-seq) results on TF-DNA binding preferences for ~100 TFs, we show that DNA sequences characterized by low predicted free energy of nonconsensus binding have statistically higher experimental TF occupancy and lower nucleosome occupancy than sequences characterized by high free energy of nonconsensus binding. This is in agreement with our previous analysis performed for the yeast genome. We suggest therefore that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding assists the formation of nucleosome-free regions, as TFs outcompete nucleosomes at genomic locations with enhanced nonconsensus binding. In addition, here we perform a new, large-scale analysis using <italic>in vitro</italic> TF-DNA preferences obtained from the universal protein binding microarrays (PBM) for ~90 eukaryotic TFs belonging to 22 different DNA-binding domain types. As a result of this new analysis, we conclude that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding is a widespread phenomenon that significantly affects protein-DNA binding preferences and need not require the presence of consensus (specific) TFBSs in order to achieve genome-wide TF-DNA binding specificity.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Interactions between proteins and DNA trigger many important biological processes. Therefore, to fully understand how the information encoded on the DNA transcribes into RNA, which in turn translates into proteins in the cell, we need to unravel the molecular design principles of protein-DNA interactions. It is known that many interactions occur when a protein is attracted to a specific short segment on the DNA called a specific protein-DNA binding motif. Strikingly, recent experiments revealed that many regulatory proteins reproducibly bind to different regions on the DNA lacking such specific motifs. This suggests that fundamental molecular mechanisms responsible for protein-DNA recognition specificity are not fully understood. Here, using high-throughput protein-DNA binding data obtained by two entirely different methods for ~100 TFs in each case, we show that DNA regions possessing certain repetitive sequence elements exert the statistical attractive potential on DNA-binding proteins, and as a result, such DNA regions are enriched in bound proteins. This is in agreement with our previous analysis performed for the yeast genome. We use the term <italic>nonconsensus protein-DNA binding</italic> in order to describe protein-DNA interactions that occur in the absence of specific protein-DNA binding motifs. Here we demonstrate that the identified nonconsensus effect is highly significant for a variety of organismal genomes and it affects protein-DNA binding preferences and nucleosome occupancy at the genome-wide level.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Binding of TFs to their target sites on the DNA is a key step during gene activation and repression. An existing paradigm assumes that the main mechanism responsible for specific TF-DNA recognition is TF binding to short (typically 6–20 bp long) DNA sequences called <italic>specific consensus motifs</italic>, or <italic>specific TF binding sites</italic> (TFBSs). It has been known for a long time, since the seminal studies of Iyer and Struhl [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref001" ref-type="bibr">1</xref>], that genomic context surrounding specific TFBSs significantly influences TF-DNA binding preferences. However, general rules describing the mechanisms responsible for such influences remain unknown.</p>
<p>Recently, the model organism ENCODE (modENCODE) project has revealed genome-wide comprehensive maps of TF-DNA binding and nucleosome occupancy in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref007" ref-type="bibr">7</xref>] and in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. Remarkably, these studies have challenged the existing paradigm and revealed that a large fraction of TF-DNA binding events occurs in genomic regions depleted of specific consensus motifs. Such genomic regions with enhanced overall TF-DNA binding but depleted in consensus motifs are oftentimes of low sequence complexity, which means that they are enriched in repeated DNA sequences.</p>
<p>We have recently proposed that repetitive DNA sequences characterized by certain symmetries and length scales of repetitive sequence patterns (see below) exert a statistical potential on DNA-binding proteins, affecting their binding preferences [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. This effect of protein binding to repetitive DNA sequences in the absence of specific base-pair recognition is different from the concept of nonspecific protein-DNA binding introduced and explored in seminal studies of von Hippel, Berg, et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref021" ref-type="bibr">21</xref>]. In particular, von Hippel and Berg defined two related mechanisms for nonspecific protein-DNA binding [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. The first mechanism is DNA sequence-independent, and it assumes that DNA exerts an electrostatic attraction upon DNA-binding proteins, modulated by the overall DNA geometry [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. It has been proposed that DNA-binding proteins use different conformations in specific and nonspecific binding modes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref016" ref-type="bibr">16</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref022" ref-type="bibr">22</xref>]. The second mechanism assumes that mutated specific DNA consensus motifs retain a reduced binding affinity for sequence-specific TFs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>]. Nonspecific protein-DNA binding might become significant since the statistical probability to find such imperfect motifs in many genomic locations by random chance is high for eukaryotic genomes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref019" ref-type="bibr">19</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref023" ref-type="bibr">23</xref>]. The importance of nonspecific protein-DNA binding has been experimentally demonstrated for a number of systems both <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref024" ref-type="bibr">24</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref025" ref-type="bibr">25</xref>] and <italic>in vitro</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref026" ref-type="bibr">26</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref031" ref-type="bibr">31</xref>].</p>
<p>We demonstrated recently that repetitive DNA sequence patterns characterized by certain symmetries lead to <italic>nonconsensus protein-DNA binding</italic> that can be enhanced or reduced depending on the symmetry type [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. We use the term <italic>nonconsensus protein-DNA binding</italic> in order to emphasize the point that the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy is computed without using any experimental information on specific protein-DNA binding preferences (see below). For example, we showed that repetitive homo-oligonucleotide sequence patterns, such as repeated poly(A)/poly(T)/poly(C)/poly(G) tracts lead to statistically enhanced nonconsensus protein-DNA binding affinity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Our results indicated that such nonconsensus binding significantly influences nucleosome occupancy [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>], TF-DNA binding preferences [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref013" ref-type="bibr">13</xref>], and transcription pre-initiation complex binding preferences [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref014" ref-type="bibr">14</xref>] in yeast.</p>
<p>In addition, using the protein binding microarray (PBM) method, we have recently directly measured the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy for several human TFs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. We have demonstrated that, remarkably, the magnitude of the identified nonconsensus effect reaches as much as 66% of consensus (specific) binding [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>].</p>
<p>In this study we explore the extent and significance of the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding mechanism for a large number of proteins belonging to different structural families. First, we investigate the nonconsensus effect in more complex, multicellular organisms, using the available ChIP-seq data obtained for ~100 TFs in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>]. Next, we perform the analysis of high-resolution <italic>in vitro</italic> universal protein-DNA binding microarray (PBM) data obtained for ~90 eukaryotic TFs belonging to 22 different DNA-binding domain types [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. In addition, we identify protein sequence features that statistically distinguish between proteins with stronger and weaker response to nonconsensus repetitive DNA sequence elements, respectively.</p>
<p>We stress the point that <italic>in vitro</italic> analysis is free of confounding factors present in a cell, such as nucleosomes and indirect TF-DNA binding. Our previous experimental <italic>in vitro</italic> study of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding was performed for only 6 TFs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>]. The present analysis of the vast amount of <italic>in vitro</italic> TF-DNA binding data extends this number to more than an order of magnitude, suggesting that the nonconsensus mechanism most likely represents the statistical law rather than the exception. Therefore, the results reported here strongly support our conclusion that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding is a widespread phenomenon that significantly affects protein-DNA binding preferences in eukaryotic genomes, and need not require the presence of consensus (specific) TFBSs in order to achieve genome-wide TF-DNA binding specificity.</p>

<title>Nonconsensus free energy correlates with <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> TF-DNA binding preferences</title>
<p>We compared the predicted landscape of <italic>nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy</italic> with the genomic binding profiles of 69 transcriptional regulators in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] and 30 transcriptional regulators in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref032" ref-type="bibr">32</xref>], as determined by ChIP-seq in the modENCODE project [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref008" ref-type="bibr">8</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref010" ref-type="bibr">10</xref>]. We computed the nonconsensus binding free energy landscape using a simple approach that we developed previously [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Briefly, we used a set of random protein-DNA binders as a proxy for nonspecific protein-DNA interactions in a crowded cellular environment (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Next, to each location along the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> genomes, we assigned an average <italic>free energy of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding</italic>, 〈<italic>F</italic>〉<sub><italic>TF</italic></sub>, where the averaging is performed over an ensemble of random binders (see <xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref> for further details). The free energy value at each sequence location is entropy-dominated, and it is influenced exclusively by the presence of repetitive DNA sequence patterns [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>] surrounding that location. We use the term <italic>DNA sequence correlations</italic> to describe the repetitive DNA patterns, and the term <italic>correlation scale</italic> to describe the length of the patterns (<xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). The larger the correlation scale, the larger the number of repetitive sequence patterns, and thus the stronger the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding effect [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. Importantly, the genomic DNA sequence constitutes the only input for the nonconsensus binding model, i.e. the model does not have any fitting parameters (<xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>).</p>

<title>Cartoon illustrating our model for computing the free energy of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding.</title>
<p>Schematic representation of the procedure for computing the nonconsensus free energy. Step 1: In order to model nonspecific TF-DNA binding, we generate an ensemble of 250 <italic>random</italic> TFs. Step 2: Each TF moves within a sliding window of width <italic>L</italic> bp. The TF-DNA binding energy is computed at each location of TF along the sliding window using the random potential. Step 3: For each TF we calculate the TF-DNA binding free energy. We repeat this process for all random TFs and compute the <italic>average</italic> nonconsensus binding free energy with respect to this ensemble of random TFs. Moving the sliding window along the genome, we assign the nonconsensus TF-DNA binding free energy at each genomic location. We assume that each random binder makes contacts with <italic>M</italic> bps upon DNA binding. For each model TF (random binder), we define the partition function of protein-DNA binding within the chosen sliding window of width <italic>L</italic> bp. We used <italic>L</italic> = 50 bp (i.e. the sliding window size) in our calculations of the genome-wide nonconsensus TF-DNA binding free energy profiles, and <italic>L</italic> = 36 bp for calculations of the nonconsensus TF-DNA free energies for <italic>in vitro</italic> protein binding microarray (PBM) experiments. In the latter case, we do not move the sliding window since each DNA sequence in the PBM library is 36-bp long.</p>

<p>We verified that the predicted free energy landscape is qualitatively robust with respect to variations in the model parameters (i.e. the sliding window width, <italic>L</italic>, and the TFBS size, <italic>M</italic>) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Fig</xref>). In addition, we validated that the predicted free energy landscape is determined by the presence of repetitive sequence patterns, and <italic>not</italic> by the average genomic nucleotide content. To show this, we shuffled the DNA sequence in each sliding window along the genome to obtain random DNA sequences with a fixed nucleotide content, and we computed the normalized free energy, <italic>δF</italic> = <italic>F</italic>−<italic>F</italic><sub>rand</sub>, where <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>rand</italic></sub> is the free energy of the random, shuffled sequences, averaged over different random realizations (<xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). As shown in <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s002" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Fig</xref>, the normalized free energy <italic>δF</italic> is robust with respect to global variations in the genomic nucleotide content.</p>
<p>The predicted reduction in the nonconsensus free energy upstream of TSSs (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2a and 2c</xref>) stems from the enhanced level of homo-oligonucleotide sequence correlations (i.e. repetitive homo-oligonucleotide sequence patterns, such as repeated poly(dA:dT) tracts). This effect can be intuitively understood in the following way. As shown in our previous work, the presence of enhanced homo-oligonucleotide sequence correlations within a DNA region generally leads to the widening of the protein-DNA binding energy spectrum in this region [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>]. For example, in the statistical ensemble of random binders interacting with DNA sequence that contains long homo-oligonucleotide tracts with two alternating types of nucleotides (such as alternating poly(dA:dT) and poly(dT:dA) tracts), the width (i.e. the standard deviation) of the binding energy spectrum, <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004429.e003"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004429.e003g" position="anchor" mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004429.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M3" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>homo</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula>, will be universally larger than the corresponding width for the case of entirely random DNA sequence, <inline-formula id="pcbi.1004429.e004"><alternatives><graphic id="pcbi.1004429.e004g" position="anchor" mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1004429.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><mml:math display="inline" id="M4" overflow="scroll"><mml:mrow><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>homo</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup><mml:mo>≃</mml:mo><mml:msqrt><mml:mn>2</mml:mn></mml:msqrt><mml:mo>⋅</mml:mo><mml:msubsup><mml:mi>σ</mml:mi><mml:mi>U</mml:mi><mml:mrow><mml:mtext>random</mml:mtext></mml:mrow></mml:msubsup></mml:mrow></mml:math></alternatives></inline-formula> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

<title>Nonconsensus protein-DNA binding influences nucleosome preferences</title>
<p>We also assessed the effect of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding on nucleosome binding preferences in the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> genomes. Genome-wide measurements of nucleosome occupancy show a typical nucleosome depleted region upstream of the TSSs, and a well-positioned +1 nucleosome [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref004" ref-type="bibr">4</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref042" ref-type="bibr">42</xref>].

<p>The computed nonconsensus free energy landscapes show a statistically high, positive correlation with the nucleosome occupancy profile in both genomes (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). In particular, the average nonconsensus free energy shows a pronounced minimum in the upstream nucleosome depleted region (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3a and 3c</xref>), similar to the one observed in yeast [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. In <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3b and 3d</xref> we also observed, at the single gene level, statistically significant correlation between the average nucleosome occupancy and the average free energy of nonconsensus binding (<xref rid="sec007" ref-type="sec">Methods</xref>). Sequences with lower nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy have, on average, lower nucleosome occupancy.</p>
<p>We suggest that the observed effect stems from the competition between TFs that experience enhanced nonspecific attraction towards upstream promoter regions (i.e., reduced level of the nonconsensus free energy) and nucleosome-forming histones. It is important to stress that the presence of repetitive DNA sequence elements in promoter regions might also affect histone-DNA binding due to the nonconsensus mechanism, and as a result of it, the nucleosome formation. How exactly individual histones and histone complexes respond to different repetitive DNA sequence patterns remains an open question. This issue is further complicated by the fact that several additional mechanisms influence histone-DNA binding in promoter regions. Namely, genome-wide, <italic>in vitro</italic> nucleosome reconstruction experiments demonstrate that nucleosome-free regions (NFR) can be formed to some extend even in the mixture of purified genomic DNA with histones [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref044" ref-type="bibr">44</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref045" ref-type="bibr">45</xref>]. However, intrinsic DNA sequence preferences of nucleosomes still remain an open issue [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. In particular, it has been recently demonstrated that AT-rich sequences present in many NFRs have little effect on the stability of nucleosomes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>]. Rather it appears that ATP-dependent chromatin modifiers constitute a major factor regulating nucleosome-binding preferences <italic>in vivo</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref043" ref-type="bibr">43</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref046" ref-type="bibr">46</xref>].</p>

<title><italic>In vitro</italic> protein-DNA binding measurements for ~90 TFs to ~45,000 short, non-genomic DNA sequences validate the nonconsensus binding mechanism</title>
<p>Here we provide an additional, highly significant validation for the proposed mechanism of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding by the analysis of the available <italic>in vitro</italic> TF-DNA binding data obtained using the protein-binding microarray (PBM) technology [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref047" ref-type="bibr">47</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref049" ref-type="bibr">49</xref>]. The PBM technology allows to simultaneously measure binding of a TF to tens of thousands of 36-bp long DNA sequences in a single experiment [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref035" ref-type="bibr">35</xref>]. The PBM method is free from the confounding factors, such as the effect of competing TFs and nucleosomes on TF-DNA binding preferences. Here, we used the currently available ‘universal PBM’ data for 91 TFs (belonging to 22 distinct DNA-binding domains) from <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>, <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>mus musculus</italic> [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref033" ref-type="bibr">33</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref034" ref-type="bibr">34</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref050" ref-type="bibr">50</xref>] (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>).

<p>We computed the nonconsensus TF-DNA binding free energy, 〈<italic>f</italic>〉<sub><italic>TF</italic></sub>, for each 36-bp long DNA sequence in the library using the procedure described above (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g001" ref-type="fig">Fig 1</xref>). Contrary to the case of genomic sequences, here we do not move the sliding window along the DNA sequence since each sequence is short, <italic>L</italic> = 36 bp, and therefore a single value of 〈<italic>f</italic>〉<sub><italic>TF</italic></sub> is assigned to each DNA sequence.</p>
<p>Remarkably, for 69 out of 91 analyzed TFs (i.e. 76%) we detected a statistically significant, negative correlation between the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy and the measured <italic>in vitro</italic> TF-DNA binding intensity. This is in agreement with the results obtained for the <italic>in vivo</italic> TF-DNA binding data (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b and 2d</xref>). Twelve TFs (i.e. 13%) did not show a statistically significant correlation, and interestingly, ten TFs (i.e. 11%) showed an <italic>opposite</italic>, positive correlation (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The latter observation is remarkable, since it demonstrates that a non-negligible fraction of TFs can respond to DNA symmetries (represented by our free energy model) in an opposite way compared to the majority of other TFs. However, statistically, the <italic>average</italic> TF-DNA binding preferences show highly significant, negative correlation with the computed free energy of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>) in agreement with the <italic>in vivo</italic> results (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b and 2d</xref>).</p>
<p>In order to identify what structural and sequence features are responsible for the anomalous behavior of these 11% of TFs, we classified all TFs according to the DNA-binding domain (DBD) families they belong to. However, we have not identified any particular DBD families that are unique to those 11% of TFs (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s001" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s004" ref-type="supplementary-material">S4 Fig</xref>). We have also not identified any preference of these TFs with respect to any particular biological function, according to the gene ontology (GO) classification. Therefore, the question what sequence and structural features of proteins are responsible for the positive correlation between the free energy and the experimentally measured <italic>in vitro</italic> TF occupancy remains open.</p>
<p>Next, in order to identify protein sequence features that might be responsible for enhanced nonconsensus TF-DNA binding, we separated TFs (we used 82 mouse TFs for this analysis) into two groups. The first group contained 41 TFs with the strongest negative correlation between the free energy and the measured TF occupancy. The second group contained the remaining 41 TFs. We have analyzed the amino acid correlation properties in these two groups of TFs. Our working hypothesis here is that enhanced amino acid sequence correlations in TF sequences are responsible for enhanced nonconsensus TF-DNA binding. We use the term “sequence correlations” in order to describe repetitive sequence patterns. We have previously used a similar analysis in order to investigate protein sequence features responsible for enhanced level of protein structural disorder and protein-protein interaction promiscuity [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref036" ref-type="bibr">36</xref>]. In particular, we have analyzed the frequency of occurrence of the following repetitive amino acid sequence patterns in each TF group: [<italic>aa</italic>], [<italic>aXa</italic>], [<italic>aXXa</italic>], and [<italic>aXXXa</italic>], where <italic>a</italic> represents each amino acid type and <italic>X</italic> represents an arbitrary amino acid (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). For example, when we compute the frequency of [Lys-<italic>X</italic>-Lys] pattern, we count the total number of the occurrence of this pattern in each protein sequence, irrespectively to the identity of <italic>X</italic>. As a result of this analysis, we have identified three patterns that demonstrated a statistically significant difference of frequencies between the two TF groups: [Lys-<italic>XX</italic>-Lys] (enriched in the first TF group; Kolmogorov-Smirnov p-value, <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ks</italic></sub> ≃ 0.01), [Arg-Arg] (enriched in the second TF group; <italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ks</italic></sub> ≃ 0.02), and [Leu-<italic>X</italic>-Leu] (enriched in the first TF group;<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ks</italic></sub> ≃ 0.05) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). In addition the overall compositional fraction of Lys was enriched in the first TF group (<italic>p</italic><sub><italic>ks</italic></sub> ≃ 0.01) (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The fact that the most statistically significant enrichment (distinguishing the two TF groups) is observed for the [Lys-<italic>XX</italic>-Lys] and [Arg-Arg] patterns is encouraging since positively charged Lys and Arg are obviously the key amino acids responsible for TF binding to the negatively charged DNA molecule.</p>
<p>Two conclusions can be drawn from our results. First, that the intrinsic propensity for nonconsensus protein-DNA binding is imprinted both into the DNA and the protein. Since our simple nonconsensus binding model treats proteins as random binders, it captures general trends in the binding profiles of most, but not all, TFs. Second, nonconsensus and specific (consensus) protein-DNA binding mechanisms are tightly interlinked, and both of these mechanisms cooperate in determining the overall protein-DNA binding preferences in eukaryotic genomes. The fact that our simple random-binder model (without any fitting parameters and without any protein-DNA binding specificity built in) provides such a good statistical description of the measured DNA binding strength for the majority of TFs strongly suggests that the nonconsensus mechanism is quite general and it represents the statistical law rather than the exception. However, more accurate, atomistic models describing nonconsensus protein-DNA binding interactions are necessary in order to improve the accuracy of our predictions for different proteins.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Our analyses of the effect of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding demonstrate that the combined genome-wide binding preferences of 69 TFs in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and 30 TFs in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> are significantly, negatively correlated with the predicted nonconsensus free energy landscape (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2</xref>). Our analyses also show that the experimentally derived nucleosome occupancy in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> and in <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> is significantly, positively correlated with the predicted nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g003" ref-type="fig">Fig 3</xref>). This trend is qualitatively similar to the one that we previously observed in yeast [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref012" ref-type="bibr">12</xref>]. The results shown in Figs <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g002" ref-type="fig">2</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g003" ref-type="fig">3</xref> strongly suggest that TFs compete with nucleosomes for nonconsensus binding to DNA. Such a competition between TFs and nucleosomes could lead to the enhanced TF binding cooperativity previously predicted by Mirny [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref051" ref-type="bibr">51</xref>] and Teif et al. [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref052" ref-type="bibr">52</xref>]. We suggest that nonconsensus protein-DNA binding greatly enhances such nucleosome-induced cooperativity between TFs, and most importantly, in order to achieve this enhancement, promoters do not require the presence of specific, consensus TF binding sites. We stress the important point that the predicted effect of nonconsensus TF-DNA binding most likely affects many but not all TFs. We expect for example, that stress response TFs, such as for example Msn2 in yeast [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref053" ref-type="bibr">53</xref>], might be insignificantly influenced by the nonconsensus mechanism.</p>
<p>Our model predicts that genomic loci enriched with repetitive sequences, such as in heterochromatin, should also be enriched with TF binding. However, the ChIP-seq analysis in such regions is impeded by the fact that multi-mapping reads from long repetitive region will be filtered out by most peak-calling algorithms, therefore identifying interactions in these regions remains a challenging problem [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref054" ref-type="bibr">54</xref>]. Interestingly, there are evidences that regions of heterochromatin are not actually transcriptionally inert and non-coding RNA molecules are transcribed from repeated DNA sequences in pericentromeric heterochromatin in different eukaryotic genomes [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref055" ref-type="bibr">55</xref>]. A recent study even demonstrated [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref056" ref-type="bibr">56</xref>] that some TFs bind directly to the major satellite repeat DNA sequences that are present in pericentromeric heterochromatin regions and might play a significant role in the mouse heterochromatin formation. Further experiments and analysis of TF binding to the heterochromatin would reveal whether nonconsensus binding play an important role in these regions as well.</p>
<p>Our analysis of available <italic>in vitro</italic> TF-DNA binding data from protein-binding microarray (PBM) experiments (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref> and <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>) demonstrates that statistically, on average, <italic>in vitro</italic> TF-DNA binding preferences negatively correlate with the computed nonconsensus free energy landscape, and showed qualitatively similar behavior to the one observed <italic>in vivo</italic> (compare <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g002" ref-type="fig">Fig 2b and 2d</xref> with <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.g004" ref-type="fig">Fig 4</xref>). This additional analysis is important for several reasons. First, the <italic>in vitro</italic> TF-DNA binding preferences are not affected by the presence of other proteins and histones, which can compete with the protein or cause an indirect binding to the DNA. Second, the TF binding intensity is measured in PBM experiments at significantly higher accuracy compared to ChIP-seq experiments. Third, the usage of non-genomic sequences that cover all possible 8-mer DNA sequences, eliminates possible sequence bias that might exist in the genomic sequences, and thus PBM measurements provide an entirely independent validation of the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding effect. Finally, the present analysis performed for ~90 TFs extends our previous analysis performed for only 6 TFs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref015" ref-type="bibr">15</xref>] by more than an order of magnitude, thus strongly suggesting the generality of the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding effect in eukaryotic genomes.</p>
<p>Interestingly, ten TFs (i.e. 11%) showed an <italic>opposite</italic>, positive correlation between the free energy and the measured TF-DNA occupancy (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s006" ref-type="supplementary-material">S1 Table</xref>). The latter observation is remarkable, since it demonstrates that a non-negligible fraction of TFs can respond to DNA symmetries (represented by our free energy model) in an opposite way compared to the majority of other TFs. However, we failed to identify any particular structural, sequence, or functional features unique to this set of TFs. This failure might stem from the small number of proteins that exhibited such behavior. Yet, we were able to identify repetitive amino acid sequence patterns that are responsible for enhanced nonconsensus TF-DNA binding (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). In particular, for the group of TFs characterized by the strongest nonconsensus TF-DNA binding preferences, the most statistically significant enrichment is observed for the [Lys-<italic>XX</italic>-Lys] pattern, while the frequency of [Arg-Arg] pattern is reduced in this group (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s007" ref-type="supplementary-material">S2 Table</xref>). The latter result is intuitively sound since both Lys and Arg are the key amino acids responsible for TF binding to the negatively charged DNA molecule.</p>
<p>Importantly, in this study, our random-binder statistical mechanics model for protein-DNA interactions does not use any experimentally pre-determined information on either low-affinity or high-affinity TF-DNA binding sites. The genomic DNA sequence constitutes the only experimental parameter of the model. In addition, our model does not have any fitting parameters. Contrary to the case of specific protein-DNA binding that requires the presence of a 6 to 20-bp long specific DNA motif (unique for each individual TF), the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding effect stems from multiple nonspecific interactions between the TF and a relatively long (few tens of bp) DNA fragments enriched with repetitive sequence patterns. The fact that different TFs are affected in a <italic>statistically similar</italic> way by <italic>entirely different DNA sequences</italic> containing similar repetitive patterns constitutes the key difference between the nonconsensus and specific protein-DNA recognition modes.</p>
<p>What exactly is the interplay between nonconsensus DNA repetitive sequence elements and consensus (specific) sequences and how their combination influences the overall binding of proteins to the DNA and the expression levels of genes are important questions yet to be explored. We suggest that repetitive nonconsensus sequence elements might have similar influence on TF-DNA binding and on gene expression as repeats of consensus (specific) DNA sequence elements (i.e. homotypic clusters) [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref057" ref-type="bibr">57</xref>]. However, an important difference between these two types of repeated sequence elements is that nonconsensus repeats can affect many different TFs in a similar way, while homotypic clusters are more specific to a limited set of TFs.</p>
<p>Repetitive sequence elements located near the consensus (specific) motif, could increase the TF association rate, by inducing the one-dimension “sliding” of the TF, and improving its search for the specific binding site [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref020" ref-type="bibr">20</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref058" ref-type="bibr">58</xref>]. The presence of many weaker sites flanking a strong binding site could lead to a funnel effect [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref059" ref-type="bibr">59</xref>–<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref062" ref-type="bibr">62</xref>], where the molecules are directed to the strong binding site as depicted in <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5a Fig</xref>. It could also stabilize binding sites that are not strong enough individually [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref063" ref-type="bibr">63</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref064" ref-type="bibr">64</xref>] and increase the ability of binding sites to “withstand mutations” [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref065" ref-type="bibr">65</xref>]. We use the <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> Hlh-1 protein as an example demonstrating that nonconsensus DNA sequence elements might stabilize the binding to specific consensus elements <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5b Fig</xref>). The analysis of Hlh-1 binding sites (based on the genome-wide ChIP-seq measurements [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref002" ref-type="bibr">2</xref>, <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>] in <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic>) demonstrates that only 5% of the total number of Hlh-1 specific motifs in the genome is bound by Hlh-1 (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5b Fig</xref>). We sorted the genomic sequences containing the Hlh-1 motif (consensus motifs were reported in [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref003" ref-type="bibr">3</xref>]) into two groups: the first group contains DNA sequences that were experimentally determined as being bound by Hlh-1, while the second group contains unbound DNA sequences. <xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5c Fig</xref> represents the average nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy computed for each of these two sequence groups. We observed that the nonconsensus free energy is reduced for the group that contains bound sequences as compared with the group that contains unbound sequences. The computed <italic>p</italic>-values show that this result is statistically significant (<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.s005" ref-type="supplementary-material">S5c Fig</xref>). This example supports the hypothesis that nonconsensus sequence elements might provide the funnel effect <italic>in vivo</italic>. Additional analysis and experimental measurements of the kinetics of TF-DNA binding to consensus (specific) sequence elements embedded in different nonconsensus DNA backgrounds, should shed more light on this hypothesis.</p>
<p>Future <italic>in vitro</italic> measurements of binding preferences for additional TFs [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref066" ref-type="bibr">66</xref>], combined with high-resolution <italic>in vivo</italic> ChIP-seq and ChIP-exo analysis, will help to complete the molecular picture of design principles for nonconsensus protein-DNA binding and its functional significance.</p>

<title>Calculation of the free energy of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding</title>
<p>In order to compute the nonconsensus protein-DNA binding free energy landscape, we generate an ensemble of random DNA binders as a proxy for the phenomenon of nonconsensus protein-DNA binding in a crowded cellular environment [<xref rid="pcbi.1004429.ref011" ref-type="bibr">11</xref>].

The free energy <italic>F</italic> is computed as described in the main text, using an ensemble of 125 random DNA binders. <italic>F</italic><sub><italic>rand</italic></sub> is the free energy computed for a randomized sequence (in the same sliding window as <italic>F</italic>), and averaged over 25 random realizations. We used <italic>M = 8</italic> and <italic>L = 50</italic> in our calculations. The described procedure removes a possible bias in the free energy stemming from the global variability of the nucleotide content.</p>

The <italic>y</italic>-axis displays the correlation <italic>R</italic>-value between the measured <italic>in vitro</italic> TF occupancy and the free energy of nonconsensus DNA-binding. Most of the DBD families only contain TFs with negative <italic>R</italic>-values. One family contains two proteins with positives <italic>R</italic>-values (SAND). Three DBD families contain TFs that are both negatively and positively correlated with the free energy (BRLZ, GATA, HLH).
