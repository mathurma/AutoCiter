<abstract>
<p>p38 has long been known as a central mediator of protein kinase A (PKA) signaling in brown adipocytes, which positively regulate the transcription of uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1). However, the physiological role of p38 in adipose tissues, especially the white adipose tissue (WAT), is largely unknown. Here, we show that mice lacking p38α in adipose tissues display a lean phenotype, improved metabolism, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Surprisingly, ablation of p38α causes minimal effects on brown adipose tissue (BAT) in adult mice, as evident from undetectable changes in UCP-1 expression, mitochondrial function, body temperature (BT), and energy expenditure. In contrast, genetic ablation of p38α in adipose tissues not only markedly facilitates the browning in WAT upon cold stress but also prevents diet-induced obesity. Consistently, pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α remarkably enhances the browning of WAT and has metabolic benefits. Furthermore, our data suggest that p38α deficiency promotes white-to-beige adipocyte reprogramming in a cell-autonomous manner. Mechanistically, inhibition of p38α stimulates the UCP-1 transcription through PKA and its downstream cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB), which form a positive feedback loop that functions to reinforce the white-to-beige phenotypic switch during cold exposure. Together, our study reveals that inhibition of p38α is able to promote WAT browning and confer metabolic benefits. Our study also indicates that p38α in WAT represents an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The functional brown adipose tissue (BAT) identified in human adults consists of not only classic brown adipocytes but also brown-like adipocytes (beige adipocytes), both of which are important for energy homeostasis. Due to the same ability to convert fat into heat as brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes have been considered as a novel pharmacological target to combat obesity. Growing evidence suggests that promoting the development and formation of beige adipocytes in white adipose tissue (WAT), also called the browning of WAT, is able to prevent diet-induced obesity and improve metabolism in rodents. Thus, understanding the molecular basis for the regulation of browning in WAT may help us to develop new strategies to counteract obesity and metabolic diseases. In this study, adipocyte-specific p38α knockout (Fp38αKO) mice are generated that display a lean phenotype, improved metabolism, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Interestingly, we found that adipocyte p38α deficiency facilitates the browning in WAT. Then, we show that pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α enhances the browning in WAT and has metabolic benefits. We propose that inhibiting p38α in WAT, possibly combined with cold exposure, could constitute an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>White adipose tissue (WAT) and brown adipose tissue (BAT) are two major types of adipose tissues, which play different physiological roles in whole-body energy homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref002">2</xref>]. The main function of WAT is to store excess energy as triglycerides (TGs) for utilization during nutrient shortage and to produce bioactive adipokines—such as leptin, adiponectin, and resistin, which take part in glucose and lipid metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref003">3</xref>]—while BAT dissipates the chemical energy stored in TGs as heat to preserve core temperature through uncoupling of fatty acid oxidation from ATP production by uncoupling protein 1 (UCP-1) during hypothermia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref004">4</xref>]. BAT was thought to function primarily in rodents and in newborn babies until functional BAT was discovered in adult humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref006">6</xref>]. The BAT identified in human adults might consist of not only classic brown adipocytes but also brown-like adipocytes (beige adipocytes). Similar to classic brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes display multilocular lipid droplet morphology, have high mitochondrial content, and express UCP-1, although they differ from classic brown adipocytes in their origin and molecular identity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>It has been indicated that the beige adipocytes interspersed among white adipocytes in rodents are able to alleviate cold stress to restore thermal homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref008">8</xref>]. Due to the same ability to convert fat into heat through uncoupled respiration as brown adipocyte, beige adipocyte has been also considered an attractive target to promote weight loss. Indeed, promoting the development and formation of beige adipocytes in WAT, also called the browning of WAT, increases energy expenditure, prevents diet-induced obesity, and improves glucose metabolism in rodents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref010">10</xref>], while suppressing WAT browning leads to obesity and insulin resistance [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref012">12</xref>]. It is worth noting that beige adipocytes have been shown to contribute to systemic energy handling even at room temperature (RT) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref013">13</xref>]. Given that beige and brown adipocytes have many distinguishing characteristics [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref014">14</xref>], it is probable that the regulation of the thermogenic program differs in beige and brown adipocytes, which has yet to be studied.</p>
<p>p38 mitogen-activated protein kinases (MAPKs) are key mediators in cellular responses to extracellular stimuli. p38 MAPKs play critical roles in a wide variety of cellular processes such as proliferation, differentiation, regeneration, and metabolism [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref019">19</xref>]. The p38 family of proline-directed serine/threonine kinases has 4 members (p38α, β, γ, and δ), each encoded by individual genes. p38α is highly abundant in most cell types, while p38γ and p38δ have more restricted expression patterns [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref021">21</xref>]. It has been proposed that p38 family members function in a cell context–specific and cell type–specific manner to integrate signals that affect cellular processes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref023">23</xref>]. p38 has long been known as a central mediator of cAMP/protein kinase A (PKA) signaling, which positively regulates the transcription of UCP-1 in brown adipocytes by phosphorylating activating transcription factor 2 (ATF2) directly, a member of the cAMP-response element binding protein (CREB)/ATF family of transcription factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref025">25</xref>]. The in vitro effect of p38 on the thermogenic program in brown adipocytes has been well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref024">24</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref026">26</xref>]; however, the physiologic role of p38 during cold exposure has never been validated by employing a loss-of-function genetic approach in mice. Moreover, whether cAMP/PKA/p38/ATF2 cascade plays a similar role in beige adipocytes is largely unknown.</p>
<p>Here, we show that mice lacking p38α in adipose tissues exhibited a lean phenotype and improved metabolism. To our surprise, adipocyte-specific deletion of p38α using the aP2-recombinase (Cre) line caused minimal effects on the morphology of interscapular brown adipose tissue (iBAT), the UCP-1 expression in iBAT, mitochondrial function, and body temperature (BT), as well as oxygen consumption and carbon dioxide production in adult mice. Interestingly, we found that genetic ablation of p38α in adipose tissues not only facilitated WAT browning upon cold stress but also prevented diet-induced obesity. The effect of adipocyte-specific p38α deficiency on WAT browning was subsequently verified by using the Adipoq-Cre line. Consistently, pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α promoted the browning of WAT and had beneficial effects. Further study revealed that p38α deficiency promoted white-to-beige adipocyte reprogramming in a cell-autonomous and cell type–specific manner. Mechanistically, suppression of p38α in WAT could stimulate the UCP-1 transcription through the PKA/CREB pathway. Our study indicates that p38α in WAT represents an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.</p>

<p>To investigate the role of adipocyte p38α in vivo, we generated adipocyte-specific p38α knockout (Fp38αKO) mice using the Cre-lox system (p38α<sup>f/f</sup>; aP2-Cre<sup>+/–</sup>). As controls, floxed p38α (Floxed) mice that did not express Cre recombinase were used.

Although the mRNA expression of UCP-1 was decreased in the iBAT of Fp38αKO mice, the UCP-1 protein levels were compensatorily increased in the iBAT of Fp38αKO mice after the acute cold exposure, compared to Floxed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g002">Fig 2P and 2Q</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). We also analyzed the mRNA expression of thermogenic genes and genes involved in fatty acid metabolism in the iBAT of these mice. We found that the mRNA levels of positive regulatory domain containing 16 (PRDM16), deiodinase 2 (DIO2), and elongation of very long chain fatty acids (FEN1/Elo2, SUR4/Elo3, yeast)-like 3 (ELVOL3)—as well as adipose triglyceride lipase (ATGL), monoglyceride lipase (MGL), and hormone-sensitive lipase (HSL)—were all elevated in the iBAT of Fp38αKO mice after the acute cold exposure compared to Floxed mice, suggesting that the transcription of other thormogenic genes and lipolysis-related genes was compensatorily increased during acute cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g002">Fig 2R and 2S</xref>, Fig Q in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). In addition, the nonesterified fatty acid (NEFA) levels were also comparable between Floxed and Fp38αKO mice either maintained at RT or after acute cold exposure (Fig R in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). There were no differences in the creatine kinase activity in serum, gastrocnemius (GAS) muscle, and heart between Floxed and Fp38αKO mice (Fig S in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). These results suggest that the supply of fatty acids in Fp38αKO mice was normal.</p>
<p>Since increased browning of WAT has been observed in many knockout mouse models that show improved metabolism, the finding of improved metabolism in Fp38αKO mice prompted us to investigate the browning of WAT in these mice without apparent alterations in BAT function. Interestingly, profoundly increased browning was observed in iWAT from Fp38αKO mice exposed to a cold environment for 2 d, as indicated by significantly increased emergence of multilocular adipocytes, reduced adipocyte size, increased vascular density, increased expression of UCP-1 and other thermogenic or beige adipocyte genes, and increased ratio of mitDNA to nuDNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3A–3G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). In contrast to iBAT, iWAT showed significantly decreased p-ATF2 levels in Fp38αKO mice compared to Floxed mice after 2 d of cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3H and 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). The levels of p-CREB (Ser133) were increased in the iWAT of Fp38αKO mice after 2 d of cold exposure, which might contribute to the up-regulation of UCP-1 in these mice (Fig A in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Since it is widely assumed that the browning of WAT can increase energy expenditure, we speculated that the energy expenditure would be affected in Fp38αKO mice after the induction of WAT browning. As expected, increased energy expenditure was observed within 48 h after β3-adrenoceptor agonist (CL316,243) injection in Fp38αKO mice compared to Floxed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3J and 3K</xref>, Fig B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Similar results were obtained in mice exposed to a cold environment for 7 d before analysis (cold-adapted mice) (Fig C in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). These results further indicate that deletion of p38α in adipose tissues facilitates WAT browning upon cold stress.</p>

<p>Increased emergence of multilocular adipocytes, reduced adipocyte size, and increased expression of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes were also observed in the iWAT from Fp38αKO mice exposed to cold for 7 d compared to Floxed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3L–3O</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>), further suggesting that lacking p38α in adipose tissues could lead to an increase in WAT browning upon cold stress. In addition, distinct histological morphology and smaller adipocyte size; increased expression of thermogenic genes, including UCP-1; and increased ratio of mitDNA to nuDNA were observed in the iWAT from 5-wk-old Fp38αKO mice maintained at RT, which was indicative of enhanced browning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3P</xref>, Fig D-F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Accordingly, smaller adipocyte size was also observed in eWAT from 5-wk-old Fp38αKO mice compared to age-matched Floxed mice (Fig G-H in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>To test whether the increased browning of iWAT observed in adult Fp38αKO mice upon cold exposure and 5-wk-old Fp38αKO mice maintained at RT was due to an increase in sympathetic input, we measured the protein levels of TH in iWAT of these mice. We found that the protein levels of TH in iWAT were not altered in adult Fp38αKO mice compared to Floxed mice upon cold stress for 2 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3D</xref>). Similarly, we did not detect any changes in TH protein levels in iWAT from 5-wk-old Fp38αKO mice maintained at RT compared to age-matched Floxed mice (Fig I in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). These results indicate that the increased browning of iWAT observed in cold-exposed adult Fp38αKO mice or 5-wk-old Fp38αKO mice maintained at RT was independent of sympathetic action.</p>
<p>It has been reported that different adipocyte-specific Cre lines displayed different degrees of efficiency and specificity. Another Cre line driven by the mouse adiponectin promoter regions within the brown adipocyte cell line (BAC) transgene (Adipoq-Cre) was bred to p38α<sup>f/f</sup> mice to generate Ap38αKO mice. As expected, p38α protein expression was greatly reduced in iBAT and iWAT of Ap38αKO mice (Fig J and K in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). Consistent with the observation in Fp38αKO mice, the UCP-1 levels were elevated in iWAT of cold-exposed Ap38αKO mice (Fig K in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), further supporting the notion that ablation of p38α in adipose tissues could promote WAT browning in the adaptive response to cold environments.</p>
<p>To see whether the adipogenesis was affected in the iWAT of Fp38αKO mice after cold exposure, in vivo BrdU-labeling experiments were performed. We found that the proportion of BrdU-positive adipocytes in iWAT was not different between Floxed and Fp38αKO mice after cold challenge for 7 d (Fig L and M in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>), suggesting that the adipogenesis was not affected in the iWAT of Fp38αKO mice. Additionally, we determined the mRNA levels of p38 isoforms in mouse iWAT and found that p38α and p38β are the most abundant isoforms in mouse iWAT, and the expression of p38δ is very low in mouse iWAT (Fig N in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). We then examined the protein levels of p38β and p38γ in the iWAT of Fp38αKO mice and found that the protein expression of both p38β and p38γ was not altered in Fp38αKO mice either maintained at RT or after 2 d of cold exposure compared to Floxed mice (Fig O and P in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>According to a previous study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref031">31</xref>], the total protein of adipose tissues would increase after cold exposure for 7 wk, especially for iBAT. To take this into consideration, we quantitatively determined the total protein content in iBAT and iWAT, and UCP-1 content per mg protein, then calculated the total UCP-1 content per depot in both genotypes. We found that total protein content in iBAT and iWAT was comparable between Floxed and Fp38αKO mice either maintained at RT or exposed to cold for 2 d (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3Q and 3R</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). The total UCP-1 content per depot for iBAT was similar in both Floxed and Fp38αKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3S</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). In contrast, increased total UCP-1 per depot for iWAT was observed in Fp38αKO mice compared to Floxed mice after 2 d of cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3S</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).</p>

<title>Ablation of p38α in adipose tissues prevents diet-induced obesity</title>
<p>To determine the effect of adipocyte-specific p38α deficiency on diet-induced obesity, we treated adult Fp38αKO and Floxed mice with a high-fat diet (HFD). After 3 months of HFD challenge, adult Fp38αKO mice gained less BW and had smaller iWAT and eWAT weight compared to Floxed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).

When normalized to the BW, the relative weight of either iWAT or eWAT was significantly lower in Fp38αKO mice than that in Floxed mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g004">Fig 4D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).

In agreement with these findings, the GTT and insulin tolerance test (ITT) experiments revealed that HFD-fed adult Fp38αKO mice displayed improved glucose tolerance and insulin sensitivity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g004">Fig 4E and 4F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). As expected, we observed increased browning as indicated by formation of multilocular adipocytes, reduced adipocyte size, and increased expression of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes in iWAT from HFD-fed Fp38αKO mice after 2 d of cold exposure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g004">Fig 4G–4J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). The adipocyte size was also reduced in eWAT from HFD-fed Fp38αKO mice exposed to cold for 2 d (Fig F and G in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Together, these results suggest that ablation of p38α in adipose tissues was able to prevent diet-induced obesity and improve metabolism, which might be attributed to the increased browning potential of WAT.</p>

We also found that 4 wk of SB203580 treatment led to a lean phenotype, as evident from a decrease in BW and relative weight of iWAT, eWAT, and iBAT, but had no effect on liver weight (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g005">Fig 5C and 5D</xref>, Fig A and B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>The positron emission tomography (PET) tracer <sup>18</sup>F-FDG was used to monitor the CL316,243-induced brown adipocyte recruitment into WAT in C57BL/6J mice after 4 wk of SB203580 treatment.

We did not observe any differences in <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in iBAT between SB203580-treated mice and control mice. The <sup>18</sup>F-FDG uptake in skeletal muscle was decreased in SB203580-treated mice, although there was no evidence for myofiber-type conversion (Fig E and F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>SB203580 was also employed to treat obese <italic>db/db</italic> mice.

<p>Given that genetic ablation of p38α was capable of increasing browning of WAT without affecting sympathetic activation, we hypothesized that p38α in WAT might function in a cell-autonomous manner. To test our hypothesis, we injected adenovirus-expressing p38αAF (Ad-p38αAF), which is a dominant-negative form of p38α, into the iWAT of C57BL/6J mice (Fig A and B in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).

<p>To further explore the role of p38α in WAT, we performed cell-based experiments. Interestingly, we found that SB203580 treatment increased the mRNA levels of UCP-1 and DIO2 in matured 3T3L1 adipocytes while suppressing the mRNA expression of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes in matured brown adipocytes differentiated from either a BAC or stromal vascular fraction (SVF) isolated from iBAT (iBAT-SVF) of C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6D–S6F Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Consistently, the mRNA expression of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes was up-regulated by SB203580 treatment in a time-dependent manner in matured adipocytes derived from SVF isolated from iWAT (iWAT-SVF) of C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Given that p38α is the major p38 isoform in either matured iBAT-SVF-derived adipocytes or matured iWAT-SVF-derived adipocytes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6G Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>), similar results were obtained by using a p38α inhibitor (p38αMAPK-IN-1) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6E</xref>, Fig H in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>Additionally, the mRNA expression of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes was elevated in matured 3T3L1 adipocytes infected with lentivirus expressing p38αAF (Lenti-p38αAF) (Fig I and J in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). We did not detect any effects of Lenti-p38αAF on lipid accumulation in these matured 3T3L1 adipocytes (Fig K in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). Similarly, infection of Lenti-p38αAF increased the mRNA levels of UCP-1 and other thermogenic genes in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6F</xref>, Fig L in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). To substantiate the evidence that inhibition of p38 signaling has differential effects on thermogenic program in brown adipocytes and white adipocytes, matured adipocytes derived from either iWAT-SVF or iBAT-SVF of Fp38αKO mice were used. We found that loss of p38α did not influence the adipogenic capacity of iWAT-SVF-derived cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6M and S6N Fig</xref>). In agreement with the results obtained by using either inhibitors or Lenti-p38αAF, the mRNA expression of thermogenic genes was increased in matured adipocytes derived from iWAT-SVF of Fp38αKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). In contrast to what we observed in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes, the mRNA levels of thermogenic genes were decreased in matured adipocytes derived from iBAT-SVF of Fp38αKO mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s006">S6O Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>).</p>
<p>An increase in mitochondria staining was also observed in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes infected with Lenti-p38αAF, indicating that the thermogenic program was activated upon p38α inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6H</xref>). Accordingly, by using Agilent Seahorse XF24 Analyzer, we found that basal, uncoupled, and maximal OCRs were all significantly increased in matured adipocytes derived from iWAT-SVF of Fp38αKO mice as compared to Floxed mice, further suggesting that loss of p38α could enhance mitochondrial function in white adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6I and 6J</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Consistently, the immunofluorescence staining of UCP-1 in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes was increased by Lenti-p38αAF infection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6K</xref>). Consistent with above findings using Lenti-p38αAF, we found that the UCP-1 expression was significantly increased in matured adipocytes derived from iWAT-SVF of Fp38αKO mice compared to control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g006">Fig 6L</xref>).

<p>Since it has been reported that PKA is able to phosphorylate CREB at Ser 133, we tested whether PKA expression was altered when p38α was absent. Interestingly, increased staining of PKA catalytic subunit (PKA C) was observed in iWAT from cold-exposed adult Fp38αKO mice, accompanied by increased staining of p-CREB (Ser133) in the same animal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g007">Fig 7A</xref>).

In agreement with these findings, either inhibition of p38α by Lenti-p38αAF or genetic deletion of p38α increased the immunofluorescence staining of PKA C in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g007">Fig 7C and 7D</xref>). Additionally, the levels of phosphorylated PKA substrates in matured 3T3L1 adipocytes infected with Lenti-p38αAF were elevated, suggesting the PKA activity was increased by p38α inhibition (Fig F in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). To test whether activation of p38 signaling could suppress the expression of PKA C, a lentivirus expressing a constitutive active mutant of an MAPK kinase (Lenti-MKK6E) was employed. As expected, in contrast to the effect of Lenti-p38αAF on the protein levels of PKA C, Lenti-MKK6E infection led to a decrease in PKA C protein levels in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). These data suggest that p38α in WAT is a negative regulator of PKA/CREB pathway.</p>
<p>To test whether the PKA/CREB pathway mediated the effect of p38α inhibition on the thermogenic program in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes, H-89, an inhibitor of PKA, was employed. We found that suppression of PKA activity by H-89 was able to attenuate the effect of p38α inhibition either by SB203580 or Lenti-p38αAF on the UCP-1 mRNA expression in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g007">Fig 7F and 7G</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Consistently, we found that H-89 could abolish the effect of Lenti-p38αAF on the protein levels of UCP-1 in iWAT-SVF-derived matured adipocytes by using immunofluorescence staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g007">Fig 7H</xref>). Together, our results suggest that inhibition of p38α might stimulate the thermogenic program through PKA/CREB pathway in WAT.</p>
<p>Interestingly, we found that the protein levels of p-CREB (Ser133) were reduced instead of increased in SB203580-treated BAC, matured adipocytes derived from iBAT-SVF of Fp38αKO mice, and iBAT from Fp38αKO mice maintained at RT compared to their controls, respectively (Fig G-I in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In contrast to p-CREB, we found that the protein levels of p-ATF2 were not only decreased in the matured adipocytes derived from the iWAT-SVF of Fp38αKO mice but also reduced in SB203580-treated matured adipocytes derived from iWAT-SVF of C57BL/6J mice (Fig J in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Thus, our data suggest that the molecular mechanism underlying the transcriptional regulation of UCP-1 in WAT is distinct from that in BAT.</p>
<p>More interestingly, we found a putative CRE in the promoter region of the PKA C gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). ChIP assay using the CREB antibody revealed an enrichment of CREB on this putative CRE in the PKA C promoter in either matured 3T3L1 adipocytes or iWAT of C57BL/6J mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g008">Fig 8B and 8C</xref>). Accordingly, luciferase assay demonstrated that overexpression of CREB could enhance the activity of PKA C promoter containing this putative CRE in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g008">Fig 8D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). These results suggested that CREB could regulate the expression of PKA C at transcriptional level. In this mode, PKA and CREB form a positive feedback loop that serves to activate a thermogenic program that leads to white-to-beige phenotypic switching during adaption to cold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g008">Fig 8E</xref>).</p>

<p>Based on our current data, we propose that adipose p38α is a critical regulator of energy homeostasis. p38α functions as a brake of the PKA signaling pathway in WAT, thereby conferring robust and precise controls on the adaptation of adipose tissues to cold exposure and the whole-body energy metabolism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Inhibition of p38α in WAT promotes browning, which could serve as a new therapeutic approach to combat obesity and improve metabolic homeostasis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g008">Fig 8E</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Maintenance of a proper BT is essential for survival in homeotherms. The sophisticated mechanisms of thermoregulation may participate in the control of energy homeostasis and the development of metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref033">33</xref>]. Since both brown and beige adipocytes are present in adult humans and have remarkable capacity to dissipate stored energy, these two types of adipocytes hold great promise to treat obesity and metabolic diseases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref034">34</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref035">35</xref>]. In this study, we demonstrate that p38α signaling controls the development and formation of beige adipocytes in WAT. We found that genetic ablation of p38α in adipose tissues facilitated WAT browning during cold exposure. Moreover, loss of p38α in adipose tissues led to a lean phenotype, improved metabolism, and resistance to diet-induced obesity. Given that pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α promoted the browning of WAT and had beneficial effects, we propose that p38α in WAT could serve as an exciting pharmacological target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.</p>
<p>p38α is activated in response to a variety of extracellular stimuli and mediates signal transduction from the cell surface to the nucleus. p38 has been long proposed to positively regulate the thermogenic program in brown adipocytes as a downstream mediator of cAMP/PKA signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref025">25</xref>]. Our finding that the ablation of p38α in adipose tissues of mice caused minimal effects on thermogenic function of iBAT, as indicated by undetectable changes in UCP-1 expression, BT, morphology, and mitochondrial function, as well as energy expenditure in adult mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g002">Fig 2A–2M</xref>, Fig A-K in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s002">S2 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). These unexpected findings yielded from our study suggest that the loss of p38α in brown adipocytes is not as deleterious as we previously thought.</p>
<p>On the other hand, to our knowledge, the role of p38 in the browning of WAT, especially the regulation of the thermogenic program in WAT, has never been extensively studied. Recently, PKA–apoptosis signal-regulating kinase 1 (ASK1)-p38 axis has been shown to contribute to the induction of brown adipocyte–specific gene expression in response to cAMP signaling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref036">36</xref>]. Either CL316,243 treatment or enhancing the expression of ASK1 was able to induce UCP-1 expression, which was accompanied by an increase in p-p38 levels. However, the effect of p38 inhibition on CL316,243-induced ASK1 activation and UCP-1 expression was not investigated in that study. Therefore, the roles of adipocyte p38 in the regulation of thermogenic program remain unclear. Here, our data suggest that p38α acts as a negative regulator of browning in WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g008">Fig 8E</xref>). Suppression of p38α, instead of activation of p38α, is able to stimulate the thermogenic program through enhancing PKA signaling in WAT. Thus, p38α differentially regulates PKA signaling and the thermogenic program upon cold exposure in BAT and WAT. These findings also indicate that p38α plays an important role in coordinating energy homeostasis by controlling the thermogenic program in an adipose depot–specific manner.</p>
<p>Recent studies have greatly expanded our knowledge of beige adipocytes. In contrast to classic brown adipocytes, beige adipocytes express relatively low levels of theromogenic genes under nonstimulated conditions, which are dramatically induced upon cold exposure [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref008">8</xref>]. Although it is possible that common regulatory mechanisms may operate, since the thermogenic program in BAT and the browning of WAT are both stimulated by cold stress, it remains to be established whether cell type–specific mechanisms exist in brown and beige adipocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref037">37</xref>]. In brown adipocytes, the activation of p38 by cAMP/PKA signaling stimulates the transcription of UCP-1 through direct phosphorylation of ATF2, which binds to a well-characterized enhancer located 2.5 kb upstream of the UCP-1 gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref025">25</xref>]. Whether the cAMP/PKA/p38/ATF2 cascade also plays a similar role in WAT browning remains unclear. In our study, we did observe the effect of loss of p38α on the phosphorylation of ATF2 in WAT during browning; however, the reduced levels of p-ATF2 could not explain the elevation of UCP-1 expression, suggesting there is a distinct regulatory mechanism in WAT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3H and 3I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Interestingly, we found genetic or pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α was able to stimulate rather than suppress the transcription of UCP-1 through PKA/CREB cascade in WAT. These findings suggest that cell type-specific signaling cascades exist in BAT and WAT, which provide a means to fine-tune the expression of UCP-1 in all adipose tissues across the whole body.</p>
<p>It has been widely accepted that beige fat is metabolically important, especially during cold exposure and nutrient overload [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref038">38</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref040">40</xref>]. Notably, obesity resistance in mice appears to be mostly related to browning of WAT rather than to adaptive thermogenesis of classic BAT, suggesting that beige fat is a key contributor to metabolic health [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref041">41</xref>]. Previous studies have clearly demonstrated that stimulating the browning process improves metabolism and protects mice from diet-induced obesity, whereas ablation of beige adipocytes results in metabolic dysfunction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref042">42</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref043">43</xref>]. It has also been proposed that beige fat has nonthermogenic functions and regulates energy metabolism through various mechanisms in response to nutrient stress. In light of the presence of beige adipocytes in adult humans, these findings have been generating considerable interest, as understanding the molecular mechanisms underlying the browning of WAT could lead to novel therapeutic strategies for treating obesity and metabolic disorders [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref044">44</xref>]. Adipocyte p38 has been investigated before by using commercially available human adipocytes, preadipocytes, SVF, or directly using adipocytes collected from human subjects. These studies suggest that the adipocyte p38 is involved in the regulation of the response to inflammatory stress, cardiac natriuretic peptide-induced thermogenic program, and cellular aging [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref048">48</xref>]. More importantly, it has been reported that phosphorylation p38 was increased either in type 2 diabetic adipocytes or omental fat from obese women [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref050">50</xref>]. In our study, we observed that p38α deficiency in adipose tissues increased the browning in WAT, which was accompanied by resistance to obesity and improvement of metabolism. Mechanistically, p38α deficiency could promote white-to-beige adipocyte reprogramming in a cell-autonomous manner. Our findings, together with those reported by others [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref050">50</xref>], suggest that inhibition of the overactivated p38 in WAT may be beneficial for obese or diabetic subjects. Although we could not achieve WAT-specific delivery, our data suggest that pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α by SB203580 treatment is able to reduce the fat weight and glucose levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g005">Fig 5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). However, whether the pharmaceutical inhibition of p38α would promote white-to-beige adipocyte reprogramming in human adipocytes is not known and requires further study.</p>
<p>In agreement with previous reports [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref051">51</xref>], our results indicate that although there was a dramatic increase in the protein levels of UCP-1 in the iWAT of mice upon cold exposure, at the system level the contribution from classic brown-fat UCP-1-mediated thermogenesis would still predominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004225.g003">Fig 3S</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004225.s010">S1 Data</xref>). Therefore, the changes in UCP-1 levels in the iWAT of Fp38αKO mice upon cold exposure might not explain the whole phenotype we observed in this study. UCP-1-independent and/or nonthermogenic mechanisms need to be investigated in future studies.</p>
<p>Taken together, we establish an important role for p38α in the browning of WAT and energy homeostasis. Based on our findings, we propose that p38α in WAT could serve as a novel druggable target to combat obesity and metabolic diseases.</p>

<p>Mice were randomly assigned to each group; however, blinding was not possible. Mice with similar age or from same litters had the priority of use. During the experiments, mice were monitored daily. Any mice with significantly abnormal signs of rapid weight loss, inability to eat or drink, clinical symptomatology, toxicity, or unresponsiveness would be recorded, and the data from these mice were excluded for statistical analysis. We estimated the sample size by using an online program from <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.powerandsamplesize.com/Calculators/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.powerandsamplesize.com/Calculators/</ext-link> for animal study. If the known value is 1, expected value is 1.2 (20% difference between groups), standard deviation is 0.1, and alpha is 0.05, the power of the test will reach 0.93 when sample size is 3, or the power will reach 0.99 when sample size is 5. If the expected value is 1.1–1.5 (smaller difference), 5–10 or even more samples will be used to have the power bigger than 0.9.</p>

<title>Plasmids, adenovirus, and lentivirus</title>
<p>The recombinant adenovirues of GFP (control) and p38αAF were generated as previously described in another study [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004225.ref052">52</xref>]. In order to generate the lentivirus for GFP, p38αAF, and MKK6E, the synthesized sequences were inserted into Fugw-vector plasmids, which were PCR from plasmids described previously. The above Fugw plasmids and packaging plasmids PMD2.G and PSPAX were cotransfected into HEK293T cells. The virus particles were collected from supernatant. Titers were determined by using dilution methods and counting the number of GFP-positive colonies using fluorescence microscope. PKA C (CRE) promoters were amplified with primers: PKA C (CRE) KpnI-f: CGG GGT ACC CCG GAC CTA GTC AGA CTT TGG AG; PKA C (CRE) XhoI-r: CCG CTC GAG CGG ATC AGT TTG TCT TGG GGA CT. For the luciferase reporter assay, HEK293T cells were plated in 48-well plates and transfected with PKA C (CRE) reporter constructs and MSCV or CREB vectors (Addgene). The pRL-TK vector (expressing Renilla luciferase) was used to normalize the luciferase activity. Cells were lysed 48 h after transfection, and luciferase activity was measured using a dual-luciferase reporter assay system (Promega).</p>

<title>ChIP analysis</title>
<p>ChIP assays of SVF-derived matured adipocytes were performed using an EZ Magna ChIP G kit (Minipore) according to the manufacturer’s protocol. Immunoprecipitation was performed using an anti-pCREB (Ser133) antibody or with rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) as a negative control. Primers used for amplifying CRE2 and CRE4 were CRE2-chip-f, GAT AAG AAG TTA CGA CGG GA; CRE2-chip-r: TCT GAG GAA AGG GTT GAC CT; CRE4-chip-f, GAA GAG TGA CAA AAG GCA CC; and CRE4-chip-r: TAT ATA GCC CCT TGC CGG AG. Immunoprecipitation to identify putative CRE in PKA C promoter was performed using an anti-CREB1 antibody (Abcam) or with rabbit IgG (Santa Cruz) as a negative control. Primers used for amplifying putative CRE in PKA C promoter were PKA C (CRE)-chip-f: AGG GAC AGT GCC TCA AAC CT; PKA C (CRE)-chip-r: TGA CAA GCC TGT ACC AGA GA. The PCR cycle parameters were 95 °C for 5 min, then 30 cycles of 95 °C for 25 s, 60 °C for 30 s, and 72 °C for 30 s, followed by a final extension at 72 °C for 3 min for both the ChIP product and input (represent 0.2%). PCR products were resolved by electrophoresis in a 2% Agarose-gel (Invitrogen).</p>
