        <p>Genetic analyses in zebrafish identify a novel physical signaling mechanism that drives formation of invadopodia-like structures and promotes cell invasion in vivo.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>The signals that initiate cell invasion are not well understood, but there is increasing evidence that extracellular physical signals play an important role. Here we show that epithelial cell invasion in the intestine of zebrafish <italic>meltdown</italic> (<italic>mlt</italic>) mutants arises in response to unregulated contractile tone in the surrounding smooth muscle cell layer. Physical signaling in <italic>mlt</italic> drives formation of membrane protrusions within the epithelium that resemble invadopodia, matrix-degrading protrusions present in invasive cancer cells. Knockdown of Tks5, a Src substrate that is required for invadopodia formation in mammalian cells blocked formation of the protrusions and rescued invasion in <italic>mlt</italic>. Activation of Src-signaling induced invadopodia-like protrusions in wild type epithelial cells, however the cells did not migrate into the tissue stroma, thus indicating that the protrusions were required but not sufficient for invasion in this in vivo model. Transcriptional profiling experiments showed that genes responsive to reactive oxygen species (ROS) were upregulated in <italic>mlt</italic> larvae. ROS generators induced invadopodia-like protrusions and invasion in heterozygous <italic>mlt</italic> larvae but had no effect in wild type larvae. Co-activation of oncogenic Ras and Wnt signaling enhanced the responsiveness of <italic>mlt</italic> heterozygotes to the ROS generators. These findings present the first direct evidence that invadopodia play a role in tissue cell invasion in vivo. In addition, they identify an inducible physical signaling pathway sensitive to redox and oncogenic signaling that can drive this process.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The epithelial cells lining the digestive tract are separated from the connective tissue stroma by a thin layer of         extracellular matrix called the basement membrane. During cell invasion, as occurs during cancer metastasis, epithelial cells breach the basement membrane and invade the tissue stroma. The proteases used by invasive cells to degrade basement membrane in vitro are localized in specialized plasma membrane protrusions known as invadopodia. It is not known, however, whether invadopodia are required for cell invasion in vivo or what triggers their formation. Here, we show that epithelial cells in the intestine of the zebrafish mutant <italic>meltdown</italic> form invadopodia-like protrusions and invade the tissue stroma in response to unregulated contractile tone in the surrounding smooth muscle layer. The invadopodia-like protrusions that form in response to this physical signal are required for epithelial cell invasion in this in vivo model, and they can be induced when unregulated smooth muscle contraction is induced by oxidative stress. These findings provide the first direct evidence that invadopodia play a role in tissue cell invasion in vivo and identify a novel inducible physical signaling mechanism that can drive this process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Physical signaling mechanisms are increasingly recognized as playing an important role in regulating the growth, differentiation, and morphology of vertebrate tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-deRooij1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Yeung1">[2]</xref>. In vitro studies have shown that the polarization, shape, and three-dimensional arrangement of cells in culture can be altered by changing the mechanical properties of their underlying substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Paszek1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Papusheva1">[4]</xref>. Tissue remodeling in vivo can also be initiated by physical signals. In the vasculature, forces arising from changes in intraluminal pressure can activate membrane-bound ion channels or signaling molecules within endothelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Lehoux1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Birukov1">[6]</xref>. This leads to changes in the architecture of endothelial cells themselves, as well as the surrounding smooth muscle and adventitial cells in the vessel wall. Physical signaling has also been shown to be important in tumor progression. Matrix stiffening promotes tumor cell invasion in breast cancer models and neoplastic transformation of benign papillomas to skin cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Levental1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Samuel1">[8]</xref>. Mechanical strain induces an oncogene expression profile in intestinal explants derived from tumor prone mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Whitehead1">[9]</xref>. Cell proliferation within a tumor can alter vascular permeability. This increases interstitial pressure within the tumor itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Boucher1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Padera1">[11]</xref>, which promotes tumor progression in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Craig1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Invasion of cancer cells through their basement membrane is an early event during tumor progression and is a histological feature that distinguishes cancers from benign tumors. In vitro models suggest cancer cell invasion requires the formation of invadopodia, actin-rich membrane protrusions that provide a localized source of matrix degrading proteases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Weaver1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy1">[14]</xref>. Invadopodia and structurally related podosomes were first discovered in cells transformed with the Rous Sarcoma Virus oncogene <italic>v-SRC</italic> (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy1">[14]</xref>). High levels of endogenous SRC are thought to promote invadopodia that form spontaneously in invasive cancer cells or following activation of growth factor signaling pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy1">[14]</xref>. Changes in substrate rigidity were recently shown to alter the number and activity of invadopodia that form spontaneously in invasive breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Alexander1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Parekh1">[16]</xref>, thus providing a potential mechanistic link between invasion and physical signaling. Although invadopodia have been studied extensively in cell culture models, their precise role in cell invasion in vivo has not yet been determined <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In previous work, we showed that cell invasion can be modeled in a zebrafish mutant, <italic>meltdown</italic> (<italic>mlt</italic>), in which intestinal architecture is disrupted by a mutation in <italic>myosin heavy chain 11</italic> (<italic>myh11</italic>), the gene encoding the principle myosin present in smooth muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref>. Biochemical and in vitro analyses showed that the mutant myosin had non-regulated ATPase activity but lacked motor activity. Metalloproteases linked to cancer invasion (Mmp14 (MT1-Mmp); Mmp2) and regulators of epithelial mesenchymal transition were upregulated in <italic>mlt</italic>, and their inhibition rescued the mutant phenotype, thus linking <italic>mlt</italic> to established models of cell invasion. Here we present in vivo evidence that the <italic>mlt</italic> mutation transforms Myh11 into a constitutively active contractile protein, and that unregulated actomyosin interactions increase the basal level of smooth muscle contractile tone in the larval intestine. The physical signal arising from increased contractile tone activates a feed forward redox signaling loop that induces invadopodia-like protrusions in the epithelium, and we show that this requires Tks5, a Src substrate that is a component of the ROS generating Nox complex and is required for formation of invadopodia and podosomes in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Seals1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Crimaldi1">[20]</xref>. Heterozygous <italic>mlt</italic> mutants normally have no detectable phenotype, however treatment with ROS generators induced both the protrusions and cell invasion. Together, these findings identify a novel inducible in vivo signaling mechanism that non-cell autonomously drives formation of invadopodia-like protrusions and cell invasion.</p>

        <title>Unregulated Myh11 in <italic>mlt</italic> Drives Formation of Invadopodia-Like Protrusions That Are Required for Invasive Tissue Remodeling</title>
        <p>The <italic>mlt</italic> invasive phenotype is first visible at 74 h post-fertilization (hpf), shortly after the onset of <italic>myh11</italic> expression in the developing intestinal circular smooth muscle layer surrounding the epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref>. At this stage, the wild type intestinal epithelium is comprised of a single layer of cells that have formed an apical brush border (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g001">Figure 1A and 1D</xref>) and are joined to one another by apical tight junctions, adherens junctions, and desmosomes. The cells have a progenitor phenotype as they are still in a phase of proliferative growth and do not express lineage-specific markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace2">[21]</xref>. In <italic>mlt</italic>, the intestinal tube has an irregular contour in comparison to the wild type intestine (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g001">Figure 1B and 1A</xref>). Histological analyses at this stage showed focal regions of basement membrane degradation with invasion of epithelial cells into the surrounding tissue or epithelial stratification (collectively referred to as invasive remodeling) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g001">Figure 1E–1G</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 15 <italic>mlt</italic> and 15 wild type larvae; see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref>). This initial phase of tissue remodeling is followed by expansive growth of the epithelium and the formation of fluid filled cysts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g001">Figure 1C and 1H</xref>).</p>

        <p>In tissue culture models, degradation of the basement membrane by invasive cells is driven by metalloproteinases associated with invadopodia, plasma membrane protrusions that are enriched in actin, and the actin binding protein Cortactin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Caldieri1">[22]</xref>. In previous work, we showed that invasion in <italic>mlt</italic> required Mmp-14 (also known as MT1-Mmp), a metalloproteinase associated with invadopodia, as well as Mmp2, a metalloproteinase that is activated by Mmp-14 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref>.

        <p>MMP-14 localizes to invadopodia, where it drives degradation of the extracellular matrix. To test whether Mmp-14 was present in the <italic>mlt</italic> protrusions we compared the cellular localization of an ectopically expressed Mmp14a-mCherry fusion protein in <italic>mlt</italic> and wild type intestinal epithelial cells. This approach was necessary because none of the antibodies we tested in immunostainings detected endogenous Mmp-14 protein in the intestine. Confocal analyses showed that the Mmp14a-mCherry fusion protein preferentially localized to the basal portion of <italic>mlt</italic> epithelial cells with protrusions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g003">Figure 3D–F</xref>), whereas in wild type larvae, Mmp14a-mCherry was evenly distributed within the epithelial cells. Fluorescence quantification showed a 1.5-fold increase in basal Mmp14a-mCherry in <italic>mlt</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g003">Figure 3G</xref>). In many <italic>mlt</italic> cells the Mmp14-mCherry fusion protein was nearly exclusively present within or adjacent to the actin-rich protrusions in the basal cell membrane, whereas this pattern was not detected in wild type cells.</p>
        <p>To further characterize the <italic>mlt</italic> membrane protrusions, we next asked whether they could form in mutant larvae that were deficient in the Src substrate Tks5, a scaffolding protein that is required for invadopodia and podosome formation in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Seals1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Crimaldi1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Mader1">[24]</xref>. Knockdown of zebrafish Tks5 disrupts migration of developing neural crest cells, however it is not known whether these cells form matrix-degrading protrusions similar to <italic>mlt</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy2">[25]</xref>. Injection of the Tks5 morpholino into newly fertilized wild type and <italic>mlt</italic> embryos caused severe developmental delay in most embryos, as previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy2">[25]</xref>. However, in the <italic>mlt</italic> embryos that developed normally Tks5 knockdown blocked formation of the protrusions and rescued the invasive phenotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g003">Figures 3H, 3I</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001386.s001">S1</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 5 independent experiments; confirmed by genotyping in six rescued <italic>mlt</italic> homozygotes).</p>
        <p>Together, these findings argue that the membrane protrusions present in <italic>mlt</italic> epithelial cells are closely related, if not identical to invadopodia and or podosomes, and furthermore, that the protrusions are required for invasion. Because podosomes have not been described in epithelial cells and are associated with cell migration rather than invasion, hereafter we refer to the <italic>mlt</italic> protrusions as invadopodia-like protrusions.</p>

        <title>Smooth Muscle Tension Activates a Feed Forward Signaling Loop That Amplifies Epithelial Redox Signaling</title>
        <p>One explanation that could account for the invasive response of <italic>mlt</italic> heterozygotes to menadione was that activation of redox signaling increased smooth muscle contractile tone, similar to the effect of h-CaD knockdown or Nos inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g007">Figure 7D–7F</xref>). Supporting this hypothesis, Western blots showed that menadione induced premature phosphorylation of h-CaD in <italic>mlt</italic> heterozygotes, but not in sibling larvae that were homozygous for the wild type <italic>myh11</italic> allele (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g008">Figure 8G</xref>). To determine whether h-CaD phosphorylation occurred downstream of smooth muscle redox signaling, we used fluorescent RNA in situ hybridization to localize <italic>gpx</italic> and <italic>junB</italic> expression in the menadione-treated larvae. Expression of both genes was restricted to the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g008">Figure 8E and 8F</xref>; <italic>n</italic> = 10 larvae), as in <italic>mlt</italic> homozygotes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g008">Figures 8C,D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001386.s006">S6</xref>). Together, these findings led us to hypothesize that h-CaD phosphorylation in the menadione-treated heterozygotes was triggered by an epithelial signal rather than a direct effect of menadione on the smooth muscle.</p>
        <p>To test this hypothesis, we asked whether menadione induced h-CaD phosphorylation in dissociated heterozygous smooth muscle cells. Intestines were dissected from heterozygous <italic>mlt</italic> and wild type larvae and divided into two groups. The first group was treated with menadione and then processed for Western blot analyses. The second group was dissociated into a suspension of epithelial and smooth muscle cells prior to treatment with menadione. We reasoned that the dissociated smooth muscle cells could still directly respond to mendaione even though their interactions with the epithelium and extracellular matrix had been disrupted. Western blots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g008">Figure 8H</xref>) showed that h-CaD was phosphorylated in the non-dissociated heterozygous intestines treated with menadione, and that phospho-h-CaD already present in homozygous <italic>mlt</italic> smooth muscle cells prior to cell dissociation was not degraded during the incubation period of the assay. In contrast, phospho-h-CaD was not detected in the dissociated heterozygous smooth muscle cells exposed to menadione (<italic>n</italic> = 3 independent experiments).</p>
        <p>Collectively, these data support a model in which h-CaD phosphorylation in <italic>mlt</italic> smooth muscle cells arises from an ROS-activated epithelial signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g010">Figure 10</xref>). Phosphorylation of h-CaD enhances smooth muscle tone, thereby generating additional oxidative stress within the epithelium. This establishes a feed-forward signaling loop with the adjacent smooth muscle that further enhances contractile tone, amplifies epithelial ROS production, and culminates in epithelial invasion. To test this model we measured epithelial ROS production in menadione-treated wild type and heterozygous larvae that express a ratiometric ROS sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Gutscher1">[54]</xref>. Oxidation of the sensor by ROS causes a shift in its fluorescence absorption-emission ratio, thus allowing ROS quantification. Menadione treatment led to a 33% increase in epithelial ROS levels in wild type transgenic larvae (<italic>Tg(beta-Actin:grx-roGFP2</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g008">Figure 8B</xref>). This response was increased more than 2-fold in heterozygous larvae, thus confirming amplification of ROS production in the invasive cells. Quantitative RT-PCR experiments showed that menadione caused a nearly identical increase in intestinal <italic>gpx</italic> and <italic>jun-b</italic> expression in heterozygotes compared with menadione-treated wild type larvae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001386-g008">Figures 8A′</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001386.s006">S6</xref>).

            <p>(A) In <italic>mlt</italic> heterozygotes the expression of mutant Myh11 protein does not generate sufficient smooth muscle tension to induce epithelial invasion or stratification (0). Menadione treatment induces ROS production in the epithelium (1). Epithelial ROS signaling leads to premature phosphorylation of Caldesmon in heterozygous smooth muscle cells (2). The resulting increase in smooth muscle tone (3) leads to an amplified ROS response in the epithelium (4), establishing a feed forward loop causing additional h-CaD phosphorylation and increased smooth muscle tension. Together these stimuli induce invasive remodeling of the epithelium (5). (B) Endogenous smooth muscle tone in <italic>mlt</italic> homozygous larvae (0) induces epithelial ROS (1) and h-CaD phosphorylation via epithelial signaling (2, 3). Ultimately, this culminates in epithelial invasion (4), as in menadione treated <italic>mlt</italic> heterozygotes.</p>

        <title>Epithelial Invasion in <italic>mlt</italic> Is Triggered by a Tension-Induced Extracellular Physical Signal</title>
        <p>In previous work, we reported that invasive remodeling of the developing intestinal epithelium of zebrafish <italic>mlt</italic> mutants is caused by a mutation of the <italic>smooth muscle myosin heavy chain</italic> gene. Initially, we attributed the non-cell-autonomous mutant phenotype to the constitutive actin-independent ATPase activity of the mutant Myh11 protein, rather than its non-regulated contractile function, because contraction was not detected in an in vitro motility assay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref>. Here, we show that the mutant myosin does indeed have contractile function, and that the non-regulated motor activity of the mutant Myh11 is necessary and sufficient for the mutant phenotype. Specifically, we show that inhibiting smooth muscle contraction, via Sma knockdown, rescues invasion in homozygous mutants, and that enhancing smooth muscle contractility, via h-CaD knockdown and Nos inhibition, induces invasion in heterozygous <italic>mlt</italic> mutants. Together, these findings are consistent with the idea that invasive transformation of the <italic>mlt</italic> intestinal epithelium is triggered by a physical signal from the adjacent smooth muscle layer, and that on its own, the unregulated ATPase activity of the mutant myosin (which is independent of actin) is not sufficient to induce invasion.</p>
        <p>Physical signaling mechanisms are increasingly recognized as important for organ development and disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Mammoto1">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Janmey1">[60]</xref>. Recent studies suggest a role for changes in matrix rigidity (stiffness) and other types of mechanical forces in cancer progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Paszek1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Levental1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Craig1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wirtz1">[61]</xref>. Our findings distinguish <italic>mlt</italic> from these cancer progression models in several ways. First, invasive remodeling of the <italic>mlt</italic> intestinal epithelium occurs in the absence of any oncogenic stimuli. Second, invasion in <italic>mlt</italic> is triggered by increased smooth muscle tone rather than qualitative or quantitative changes in matrix proteins. Third, we did not detect tissue stiffening or increased levels of activated Fak in <italic>mlt</italic>, thus arguing that force arising from smooth muscle tension activates a distinct mechanotransductive signaling mechanism than matrix stiffening <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Tee1">[62]</xref>. Interestingly, metalloproteinases and EMT regulators are upregulated in both the <italic>mlt</italic> intestine <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref> and in cancer cells in contact with stiff matrices. Thus, the downstream effects of the different signaling pathways appear to converge in the responding cells.</p>
        <p>Although invasive cells in <italic>mlt</italic> are not transformed, they share some features with cancer cells in that they are highly proliferative and not fully differentiated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref>. In contrast, differentiated epithelial cells in homozygous <italic>mlt</italic> larvae rescued by transient Myh11 knockdown have only a modest invasive response to tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wallace1">[17]</xref>. Differentiated epithelial cells in 5 dpf <italic>mlt</italic> heterozygotes also did not respond to menadione, and they formed fewer invadopodia in response to Src than undifferentiated cells. Together, these findings argue that epithelial progenitor cells, and by analogy cancer cells, have an intrinsic capacity for invasive transformation in response to mechanical signals. Supporting this, the invasive response of mature epithelial cells in heterozygous 5 dpf larvae was restored by activation of oncogenic signaling pathways known to play a role in colorectal cancer in humans.</p>

        <title>Extracellular Tension Induces Epithelial Invadopodia-Like Protrusions</title>
        <p>In vitro studies link cancer cell invasion to the matrix-degrading function of invadopodia, however it is not known whether invadopodia play a role in cell invasion in vivo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy1">[14]</xref>. The evidence supporting such a role is principally derived from cell transplantation studies in which tumor cell invasion correlated with Cortactin expression and invadopodia activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Clark1">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Blouw1">[64]</xref>. Here we present direct evidence that invadopodia can drive matrix degradation and cell invasion within an intact tissue in vivo. Time lapse movies show that the invadopodia-like protrusions in <italic>mlt</italic> form before the onset of cell invasion, and immunostainings show that the protrusions are located adjacent to degraded segments of the basement membrane, through which the invasive cells migrate into the tissue stroma. The <italic>mlt</italic> protrusions are enriched in the invadopodia proteins Actin, Cortactin, and Src, and their formation requires Tks5, a Src substrate required for invadopodia formation in cancer cells. Trafficking of Mmp14, a metalloproteinase that associates with invadopodia in vitro, was also preferentially distributed to the basal region of <italic>mlt</italic> epithelial cells with protrusions. The latter finding is consistent with our previous work showing upregulated epithelial expression of Mmp14 and Mmp2 in <italic>mlt</italic>, and that metalloproteinase inhibition rescues invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Parekh1">[17]</xref>. All together, these data are, to our knowledge, the most conclusive evidence supporting a role for invadopodia in cell invasion in vivo.</p>
        <p>The mechanical properties of cell culture substrates can modify the number and activity of invadopodia that form spontaneously in cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Alexander1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Parekh1">[16]</xref>. The findings presented here are novel in that they also show that formation of the invadopodia-like protrusions can be initiated in vivo by activation of a physical signaling mechanism.</p>

        <title>Src Is Sufficient for Formation of Invadopodia-Like Protrusions In Vivo but Not Tissue Cell Invasion</title>
        <p>Src signaling is sufficient to induce invadopodia formation in non-transformed mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Murphy1">[14]</xref>. Similarly, activated Src induced formation of invadopodia-like protrusions in wild type zebrafish intestinal epithelial cells. The Src-induced protrusions were located at sites of basement membrane degradation, however cell invasion was never detected in this in vivo model. These findings argue that on their own invadopodia are not sufficient for invasion of mammalian cells from an intact tissue in vivo.</p>
        <p>Although activated Src did not induce invasion in wild type epithelial cells, our findings indicate that Src is required for invasion in <italic>mlt</italic>, as the well-characterized Src inhibitor, Src-I1, blocked matrix degradation and invasion in mutant larvae. Interestingly, Src inhibition did not disrupt formation of the invadopodia-like protrusions. The response of <italic>mlt</italic> larvae to Src inhibition therefore resembles the effect of Src knockdown in invasive breast cancer cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Mader1">[24]</xref>. The fact that other Src inhibitors had no effect in <italic>mlt</italic> could be explained by either their inability to access the intestine at larval stages (SU6656) or their different mechanisms of action. Src-l1 competitively inhibits ATP and substrate binding to Src, whereas PP2 only competes for substrate binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Karni1">[65]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Tian1">[66]</xref>. An alternate explanation is that Src-I1 targets other kinases responsible for invasion in <italic>mlt</italic>, however both Src-I1 and PP2 are specific inhibitors of mammalian Src <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Bain1">[29]</xref>, and thus are likely to function comparably to zebrafish Src, which is highly conserved.</p>
        <p>Although our data link invasion in <italic>mlt</italic> to Src, we could not detect a higher level of activated Src (phospho-Tyrosine 417) in the <italic>mlt</italic> intestine by Western blot (unpublished data). One explanation for this is that Src and related kinases are already highly activated in larvae due to their function in controlling proliferation and cell polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Guarino1">[67]</xref>. Formation of the protrusions and invasion in <italic>mlt</italic> could therefore involve the relocalization of activated Src to the basal plasma membrane. Alternatively, invasion may require the de novo activation of a relatively small localized pool of cytoplasmic Src. Supporting this idea, force application to the plasma membrane of cultured cells can rapidly activate cytoplasmic Src <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wang1">[68]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Na1">[69]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Epithelial Invadopodia and Invasion in <italic>mlt</italic> Are Triggered by a Conserved Redox Signaling Mechanism</title>
        <p>We identified a role for redox signaling in <italic>mlt</italic> based on the enhanced expression of ROS sensitive genes, the requirement for Tks5, a component of the ROS producing NAD(P)H oxidase (Nox) complex, and the invasive response of heterozygotes to exogenous oxidative stress induced by ROS generators. Redox signaling has previously been linked to cancer cell invasion and metastasis through formation of invadopodia and activation of EMT regulators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Cannito1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Gianni1">[50]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Behrend1">[70]</xref>. Our findings are novel in that the <italic>mlt</italic> redox signaling pathway is triggered by a non-cell-autonomous physical signaling mechanism that requires the interaction of cells within adjacent tissue cell layers. A related redox signaling pathway has been implicated in vascular remodeling in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Na1">[69]</xref>.

        <title>Myh11, ROS, and Cancer Progression</title>
        <p>Recently, heterozygous somatic activating mutations in <italic>MYH11</italic>, similar to <italic>mlt</italic>, were reported in human colorectal cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Alhopuro1">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Vickaryous1">[74]</xref>. Surprisingly, in the subset of the colorectal cancers examined, the <italic>MYH11</italic> mutations were found more frequently in the epithelium, which does not normally express <italic>MYH11</italic>, than in smooth muscle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Wang1">[68]</xref>. The precise role of the <italic>MYH11</italic> mutations in colorectal cancer therefore could not be resolved by these association studies. The findings presented here argue for a primary effect of these mutations in smooth muscle rather than the epithelium. As the invasive remodeling in <italic>mlt</italic> larvae occurs without prior tumor formation, we do not consider <italic>mlt</italic> to be a model for how cancers develop, but rather a model for how cancer cells react to external physical force. Thus, <italic>mlt</italic> can be used to study how epithelial tumors progress from a localized lesion to invasive cancer. Indeed, in one study the presence of the <italic>MYH11</italic> mutations was associated with the invasive transformation of benign adenomatous polyps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Vickaryous1">[74]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The response of heterozygous <italic>mlt</italic> larvae to oxidative stress is an important finding from this study because it provides an example of how tissue architecture can be altered in the appropriate genetic context. Based on our model, we argue that activating mutations of <italic>MYH11</italic> or other human smooth muscle genes could cause invasion of existing cancer in the setting of oxidative stress that is intrinsic to cancers or occurs in the setting of inflammatory conditions that promote cancer formation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Clevers1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Fox1">[77]</xref>. These mutations could alter the function of different types of contractile cells within the tumor stroma besides smooth muscle, such as pericytes and myoepithelial cells, as well stromal fibroblasts that express smooth muscle actin and other contractile proteins. Sustained contraction of these cells could alter extracellular tension in tumors, thus causing them to invade. Alternatively, tonic contraction could also originate from wild type cells present in the tumor stroma such as cancer-associated fibroblasts or related stromal cells.</p>

Injection of ∼20 pg caused an in-frame deletion of this exon but had no effect on transcript of the low molecular weight isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Abrams1">[39]</xref>.

        <title>Tissue Stiffness Measurements</title>
        <p>The elastic moduli (Young's modulus) of intestines isolated from wild type and <italic>mlt</italic> larvae were measured using a microprobe indenter device <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001386-Levental2">[43]</xref>. This assay measures the upward force generated by the intestine in response to indentation of the probe applied to the outer (serosal) surface. Tissue compliance (Young's modulus) is the slope of the force versus probe indentation curve. Briefly, a tensiometer probe (Kibron, Inc., Helsinki) with a 100 µm radius flat-bottom needle was mounted on a 3-D micromanipulator with 160 nm step size (Eppendorf, Inc.) attached to an inverted microscope. The tissue was adhered to the bottom of a plastic dish filled with DMEM and imaged by bright field illumination. The bottom of the probe was brought through the air-water interface until it rested at the surface of the cylindrical tissue with a diameter of approximately 80 microns. The probe was calibrated using the known surface tension of a pure water/air interface, and the stress applied by the tissue to the probe as it was lowered was measured as a function of indentation depth. In principle, this deformation geometry is that of an infinite plane compressing a cylindrical object, and the absolute values of elastic modulus can be calculated from appropriate models that require assumptions about the adherence of the tissue to the probe and the glass slide, whether the sample is modeled as a uniform cylinder or an elastic shell, and other structural factors that confound calculation of the absolute value of elastic modulus from the force-indentation data. In this study the primary interest is in the relative stiffness of wild type and mutant tissue, and therefore we present only the primary data, which consists of the elastic resistance of the tissues as a function of indentation depth. Indentations (≥13 per intestine) spanned the range from 160 nm, which would measure small strain reflecting linear elasticity to indentations, up to 20 microns, which would reveal differences in large strain deformation or rupture. After the largest indentations, measurements were repeated at small strains to confirm that the deformations were recoverable. For statistical analyses, a one-tailed Student's <italic>t</italic> test for data sets with unequal variance was performed to determine the significance of differences between Young's moduli of wild type and <italic>mlt</italic> intestines samples.</p>
