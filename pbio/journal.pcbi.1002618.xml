        <p>The orderly packing and precise arrangement of epithelial cells is essential to the functioning of many tissues, and refinement of this packing during development is a central theme in animal morphogenesis. The mechanisms that determine epithelial cell shape and position, however, remain incompletely understood. Here, we investigate these mechanisms in a striking example of planar order in a vertebrate epithelium: The periodic, almost crystalline distribution of cone photoreceptors in the adult teleost fish retina. Based on observations of the emergence of photoreceptor packing near the retinal margin, we propose a mathematical model in which ordered columns of cells form as a result of coupling between planar cell polarity (PCP) and anisotropic tissue-scale mechanical stresses. This model recapitulates many observed features of cone photoreceptor organization during retinal growth and regeneration. Consistent with the model's predictions, we report a planar-polarized distribution of Crumbs2a protein in cone photoreceptors in both unperturbed and regenerated tissue. We further show that the pattern perturbations predicted by the model to occur if the imposed stresses become isotropic closely resemble defects in the cone pattern in zebrafish <italic>lrp2</italic> mutants, in which intraocular pressure is increased, resulting in altered mechanical stress and ocular enlargement. Evidence of interactions linking PCP, cell shape, and mechanical stresses has recently emerged in a number of systems, several of which show signs of columnar cell packing akin to that described here. Our results may hence have broader relevance for the organization of cells in epithelia. Whereas earlier models have allowed only for unidirectional influences between PCP and cell mechanics, the simple, phenomenological framework that we introduce here can encompass a broad range of bidirectional feedback interactions among planar polarity, shape, and stresses; our model thus represents a conceptual framework that can address many questions of importance to morphogenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Many tissues and organs, including sensory organs like the vertebrate retina and inner ear, are built from sheets of connected cells called epithelia. The precise arrangement of different types of cells within these epithelia can be essential to their function. (For example, photoreceptor cells in eyes must be properly spaced to collect an optimal, undistorted signal.) We combine experimental observations with computational modeling to understand how a particular example of such epithelial organization—the planar crystalline packing of cone photoreceptor cells in the fish retina—is created. Specifically, we introduce a model where the strength of cell-cell adhesion along an interface depends on the orientation of that interface. When a global mechanical compression is applied along one direction, this model can recapitulate observed features of the cone packing and gives qualitatively correct predictions of the cone photoreceptor pattern observed in regenerated and mutant retinas. Our analysis shows that simple local interactions can direct the creation of regular, long-ranged order among epithelial cells, and it also clarifies the mechanical interactions needed to establish and maintain the integrity of the retinal epithelium. Our model may thus ultimately provide a foundation for insights into diseases in which epithelial integrity is lost.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Epithelia are one of the basic building blocks from which animals sculpt complex tissues and organs during development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Davidson1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Martin1">[5]</xref>. These sheets of cells are held together by specialized structures—notably apical junctional complexes, including adherens junctions—that allow cells to adhere tightly to their neighbors and ensure the epithelium's mechanical integrity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Cavey1">[6]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Tepass1">[9]</xref>. In most epithelia, individual cells of distinct identities are packed together in quasi-two-dimensional arrays of varying complexity. Despite the fundamental importance of epithelial organization for many biological functions, the biophysical mechanisms that control cell shape and position in epithelia—and in particular the development of regular, ordered epithelial cell packings—remain only partially understood.</p>
      <p>In vertebrates, the neural retina exhibits a particularly high degree of epithelial organization, both in the radial direction, where it comprises multiple, stratified layers, and within layers, where the spatial distribution of each class of neuron within the epithelial plane has consistently been shown to be non-random <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Pujic1">[10]</xref>. This planar order is especially pronounced in adult teleost fish, where the cone photoreceptor cells are arranged in a well-defined, periodic pattern—the cone mosaic—that shows strong heterotypic as well as homotypic correlations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Engstrm1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Lyall1">[12]</xref>. The cone mosaic thus represents a rare vertebrate example of the precise regulation of cell fate and organization at the single cell level (more instances of which have been described in invertebrate systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Classen1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Ready1">[14]</xref>).</p>
      <p>Previous studies have characterized cone mosaic patterns primarily by observing regular spatial arrangements of various individual cone cell subtypes, identified morphologically and/or with specific cell markers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Shand1">[18]</xref>. They have, in contrast, left largely unexplored the complementary question of how cone photoreceptors, together with rod photoreceptors and the apical processes of Müller glia, pack together and occupy space in the epithelial plane. Depending on the species, cone photoreceptors in teleost fish include several morphologically identifiable classes of single cones and double cones that express distinct visual pigments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Bowmaker1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hofmann1">[20]</xref>. For example, the zebrafish, <italic>Danio rerio</italic>, has four spectral subtypes of cones designated red, green, blue, and ultraviolet (UV), respectively, based on the absorption maxima of their visual pigments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Chinen1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Nawrocki1">[22]</xref>. These cone photoreceptors are distributed in a repeating pattern that has been classically described as a row mosaic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Engstrm1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Larison1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Raymond1">[23]</xref>.</p>

      <p>The zebrafish retina is a thin, hemispheric sheet that lines the back of the eye. This sheet continues to grow along with the rest of the fish throughout postembryonic larval and adult stages: the diameter of the eye at the end of embryonic development (∼3 days post-fertilization [dpf]) is only ∼0.2 mm, but several months later it can reach ∼2 mm or more. From ∼3 dpf onwards, retinal growth is accomplished by the addition of new cone cells at the rim of the retinal hemisphere, where the retinal and ciliary epithelia meet at a circumferential germinal zone of proliferative precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Ochocinska1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Stenkamp1">[27]</xref>. Due to this particular mode of continuous growth, successive stages of development and cell differentiation are laid out spatially in concentric annuli in a single epithelium: the remnant of the embryonic and larval retina remains in the center of the retina of the adult fish, whereas the majority of the adult retina extending out to the periphery is more recently created tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>. The embryonic/larval remnant is easily distinguished in a flat-mounted preparation of the entire adult retina because neither the cones generated from the embryonic retinal primordium nor those added post-embryonically to the growing larval retina are arrayed in a regular, rectangular mosaic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Shand1">[18]</xref>. Even though the growing retina adds annuli of new cones at the periphery from late embryonic stages onwards, only those born after the end of larval development, at ∼3 weeks post-fertilization (wpf), form an ordered mosaic lattice. Thus, addition of successive annuli of cone photoreceptors at the retinal perimeter is not, by itself, sufficient to produce a crystalline cone mosaic.</p>
      <p>The appearance of the ordered lattice of cone photoreceptors at ∼3 wpf, on the other hand, <italic>does</italic> coincide with the completion of significant developmental changes in ocular anatomy. These include the formation and maturation of the anterior segment—that is, the iris, the ciliary epithelium, and the annular ligament, a circular bracket of connective tissue that is thought to give structural support to the front of the eye and that roughly encircles the retinal germinal zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Soules1">[28]</xref>. The maturation of the anterior segment leads to the production of aqueous humor, a fluid secreted by the ciliary epithelium that fills the eyeball. The aqueous humor is maintained at a significant intraocular hydrostatic pressure (IOP) relative to the outside environment, and this pressure inflates and stretches the retinal epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Anderson1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Nickla1">[31]</xref>. Similar mechanical stresses are known to affect epithelial cell packing in other contexts, but the potential relationship between these tissue-scale influences and the organization of the cone mosaic pattern has not been explored.</p>
      <p>Another mechanism known to influence cell shape and packing in epithelia is planar cell polarity (PCP)—the organization of cellular properties along a preferred direction within the plane of an epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Goodrich1">[32]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Gray1">[33]</xref>. Such polarization is increasingly recognized as a widespread and important feature of epithelial organization. PCP has not previously been studied in the vertebrate retina, but its molecular mechanisms have been worked out in considerable detail in certain <italic>Drosophila</italic> model systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zallen1">[34]</xref>, and the same pathway appears to be conserved in some vertebrate systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Simons1">[35]</xref>. One of the major functions of PCP is to introduce anisotropic mechanical stresses in epithelial sheets through modulation of acto-myosin cortical contractility or cell-cell adhesion, leading to polarized cell shape changes and rearrangements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zallen1">[34]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Vichas1">[36]</xref>; conversely, PCP can itself be affected by changes in cell shape and packing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Aigouy1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Ma1">[38]</xref> and by mechanical stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Olguin1">[39]</xref>. Several mathematical models of PCP have been developed, ranging from the relatively molecularly detailed to the more schematic and phenomenological <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Aigouy1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Ma1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Amonlirdviman1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Viktorinova1">[46]</xref>, and the consequences of polarized contractility and adhesion for cell movement have also been examined computationally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zajac1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Mao1">[49]</xref>. A mathematical model that can capture the full range of interactions between PCP and mechanical forces has, however, so far been lacking.</p>
      <p>Here, we propose just such a model to explain the developmental mechanisms behind the emergence of the ordered cone mosaic in the adult zebrafish retina. We present the first systematic experimental characterization of the epithelial packing of cone and rod photoreceptors and Müller glia at the apical surface of the retina, and we describe both the evolution of packing order as new cells are generated during retinal growth and the defects in order that accompany photoreceptor regeneration and that occur in a mutant strain of zebrafish with elevated intraocular pressure. Based on our observations, we introduce a mathematical model in which anisotropic, tissue-scale mechanical stresses interact with intrinsic planar cell polarity (PCP) in cones to generate cell packing in a rectangular lattice with long-ranged order. We provide morphological observations to verify the existence of the postulated PCP and functional genetic data consistent with the predicted role of anisotropic mechanical stress in the generation of the rectangular cone lattice.</p>

        <p>We first characterized the apical epithelial organization in the photoreceptor layer of adult zebrafish. The photoreceptor mosaic pattern in zebrafish has been previously described by observing the positions of photoreceptor cells in flat-mount retinal preparations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Larison1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Raymond1">[23]</xref>. Cones in the adult retina are organized in a rectangular lattice consisting of a repeated motif of 12 cells with an internal, reiterative, mirror image symmetry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>). Rows of blue and UV single cones alternate with rows of red and green double cone pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Figs. 1A–B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">S1A–C</xref>). Double cone pairs are tightly apposed along the length of their apical processes (inner segments) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Larison1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Branchek1">[54]</xref>. In the orthogonal direction, columns of cones can be separated by rods, which have much smaller profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Figs. 1A, C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">S1D–I</xref>). The adult teleost retina continues to grow by addition of retinal cells in a circumferential germinal zone at the retinal periphery (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1D</xref>), and each column of cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1A</xref>) represents a cohort of cells that are generated synchronously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Stenkamp2">[55]</xref> and differentiate sequentially <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Stenkamp2">[55]</xref>. Rods appear after cones differentiate; they continue to accumulate in the adult retina and insert into the epithelial sheet between cone columns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">Fig. S1D–I</xref>). The earliest born rod photoreceptors insert into the cone pattern at the corners defined by the four-way interface of blue, UV, red, and green cones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">Fig. S1D–F</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Fadool1">[16]</xref>); as the fish ages, rods also accumulate elsewhere between the cone columns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">Fig. S1G–I</xref>). Rod photoreceptors have been shown not to be essential for generation of the cone mosaic in goldfish retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Wan1">[56]</xref>, and we subsequently ignore rods in our analysis of cone cell packing. Finally, the numerous, irregular ZO-1-delimited cell profiles at the apical surface of the retina in the germinal zone and in the region of differentiating cones at the peripheral margin are processes of Müller glial cells, which have thin lamellae that completely enwrap the cone and rod photoreceptors as they penetrate through the OLM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">Fig. S1J–L</xref>).</p>
        <p>Labeling the cell boundaries with ZO-1 antibodies reveals additional, unexpected details of the apical epithelial packing and shape of cones at the level of the OLM. The two orthogonal directions in cone packing geometry are not equivalent: boundaries between adjacent cones belonging to the same column are straight, particularly the junctions between pairs of red and green double cones within a column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Figs. 1B–C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">S1B, E, H</xref>). These columns of cones belong to a cohort generated synchronously at the germinal zone, and they remain contiguous; rods penetrate the cone lattice between the columns but rarely between cones within the same column (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Figs. 1C</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">S1G–I</xref>). The nonequivalence in the packing geometry of cones is suggestive of a cell-cell adhesion mechanism that operates between cones <underline>within</underline> a column but <underline>not across</underline> columns.</p>
        <p>In contrast to those in the adult retina, cones that differentiate within the first few weeks after fertilization are not organized into long-range, supracellular lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1E, G</xref>), and their packing clearly lacks the periodic, repetitive, lattice organization of the adult retina. Although short, linear arrays of alternating blue and UV cones are apparent even in the embryonic remnant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1E</xref>), they are not aligned in a consistent direction and red-green double cone pairs cannot be recognized at this stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Branchek1">[54]</xref>. The embryonic and early larval retina is also known to have relatively more blue and UV cones and relatively few rods compared with the adult retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>. In the larval retina, which is formed by addition of cells at the retinal margin (lower left, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>), the ordered linear fragments become more prominent, but the long-ranged lattice order is still clearly absent.</p>
        <p>To obtain a quantitative measure of the regularity of cone cell packing at the level of the apical epithelial surface, we segmented the images of ZO-1 immunolabeled cell profiles and statistically analyzed the data with an orientational order parameter, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, that we designed to measure the similarity of the observed packing to an ideal rectangular lattice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g002">Fig. 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s009">Text S1</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s002">Fig. S2</xref>). Compared to a traditional Fourier transform measurement of positional order, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is expected to be more sensitive to relatively weak ordering <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Nelson1">[57]</xref>. It also has the advantage that it measures order relatively locally, without the requirement of averaging over a large number of cells, and thus can detect abrupt changes in the degree of ordering such as that observed at the retinal margin (below). Cones of all four subtypes are treated equivalently in the analysis, so that the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> reflects the packing organization only, independent of the distribution of spectral subtypes. The average value of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> order parameter is significantly different between the embryonic and adult retinas (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1F</xref>): <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> SD, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for embryonic retina, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) for adult retina. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e011" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is designed to vanish in a truly disordered packing, though finite size effects always give at least a small positive value when it is calculated from real data; the value for embryonic retina thus indicates that there is little or no orientational order. As an alternative measure of crystalline organization, we also computed a conventional positional order parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> from the Fourier transform of the cell centroid positions and found a similar discrepancy between embryonic and adult retinas (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for embryonic retina, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e014" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for adult retina). This difference in <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is consistent with that observed in simulations of the liquid-solid transition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hansen1">[58]</xref>; in particular, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not expected to vanish in a disordered, liquid-like packing.

        <p>The apical epithelial cell packing at the boundary between peripheral retina and germinal zone, where newly generated cones are differentiating, shows striking differences between larvae and adults: in the larval retinal margin there is no obvious distinction between the proliferative germinal zone and the differentiated retina, but instead a gradual transition from a region with heterogeneous cell shapes including large, irregular profiles of Müller glia, to the differentiated region where polygonal cone profiles dominate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Fig. 3B</xref>). In contrast, a steep transition is clearly visible in the cell profiles in the adult retinal margin from the disordered, heterogeneous proliferative region compared with the crystalline ordered regions of the differentiated retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). These distinctions were confirmed by evaluation of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> order parameter profile along the direction of growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Fig. 3C and 3E</xref>, respectively).

          <title>Motivation</title>
          <p>The creation of a crystalline cone mosaic entails at least two distinct processes: The cone photoreceptors must line up in regular columns, and spectral fates must be assigned to cones in the correct ratios. Our focus here is firmly on the former set of events, and our model is thus fundamentally a description of the forces that determine cell shape and position.</p>
          <p>Several facts from the preceding sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Figs. 1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">3</xref>) motivate the precise form of this description. First, cone photoreceptors are progressively added at the retinal margin in larval as well as in adult fish. This growth mode thus cannot by itself be sufficient to create a regular cell packing. Instead, the ordered adult pattern is first found at roughly the same developmental time that the anterior segment of the zebrafish eye attains its mature morphology, at the end of larval development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Soules1">[28]</xref>. These anatomical and developmental peculiarities lead us to hypothesize that the formation of the annular ligament, by introducing a rigid frame around the retinal margin of the adult eye, induces anisotropic mechanical stresses in the retinal epithelium, with the anisotropy likely to be most pronounced nearest to the annular ligament, which is immediately external to the retinal germinal zone <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Soules1">[28]</xref>. Cells in the germinal zone tend on average to be mildly elongated in the circumferential direction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>), parallel to the margin, suggesting, more specifically, that the annular ligament may compress the germinal zone in the radial direction (or, equivalently, may protect it from radial tensile stresses present elsewhere in the epithelium).</p>
          <p>A second notable fact is that cone photoreceptors in the adult retina align in circumferential columns a single cell wide and parallel to the germinal zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Fig. 3D</xref>). That these annular columns of cones do not wander even on large scales suggests that the junctions between columns are under a relatively high tension that tends to pull the columns straight. This idea is further supported by the observation that, when three cone-cone interfaces meet at a vertex, the angles between the junctions deviate substantially from 120° (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1H</xref>). In mechanical equilibrium, the forces exerted on the vertex by the three interfaces must balance; if the angles between the interfaces are not equal, then some interfaces must be exerting a larger force—and thus have a higher tension—than others. Indeed, from the fact that the two inter-column interfaces meeting at a vertex are nearly parallel, we can infer that their tensions are large compared with that of the third, intra-column interface.</p>
          <p>That rod photoreceptors insert primarily between columns of cones is also consistent with the idea that the interfaces between adjacent cone columns are under high tension or have weak adhesion (which amount to the same thing at a coarse-grained level), thus favoring rod insertion. Moreover, the tendency to form columns of cones a single cell wide can be seen not just in the adult retina, but also in the larval remnant, where the columns are not globally aligned, but fragments of columns are nonetheless clearly apparent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Figs. 1G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">3B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g004">4A</xref>). This indicates that the tendency towards anisotropic cell-cell interactions is not a property exclusively of the ordered adult cone mosaic, but is rather intrinsic to the cone photoreceptors themselves. We thus propose that the cone photoreceptors in the retinal epithelium exhibit polarized cell-cell adhesion and cortical tension mediated by PCP, and that these lead to a tension on cell-cell interfaces that depends on their orientation relative to the direction of planar polarization.</p>

          <title>Model ingredients</title>
          <p>In the absence of a detailed molecular understanding of the determinants of photoreceptor shape and packing in the retina, we turned to a coarse-grained, phenomenological description to understand the essential consequences of our proposed coupling between mechanical forces and PCP. In keeping with earlier successful work on epithelial cell packing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Farhadifar1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Schilling1">[65]</xref>, our model focuses on cells' two-dimensional shape at the level of the adherens junctions in the OLM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Fig. 3A</xref>). Within this two dimensional model, cells are bounded by <italic>edges</italic>, corresponding to cell-cell junctions, which meet in <italic>vertices</italic> where three or more cells come together. Our model assumes that the edges are circular arcs, as they must be in mechanical equilibrium if the cells possess an isotropic pressure conjugate to their (two-dimensional) area and the cell-cell interfaces do not resist bending <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Weaire1">[66]</xref>; more generally, this assumption represents the simplest possible extension of the widely-used vertex models, which enforce straight edges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Aigouy1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Farhadifar1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hufnagel1">[62]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Staple1">[67]</xref>, to allow for the significant interfacial curvature seen in some of our images of fish retina. In addition to the positions of the vertices, the radii of curvature of the edges are dynamical variables that we follow during our simulations.</p>
          <p>The model also includes a schematic description of PCP loosely based on what is known about <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs, but flexible enough to allow for alternative molecular mechanisms that also lead to polarization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Aigouy1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Burak1">[41]</xref>. (It is perhaps worth noting that, although the signaling pathways responsible for PCP in wing discs have been analyzed extensively, genetic studies show that the molecular origins of PCP in some other <italic>Drosophila</italic> tissues, while likely related, cannot be identical <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zallen2">[68]</xref>.) In our model, membrane-bound protein complexes A and B interact in such a way that they prefer to be on opposite sides of a given cell, thereby defining a polarization vector within each cell (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g004">Fig. 4B</xref>). The extracellular domains of proteins on apposing surfaces in neighboring cells then bind, thus aligning the polarizations of neighboring cells. Although strictly polar order would demand that A complexes in one cell bind only to B complexes on apposing surfaces, we also consider the possibility of interactions reminiscent of those in nematic liquid crystals (<italic>i.e.</italic>, systems in which a preferred axis is chosen, but the two directions along this axis are equivalent <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-deGennes1">[69]</xref>) and allow A to bind to A and B to bind to B across cell-cell junctions. We assume that protein diffusion along a given edge is fast, so that the concentration of each complex is constant along edges, but keep track of slower protein exchange between edges.</p>
          <p>Finally, the model incorporates bidirectional coupling between mechanical forces and cell polarization: On the one hand, the mechanical tensions along edges, and through them the shapes of individual cells, depend on the concentrations of the PCP proteins along those edges. On the other hand, interactions between PCP proteins favor their accumulation on shorter edges, so that cells tend to polarize along their long axes. External mechanical stresses deform cells, and thereby influence PCP alignment.</p>
          <p>The precise mathematical form of the model (see below) reflects several further assumptions:</p>
          <list list-type="bullet">
            <list-item>
              <p>The model allows for two types of cells, proliferative precursor cells and cone photoreceptors. We thus do not distinguish among the different cone spectral subtypes. This choice allows us to focus on behavior that arises generically from coupling PCP to cell shape and avoids the explosion of poorly constrained parameters that would result from including four different spectral fates. The model will give an accurate description of the events leading to the establishment of the cone mosaic if, during the initial stages of mosaic formation near the retinal margin, either cell-cell interactions depend weakly on spectral subtype or spectral fate has not yet been determined. While we expect that such a model will be able to capture the initial formation of cone photoreceptor columns, it may not reproduce all of the subsequent, more subtle refinements that lead to the final crystalline mosaic.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>The PCP pathway is active in cones, but both PCP proteins have concentration zero in precursors.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>We do not explicitly include Müller glia or rod photoreceptors in the model. The phenomenological parameters that govern cell shape in our model include the average effect of glial processes interposed between cone cells at the level of the OLM. On the other hand, it is unlikely that rods contribute mechanistically in an essential way to cone mosaic formation: In several teleost species with prolonged larval development, the retina contains no rod photoreceptors, but the cone mosaic is highly ordered <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Adler1">[70]</xref>; in a zebrafish rod degeneration mutant the cone mosaic is not disrupted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Morris1">[71]</xref>; and in goldfish selective elimination of rod progenitors does not disrupt the cone mosaic <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Wan1">[56]</xref>.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>To model progressive growth of the mosaic at the retinal margin, at regular intervals we change all precursors that are touching a photoreceptor into a photoreceptor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5C</xref>). Newly formed photoreceptors initially have random concentrations of polarity proteins on their edges. Instead of explicitly modeling mitosis of precursors, we allow the cone mosaic to propagate into a large field of undifferentiated precursor cells; this should be a reasonable approximation as long as dividing cells are at least a few cell diameters away from the differentiating cone photoreceptors.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>In the unperturbed adult retina, we assume the germinal zone is compressed radially (<italic>i.e.</italic>, perpendicular to the margin), as suggested above (“Motivation”).</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Equilibrium cell shape is determined by an effective energy (or work function; <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002618.e026">Eq. 1</xref> below), with a quadratic area elasticity and an interfacial tension along the edges that summarizes the effects of both cell-cell adhesion and acto-myosin contractility in the adherens band. Such effective energy models have been quite successful in describing cell shape in other epithelia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Aigouy1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Farhadifar1">[60]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hilgenfeldt1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Kafer1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hayashi1">[72]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Larson1">[73]</xref>. In the interest of reducing the number of unknown parameters in the model, we include an interfacial energy linear in edge length, but not the additional term quadratic in cell perimeter that has been used by some authors. Although this quadratic term is necessary for precise quantitative agreement with some experiments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Farhadifar1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Kafer1">[63]</xref>, it does not affect qualitative behavior in the regime relevant to this paper, in which edges are always under a significant contractile tension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Staple1">[67]</xref>.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>PCP protein concentrations are governed by a purely phenomenological effective energy (<xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pcbi.1002618.e031">Eq. 2</xref> below) chosen to yield polarization and to favor high protein concentrations on shorter edges. Total protein numbers in each cell are conserved.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Interfacial tensions vary linearly with PCP protein concentration. This dependence might reflect either direct adhesive interactions between core PCP proteins or polarized recruitment of molecules that modulate either cell-cell adhesion or the tension of the actin-myosin cortex in the adherens band.</p>
            </list-item>
            <list-item>
              <p>Vertices move in the direction of the net force exerted on them by the tensions of their adjoining edges, and edge curvatures evolve towards a balance between edge tension and the pressure difference between adjoining cells. PCP protein concentrations move downhill in the PCP effective energy (for given cell shapes and topology). We do not, however, include cross derivatives between the mechanical and PCP energies. That is, the PCP dynamics does not depend on the mechanical energy, even though the edge tensions are modulated by PCP protein concentrations, and similarly the shape dynamics is independent of the PCP energy. Thus, although it is based on two effective energies, the model is not variational in form and so is clearly non-equilibrium.</p>

            <list-item>
              <p>Topological transitions in the cell packing are attempted when two vertices come within a certain cutoff distance of each other and are accepted if the net tension force on the two vertices after the transition tends to separate them further (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, below).</p>

          <title>Simulation results</title>
          <p>We found that simulations of our model were able to replicate most of the major observed features of cone mosaic formation in zebrafish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s010">Video S1</xref>). When the cone fate is induced in a new column of cells, their PCP axis aligns parallel to the retinal margin. With this PCP orientation, the tensions of edges perpendicular to the margin are low while those of edges parallel to it are high, leading to straight, well-ordered columns parallel to the margin, with only occasional defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5E</xref>). The cells in these columns have roughly rectangular or trapezoidal shapes, like those observed in adult fish retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g004">Figs. 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">S1B, E, H, K</xref>). Reflecting the ordering achieved in the simulated packing, order parameters computed from the cell centroid positions were relatively high (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e081" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e082" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, [mean <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>SD, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>]).

That the order parameter values obtained for simulated ordered packings are slightly higher than the measured order parameters of adult retinas presumably reflects the presence of sources of variability and noise in the actual biological tissue (or the fixation and imaging procedures) beyond those included in the model.</p>

          <p>The computations also reproduce some more subtle features of our experimental observations that we did not deliberately try to include in the model. For example, in our simulations, edges parallel to the margin, between columns, often alternate between long and short, with the shorter edges, which appear slightly tilted relative to the margin, having higher PCP protein concentrations. At vertices joining long and short edges parallel to the margin, the third edge is tilted towards the shorter of the other two edges, consistent with the fact that the short edges tend to have a lower tension than the long edges. As a result, many of the edges within columns are not oriented exactly perpendicular to the columns, but are instead angled. Similar patterns are seen near the margin in adult fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Figs. 3D</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">S4J</xref>).</p>
          <p>Importantly, our model requires both progressive, column-by-column growth and anisotropic stress to produce a well-ordered cone mosaic. In the absence of either factor, errors tend to proliferate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5B, D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s011">Videos S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s012">S3</xref>). In particular, progressive growth with isotropic stress (which we hypothesize occurs in the larval fish) yields a packing that shows significant short-ranged correlations but lacks a truly ordered lattice, just as we observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>; compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g003">Figs. 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g004">4A</xref>). Indeed, even a transient loss of stress anisotropy at the tissue scale leads to mosaic disruption. If the anisotropy is subsequently restored, the patterning process can recover, and newly created columns will be well-ordered, but the defects created while the stress was isotropic cannot readily be removed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>). Thus, a temporary perturbation of the retina's mechanical environment is predicted to lead to a band of disorganized cell packing within the adult retinal mosaic. The effects of removing progressive growth can be studied experimentally by, for example, ablating cone photoreceptors in the center of the retina and allowing them to regenerate (from Müller glia that function as retinal stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Bernardos1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hitchcock1">[76]</xref>). Similarly, if the intraocular pressure is altered, we expect that the stress anisotropy would be affected. We report experiments examining both of these effects in the next two sections.</p>
          <p>We also find that the greatest regularity in cell packing generated by the model is attained when the PCP systems in neighboring cells have nematic, rather than purely polar interactions; in the strictly polar case, newly differentiating cells can choose one of two PCP orientations parallel to the margin, and columns tend to be deformed or broken at boundaries between domains with different orientations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s007">Fig. S7</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s013">Video S4</xref>). On the other hand, our model is robust to parameter variation, with qualitatively correct behavior persisting over at least a factor of 2 in each parameter (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>, below, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). This is hardly surprising; indeed, the arguments motivating our model indicate that it should quite generically lead to anisotropic, column-like organization of cells akin to what we observe in fish retina.</p>

        <title>Polarization of Crumbs2a as predicted by the mathematical model</title>
        <p>In order to test our proposal that PCP couples with mechanical interactions to sculpt the cone mosaic, we first looked for experimental evidence of planar polarization in the retinal epithelium. The Crumbs complex–the transmembrane Crumbs2a (Crb2a) protein and associated intracellular scaffolding proteins in the MPP5 (membrane palmitolated protein 5) family (<italic>Drosophila</italic> ortholog <italic>stardust</italic> and zebrafish orthologs <italic>Nok</italic> and <italic>Ponli</italic>)–localizes to the subapical region (SAR) in the inner segment region of zebrafish cone photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hsu1">[77]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zou2">[79]</xref>. This complex is important in maintaining apical-basal polarity and the integrity of the adherens junctions at the OLM and is thought to mediate cell-cell adhesion both between photoreceptors and Müller glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Gosens1">[50]</xref> and between photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zou1">[78]</xref>.</p>
        <p>As cone photoreceptors differentiate, for example in the larval retina from 4 to 10 dpf, the inner segment elongates, as does the SAR, as delimited by Crb2a immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">Fig. S4A–C</xref>). In the adult, the SAR interface between inner segments of red-green double cones extends up to 50 µm apical to the OLM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">Fig. S4D–I</xref>). In contrast, thin lamellar processes of Müller glia surround each cone profile at the level of the OLM, as identified by ZO-1 immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s001">Figs. S1J–L</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">S4D</xref>), but in the adult retina, these processes extend at most ∼15 µm apically beyond the OLM (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">Fig. S4G–I</xref>). Above the Müller glial processes, the inner segments (SAR) of cones have the opportunity for direct cell-cell contacts without intervening glia (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">Fig. S4E–H</xref>). The inner segments/SAR of the red-green double cone pairs, in particular, are tightly apposed and exclude all Müller glial processes from the level of the OLM apically (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">Fig. S4I</xref>).</p>
        <p>We found that the distribution of Crb2a protein in cone photoreceptors is co-localized with ZO-1 at the level of the zonula adherens in the OLM, but shows planar polarization at the level of the inner segments within the SAR. In this region of direct cell-cell contacts between cones, the Crb2a protein exhibits a polarized distribution aligned with the rectangular cone lattice, as predicted by the mathematical model, with Crb2a enriched along interfaces between adjacent cones within columns compared with interfaces between columns (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">Fig. 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s004">S4J–L</xref>). High levels of Crb2a in the SAR are thus correlated with relatively weak interfacial tensions while low levels indicate higher tensions. Importantly, this planar polarization is observed near the retinal margin, before significant numbers of rods that might prevent contacts between cones in different columns have inserted. Indeed, it is interesting to note that rods subsequently insert along interfaces with low Crb2a concentrations, consistent with reports that knockdown of Crumbs favors insertion of transplanted rods into murine retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Pearson1">[80]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Disrupted mosaics as predicted by the mathematical model</title>
        <p>One of the motivations for introducing PCP, and hence planar polarized mechanical interactions between cone photoreceptors, into our model was the observed linear fragments of cone columns even in the embryonic or larval retina or remnants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Figs. 1E, G</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g004">4A</xref>), where long-ranged order is lacking. The model predicts that similar ordered domains should be observed wherever the cone mosaic is not fully crystalline. To verify this prediction, we examined cone photoreceptor cell packing in regenerated retinal tissue in adult zebrafish. If photoreceptors in a region of the neural retina in adult zebrafish are ablated through exposure to very intense light, the Müller glia in the affected region re-enter the cell cycle and form scattered clusters of neurogenic progenitor cells that regenerate a new complement of cone photoreceptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Bernardos1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hitchcock1">[76]</xref>. The resulting restored photoreceptor mosaic, however, lacks the crystalline order seen in the undamaged adult retina <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Stenkamp1">[27]</xref>. Instead, we find that the regenerated retina contains short, curvilinear chains of cones, a single cell wide, with intervening spaces filled with rods (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>). The organization of cones in the regenerated retina is closer to simulations of packing of cones being specified simultaneously under a global isotropic stress, where disconnected regions of rectangular order form in all directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5A</xref>). It also somewhat resembles that of the larval remnant in the adult retina (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g001">Fig. 1G</xref>), though the larval remnant has far fewer rods. This striking morphology is strong evidence of anisotropic, polarized interactions between individual cones, independent of any crystalline ordering. Moreover, in the SAR of the regenerated cones, Crb2a localizes preferentially to interfaces within the curvilinear chains of cones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>), suggesting that these groups may be viewed as fragments of cone cell columns organized by PCP-dependent junctional structures, just as the mathematical model predicts.</p>
        <p>Our model also suggests that perturbations of the mechanical environment of the retina as cones are differentiating should lead to defects in the cone mosaic. Consistent with this prediction, we find that the cone mosaic is disturbed in <italic>bugeye</italic> mutant fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>; compare simulations <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5D, F</xref>). The <italic>bugeye</italic> locus encodes the Low density lipoprotein receptor-related protein 2 (Lrp2), a large transmembrane receptor with multiple identified ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Veth1">[81]</xref>. In the eye, Lrp2 is expressed in the ciliary epithelium of the anterior segment of the eye and in the retinal pigment epithelium behind the neural retina, but not in the neural retina itself. The phenotype of the <italic>bugeye</italic> mutants in adult fish includes enlarged eyes, elevated intraocular pressure (IOP), and thinner epithelial layers with decreased photoreceptor density (consistent with mechanical stretching induced by the IOP), but with variable penetrance; the severity and time of onset of the defects varies significantly from one animal to the next and even between the two eyes of a single fish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Veth1">[81]</xref>. We detected cone mosaic disruption only in enlarged eyes of <italic>bugeye</italic> fish (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">Fig. 6D</xref>). When imperfections were observed, they were strongly reminiscent of the defects found in the regenerated regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">Fig. 6C</xref>) and in simulations of our model in the absence of a global stress anisotropy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5D</xref>). Because Lrp2 is not expressed in photoreceptor neurons, the effects of the mutation must be transmitted to the photoreceptor layer either through a secondary signal from the retinal pigmented or ciliary epithelium or through changes in mechanical properties like IOP. (One effect of such a secondary signal might be to affect cell proliferation or death, but no increase in apoptosis is observed in the photoreceptor layer, and, although there is conflicting evidence as to whether and how proliferation is affected, experiments to date do not suggest dramatic enough changes in proliferation to induce the near-complete loss of long-ranged order of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g006">Fig. 6D</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Veth1">[81]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Sherpa1">[82]</xref>). Although we cannot rule out the possibility of some unknown signal from the non-neural ocular epithelia that is permissive for crystalline mosaics, we favor the latter hypothesis: The loss of long-ranged crystalline order in a mutant with elevated IOP suggests that large changes in the IOP may disrupt the pattern of tissue-scale mechanical stresses necessary for global alignment of the mosaic pattern, as predicted by our mathematical model.</p>

        <title>The geometry of photoreceptor packing in the retinal epithelium</title>
        <p>In the crystalline cone mosaic of the adult zebrafish retina, both the spectral fates of cone photoreceptor cells and their shape and packing in the apical plane of the retina exhibit precise patterns. Here, we have focused on the planar packing of cones, which appears to arise roughly simultaneously with the determination of cone cell fate and the differentiation of the SAR as represented by elaboration of the cone inner segment. To gain insights into the mechanisms producing the rectangular lattice packing, we first characterized the arrangement of cone and rod photoreceptors in mature zebrafish retina, which we showed is dominated by circumferential columns of closely apposed cones, a single cell wide, oriented parallel to the site of cone genesis in the germinal zone at the peripheral retinal margin. The cones in a column thus represent a cohort of cells of approximately the same age. Cones in successive columns are also aligned in radiating rows, and rod photoreceptors are mostly constrained to the interstices between cone columns. This rectangular lattice pattern contrasts with the more disordered cone cell packing in the embryonic and larval retina, which largely lacks rods and has reduced numbers of red and green cones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Allison1">[15]</xref>, but which nevertheless shows evidence of short, linear chains of cones, reminiscent of the columns in the adult cone mosaic, albeit without long ranged order. We also examined the emergence of epithelial order as new cones are generated at the retinal germinal zone and contrasted this with the relative lack of order in two experimental conditions: 1) when cones in light-damaged, adult zebrafish regenerated in central retina from unaligned, scattered neurogenic foci, and 2) when cones were generated in the <italic>bugeye</italic> mutant zebrafish, which has altered intraocular mechanics.</p>
        <p>Cone photoreceptor genesis in both larval and adult zebrafish occurs only in the germinal zone at the circumference of the retina, and in both cases the retina grows by adding successive annuli of cells at the perimeter. Nonetheless, a truly ordered cone mosaic is only seen in adults, not in larval fish. Thus, progressive, spatially restricted differentiation cannot, by itself, explain the appearance of a crystalline cell packing. Instead, the emergence of regular cone packing coincides with the maturation of the ciliary epithelium in the anterior segment at the end of larval development, with the concomitant production of aqueous humor and the resultant intraocular pressure, and with the simultaneous formation of the annular ligament, a mechanical constraint overlying the retinal germinal zone in the anterior segment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Soules1">[28]</xref>. We therefore hypothesize that the tissue-scale mechanical environment may play a central role in regulating local cell shapes and packing in the retinal epithelium as the cone mosaic is formed and that the development of the anterior segment may lead to a significant change in this mechanical environment. Building on this idea and on our experimental observations, we propose that circumferential columns of cones form through a feedback between mechanical tension at cell-cell interfaces and PCP, with an anisotropic mechanical stress, possibly imposed by the annular ligament, providing an overall orientational signal. A mathematical model incorporating both cell mechanics and PCP reveals that such a global mechanical stress, together with progressive growth and addition of cells at the retinal margin, is sufficient to robustly assemble the new cones into a coherent rectangular lattice.</p>
        <p>The model is supported by our observations of a polarized distribution of Crumbs2a protein in differentiating cones near the retinal margin, as well as in mature cones in the patterned areas of adult fish. The Crumbs transmembrane proteins define the apical membrane of epithelial cells, including photoreceptors in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and vertebrates, and are implicated in cell-cell adhesion through a poorly understood mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Gosens1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hsu1">[77]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Wei1">[83]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zou3">[84]</xref>. The intracellular domain of Crumbs proteins is associated with a macromolecular complex of scaffolding proteins, including the MPP5 proteins such as zebrafish Nok <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Wei1">[83]</xref>. Genetic evidence suggests that the Crumbs/Nok apical junctional complex mediates photoreceptor-photoreceptor adhesion in zebrafish: In a zebrafish mutant with nonfunctional N-cadherin, the adherens junctions of the OLM are destabilized and the apicobasal polarity of the retinal epithelium is destroyed, but the photoreceptors nevertheless develop an intrinsic apical-basal polarity and self-associate into small, scattered, spherical “rosettes” with apical surfaces pointing toward the center; in the absence of functional Nok protein, rosettes fail to form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Wei1">[83]</xref>. Further, Nok mutant photoreceptors fail to localize Crumbs protein to the SAR of the inner segments, and photoreceptor cells with mutant Nok protein transplanted into a wild type retina show increased mobility (consistent with reduced cell-cell adhesion) when viewed by time-lapse microscopy in a living zebrafish embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Wei1">[83]</xref>. Even more relevant to the present results are recent reports on the subcellular localization of two proteins, a novel Nok/MPP5 family member in zebrafish, Ponli (Photoreceptor-layer-nok-like), and Crumbs2b, both of which are expressed exclusively in red, green, and blue cones and which show polarized localization to the SAR coincident with the localization demonstrated here for Crb2a, <italic>i.e.</italic> at the interfaces between cones within a column, but not between columns <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zou2">[79]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zou3">[84]</xref>.</p>
        <p>In further support of our model, we have here reported fragments of cone cell columns in cones regenerating within the adult retina at a distance from the germinal zone and the annular ligament <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Bernardos1">[75]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Hitchcock1">[76]</xref> and in the <italic>bugeye</italic> mutant, in which the ocular globe enlarges dramatically as a consequence of increased intraocular pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Veth1">[81]</xref>; these column fragments exhibit a planar-polarized Crb2a distribution that corresponds very closely to that seen in the cone cell columns of unperturbed retina. Very recently, Zou <italic>et al.</italic> have observed similar column fragments in transgenic fish with secreted Crb2b extracellular fragment <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Zou3">[84]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Additional evidence for strong adhesive interactions between cone photoreceptors comes from morphological observations.

        <title>A mathematical model of PCP and cell shape</title>
        <p>The defining characteristic of the model presented here is the feedback loop encompassing mechanical stresses, cell shape, and PCP: Anisotropic stresses, whether externally imposed on the epithelial sheet or generated internally, tend to deform cells, and the resulting elongated cell shapes in turn favor cell polarization along a particular direction in the epithelial plane. Finally, PCP leads to anisotropic tensions along cell-cell interfaces, closing the loop. Importantly, cells in our model will spontaneously polarize even in the absence of tissue-scale anisotropic stresses imposed by the annular ligament, which serve only to encourage all cells to align in the same direction (and hence to line up in columns); the model's behavior is thus insensitive to the exact magnitude of the anisotropy. In the presence of a global stress anisotropy, these interactions are sufficient to reproduce the observed packing of cone photoreceptors near the retinal margin, including not only the presence of aligned columns, but also such unexpected features as the tendency of cell-cell interfaces within columns to tilt relative to the average column direction and the rotation of the average direction of the cone cells' long axis as they leave the germinal zone. Consistent with our hypothesis of a central role for PCP in determining cell packing, we have moreover observed planar-polarized protein distributions in adult cone mosaics and a tendency of cone photoreceptors in regenerated retina to form chains, suggestive of planar-polarized interactions between these cells.</p>
        <p>Our model makes several further predictions that we have not yet been able to test experimentally. Most obviously, we expect that the retinal epithelium supports anisotropic mechanical stresses. On the scale of the entire tissue, this should take the form of different diagonal stress tensor components in the radial and circumferential directions. At the level of individual cells, cell-cell interfaces are expected to have disparate tensions depending on their orientation relative to the direction of the cell's planar polarization. In fact, it should be possible to correlate interfacial tensions with the concentrations of proteins (including perhaps Crb) implicated in PCP. In principle, tension anisotropy on both scales can be measured with appropriate forms of laser microsurgery combined with live cell imaging <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Farhadifar1">[60]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Landsberg1">[64]</xref>. In addition, it might be possible to infer the tensions along individual interfaces from a careful analysis of cell shapes and, in particular, of the angles at which interfaces meet at vertices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Brodland1">[90]</xref>. More broadly, our analysis suggests that changes to the neural retina's overall mechanical environment should disturb the precision of the cone mosaic. Thus, mutations or experimental treatments affecting the eye anterior segment—and especially the annular ligament—might be expected to disrupt the cone mosaic; for example, if it were possible to ablate the annular ligament entirely, we would predict that the crystalline cone mosaic would revert to something closer to the disordered packing seen in the larval retina. Similar effects might also occur as a result of sufficiently large and sustained changes to the intraocular pressure, though in this case global mechanical effects might be difficult to separate from the consequences of physiological stress responses within individual photoreceptor neurons.</p>

        <title>Outlook</title>
        <p>One striking feature of the cell packing at the retinal margin in the adult is the sudden shift from a haphazard cell array in the germinal zone to the orderly columns characteristic of mature retina. This is to be contrasted with the more gradual rearrangements seen in another prominent example of a crystalline cell packing resulting from front-like growth: In the <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye imaginal disc, a rough lattice of isolated cells fated to become R8 photoreceptors is first selected from within an essentially disordered cell packing. These R8s then signal to surrounding cells to induce successive waves of differentiation, with significant changes in cell shape and position in most cases coming more gradually and only after fate specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Wolff1">[91]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Roignant1">[92]</xref>. The abrupt appearance of columns in fish retina suggests a much tighter integration of spectral fate specification and morphogenesis.</p>
        <p>Also of note is our observation of planar polarized Crb protein localization in cells near the retinal margin. The Crumbs complex, which includes transmembrane Crumbs proteins and associated intracellular proteins MPP5 and Patj, is thought to work in concert with the Par-3 complex, which includes the cytoplasmic proteins Par-3 (Bazooka in <italic>Drosophila</italic>), Par-6, aPKC, and Cdc42, to define distinct apical membrane domains in epithelial cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Gosens1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-StJohnston1">[93]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Nance1">[95]</xref>. More recently, studies in <italic>Drosophila</italic> have implicated many of these same proteins—including, in one case, Crb <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Kaplan1">[96]</xref>—in PCP, especially in systems where PCP is intimately linked with polarized contraction of cell-cell interfaces <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Rauzi1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-StJohnston2">[94]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Nance1">[95]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Bellaiche1">[97]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-deMatosSimoes1">[101]</xref>. Our results suggest a related role for Crb in fish retina Significantly, in the fly systems, apical proteins have higher concentration on edges with lower tensions, and we likewise observe preferential Crb localization to (presumptively) lower tension edges in fish. Our observations thus hint that much of the machinery that establishes apico-basal polarity may be reused to regulate planar polarized cell movements in vertebrates, just as it is in flies.</p>
        <p>It is well established that PCP can lead to anisotropic tensions along cell-cell interfaces, and thereby to cell shape changes or even to large-scale tissue remodeling. This is perhaps most dramatically seen in convergent extension <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Rauzi1">[48]</xref>, but the PCP pathway is also required in other processes, ranging from oriented cell division to the establishment of the hexagonal cell packing in <italic>Drosophila</italic> wing imaginal discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Classen1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Mao1">[49]</xref> or the morphogenesis of Kupffer's vesicle in zebrafish <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Oteiza1">[102]</xref>. On the other hand, recent evidence also indicates that both static cell packing defects and the dynamics of cell division and changes in packing topology can influence PCP in wing discs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Aigouy1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Ma1">[38]</xref>. Mathematical models have been able to reproduce and explain many of these observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Aigouy1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Ma1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Rauzi1">[48]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Mao1">[49]</xref>. This prior work, however, focuses largely on unidirectional influences either of PCP on cell mechanics or of cell mechanics on PCP. By including interactions in both directions, we are able to paint a more complete portrait of morphogenetic processes involving PCP. Indeed, the studies just cited show that such feedback loops must exist in wing discs. Likewise, columns of cells reminiscent of those seen in mature fish retina appear in several other systems where PCP is known to be active, most notably in the ventral epidermis of <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, where a similar interplay among PCP, polarized tensions, and cell shape changes may well be at work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Kaplan1">[96]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Colosimo1">[99]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Simone1">[100]</xref>. In convergent extension, it remains unclear how the global PCP orientation is faithfully maintained in the face of large-scale cell movements; as these rearrangements are themselves dependent on PCP, this question can only be addressed with models that integrate the dynamics of PCP and of cell motion. Our model is thus likely to find applications in investigations of many other systems.</p>

          <p>Two different dissection methods were used to prepare retinal flat mounts from adult zebrafish to visualize the cellular organization at the apical retinal surface:</p>
          <p>In the first method, which is the standard retinal flat-mount, the retina is isolated from the other ocular tissues, and mounted flat on a microscope slide. Adult zebrafish, 2–4 months post-fertilization (mpf) were anesthetized in Tricane (Sigma). With Vannas micro-scissors, a circumferential cut was made at the limbus and the entire anterior segment (ciliary epithelium, iris epithelium, lens and cornea) was removed. A radial cut was made along the ventral axis of the eye cup for orientation, the optic nerve was severed, and the retina was flushed out of the eyecup onto a piece of Parafilm by applying a stream of phosphate buffered saline. A large drop of fixative (4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 with 5% sucrose) was placed on the tissue and short relaxing cuts were made along the retinal perimeter. After 15 minutes a second piece of Parafilm was placed on top of the drop of fixative and a 2.5 g weight was placed on top to flatten the retina. The tissue was placed in a humid chamber fixed flat for 30 minutes, then removed from the Parafilm sandwich and immersion-fixed for another 45 minutes. After fixation the tissue was rinsed in 0.1M phosphate buffer with 5% sucrose, 3 times for 20 minutes each and mounted on a microscope slide with the photoreceptor side down. The photoreceptor layer was imaged by focusing down through the retina from the vitreal surface.</p>
          <p>A second method was designed to visualize the germinal zone and the new cone photoreceptors generated at the peripheral retinal margin, which is at the limbus of the eye, the junction between sclera and cornea. This region of the retina is often damaged in the dissection method above. Adult zebrafish, 2–4 mpf were anesthetized, the eyes were enucleated and placed cornea side down on a piece of Parafilm. A hole was made with a microscalpel in the back of the eye at the optic nerve head and radial cuts were made with Vannas microscissors along the dorsal/nasal and ventral/temporal axes through the sclera, choroid, pigmented epithelium, and neural retina. The four flaps were gently laid open and the lens removed. The tissue was transferred to a drop of fixative and processed as described above except a 15 g weight was used to flatten the eyecup. After fixation the tissue was rinsed in 0.1M phosphate buffer with 5% sucrose, 3 times for 20 minutes each and mounted on a microscope slide with the scleral side down.</p>
          <p>For whole mount preparations of larval zebrafish eyes, embryos were treated with PTU (1-phenyl-2-thiourea) at 12 hours post-fertilization to block melanin formation in the retinal pigmented epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002618-Westerfield1">[105]</xref>. The larval fish were fixed at 4–5 days post-fertilization in 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.1 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4 with 5% sucrose for 2 hours at room temperature and rinsed three times for 20 minutes each. Prior to whole mount immunocytochemistry (see below) the eyes were dissected out of the head of the larval fish; processed eyes were mounted under a coverslip on a microscope slide.</p>

        <p>An orientational order parameter reflecting the four-fold rotational symmetry of a perfect cone mosaic was used to evaluate quantitatively the closeness of an arrangement of cells to a rectangular periodic lattice. Inside each cell, a cross is specified (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, blue line) whose orientation reflects the neighbors position. To do so, for every orientation of the cross the plane is separated into four quadrants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g002">Fig. 2A</xref>, dotted line) and the distance between the arms of the cells and the closest neighbor within the quadrant to which the arm belongs is calculated.

This allows assigning a cross for every cell in the epithelium characterizing the packing geometry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g002">Fig. 2B</xref>).

          <p>Different choices can be made on how much polarity protein the newly formed edge receives. We chose to redistribute polarity proteins according to the following rules, where the new edge is formed between the vertices connecting respectively the edges 1 and 3 and 2 and 4 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s005">Fig. S5B</xref>): <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e118" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. These rules ensure that a certain amount of protein is redistributed to the newly formed edge while conserving the total number of proteins in each cell. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, there are no polarity proteins on the newly formed edge, which in our framework leads to a new edge with a high tension and therefore promotes 4-fold vertices. For <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of order 1, formation of new edges is favored, which can later lead to the disappearance of the new edge following redistribution of the polarity proteins and hence to cycles of formation and disappearance of an edge.

          <p>Simulations are performed by starting from Voronoi tessellations of squares of side <italic>L</italic> on which <italic>N</italic> points are randomly distributed. The resulting cell packing is subsequently relaxed to equilibrium assuming uniform tensions along the edges, so that the edges meet at 120° at vertices. When cells are subsequently assigned a cone cell fate, they receive a random distribution of polarity proteins on their edges. Each concentration is chosen randomly between 0 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> where, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the edge length, with the constraint that the sum of the concentrations of each kind of protein within one cell is equal to 1. To initiate simulations of growing, propagating patterns, a first column of cone cells is established by assigning a cone cell fate to all cells crossed by a vertical line within the packing. Subsequent cone cells are then propagated by induction from this initial column, as described above.</p>

          <p>The parameters of our model can be normalized through the definition of a reference tension <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a reference length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> equal to the side length of a cell in a honeycomb packing filling the square of side <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (and thus satisfying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e128" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of cells), reference interaction strength between proteins <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and two reference timescales, a mechanical timescale <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and a polarity protein timescale <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> All other parameters can be normalized to these quantities. We set <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as the tension of precursor cells, leaving the two quantities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e133" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e134" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as free parameters for cone cells. In the limit where each polarity protein accumulates on one edge within the cell and assuming the cell polarities are correlated across the tissue, typical tensions then lie between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for edges with high polarity protein concentrations and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for edges that have no PCP proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s005">Fig. S5C</xref>).</p>
          <p>In simulations involving only cone cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5A–B</xref>) the following set of parameters was used: <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e140" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e142" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Parameters describing the PCP dynamics were empirically chosen to generate aligned polarity in a stretched honeycomb packing: The simulations were performed by relaxing a honeycomb packing with initial uniform edge tension and random concentrations of polarity proteins, taking periodic boundary conditions on a frame of fixed size. To simulate the effect of anisotropic stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5</xref>), an initial isotropic packing produced by relaxation of a Voronoi tessellation was compressed quasistatically along one direction until it reached 2/3 of its initial size, before starting the simulation with polarity proteins.</p>
          <p>Simulations with propagating fronts of differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5D–E</xref>) also include a second type of cells corresponding to cone progenitors in the germinal zone. These cells were chosen to have no polarity proteins on their edges and a uniform tension <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e146" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Other parameters were identical to those for cone cells. During propagation, the frame size was relaxed with the choice <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
          <p>Simulations of a propagating pattern with varying external global stress (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002618-g005">Fig. 5F</xref>) were done with an additional rule: the area elastic modulus of cone cells was increased to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> while keeping the former value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for progenitors. This led to less deformation of the already assembled retina following a modification in the global stress to establish anisotropic stress in the packing. We also verified that this rule did not affect our results for propagation under isotropic and anisotropic condition, only leading to retina with larger cones.</p>

          <title>Robustness</title>
          <p>To study the robustness of our results to parameter variation, we performed simulations of a propagating pattern with an anisotropic applied stress, as described, while varying each model parameter in succession. We found that variations between 60 and 200% of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> did not qualitatively affect the patterns produced. We also verified that for relative velocities <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e155" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> the patterns produced were still ordered.</p>
          <p>We more systematically investigated the effect of varying <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e157" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on the regularity of the pattern produced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002618.s006">Fig. S6</xref>). The pattern generation mechanism was likewise robust to variation of these parameters. Away from the robust region, topological defects consisting of line dislocations could be observed, similar to the defects observed in non-propagating packings. Interestingly, the pattern formation requires a large enough cut-off edge length <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to ensure a sufficient regularity of the unspecified packing to be patterned. Similarly, a small enough value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e161" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was necessary to ensure that polarity proteins where strongly concentrated on two opposite edges. The model was relatively robust to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e162" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and to the related anisotropy of edges tensions within each cell, with generation of regular packings for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e163" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. As expected, decreasing the value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e164" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> led to packings with straighter interfaces between columns.</p>

C) Schematic illustrating how cells adopt a rectangular shape in the simulations. Left: with uniform tension, cells typically adopt hexagonal shapes where edges meet at vertices with 120 degree angles. Right: when the polarity protein dynamics is turned on, polarity proteins accumulate on opposite edges of cells, which results in an decrease of edge tension on 2 opposite sides and an increase in tension on the other 4 sides. To satisfy force balance, the cells must then deform their shapes towards a nearly rectangular shape. When minimum and maximum tensions in a cell satisfy <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, the cell shape is close to a rectangle and, in a perfectly regular packing, the length of the edges with polarity proteins is approximately <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e169" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e170" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the length of a side in the original hexagonal packing. Assuming each polarity protein is concentrated on one of two opposite edges in the cell, the concentration reached is about <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e171" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e172" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e173" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002618.e174" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

The simulation was started with one line of cells with a uniform polarity. Following this first line, each new row of cells is specified with a random distribution of polarity protein, and no global polarity cue is given. A) Example of simulation results: the cell packing does not show rectangular order. B) Snapshots of simulations illustrating the mechanism leading to patterning defects: polarity can point up or down, leading to domain formation. Because the resulting configuration is not favorable, the polarity reorients when the next column is specified, leading to polarity misalignment and eventually to a defect in cell packing.</p>
