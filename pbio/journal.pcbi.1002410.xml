        <p>When planning a series of actions, it is usually infeasible to consider all potential future sequences; instead, one must prune the decision tree. Provably optimal pruning is, however, still computationally ruinous and the specific approximations humans employ remain unknown. We designed a new sequential reinforcement-based task and showed that human subjects adopted a simple pruning strategy: during mental evaluation of a sequence of choices, they curtailed any further evaluation of a sequence as soon as they encountered a large loss. This pruning strategy was Pavlovian: it was reflexively evoked by large losses and persisted even when overwhelmingly counterproductive. It was also evident above and beyond loss aversion. We found that the tendency towards Pavlovian pruning was selectively predicted by the degree to which subjects exhibited sub-clinical mood disturbance, in accordance with theories that ascribe Pavlovian behavioural inhibition, via serotonin, a role in mood disorders. We conclude that Pavlovian behavioural inhibition shapes highly flexible, goal-directed choices in a manner that may be important for theories of decision-making in mood disorders.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Planning is tricky because choices we make now affect future choices, and future choices and outcomes should guide current choices. Because there are exponentially many combinations of future choices and actions, brute-force approaches that consider all possible combinations work only for trivially small problems. Here, we describe how humans use a simple Pavlovian strategy to cut an expanding decision tree down to a computationally manageable size. We find that humans use this strategy even when it is disadvantageous, and that the tendency to use it is related to mild depressive symptoms. The findings, we suggest, can be interpreted within a theoretical framework which relates Pavlovian behavioural inhibition to serotonin and mood disorders.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Most planning problems faced by humans cannot be solved by evaluating all potential sequences of choices explicitly, because the number of possible sequences from which to choose grows exponentially with the sequence length. Consider chess: for each of the thirty-odd moves available to you, your opponent chooses among an equal number. Looking <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> moves ahead demands consideration of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequences. Ostensibly trivial everyday tasks, ranging from planning a route to preparing a meal, present the same fundamental computational dilemma. Their computational cost defeats brute force approaches.</p>
      <p>These problems have to be solved by pruning the underlying decision tree, i.e.by excising poor decision sub-trees from consideration and spending limited cognitive resources evaluating which of the good options will prove the best, not which of the bad ones are the worst. There exist algorithmic solutions that ignore branches of a decision tree that are guaranteed to be worse than those already evaluated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Knuth1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Russell1">[3]</xref>. However, these approaches are still computationally costly and rely on information rarely available. Everyday problems such as navigation or cooking may therefore force precision to be traded for speed; and the algorithmic guarantees to be replaced with powerful––but approximate and potentially suboptimal––heuristics.</p>
      <p>Consider the decision tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g001">Figure 1A</xref>, involving a sequence of three binary choices. Optimal choice involves evaluating <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequences. The simple heuristic of curtailing evaluation of all sequences every time a large loss (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) is encountered excises the left-hand sub-tree, nearly halving the computational load (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). We term this heuristic pruning a “Pavlovian” response because it is invoked, as an immediate consequence of encountering the large loss, when searching the tree in one's mind. It is a reflexive response evoked by a valence, here negative, in a manner akin to that in which stimuli predicting aversive events can suppress unrelated ongoing motor activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Estes1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Tye1">[5]</xref>.</p>

      <p>A further characteristic feature of responding under Pavlovian control is that such responding persists despite being suboptimal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Bouton1">[6]</xref>: pigeons, for instance, continue pecking a light that predicts food, even when the food is omitted on every trial on which they peck the light <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Williams1">[7]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan1">[8]</xref>. While rewards tend to evoke approach, punishments appear particularly efficient at evoking behavioral inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Bolles1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Soubri1">[10]</xref>, possibly via a serotonergic mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Boureau1">[11]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Robinson1">[15]</xref>. Here, we will ascertain whether pruning decision trees when encountering losses may be one instance of Pavlovian behavioural inhibition. We will do so by leveraging the insensitivity of Pavlovian responses to their ultimate consequences.</p>
      <p>We developed a sequential, goal-directed decision-making task in which subjects were asked to plan ahead (c.f. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Tanaka1">[16]</xref>). On each trial, subjects started from a random state and generated a sequence of 2–8 choices to maximize their net income (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>). In the first of three experimental groups the heuristic of pruning sub-trees when encountering large punishments incurred no extra cost (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Subjects here pruned extensively: they tended to ignore subtrees lying beyond large losses. This alleviated the computational load they faced, but did not incur any costs in terms of outcomes because there was always an equally good sequence which avoided large losses (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). In contrast, in the second and third experimental groups subjects incurred increasingly large costs for this pruning strategy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>); yet, they continued to deploy it. That is, the tendency to excise subtrees lying below punishments persisted even when counterproductive in terms of outcomes. This persistence suggests that pruning was reflexively evoked in response to punishments and relatively insensitive to the ultimate outcomes.</p>

          <title>Task description.</title>
          <p><bold>A</bold>: Task as seen by subjects. Subjects used two buttons on the keyboard (‘U’ and ‘I’) to navigate between six environmental states, depicted as boxes on a computer screen. From each state, subjects could move to exactly two other states. Each of these was associated with a particular reinforcement. The current state was highlighted in white, and the required sequence length displayed centrally. Reinforcements available from each state were displayed symbolically below the state, e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the large reward. <bold>B</bold>: Deterministic task transition matrix. Each button resulted in one of two deterministic transitions from each state. For example, if the participant began in state 6, pressing ‘U’ would lead to state 3, whereas pressing ‘I’ would lead to state 1. The transitions in red yielded large punishments. These (and only these) differed between three groups of subjects (−140, −100 or −70). Note that the decision trees in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g001">Figure 1A,B</xref> correspond to a depth 3 search starting from state 3. <bold>C–E</bold>: Effect of pruning on values of optimal choices. Each square in each panel analyses choices from one state when a certain number of choices remains to be taken. The color shows the difference in earnings between two choice sequences: the best choice sequence with pruning and the best choice sequence without pruning. In terms of net earnings, pruning is never advantageous (pruned values are never better than the optimal lookahead values); but pruning does not always result in losses (white areas). It is most disadvantageous in the −70 group, and it is never disadvantageous in the −140 group because there is always an equally good alternative choice sequence which avoids transitions through large losses.</p>

      <p>Computational models which accounted for close to 90% of choices verified that the nature of pruning corresponded to the Pavlovian reflexive account in detail. These results reveal a novel type of interaction between computationally separate decision making systems, with the Pavlovian behavioural inhibition system working as a crutch for the powerful, yet computationally challenged, goal-directed system. Furthermore, the extent to which subjects pruned correlated with sub-clinical depressive symptoms. We interpret this in the light of a theoretical model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref> on the involvement of serotonin in both behavioural inhibition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Crockett1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Robinson1">[15]</xref> and depression.</p>

      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3</xref> shows representative decision paths. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3A</xref> shows the decision tree subjects faced when starting from state 3 and asked to make a 3-step decision. In the −140 group, there are two equally good choice sequences in this situation: either through states 3-4-2-3 (with returns <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> net) or through states 3-6-1-2 (with returns <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> net). When given the choice, subjects reliably chose the path avoiding the large loss (even though this meant also avoiding the equally large gain). However, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3B</xref> shows that subjects could overcome the reflexive avoidance of the large loss. In this situation, because the large loss is much smaller (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), it is best to transition through it to reap the even larger reward (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) behind it. This same behaviour was less frequently observed in larger trees when large losses happened deeper in the tree. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3C</xref> shows the tree of depth 5 starting from state 1. The leftmost three-move subtree, highlighted by the box, is identical to the tree starting from state 3 with depth 3. Although it is still optimal to transition through the large loss, subjects tended to avoided this transition and thereby missed potential gains. Note that in 3C, subjects also avoided an alternative optimal path where the large loss again did not occur immediately.</p>

      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3D–F</xref> shows the number of times subjects chose the optimal sequence through the decision tree, separating out situations when this optimal choice involved a transition through a large loss and when it did not. Subjects were worse at choosing optimal sequences when the depth was greater. Subjects were also less willing to choose <italic>optimal</italic> sequences involving transitions through large losses (shown in blue) than those that did not (shown in green). This appeared to be the case more in the group −140 than the two other groups. However, this statistic is difficult to interpret because in this group there was always an optimal sequence which avoided the large loss. Nevertheless, we separated the blue traces into those cases where large losses appeared early or deep in the tree. For sequences of length 4 or 5, subjects were more likely to choose the optimal sequence if the loss appeared in the first rather than in the second half of the sequence (t-tests, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e015" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> respectively). At depth of 6 or more there was no difference, but the number of these events was small, limiting the power.</p>
      <p>Given these patterns in the data, we considered that subjects made goal-directed decisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Daw1">[18]</xref> by evaluating decision paths sequentially. We directly tested the hypothesis whether they would avoid paths involving losses by terminating this sequential evaluation when encountering large losses. That is, in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3C</xref>, do subjects neglect the large reward behind the large loss because they did not even consider looking past the large loss? Important alternative accounts (which the analyses so far do not fully address) are a simple inability to look so far ahead in this task (“discounting”), an overweighting of losses relative to rewards (“loss aversion”), and interference by other, non goal-directed, decision making strategies (“conditioned attraction &amp; repulsion”). We assessed whether subjects' decision and inference strategies showed evidence of pruning by fitting a series of increasingly complex models assessing all these factors explicitly and jointly. This allowed a quantitative comparison of the extent to which the various hypotheses embodied by the models were able to account for the data.</p>

        <title>Decision making structure</title>
        <p>The first model ‘Look-ahead’ embodied full tree evaluation, without pruning. It assumed that, at each stage, subjects evaluated the decision tree all the way to the end. That is, for an episode of length <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, subjects would consider all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> possible sequences, and choose among them with probabilities associated monotonically with their values. This model ascribed the higher action value to the subjects' actual choices a total of 77% of the time (fraction of choices predicted), which is significantly better than chance (fixed effect binomial <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The gray lines in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4A</xref> separate this by group and sequence length. They show that subjects in all three groups chose the action identified by the full look-ahead model more often than chance, even for some very deep searches. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows the predictive probability, i.e. the probability afforded to choices by the model. This is influenced by both the fraction of choices predicted correctly and the certainty with which they were predicted and took on the value 0.71, again different from chance (fixed effect binomial <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). These results, particularly when considered with the fact that on half the trials subjects were forced to choose the entire sequence before making any move in the tree, indicate that they both understood the task structure and used it in a goal-directed manner by searching the decision tree.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>In order to directly test hypotheses pertaining to pruning of decision trees, we fitted two additional models to the data. Model ‘Discount’ attempted to capture subjects' likely reluctance to look ahead fully and evaluate all sequences (up to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Rather, tree search was assumed to terminate with probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> at each depth, substituting the value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the remaining subtree. In essence, this parameter models subjects' general tendency not to plan ahead. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows that this model predicted choices better. However, since an improved fit is expected from a more complex model, we performed Bayesian model comparison, integrating out all individual-level parameters, and penalizing more complex models at the group level (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4C</xref> shows that fitting this extra parameter resulted in a more parsimonious model. Note that this goal-directed model also vastly outperformed a habitual model of choice (SARSA; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Watkins1">[19]</xref>) in which subjects are assumed to update action propensities in a model-free, iterative manner (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> improvement of 314).</p>
        <p>The third model, ‘Pruning’, is central to the hypothesis we seek to test here. This model separated subjects' global tendency to curtail the tree search (captured by the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> parameter of model ‘discount’) into two separate quantities captured by independent parameters: a general pruning parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e034" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and a specific pruning parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The latter applied to transitions immediately after large punishments (red ‘−X’ in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), while the former applied to all other transitions. If subjects were indeed more likely to terminate their tree search after transitions resulting in large punishments, then a model that separates discounting into two separate pruning parameters should provide a better account of the data. Again, we applied Bayesian model comparison and found strong evidence for such a separation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4C</xref>).</p>
        <p>The fourth model added an immediate Pavlovian influence on choice. The need for this can be seen by comparing the observed and predicted transition (action) probabilities at a key stage in the task. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4D</xref> shows the probability that subjects moved from state 6 to state 1 when they had two or more choices left. Through this move, subjects would have the opportunity to reap the large reward of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), by first suffering the small loss of −20. Subjects duly chose to move to state 1 on <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>90% of these occasions in all three groups. This was well matched by the model ‘Pruning’. However, when subjects only had a single choice left in state 6, it would no longer be optimal to move to state 1, since there would be no opportunity to gain the large reward afterwards. Instead, the optimal choice would be to move to state 3, at a gain of 20. Despite this, on about 40% of such trials, subjects were attracted to state 1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). This was not predicted by the pruning model: paired t-tests showed significant differences between empirical and predicted choice probabilities for each of the three groups: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e039" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e040" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e041" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>; and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e042" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e043" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, for groups −70, −100 and −140 respectively. Three subjects in group −70 and one subject in group −100 were never exposed to depth 1 sequences in state 6.</p>
        <p>To accommodate this characteristic of the behavior, we added a further, ‘Learned Pavlovian’ component to the model, accounting for the conditioned attraction (or repulsion) to states that accrues with experience. This captured an immediate attraction towards future states that, on average (but ignoring the remaining sequence length on a particular trial), were experienced as rewarding; and repulsion from states that were, on average, associated with more punishment (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for details). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4B,C</xref> show that this model (Pruning and Learned) provided the most parsimonious account of the data despite two additional parameters, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figures 4D–E</xref> show that the addition of the Learned parameters allowed the model to capture more faithfully the transition probabilities out of state 6. The blue bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4A</xref> display the probability that this model chose the same action as subjects (correctly predicting 91% of choices). The model's predicted transition probabilities were highly correlated with the empirical choice probabilities in every single state (all <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e044" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Further, we considered the possibility that the Learned Pavlovian values might play the additional role of substituting for the utilities of parts of a search tree that had been truncated by general or specific pruning. However, this did not improve parsimony.</p>
        <p>We have so far neglected any possible differences between the groups with different large losses. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figures 3D–F</xref> might suggest more pruning in group −140 than in the other two groups (as the probability of choosing optimal full lookahead sequences containing a large loss is minimal in group −140). We therefore fitted separate models to the three groups. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4B</xref> shows that the increase in the model flexibility due to separate prior parameters for each group (‘Pruning &amp; Learned (separate)’) failed to improve the predictive probability, increased the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e045" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> score (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), and hence represents a loss of parsimony. Returning to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3D–F</xref>, we plotted the predictions of model ‘Pruning &amp; Learned’ for each of the three groups, and found that this model was able to capture the very extensive avoidance of optimal full lookahead sequences including large losses in group −140, and yet show a gradual decline in the other two groups.</p>
        <p>The qualitative difference between group −140 and the two other groups in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3D–F</xref> is also important because it speaks to the ‘goal-directed’ nature of pruning. Pruning is only counterproductive in groups −70 and −100. The apparent reduction in pruning suggested by the reduced avoidance of optimal sequences involving large losses in groups −70 and −100 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3E,F</xref>) could suggest that the extent of pruning depends on how adaptive it is, which would argue against a reflexive, Pavlovian mechanism. It is thus important that model ‘Pruning &amp; Learned’ could capture these qualitative differences without recurrence to such a goal-directed, clever, pruning. It shows that these differences were instead due to the different reward structures (−70 is not as aversive as −140).</p>
        <p>Finally, we return to the decision tree in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g003">Figure 3B</xref>. This would <italic>prima facie</italic> seem inconsistent with the notion of pruning, as subjects happily transition through a large loss at the very beginning of the decision sequence. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4F</xref> shows a different facet of this. Starting from the state 3 again, subjects in group −70 choose the optimal path that goes through the large loss straight away even though there is an optimal alternative in which they do not have to transition through the large loss so early.</p>
        <p>In fact, in the model, the relative impact of general and specific pruning factors interacts with the precise reinforcement sequence, and hence with the depth at which each reinforcement is obtained. More specifically, let us neglect the entire tree other than the two optimal (yellow) sequences the subjects actually took, and let <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The value of the left sequence then equals <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. A similar, third-order polynomial in combinations of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> describes the value of the right path, and indeed their difference. The blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4G</xref> shows, for each value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, what value of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> would result in the left and right sequences having the same value. The combinations of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for which the chosen left path (with the early transition through the large loss) has a higher total value turn out to lie below this blue line. In addition, pruning will only be more pronounced after large losses if <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is larger than <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The overlap between these two requirements is shown in green, and the group means for <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are shown by the red dot. Thus, because the effects of general and specific pruning interact with depth, the reflexive, but probabilistic, pruning in the model can lead to the pattern seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4G</xref>, whereby subjects transition through large losses close to the root of the decision tree, but avoid doing so deeper in the tree. Put simply, fixed, reflexive Pavlovian pruning in these particular sequences of reinforcements has differential effects deep in the tree. In these cases, it matches the intuition that it is the exploding computational demands which mandate approximations. However, this is not a necessary consequence of the model formulation and would not hold for all sequences.</p>
      </sec>
      <sec id="s2b">
        <title>Loss aversion</title>
        <p>An alternative to the pruning account is the notion of loss aversion, whereby a loss of a given amount is more aversive than the gain of an equal amount is appetitive. Consider the following sequence of returns: <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> with an overall return of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The pruning account above would assign it a low value because the large terminal gain is neglected. An alternative manner by which subjects may assign this sequence a low value is to increase how aversive a view they take of large losses. In this latter account, subjects would sum over the entire sequence, but overweigh large losses, resulting in an equally low value for the entire sequence.</p>
        <p>To distinguish loss aversion from pruning, we fit several additional models. Model ‘Loss’ is equal to model ‘Look-ahead’ in that it assumes that subjects evaluate the entire tree. It differs, in that it infers, for every subject, what effective weight they assigned each reinforcement. In the above example, for the overall sequence to be as subjectively bad as if the reinforcement behind it had been neglected, the −100 reinforcement could be increased to an effective value of −240. By itself, this did not provide a parsimonious account of the data, as model ‘Loss’ performed poorly (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We augmented model ‘Loss’ in the same manner as the original model by allowing for discounting and for specific pruning. There was evidence for pruning even when reinforcement sensitivities were allowed to vary separately, i.e. even after accounting for any loss aversion (cf. models ‘Discount &amp; Loss’ and ‘Pruning &amp; Loss’, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, adding loss aversion to the previous best model did not improve parsimony (cf. models ‘Pruning &amp; Learned’ vs ‘Loss &amp; Pruning &amp; Learned’). Finally, the Pavlovian conditioned approach also provided a more parsimonious account than loss aversion (cf ‘Pruning &amp; Learned’ vs ‘Pruning &amp; Loss’). Replacing the four separate parameters in the ‘Loss’ model with two slope parameters to reduce the disadvantage incurred due to the higher number of parameters does not alter these conclusions (data not shown). Finally, the screen subjects saw (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) only showed four symbols: ++, +, − and − −. It is thus conceivable that subjects treated a ++ as twice as valuable as a +, and similarly for losses. A model that forced reinforcements to obey these relationships did not improve parsimony (data not shown). The inferred reinforcement sensitivities from model ‘Pruning &amp; Loss’ are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g005">Figure 5B</xref>. Comparing the inferred sensitivities to the largest rewards and punishments showed that subjects did overvalue punishments (treating them approximately 1.4 times as aversive as an equal-sized reward was appetitive; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Tom1">[20]</xref>. In conclusion, there is decisive evidence for specific Pavlovian pruning of decision trees above and beyond any contribution of loss aversion.</p>

        <p>The parsimony of separate priors was tested earlier (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4C</xref>), showing that specific pruning <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e070" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> did not differ between groups. This is in spite of the fact that pruning in the groups −70 and −100 is costly, but not in the −140 group (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). The fact that pruning continues even when disadvantageous is evidence for a simple and inflexible pruning strategy which neglects events occurring after large losses when computational demands are high. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g006">Figure 6C</xref> shows the cost of pruning in terms of the loss of income during episodes when the optimal choice sequence would have involved a transition through a large punishment. These results suggest that pruning is a Pavlovian response in the sense that it is not goal-directed and not adaptive to the task demands, but is rather an inflexible strategy reflexively applied upon encountering punishments.</p>

        <title>Psychometric correlates</title>
        <p>We next tested two a priori predictions that relate the model parameters to psychometric measurements. Based on prior modelling work <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref>, we hypothesized that the tendency to employ the simple pruning strategy should correlate with psychometric measures related to depression and anxiety, i.e. with the BDI score and NEO neuroticism. We also expected to replicate prior findings whereby the reward sensitivity parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e071" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> should be negatively correlated with BDI and NEO neuroticism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Pizzagalli1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Eshel1">[24]</xref>. Because parameters for different subjects were estimated with varying degrees of accuracy (see individual gray error bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g006">Figure 6</xref>), our primary analysis was a multiple regression model in which the influence of each subject's data was weighted according to how accurately their parameters were estimated (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>
        <p>We found that BDI was positively correlated with the specific pruning parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e072" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e073" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). Furthermore, this effect was specific in that there was no such correlation with general pruning <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e074" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. There was also a negative correlation between BDI score and reward sensitivity <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e075" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, although this did not survive correction for multiple comparisons (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e076" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). The regression coefficients for the BDI score are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g007">Figure 7A</xref>. Notably, these correlations arose after correcting for age, gender, verbal IQ, working memory performance and all other NEO measures of personality. Thus, as predicted, subjects with more subclinical features of depression were more likely to curtail their search specifically after large punishment. However, against our hypothesis, we did not identify any significant correlations with NEO neuroticism.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>We employed a Bayesian model-fitting approach to investigate how Pavlovian choices might shape goal-directed decision making. Our full model was able to account for a high percentage of subjects' choices, allowing us to draw strong conclusions about the likely forces governing their behavior. Influences were deemed Pavlovian when they were evoked in a fixed and inflexible manner in response to an outcome or a stimulus value, and goal-directed when sensitive to the ultimate, possibly distant, result of the choice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dickinson1">[25]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Participants exhibited two highly significant Pavlovian influences. First, subjects pruned to a very substantial degree. While part of this pruning was valence independent and hence not Pavlovian (parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e083" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the model), and can be seen as a natural, if suboptimal, response to the exponentially exploding complexity of complete search in the model (ranging from 2 to 256 sequences), subjects also showed a substantial increase in their propensity to prune in the face of a large negative outcome (parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e084" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the model). Importantly, they did so even at the expense of a substantial net loss in reward. It was striking that subjects were no less likely to prune (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>) even when we rendered it increasingly disadvantageous (moving from group −140 to group −70),.</p>
      <p>The second, ‘Learned’, Pavlovian influence was associated with the learned attractiveness of previously rewarded states. In our task, states could have been associated with large rewards on past trials, but lack the potential to lead to reward (or indeed punishment) on a given trial, because insufficient choices remained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4E</xref>). Subjects were significantly seduced by the effect of these past rewards (or repulsed by punishments), again in a way that was counterproductive to optimal control. Note that by including this second Pavlovian influence, we could be sure that the pruning described above was a pure influence on goal-based evaluation, and was not corrupted by an intrinsic repulsion to the punishment (which would have been ascribed to this second, Pavlovian, influence).</p>
      <p>The ‘Loss’ models do suggest that subjects were more sensitive to punishments than rewards (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). However, this did not explain away pruning. Also, if the pruning we observed was just a signature of loss aversion, one would have expected the extent of pruning not to be the same across groups. Loss aversion is a specific phenomenon in behavioural economics, whereby subjects are more strongly opposed to a given probability of losing a certain amount than to winning that same amount <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Tversky1">[26]</xref>. To the extent to which loss aversion can be described as an inflexible, reactive, response to an aversive stimulus, it may represent a third instance of Pavlovian responses to losses interfering with goal-directed decisions in this task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-GuitartMasip1">[27]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Next, subjects could transition through losses early on in the tree, but were more reluctant to do so when they appeared deeper in the tree. Pavlovian pruning thus appeared to have a particularly strong effect deeper in the tree. Although this makes intuitive sense, it is not a feature explicitly built into the models. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4G</xref> shows that this <italic>can</italic> arise from the interaction of the particular sequence of reinforcements (and thus reinforcement depth) and the pruning and discount factors. Although this is not necessarily always the case, the fact that our best-performing model accounted so well for subjects' choices (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g004">Figure 4A</xref>) suggests that it was a sufficient mechanism for the particular set of reinforcement sequences encountered here.</p>
      <p>Finally, although our sample of <italic>healthy</italic> volunteers, which was thoroughly screened for past pathology, reported only very mild depressive symptoms (with mean BDI scores of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e085" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, range <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e086" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), we found that subjects' propensity to prune specifically in the face of negative valence was positively correlated with self-reported sub-clinical depressive symptoms.</p>

        <title>Pruning, serotonin and depression</title>
        <p>Our work was inspired by a previous modelling paper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref>, which used the concept of behavioural inhibition to unify two divergent and contradictory findings on the relationship between serotonin and depression. On the one hand, drugs that putatively increase serotonin by inhibiting the serotonin reuptake mechanism are effective for both acutely treating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Cipriani1">[28]</xref>, and preventing relapse of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Geddes1">[29]</xref>, depression. On the other hand, a genetic polymorphism that downregulates the very same serotonin reuptake transporter, thus acting in the same direction as the drugs, has the opposite effect on mood, predisposing towards depression and other related mood disorders (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Caspi1">[30]</xref>; though see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Wankerl1">[31]</xref> for a discussion of replication failures).</p>
        <p>Dayan and Huys <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref> explained this paradox by suggesting that people who experienced high levels of serotonin and thus exaggerated Pavlovian behavioural inhibition during early development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Ansorge1">[32]</xref> would be most sensitive to the effects of any interference with this inhibition in adulthood secondary to a drop in serotonin levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Roiser1">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Ruh1">[34]</xref>. Thus, the inhibitory consequences of serotonin could account for both its predisposing qualities on a developmental time-scale, and more acute relief during depressive episodes.</p>
        <p>The hypothesis in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref> relates to two facets of the current study. First, if serotonin indeed mediates behavioural inhibition in the face of punishments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Soubri1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Cools1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Crockett1">[14]</xref> then it is a strong prediction that the pruning parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e087" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, which mediates the inhibition of iterative thought processes, should be related to, and modulated by, serotonergic activity. We plan to test this directly in future studies. There is already some, though far from conclusive, evidence pointing towards such an influence of serotonin on higher-level cognition. First, serotonergic neurons project strongly to areas involved in goal-directed, affective choices including the medial prefrontal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Varns1">[35]</xref>. Genetic variation in the serotonin transporter allele modulates functional coupling between amygdala and rostral cingulate cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Pezawas1">[36]</xref>. Next, orbitofrontal serotonin depletion impacts cognitive flexibility, or the adaptive ability to switch between contingencies, by impairing inhibitory control <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Clarke1">[37]</xref> in monkeys. Third, learned helplessness, which can be interpreted in goal-directed terms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref>, depends critically on pre- and infralimbic cortex in rats <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Amat1">[38]</xref>, and is known to be mediated by serotonin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Maier1">[39]</xref>. Contrary to this, there is a recent report that mood manipulation, but not acute tryptophan depletion, impairs processing on the one-touch Tower of London (OTT) task <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Robinson2">[40]</xref>, which should certainly engage goal-directed processing. One possible explanation for this apparent discrepancy is that although the OTT requires sequences of moves to be evaluated, there is no obvious aversive point at which Pavlovian pruning might be invoked. Further, although OTT is explicitly framed as a ‘cold’ task, i.e. one which does not involve affective choices, there is also supporting evidence (see below).</p>
        <p>The second facet of our theoretical model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref> concerns depression. The model suggested that subjects prone to depression exhibit decision making that is more reliant on serotonergic function, expressed as excess pruning, but that the depressed state itself is characterised by a low serotonin state and thus a loss of pruning. The stronger dependence on serotonin in at-risk subjects would explain why only they are sensitive to the mood effects of tryptophan depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Ruh1">[34]</xref>, and why individuals with a polymorphism in the serotonin transporter gene that reduces serotonin uptake are more liable to develop mood disturbance, especially following serotonin depletion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Roiser2">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Neumeister1">[42]</xref>. That is, this theory predicts excessive pruning to occur in subjects <italic>at risk</italic> for depression, and reduced pruning to occur <italic>during</italic> a depressive episode. The data presented here (a positive correlation between mildly raised BDI scores and the tendency to prune when encountering a large loss; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g007">Figure 7</xref>) would be consistent with this theoretical account if mildly raised BDI scores in otherwise healthy subjects (we screened for criteria for a major depressive episode; and 94% of our participants had BDI scores <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e088" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, rendering depression unlikely <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Lasa1">[43]</xref>) could be interpreted as a vulnerability or proneness to depression. The mildly raised BDI scores do reveal a latent level of dysphoric symptoms amongst healthy participants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Beck2">[55]</xref>. This might be in line with findings that levels of dysphoric symptoms correlate with levels of dysfunctional thinking, and that a cyclical interaction between the two could, in the presence of certain environmental events, crescendo into a depressive episode proper <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Teasdale1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Lewinsohn1">[46]</xref>. However, we are not aware of any direct evidence that mildly raised BDI scores measure vulnerability, and maybe more critically, we did not observe correlations with NEO neuroticism, which is an established risk factor for depression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Kendler1">[47]</xref>. The strong prediction that serotonergic function and behavioural inhibition in the face of losses should be reduced during a major depressive episode remains to be tested. However, there is already some evidence in favour of this conclusion. People actively suffering from depression are impaired on the OTT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Beats1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Elliott1">[49]</xref>. The impairment relative to controls grows with the difficulty of the problem; and depressed subjects also spend increasing amounts of time thinking about the harder problems, without showing improved choices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Goodwin1">[50]</xref>. This suggests that people who are suffering from depression have more difficulty searching a deep tree effectively (possibly also captured by more general, superficial autobiographical recollections; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Williams2">[51]</xref>). However, given the finding by <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Robinson2">[40]</xref>, we note that it is at present not possible to interpret this conclusively in terms of pruning. Finally, the same group has also reported catastrophic breakdown in OTT performance in depressed subjects after negative feedback <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Elliott2">[52]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Conclusion</title>
        <p>We used a novel sequential decision-making task in conjunction with a sophisticated computational analysis that fitted a high proportion of healthy subjects' choices. This allowed us to unpack a central facet of effective computation, pruning. Importantly, most subjects were unable to resist pruning even when it was disadvantageous, supporting our hypothesis that this process occurs by simple, Pavlovian, behavioural inhibition of ongoing thoughts in the face of punishments <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref>. Provocatively, consistent with this model, we found a relationship between the propensity to prune and sub-clinical mood disturbance, and this suggests it would be opportune to examine in detail the model's predictions that pruning should be impaired in clinically depressed individuals and following serotonin depletion.</p>

        <title>Task</title>
        <p>Participants first underwent extensive training to learn the transition matrix (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Tanaka1">[16]</xref>). During the training, subjects were repeatedly placed in a random starting state and told to reach a random target state in a specified number of moves (up to 4). After 40 practice trials, training continued until the participant reached the target in 9 out of 10 trials. Most subjects passed the training criterion in three attempts. Reaching training criterion was mandatory to move on to the main task.</p>
        <p>After training, each transition was associated with a deterministic reward (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Subjects completed two blocks of of 24 choice episodes; each episode included 2 to 8 trials. The first block of 24 episodes was discarded as part of training the reward matrix, and the second block of 24 episodes was analysed. At the beginning of each episode, subjects were placed randomly in one of the states (highlighted in white) and told how many moves they would have to make (i.e., 2 to 8). Their goal was to devise a sequence of that particular length of moves to maximize their total reward over the entire sequence of moves. To help the subjects remember the reward or punishment possible from each state, the appropriate “+” or “-” were always displayed beneath each box. Regardless of the state the subject finished in on a given episode, they would be placed in a random new state at the beginning of the next episode. Thus, each episode was an independent test of the subject's ability to sequentially think through the transition matrix and infer the best action sequence. After each transition, the new state was highlighted in white and the outcome displayed. On half of the trials, subjects were asked to plan ahead their last 2–4 moves together and enter them in one step without any intermittent feedback.</p>
        <p>The reward matrix was designed to assess subjects' pruning strategy; and whether this strategy changed in an adaptive, goal-directed way. All subjects experienced the same transition matrix, but the red transitions in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figure 2C</xref> led to different losses in the three groups, of −70, −100 or −140 pence respectively. This had the effect of making pruning counterproductive in groups −70 and −100, but not −140 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002410-g002">Figures 2C–E</xref>). At the end of the task, subjects were awarded a monetary amount based on their performance, with a maximum of £20. They were also compensated £10 for time and travel expenses.</p>

        <title>Model-based analysis</title>
        <p>In the look-ahead model, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e104" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>-value of each action <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e105" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the present state <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e106" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is derived by i) searching through all possible future choices; ii) always choosing the optimal option available in the future after a particular choice; and iii) assigning the two actions at the present state the values of the immediate reward plus the best possible future earnings over the entire episode. More concisely, the look-ahead (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e107" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) model is a standard tree search model, in which the value of a particular action is given by the sum of the immediate reward <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e108" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and the value of the optimal action from the next state <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e109" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e110" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e111" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the deterministic transition function. This equation is iterated until the end of the tree has been reached <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Sutton1">[59]</xref>. For notational clarity, we omit dependence of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e112" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values on the depth of the tree. To make the gradients tractable, we implement the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e113" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> operator with a steep softmax.</p>
        <p>An explicit search all the way to the end of the tree is unlikely for any depths <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e114" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, given the large computational demands. The model ‘Discount’ (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e115" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) thus allowed, at each depth, a biased coin to be flipped to determine whether the tree search should proceed further, or whether it should terminate at that depth, and assume zero further earnings. Let the probability of stopping be <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e116" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The expected outcome from a choice in a particular state, the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e117" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values, is now an average over all possible prunings of the tree, weighted by how likely that particular number of prunings is to occur:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e118" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e119" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the full lookahead value of action <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e120" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in state <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e121" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for the cut tree <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e122" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. Importantly, the number <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e123" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is immense. If the number of branches of a binary tree is <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e124" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, then there are <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e125" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> possible ways of choosing up to <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e126" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> branches of the tree to cut. Although this overestimates the problem because branches off branches that have already been cut off should no longer be considered, the problem remains overly large. We therefore use a mean-field approximation, resulting in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e127" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e128" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula>where, at each step, the future is weighted by the probability <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e129" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> that it be encountered. This means that outcomes <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e130" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> steps ahead are discounted by a factor <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e131" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We note, however, that Equation 3 solves a different Markov decision problem exactly.</p>
        <p>Next, the ‘Pruning’ (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e132" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) model encompassed the possibility that subjects were more likely to stop after a large punishment had been encountered. It did this by separating the stopping probability into two independent factors, resulting in:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e133" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e134" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(5)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e135" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the specific pruning parameter that denotes the probability with which the subject stops evaluation of the tree at any state-action pair associated with the large negative reward. Here, we used binary pruning rather than the graded form of <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan3">[17]</xref>, since there is only one extreme negative outcome. The second parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e136" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was the probability of curtailing the tree search at any other transition (−20, +20, +140) and is exactly analogous to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e137" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the Discount model.</p>
        <p>To account for ‘Learned Pavlovian’ (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e138" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) attraction or repulsion, i.e. the approach to, or avoidance of, states that are typically associated with future rewards on those trials on which these future rewards are not available (e.g. a terminal transition from state 6 to state 1), we modified the ‘Pruning’ model by adding a second state-action value which depends on the long-term experienced average value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e139" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the states:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e140" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(6)</label></disp-formula>The value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e141" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is learned by standard temporal difference learning:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e142" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(7)</label></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e143" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is set to zero if it is the terminal transition. This model, which we term ‘Learned + Pavlovian’, is based on <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Dayan1">[8]</xref> and the parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e144" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is fit to the data.</p>
        <p>So far, when search terminates, a zero value for the rest of the decision tree was entered. An alternative to the Learned Pavlovian model is to additionally include the value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e145" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as terminal value, i.e.:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e146" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(8)</label></disp-formula>with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e147" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> as in the Pruning model, and with <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e148" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> evolving as in equation 7. Note that we this model also incorporated the direct learned Pavlovian effect (Equation 6).</p>
        <p>To account for loss aversion, we fitted models in which we inferred all reinforcement sensitivities <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e149" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> separately. Thus, these models relaxed the assumption of the above models that subjects treated a reward of 140 as exactly cancelling out a loss of −140. In fact, these models in principle allowed subjects to be attracted to a loss and repelled from a reward. We used such a free formulation to attempt to soak up as much variance as possible. If pruning is visible above and beyond this, then differential sensitivities to rewards and punishments by themselves cannot account for the pruning effects in the above models. This formulation does have the drawback that the large number of free parameters may potentially exert a prohibitive effect on the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e150" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> scores. Although we saw no indication of that, we fitted a further, restricted loss aversion model with two slopes, i.e. where the rewards took on values <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e151" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e152" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and the losses <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e153" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e154" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. The restricted models led to the same conclusions as the full loss aversion models and we thus do not report those results.</p>
        <p>Finally, in the habitual SARSA model, choice propensities were calculated in a model-free manner to capture habitual choices <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Daw1">[18]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Watkins1">[19]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e155" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(9)</label></disp-formula></p>
        <p>Given the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e156" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values, the probability of subjects' choices was computed as<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e157" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(10)</label></disp-formula>where we emphasize that the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e158" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> value of each choice depends on how many choices are left after <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e159" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, but <italic>not</italic> on the choices preceding it. The parameter <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e160" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> was set to unity for all loss models. We note that this probability is predictive in that it depends only on past rewards and choices, but not in the machine learning sense, whereby it predicts data not used to fit the parameters.</p>

        <p>We have previously described our Bayesian model fitting and comparison approach <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Huys3">[60]</xref>, but repeat the description here for completeness.

We assume that actions are independent (given the stimuli, which we omit for notational clarity), and thus factorize over trials. The prior distribution on the parameters mainly serves to regularise the inference and prevent parameters that are not well-constrained from taking on extreme values. We set the parameters of the prior distribution <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e165" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the maximum likelihood given all the data by <italic>all</italic> the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e166" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> subjects:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e167" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e168" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

        <p>As we have no prior on the models themselves (testing only models we believe are equally likely a priori), we instead examine the model log likelihood <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e182" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> directly. This quantity can be approximated in two steps. First, at the group level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002410-Kass1">[62]</xref>:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e183" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e184" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e185" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the total number of choices made by all subjects, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e186" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the number of prior parameters fitted (mean and variance for each parameter). Importantly, however, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e187" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is not the sum of individual likelihoods, but the sum of <italic>integrals</italic> over the individual parameters (hence the subscript “int” to the Baysian Information Criterion (BIC)):<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e188" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>The second approximation involves replacing the integral by a sum over samples from the empirical prior <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e189" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.

          <p>We used a Bayesian model comparison approach to compare the three groups receiving different maximal punishments. To do so, we fitted models that allowed for separate prior parameters for each group, and penalized this overall model according to its <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e190" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> score.

          <p>We used a weighted hierarchical multivariate regression, which is equivalent to a standard hierarchical multivariate regression, except that parameters were weighted by the precision with which they were estimated. As this is, to our knowledge, non-standard, we describe it in some detail.</p>
          <p>The first step consisted of a sequential orthogonalization procedure of the questionnaire measures, whereby we entered the measurements in the following sequence: 1. Age, 2. Sex, 3. IQ (computed from WTAR), 4. Digit Span, 5. NEO E, 6. NEO O, 7. NEO A, 8. NEO C, 9. STAI Trait, 10. STAI State, 11. NEO N, 12. BDI, with the consequence that regressors entered later only retained variation along dimensions orthogonal to the previously entered regressors. We then seeked regression coefficients such that<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e192" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e193" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the parameter vector for subject <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e194" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e195" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the vector of orthogonalized psychometric measures for that subject, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e196" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the regression matrix we seek to infer. Crucially, two sources of noise are assumed to contribue. First, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e197" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the uncertainty about the inferred value <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e198" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. This is noise that originates from the model-based estimation procedure (i.e. at the within-subject level). Second, <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e199" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is a diagonal matrix the components <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e200" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of which are the standard regression noise (capturing noise at the between-subject level) for each of the five model parameters. Including both terms, rather than just the latter, means that parameters that are better constrained by the behavioural data contribute more to the inference. This reduces to multiple multivariate linear regression if the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e201" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To perform the inference, the above set of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e202" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> vector equations are written in terms of normal log likelihoods:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e203" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(11)</label></disp-formula>This can be rewritten such as to yield one quadratic likelihood in the concatenation <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e204" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of all columns of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e205" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, and can then be solved for both <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e206" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002410.e207" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> by gradient ascent.</p>
