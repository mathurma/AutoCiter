        <p>Competition for nutrients contained in diverse types of plant cell wall-associated polysaccharides may explain the evolution of substrate-specific catabolic gene modules in common bacterial members of the human gut microbiota.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>Symbiotic bacteria inhabiting the human gut have evolved under intense pressure to utilize complex carbohydrates, primarily plant cell wall glycans in our diets. These polysaccharides are not digested by human enzymes, but are processed to absorbable short chain fatty acids by gut bacteria. The Bacteroidetes, one of two dominant bacterial phyla in the adult gut, possess broad glycan-degrading abilities. These species use a series of membrane protein complexes, termed Sus-like systems, for catabolism of many complex carbohydrates. However, the role of these systems in degrading the chemically diverse repertoire of plant cell wall glycans remains unknown. Here we show that two closely related human gut Bacteroides, <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic>, are capable of utilizing nearly all of the major plant and host glycans, including rhamnogalacturonan II, a highly complex polymer thought to be recalcitrant to microbial degradation. Transcriptional profiling and gene inactivation experiments revealed the identity and specificity of the polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs) that encode individual Sus-like systems that target various plant polysaccharides. Comparative genomic analysis indicated that <italic>B. ovatus</italic> possesses several unique PULs that enable degradation of hemicellulosic polysaccharides, a phenotype absent from <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>. In contrast, the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> genome has been shaped by increased numbers of PULs involved in metabolism of host mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans, a phenotype that is undetectable in <italic>B. ovatus</italic>. Binding studies of the purified sensor domains of PUL-associated hybrid two-component systems in conjunction with transcriptional analyses demonstrate that complex oligosaccharides provide the regulatory cues that induce PUL activation and that each PUL is highly specific for a defined cell wall polymer. These results provide a view of how these species have diverged into different carbohydrate niches by evolving genes that target unique suites of available polysaccharides, a theme that likely applies to disparate bacteria from the gut and other habitats.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Bacteria inhabiting the human gut are critical for digestion of the plant-derived glycans that compose dietary fiber. Enzymes produced by the human body cannot degrade these abundant dietary components, and without bacterial assistance they would go unused. We investigated the molecular strategies employed by two species belonging to one of the most abundant bacterial groups in the human colon (the Bacteroidetes). Our results show that each species has evolved to degrade a unique subset of glycans; this specialization is reflected in their respective genomes, each of which contains numerous separate gene clusters involved in metabolizing plant fiber polysaccharides or glycans present in secreted mucus. Each glycan-specific gene cluster produces a related series of membrane-associated proteins which together serve to bind and degrade a specific glycan. Expression of each glycan-specific gene cluster is controlled by an environmental sensor that responds to the presence of a unique molecular signature contained in the substrate that it targets. These results provide a view of how related bacterial species have diverged into different carbohydrate niches by evolving genes that sense and degrade unique suites of available polysaccharides, a process that likely applies to disparate bacteria from the gut and other habitats.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The human distal gut is home to a densely populated microbial community (microbiota) that plays key roles in health and nutrition. The microbial symbionts that occupy this habitat produce an arsenal of enzymes that degrade dietary complex carbohydrates (glycans) that cannot be hydrolyzed by host enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Flint1">[1]</xref>. The simple sugars generated are fermented into host-absorbable end products, including short-chain fatty acids, that can contribute as much as ‚àº10% of the calories extracted from the human diet and are thought to play a role in preventing colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-McNeil1">[2]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Viewed at the broad taxonomic level of bacterial phylum, two groups of bacteria dominate the distal gut microbiota of adult humans and other mammals: the Bacteroidetes and the Firmicutes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Eckburg1">[3]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Muegge1">[6]</xref>. Studies of cultivated human microbiota species indicate that the Bacteroidetes, composed largely of members of the genus <italic>Bacteroides</italic>, exhibit broad capacities to metabolize a variety of plant- and animal-derived glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Salyers1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Bacteroidetes from a variety of environments including the human gut employ a similar strategy for binding and degrading various glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens2">[9]</xref>. These Gram-negative bacteria have amplified and permuted a series of gene clusters termed polysaccharide utilization loci (PULs). Each PUL that has been characterized to date encodes a suite of cell envelope-associated proteins (Sus-like system) that confer the ability to metabolize a single glycan or group of related glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Shipman1">[10]</xref>‚Äì<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>. Each Sus-like system contains at least one pair of outer membrane proteins homologous to SusC and SusD, which are essential for the import and degradation of starch by the prototypic starch-utilization system (Sus) for which related systems are named <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Shipman1">[10]</xref>. SusC-like proteins are predicted TonB-dependent receptors that span the outer membrane and transport oligosaccharides in an energy-dependent manner. SusD-like proteins are outer membrane lipoproteins that are oriented towards the external environment; they bind directly to specific glycans and contribute to the capture and delivery of oligosaccharides to the SusC transporter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Koropatkin1">[13]</xref>. SusC- and SusD-like proteins function in concert with other outer membrane glycan binding proteins and polysaccharide degrading enzymes (glycoside hydrolases, polysaccharide lyases, and carbohydrate esterases), which are grouped into sequence-based families in the Carbohydrate Active Enzymes (CAZy) database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Cantarel1">[14]</xref>.</p>
      <p>PULs frequently contain genes encoding inner membrane sensor-regulator systems that control the expression of genes in their associated and usually adjacent locus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-DElia1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens3">[16]</xref>. These sensor-regulators are most commonly extra-cytoplasmic function sigma (ECF-œÉ)/anti-œÉ factor pairs or hybrid two-component systems (HTCS) that contain all of the domains of a classical two-component system phosphorelay in a single polypeptide <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg2">[17]</xref>. While glycans are known to activate PUL-associated HTCS, there is a paucity of information about the actual molecular cues recognized, and the mechanism by which these inducers mediate their effect, although a previous study has indicated that large oligosaccharides are involved in activation of an HTCS controlled xylanase locus from a ruminant Bacteroidetes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Miyazaki1">[18]</xref>. In the simplest model, the activating glycan will bind directly to the periplasmic sensor domain, as occurs when fructose activates the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> fructan PUL by binding directly to its HTCS <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>. However, the periplasmic sensor domain of the fructan HTCS is atypical compared to those found in other HTCS (i.e., it is around one-third the size and adopts a periplasmic binding protein fold). It is therefore possible that the sensor domains most commonly associated with other PULs recognize more complex ligands, that the glycans are presented to the cognate HTCS bound to other periplasmic proteins, or that the HTCS interact with part of their cognate SusC porin in the periplasm in a manner analogous to the trans-envelope signaling that occurs in ECF-œÉ/anti-œÉ systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens3">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Dodd2">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, the extent to which there is cross-talk between the regulatory systems of different PULs is unclear. Thus, while previous animal feeding experiments have shown which PULs in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> are activated in vivo by diets containing plant polysaccharides <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg3">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Bjursell1">[21]</xref>, we do not know the specific components of the diet that activate individual PULs.</p>
      <p>A major factor shaping the balance between different human gut bacterial phylogenetic types (phylotypes) is the ability of each group to compete efficiently for the complex glycans that are delivered to the distal intestine. To understand how human gut bacteria have evolved to occupy distinct niches, we have measured the ability of two closely related <italic>Bacteroides</italic> phylotypes to metabolize complex dietary glycans. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> share 96.5% nucleotide sequence identity in their 16S rDNA genes. With the exception of cellulose, these species are together capable of using all major glycan classes found in the gut mucosa and in plant cells as sole carbon sources. However, each species alone has evolved to target only a partial set of all possible glycans. We use transcriptional profiling, in conjunction with the characterization of mutants lacking functional PULs, to establish that their ability to metabolize different plant cell wall glycans is contingent on selective expression of PUL-encoded Sus-like systems. Most of the identified plant glycan PULs are linked to an HTCS that is activated by the presence of the PUL's target glycan. Specific activation of each PUL is achieved by direct recognition of signature oligosaccharide cues by the cognate HTCS. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> contains many PULs that are not present in <italic>B. ovatus</italic> and confer its increased ability to target host mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans and expanded capacity to target pectic structures. Conversely, <italic>B. ovatus</italic> harbors several unique PULs that enable it to use all of the common hemicelluloses, while <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> is unable to metabolize this group of plant structural polysaccharides. In both cases, unique species-specific PULs are scattered throughout the bacterial genome rather than being present in one or more large blocks. These data support the concept that adaptation to different glycan niches is driving selective evolution of PULs in these two species. This theme may apply to other bacteria in the human gut and has implications for both the basic ecology of the gut microbiota as well as efforts to intentionally manipulate this community to restore health or alter nutrition.</p>

        <title><italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> Have Distinct But Partially Overlapping Glycan Niches</title>
        <p>To investigate the relationship between glycan metabolic phenotypes and underlying genetic architecture in commonly isolated human gut bacteria, we focused on <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> ATCC 29148 (also known as VPI-5482) and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> ATCC 8483. The rationale for our selection is based on a previous survey showing that while members of these two species can access a wide range of glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Salyers1">[7]</xref>, they display substantial differences in complex carbohydrate utilization.</p>
        <p>To define in detail the range of glycans that <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> are capable of utilizing, we constructed a custom panel of plant, animal, and microbial carbohydrates arrayed in 96-well format (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t001">Table 1</xref>). These polysaccharides are more extensive than those used in previous studies, and include plant polymers such as rhamnogalacturonan I and II and purified fragments from a number of other highly decorated pectins and hemicelluloses. In addition, we monitored anaerobic growth over a defined time interval, enabling quantitative measurements of both growth rate and final culture density for each glycan.</p>

        <p><italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> each grew on a subset of the glycans tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t001">Table 1</xref>). Both species grew on plant cell wall pectins except arabinogalactan and arabinan, which were only efficiently utilized by <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>. Interestingly, as we had noted during a previous comparison of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> growth on starch and dextran <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Koropatkin1">[13]</xref>, each species grew more rapidly on several different polysaccharides compared to their corresponding monosaccharide components. Although this result is counter-intuitive because each polysaccharide needs to first be de-polymerized prior to metabolism, it suggests that monosaccharide transport and metabolism pathways are optimally triggered by the presence of polymerized sugar molecules. For example, growth of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> on potato pectic galactan was 2.5¬±0.5 times more rapid than on its monosaccharide constituent galactose (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, Student's <italic>t</italic> test). More efficient utilization of polymeric glycans may be attributable to the fact that very little free monosaccharide reaches <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species in the distal intestine, with selective pressures acting on these bacteria to evolve ways to directly couple downstream catabolic pathways to glycan recognition.</p>
        <p><italic>B. ovatus</italic> was the only one of the two species capable of growing on the hemicelluloses tested (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t001">Table 1</xref>); it also grew on the disaccharide cellobiose but not on cellohexaose, suggesting that it is not capable of targeting higher molecular forms of cellulose. We conclude that the ability of <italic>B. ovatus</italic> to grow on cellobiose is a product of its ability to degrade other molecules that contain Œ≤1,4-glucosidic linkages, such as barley Œ≤-glucan or xyloglucan, a view supported by HTCS specificity data presented below. Additional insight into the sensing and catabolic specificities of <italic>B. ovatus</italic> for closely related Œ≤-glucan substrates was provided by testing a variety of structures that vary with respect to the linkages they contain and their relative ratios in the polysaccharide (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s001">Text S1</xref>).</p>
        <p>Beyond their utilization of plant cell wall glycans, both species grew well on plant cell storage carbohydrates such as fructans and starch (amylopectin), and on the starch-like molecules pullulan and glycogen. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> have reciprocal specificities for fructans: <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> grows best on the Œ≤2,6-linkages that occur in levan, whereas <italic>B. ovatus</italic> does not grow at all on levan but prefers Œ≤2,1-linked inulin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Only <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> grew on mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans, a trait that we previously demonstrated to be dependent on expression of over a dozen different PULs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> also grew much more efficiently than <italic>B. ovatus</italic> on Œ±-mannan, a fungal cell wall glycan that contains similar Œ±-mannosidic linkages to those found in the core regions of <italic>N</italic>-linked glycans present on secreted mucus and epithelial surfaces. Lastly, <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> exhibited better growth (more rapid rate and higher cell density) on the third class of host-derived glycans, glycosaminoglycans (GAGs), which include chondroitin sulfate, heparin, and hyaluronan.</p>
        <p>Together, the results indicate that these two human gut-associated <italic>Bacteroides</italic> have evolved distinct and only partially overlapping glycan niches. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> is more adept at foraging the more soluble, and possibly more accessible, pectic components of plant cell walls. It also exhibits a well-developed capacity to metabolize host mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans, a trait that could allow it to preferentially colonize the protective mucus layer that overlies the gut epithelium. Conversely, <italic>B. ovatus</italic> is metabolically specialized to utilize less soluble plant cell wall components like hemicelluloses, in addition to pectins, and thus is more likely to occupy physical microhabitats located in the gut lumen.</p>

        <title><italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> Deploys a Subset of Its Sus-Like Systems to Target Cell Wall Pectins</title>
        <p>To examine the molecular basis underlying plant cell wall glycan utilization by these two species, we used custom GeneChips representing 99.5% and all of the predicted or known ORFs in the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genomes, respectively. Our rationale was that identifying the genes responsible for plant cell wall degradation would allow us to compare the genomic location and organization of these genes between species. Whole-genome transcriptional profiles were generated for each species during exponential growth on individual glycans (substrates upon which each species was profiled are noted in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t001">Table 1</xref>). The specific transcriptional responses of each species to growth on a particular glycan were then determined by comparison to a reference dataset of that same species grown in minimal medium with glucose as the sole carbon source (MM-G).</p>
        <p>We previously demonstrated that genes associated with individual PULs typically exhibit large increases in their transcription when exposed to the substrates they process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>. Therefore, we applied a cutoff of ‚â•10-fold change in expression in minimal medium containing a given glycan compared to MM-G. A total of 280 <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> genes exhibited altered expression in response to growth on one or more of the six pectins tested, or pullulan (a control for expression of the starch utilization system). Expression of 268 genes (96%) was increased, while only 12 exhibited decreased expression (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s010">Table S1</xref> for a list of genes and fold-change values). Of the genes with altered expression during growth on one or more glycans, 155 (56%) were associated with 16 different PULs and all but five of these genes were upregulated. These observations indicate that PULs are a primary component of this symbiont's response to different pectins.</p>
        <p>To better visualize responses of entire PULs to the various glycans tested, genes were grouped into putative operons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Westover1">[22]</xref> and the average fold-change of each operon re-calculated from normalized GeneChip values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>. Eleven PULs had one or more operons that still exhibited ‚â•10-fold induction when cells were exposed to pectin or pullulan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Based on the predicted activities of the enzymes encoded by these PULs (enzymes in CAZy families where pectin degradation is a common feature), it is likely that 10 of them (all except the pullulan-induced starch PUL, <italic>BT3698-3704</italic>) make a significant contribution to pectin degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s011">Table S2</xref>; for schematic diagrams of these 10 PULs, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Support for this view is provided by a recent study that showed that the three GH43 enzymes from the arabinan-activated PUL spanning <italic>BT0348-69</italic> display arabinan-specific activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Cartmell1">[23]</xref>. This emerging portrait of the predicted enzyme specificity in PULs that have been empirically matched with specific polysaccharide substrates will provide a valuable template for future functional annotation of the more than 100 Bacteroidetes genomes that are known to harbor similar gene clusters, as well as a starting point for more focused biochemical and enzymatic studies of how these systems each attack their specific substrates.</p>

        <p>Comparison of our data to previous in vivo studies using gnotobiotic mice colonized with <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> alone (‚Äúmono-associated‚Äù) showed that a subset of the pectin-responsive loci were expressed in the ceca of animals consuming a diet composed of wheat- and soy-based plant material (‚Äúplant-rich diet‚Äù column in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g001">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that these natural dietary substrates contain pectins that are accessible to <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> in the absence of other bacteria. When these dietary substrates are withheld, as in mice fed a simple sugar diet <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg3">[20]</xref> or in neonatal mice suckling on mother's milk <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Bjursell1">[21]</xref>, expression of the ‚Äúpectin PULs‚Äù is reduced. In contrast, PULs targeting host-derived glycans, especially the <italic>O</italic>-glycans that are abundant in secreted mucus, are highly expressed regardless of diet, suggesting that <italic>B. thetaiotoamicron</italic> continuously forages on these substrates in vivo.</p>
        <p>To better understand the specificity of PUL expression in response to different glycans, we also evaluated the plant glycan-inducible responses of 12 previously identified PULs, known to orchestrate the degradation of host-derived glycans <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>. Despite the fact that some sugars like galactose and fucose are common to plant and host glycans, PULs specific for host glycans were not expressed in the presence of plant pectins or vice versa (compare columns A and B in the top and bottom sections of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g001">Figure 1</xref>), suggesting that individual PULs are activated in response to more complicated and unique oligosaccharide signals. Experiments that probe the specificity of HTCS regulators for oligosaccharide signals described later in this report support this view.</p>
        <p>A notable feature of the pectin-specific PULs summarized in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g001">Figure 1</xref> is activation of some PULs (e.g., <italic>BT4145-4183</italic>) by multiple substrates. A likely explanation for this phenomenon is that the preparations used for the growth assays were contaminated with trace amounts of other pectic glycans due to the inherent complexity and covalent connections originally present in these molecules prior to purification. This conclusion is supported by compositional analysis data available from the supplier: each preparation contained 5%‚Äì18% ‚Äúcontaminating‚Äù sugars that are not expected to be part of the purified pectic glycan but are present in other chains attached to a common backbone polysaccharide. Also, consistent with this notion, each PUL typically showed a much stronger transcriptional response on one substrate compared to the others. For example, <italic>BT4108-23</italic> showed highest induction on homogalacturonan and lower overall responses to three other pectins‚Äîpectic galactan and rhamnogalacturonans I and II. Compositional analysis of the former two substrates indicated the presence of homogalacturonan contamination, whereas homogalacturonan is a backbone component of the rhamnogalacturonan II structure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Mohnen1">[24]</xref>. Thus, it is likely that <italic>BT4108-23</italic> primarily targets homogalacturonan and that this substrate is responsible for its activation. This notion is compatible with the observed carbohydrate active enzyme (CAZyme) content of this PUL, which encodes seven enzymes that are members of families known to target homogalacturonan. Biochemical analysis of one of the CAZymes from the PUL (BT4116; a predicted family 1 polysaccharide lyase) supports this view as the enzyme was able to cleave homogalacturonan in an endo-like fashion but displayed no activity against rhamnogalacturonan I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s003">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s011">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>A feature shared by 8 of the 10 <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> PULs activated by pectin is their association with a HTCS regulator. To further dissect the involvement of specific PULs in pectin degradation, we disrupted the HTCS genes associated with pectin-activated PULs as well as several others associated with additional PULs (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t002">Table 2</xref>; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s002">Figure S1</xref> for a schematic of HTCS mutant locations and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s012">Table S3</xref> for a list of all HTCS mutant strains tested). Six of the mutants with disruptions in HTCS genes linked to pectin-induced PULs resulted in a growth defect on different pectins (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t002">Table 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s005">Figure S4</xref>). In contrast to the previously observed complete loss of growth after disruption of three <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> HTCS regulators associated with GAG- or fructan-utilizing PULs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>, none of the disrupted HTCS genes linked to pectin-induced PULs resulted in such a drastic phenotype on any of the pectins tested. Thus, although no individual PUL is absolutely essential for full degradation of a particular pectin preparation tested, each of the six individual PULs identified appear to be optimized for degradation of a specific substrate. This observation is supported by data presented below that show that individual PULs are specifically activated by defined oligosaccharides derived from the different pectins.</p>

        <title>Several Unique <italic>B. ovatus</italic> PULs Target Hemicellulose</title>
        <p>Our phenotypic analysis indicated that <italic>B. ovatus</italic> has evolved a capacity to target a series of hemicellulosic polysaccharides that <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> cannot access. To determine which <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genes are involved in hemicellulose metabolism, we performed transcriptional profiling experiments on <italic>B. ovatus</italic> cells grown on each of the different hemicelluloses (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t001">Table 1</xref>). This species was also profiled on the pectin homogalacturonan so that we could compare its responses to that of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> on the same substrate. Growth of <italic>B. ovatus</italic> on individual hemicellulose preparations or homogalacturonan resulted in altered expression of 259 total genes using the same ‚â•10-fold cutoff threshold used for <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>: 229 of these genes were upregulated, while 30 were downregulated. As with <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>, most of the <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genes were uniquely expressed in response to just one or a few of the carbohydrates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s013">Table S4</xref>).</p>
        <p>We next identified putative PULs in the <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genome using the same criteria as those used previously for <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>. Minimally, a PUL had to contain at least a pair of genes encoding homologs of the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> SusC/D proteins. This effort yielded 112 candidate <italic>B. ovatus</italic> PULs encompassing 1,129 ORFs (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s014">Table S5</xref> for a list of genes and annotations by PUL). As observed in <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>, most annotated PULs also contained one or more genes encoding predicted CAZymes and/or an environmental sensor/transcriptional regulator. In total, 140 (61.1%) of the genes that were upregulated in response to growth on one or more glycans were located in PULs. Six different PULs were activated by hemicellulosic polysaccharides: two by xylans, one by galacto-/glucomannan, one by xyloglucan, and two by barley Œ≤-glucan (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g002">Figure 2</xref>).</p>

        <p>The predicted CAZyme content of the six PULs activated by hemicelluloses (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s011">Table S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s007">Figure S6</xref>) is consistent with their capacity to orchestrate degradation of the inducing polysaccharides. For example, the xylan-, xyloglucan-, and galacto-/glucomannan-regulated PULs encode GH10, GH9, and GH26 enzymes, respectively, families dominated by xylanases (GH10), endoglucanases (GH9), and Œ≤-mannanases (GH26). Indeed, a previous study has shown that two enzymes encoded within the smaller of the two xylan activated PULs (<italic>BACOVA_04387</italic> and <italic>BACOVA_04386</italic>) display endo-xylanase and Œ≤-xylosidase activities, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Whitehead1">[25]</xref>. In addition, a PUL that is homologous to the smaller <italic>B. ovatus</italic> xylan PUL was recently identified in the rumen Bacteroidete <italic>Prevotella bryantii</italic> using a transcriptomic approach and wheat arabinoxylan as a test substrate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Dodd1">[11]</xref>. Finally, several of the enzymes from the xylan-activated PULs contain carbohydrate binding modules from families known to display xylan binding functionality (CBM6, 22, and 35), adding further support for a role of products of these loci in xylan utilization. Interestingly, the large xylan PUL also contains a number of genes encoding enzymes from CAZyme families not previously implicated in xylan deconstruction (e.g., GH31, GH95, GH97, GH98), suggesting that these sequences may exhibit novel specificities or target linkages so far not identified in various xylans (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s011">Table S2</xref>).</p>
        <p>Together, these findings support our conclusion that both <italic>B. ovatus</italic> and <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> rely on similar PUL-based strategies to degrade plant cell wall glycans. They also highlight how broadly Bacteroidetes Sus-like systems have evolved and further define the experimentally demonstrated range of substrates they target to include all major classes of hemicelluloses.</p>
        <p>We subsequently measured <italic>B. ovatus</italic> PUL gene expression in the distal gut (cecum) of mono-associated gnotobiotic mice fed the same plant glycan-rich diet used to examine in vivo expression of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>. A total of 353 <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genes exhibited altered expression in vivo relative to in vitro growth in MM-G: 126 genes also exhibited altered expression in the presence of one or more of the plant cell wall glycans tested and 50% of all in vivo responsive <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genes were located within putative PULs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s006">Figure S5</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s014">Table S5</xref>). Three <italic>B. ovatus</italic> PULs that were activated by the hemicelluloses xylan and Œ≤-glucan were expressed in vivo, suggesting that these substrates were present in the plant-rich diet fed to mice and could be sensed by this species in the absence of other members of the human gut microbiota (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g002">Figure 2</xref>). One of two <italic>B. ovatus</italic> PULs that responded to homogalacturonan in vitro was also expressed in vivo.</p>

        <title>Evolution of PULs in the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> Genomes</title>
        <p>Given the partially overlapping sets of carbohydrate degradation traits exhibited by <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic>, we wanted to examine the degree to which individual orthologous PULs were maintained between these two <italic>Bacteroides</italic>. We reasoned that PULs that are unique to either genome would provide evidence of independent acquisition or retention of traits that are not shared between the species. Because the genome sequence of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> VPI-5482 has been assembled into a single circular chromosome and contains fewer PULs than <italic>B. ovatus</italic>, we performed individual searches, using each of the 88 individual <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> PULs as queries, to probe for similar loci in the deep draft assembly of the <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genome. Our method (described in detail in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) was based on first comparing the core SusC/D amino acid sequences from each <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> PUL to the closest set of homologs in <italic>B. ovatus</italic> and then to score potentially homologous PULs for both gene homology and synteny within the PUL and in flanking genomic regions. Using this approach, each of the 198 PULs in the two <italic>Bacteroides</italic> species was scored as ‚Äúhomologous,‚Äù ‚Äúprobably homologous,‚Äù or ‚Äúunique‚Äù to a respective species (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s015">Table S6</xref>). Only 28 PULs met our criteria for being homologous between <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> (i.e., included in the homologous or probably homologous groups), suggesting that differential acquisition or retention of novel PULs is a mechanism underlying the phenotypic differences between these species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Among the group of PULs shared by both species were loci corresponding to each of the glycan metabolic traits that were strongly exhibited by both species: these include PULs for targeting starch, fructans, glycosaminoglycans, and all pectins except arabinan and arabinogalactan (PULs with dark or light green labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g003">Figure 3</xref>).</p>

            <p>The arrangement of PULs in the genome of each species is illustrated as a circular map with genes color coded as follows: ‚Äúhomologous PULs‚Äù (dark green); ‚Äúprobably homologous PULs‚Äù (light green); <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>-specific PULs (gold); <italic>B. ovatus</italic> specific PULs (light blue), <italic>B. ovatus</italic>-specific hemicellulose PULs (pink); all other genes in each species (gray). Shared PULs are labeled 1 through 28 based on their order in the <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> genome (clockwise from the top). Contigs in the deep-draft <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genome assembly are arranged in order of increasing size (clockwise from the top). Gaps in the genome assembly are illustrated as black tick marks around the interior of the <italic>B. ovatus</italic> genome. Empirically measured in vitro substrate specificities for some PULs are labeled around each genome schematic and correspond to PULs that were induced ‚â•10-fold in response to the indicated glycan class in this or previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>.

        </fig>
        <p>Evidence of the divergent evolution of these two species becomes apparent through visualization of the non-homologous PULs in their respective genomes. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> contains at least eight unique PULs associated with targeting host mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans (see PULs with gold labels in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g003">Figure 3</xref> that are noted as ‚Äú<italic>O</italic>-glycans‚Äù; this designation only includes PULs that have been confirmed to respond to purified neutral mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>). In addition, three previously validated PULs for degrading Œ±-mannan are also unique to <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>. Conversely, <italic>B. ovatus</italic> contains five unique PULs that underlie its ability to target plant cell wall hemicelluloses. An additional PUL (<italic>BACOVA_0942-46</italic>) that responded to Œ≤-glucan weaker than a second PUL (<italic>BACOVA_02741-47</italic>) was scored as homologous.</p>
        <p>The PULs that encode each species' unique phenotypes are scattered throughout each genome, suggesting that they arose through individual genetic events. This latter observation provides evidence for the idea that these two species are adapting to different carbohydrate niches and that these adaptations could serve to exclude access to others. For example, if <italic>B. ovatus</italic> had obtained its hemicellulose utilization PULs by lateral gene transfer or from a common ancestor, it might be expected that <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> would have been exposed to this same pool of traits during its own evolution. However, the sequenced strain of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> analyzed here has not acquired any of these individual loci, nor do any of several dozen different <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> strains tested exhibit growth on hemicelluloses <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Salyers1">[7]</xref> (N. Pudlo and E. C. Martens, unpublished). Thus, <italic>B. ovatus</italic> appears to have evolved a predilection for hemicellulose degradation that has resulted in its retention of PULs that target a family of glycans occupying similar positions in the plant cell wall. A similar picture emerges for <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>, which has evolved a predilection for host mucin <italic>O</italic>-glycans and possibly <italic>N</italic>-glycans as evidenced by its robust ability to degrade the linkages in Œ±-mannan.</p>

        <title><italic>Bacteroides</italic> HTCS Recognize Complex Oligosaccharide Signals</title>
        <p>The data presented above indicate that each <italic>Bacteroides</italic> PUL recognizes a specific molecular cue that is a component of its target polysaccharide. The most common class of regulator associated with PULs that target plant cell wall glycans are HTCS, inner membrane spanning proteins with predicted periplasmic sensory domains <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg2">[17]</xref>. A potential mechanism of signal perception by these regulators is direct binding of an oligosaccharide degradation product to the periplasmic domain of the HTCS. As noted above, this mechanism of signal perception has already been validated for one HTCS (BT1754) from <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic>'s fructan utilization PUL <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>. However, unlike BT1754, which recognizes monomeric fructose and contains a ‚àº300 aa sensory domain that adopts the periplasmic binding protein fold, the majority of <italic>Bacteroidetes</italic> HTCS contain a much larger putative periplasmic sensor domain of ‚àº700‚Äì900 aa <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Xu1">[26]</xref>. Sequence analysis revealed that these large sensor domains contain multiple short motifs (Reg_prop, Pfam 07494) indicative of an overall Œ≤-propeller fold, followed by a domain of ‚àº120 aa termed YYY (Pfam 07495) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Mascher1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Menke1">[28]</xref>. In addition to the predicted N-terminal periplasmic domain, most HTCS polypeptides possess all of the cytoplasmic domains present in a classical two component system phosphorelay <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Xu1">[26]</xref>, but in a single polypeptide, including a phosphoacceptor and dimerization domain, histidine kinase, receiver domain, and a DNA binding domain of the HTH_AraC family (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s008">Figure S7</xref>).</p>
        <p>To explore the mechanism of signal perception and identity in the HTCS proteins and further dissect their specificity, we expressed and purified the predicted periplasmic domains of several <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> HTCS identified above as being involved in plant glycan utilization and assessed their ability to bind carbohydrates using isothermal titration calorimetry (ITC). The ITC data reveal that the periplasmic domains of four HTCS bind specifically to oligosaccharides that uniquely define the parent polysaccharide that the cognate PUL is optimized to degrade. Binding data are summarized in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t003">Table 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s009">Figure S8</xref>, molecular illustrations of oligosaccharide signaling molecules that optimally bind to each HTCS sensor domain are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g004">Figure 4</xref>, and detailed findings for each individual glycan are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s001">Text S1</xref>. Notably, the binding of oligosaccharides to the HTCS is highly specific with each sensor domain only displaying affinity for glycan fragments derived from a single type of polysaccharide (e.g., the arabinan sensor BT0366 binds only arabino-oligosaccharides and not other oligosaccharides tested) (see footnote to <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t003">Table 3</xref>).</p>

        <p>Unlike the previously described fructose-sensing HTCS that binds a simpler monosaccharide signal <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Sonnenburg1">[12]</xref>, all of the HTCS sensors described here interacted directly with oligosaccharides, consistent with the idea that the specific recognition of most polysaccharides requires information contained in both the sugar content and glycosidic linkages. By sensing oligosaccharide cues that uniquely define the parent polysaccharide, <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> (and by extension other Bacteroidetes that contain PUL-associated HTCS) are able to differentiate between multiple complex glycans that contain the same sugars, and to respond efficiently by activating only the appropriate PUL for their degradation. Interestingly, the preferred ligands for the HTCS were relatively large glycan fragments ranging from tetra- to octa-saccharides and therefore represent early products of the depolymerization process that are likely transported into the periplasm via their specific PUL-encoded SusC-like outer membrane transporter, as has been suggested for maltooligosaccharides for the starch-utilization system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Anderson1">[29]</xref>. Together, these data suggest that Bacteroides respond rapidly and specifically to the presence of polysaccharides in their environment. This requirement for a rapid and highly defined response may explain the localization of the signal input and output domains of HTCS in a single polypeptide, as this physical constraint will both maximize the speed of activation and minimize cross-talk among these systems. It is also notable that all four HTCS sensors interacted directly with linear oligosaccharides, suggesting that the presence of branches, which can vary between related glycans from different sources, is not a required signaling component for this subset of sensors. In one case (mannopentaose versus di-galactosyl-mannopentaose), the presence of galactose branching interfered completely with detectable binding, suggesting that removal of these branches is a prerequisite for sensing of galactomannans.</p>
        <p>To confirm that the oligosaccharides we identified by ITC were able to specifically activate PUL gene expression in bacterial cells, we measured the relative amount of the <italic>sus</italic>C-like gene transcript (a proxy for expression of the whole operon) of each PUL when the bacteria were grown on the cognate HTCS ligand. The data reveal that the oligosaccharide that binds preferentially to the HTCS specifically upregulates the <italic>sus</italic>C-like gene, and by inference the whole PUL, associated with that HTCS (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001221-g005">Figure 5</xref>). For example, exposure of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> to arabino-octaose (the preferred ligand for BT0366 HTCS) results in a 10‚Äì100-fold greater induction of the <italic>sus</italic>C homolog present in the BT0366-associated PUL (<italic>BT0348-69</italic>) compared to its effects on the other PULs that are activated by arabinan, but whose associated HTCS display no binding to arabino-oligosaccharides (250‚Äì400-fold for <italic>susC</italic>-like genes <italic>BT0362</italic> and <italic>BT0364</italic> compared to 15- and 2-fold for the <italic>sus</italic>C-like genes, <italic>BT3046</italic> and <italic>BT4164</italic>). Similarly, growth of <italic>B. ovatus</italic> on xylotetraose, the preferred ligand for BACOVA_04394, upregulates the <italic>susC</italic>-like gene (<italic>BACOVA_04393</italic>) associated with this PUL, but not two <italic>susC</italic>-like genes from the larger xylan PUL (<italic>BACOVA_03426</italic> and <italic>_03428</italic>). These findings support the HTCS binding data and demonstrate that activation of each PUL is by a defined oligosaccharide cue that is specifically recognized by the associated HTCS (i.e., there is little or no cross-reactivity between the PULs). Additional details of the transcriptional response of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> to pectic oligosaccharides are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s001">Text S1</xref>.</p>

        <title>Prospectus</title>
        <p>The distal gut of humans is constantly inundated with a dynamic array of carbohydrates. These substrates feed the dense consortium of microbes that compete in this habitat. The gut also presents biochemical gradients that result from the differential rates of digestion of dietary resources and from the presence of a mucus layer overlying the epithelium. Given the gut's intrinsic biochemical heterogeneity, it is perhaps not surprising that different microbial lineages would evolve to fill distinct glycan niches. The data presented here support the notion that two closely related human gut symbionts have taken divergent paths that have left each species with a partially unique repertoire of metabolic traits. Although <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> are both common in the normal adult human gut microbiota, at least in Western societies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Qin1">[5]</xref>, they represent only two of at least 45 different species of Bacteroidetes that have been cultured to date from human specimens. Complete or deep-draft genomic sequences will soon be available for many more members of these species as culturing efforts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Goodman1">[30]</xref> and sequencing technology progress rapidly. The availability of additional cultured Bacteroidetes, together with the ability to dissect their carbohydrate active phenotypes using the approaches described here, present an opportunity to reveal basic biological parameters that have catalyzed the niche-specific adaptation of gut bacterial lineages throughout human history. At the same time, identifying the molecular machinery for acquisition, import, and catabolism of specific polysaccharides will help inform efforts to engineer carbohydrate active phenotypes in microbes (via PUL ‚Äútransplants‚Äù) in order to fulfill important industrial needs, as well as to manipulate human gut microbiome function in ways that restore health or enhance nutrition.</p>

        <p><italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> ATCC 29148 (VPI-5482) and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> ATCC 8483 were routinely grown in tryptone-yeast extract-glucose (TYG) medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Holdeman1">[31]</xref> or on brain-heart infusion (BHI; Beckton Dickinson) agar plus 10% horse blood (Colorado Serum Co.). Antibiotics were added as appropriate: erythromycin (25 ¬µg/ml) and gentamicin (200 ¬µg/ml). Minimal medium (MM) was formulated as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Martens1">[8]</xref>. <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> HTCS mutant strains were constructed by suicide plasmid insertion (denoted as ‚ÄúŒ©‚Äù mutants) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001221-Salyers2">[32]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The ability of <italic>B. thetaiotaomicron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> to grow on pure carbohydrates was measured using a custom carbohydrate array constructed in a 96-well format. Each well of a flat bottom 96-well plate (Costar) was loaded with 100 ¬µl of each sterilized carbohydrate stock (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001221.s016">Table S7</xref>) at 2√ó concentration. Each substrate was represented twice on each assay plate in two non-adjacent wells. Two carbohydrate-free water wells were included as negative controls. Cultures for assay inoculations were grown for ‚àº24 h at 37¬∞C under an atmosphere of 10% H<sub>2</sub>, 5% CO<sub>2</sub>, and 85% N<sub>2</sub> in MM-G, and a 1 ml aliquot centrifuged to pellet bacteria, which were then gently resuspended in 2√ó MM-no carbohydrate (MM-NC) and used to inoculate 50 ml of 2√ó MM-NC at a ratio of 1‚à∂50. Each carbohydrate array was loaded with 100 ¬µl of the inoculated 2√ó medium to produce 96 individual 200 ¬µl cultures. Assay plates were sealed in an anaerobic chamber (Coy manufacturing, Grass Lake, MI) under the atmosphere noted above with an optically clear gas-permeable polyurethane membrane (Diversified Biotech, Boston, MA). Plates were then loaded into a Biostack automated plate handling device coupled to a Powerwave HT absorbance reader (both devices from Biotek Instruments, Winooski, VT). Absorbance at 600 nm (<italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub>) was measured for each well at 10‚Äì15 min intervals. <italic>B. thetaiotaomiocron</italic> and <italic>B. ovatus</italic> were each tested in three separate carbohydrate arrays (<italic>n</italic>‚Ää=‚Ää6 replicate cultures). Data were processed using Gen5 software (Biotek) and Microsoft Excel.</p>
        <p>Several glycans yielded complicated polyphasic growth profiles rather than a single exponential growth phase. Thus, we quantified growth in each assay by first identifying a minimum time point (<italic>A</italic><sub>min</sub>) at which <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> had increased by 10% over a baseline reading taken during the first 500 min of incubation. Next, we identified the time point at which <italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub> reached its maximum (<italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub>) immediately after exponential growth. Two growth parameters were generated for each well: ‚Äúrate‚Äù [(<italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub>‚àí<italic>A</italic><sub>min</sub>)/(T<sub>max</sub>‚àíT<sub>min</sub>)], and ‚Äúdensity‚Äù (<italic>A</italic><sub>max</sub>‚àí<italic>A</italic><sub>min</sub>), where T<sub>max</sub> and T<sub>min</sub> are the corresponding time values for each absorbance. Cultures that failed to increase density by at least 0.1 (<italic>A</italic><sub>600</sub>) were scored as no growth.</p>

The average growth maximum for each mutant was compared to wild-type on the same substrate to quantify the growth defect in each mutant (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1001221-t002">Table 2</xref>, main text).</p>
