<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The bacterial phosphotransferase system (PTS) mediates uptake of multiple sugars from the environment and also controls cell physiology and swimming behavior in sugar gradients. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> and other bacteria, the PTS consists of a number of sugar-specific branches, interconnected via shared components through a series of phosphotransfer reactions. Whereas most previous studies have focused on understanding individual PTS branches, the holistic function of the entire PTS network in the cell remained elusive. In this study we address this question by investigating the dynamics of multiple protein interactions within the cellular PTS network upon stimulation with sugars and other metabolites. We demonstrate that despite its seeming complexity, the core part of the PTS network operates in a strikingly simple way, sensing the overall influx of PTS sugars and key metabolites into the cell and utilizing this information to control bacterial behavior. We further show that the default influx of the carbon source correlates with its quality, and we use computer simulations to demonstrate that this correlation apparently represents an optimal regulatory strategy.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The phosphotransferase system (PTS) is the major type of bacterial sugar transporters and is present in many bacteria. The PTS mediates uptake of a number of sugars, coupling transport to sugar phosphorylation. The phosphorylation occurs through a series of phosphotransfer reactions, starting from phosphoenolpyruvate (PEP) as a phosphodonor and involving sugar-specific Enzyme II (EII) transporters as well as two general components, Enzyme I (EI) and histidine protein (Hpr) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref002">2</xref>]. In <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, EI and Hpr are shared between 15 different sugar-specific branches, which are typically composed of three EII subunits (A, B, and C) that can exist either as a single polypeptide chain or as separate proteins. PTS components are normally phosphorylated in the absence of sugar substrates but become (partly) dephosphorylated in the process of sugar uptake. Consequently, the phosphorylation states of the PTS components serve as an indicator of substrate availability, which is used by bacteria to regulate a number of cellular functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>One such regulatory function of the PTS is inducer exclusion, in which the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> component of the glucose-specific PTS branch controls uptake of non-PTS sugars lactose and maltose by binding and inhibiting respective transporters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref004">4</xref>]. Uptake of multiple other non-PTS sugars might be controlled by the PTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref007">7</xref>], but the underlying regulatory mechanisms have not been characterized. While much of the PTS-mediated control of sugar uptake and metabolism was previously thought to occur on the level of gene expression (through the so-called catabolite repression), the importance of the PTS in catabolite repression has been recently questioned [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref008">8</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to the control of carbon uptake and metabolism, PTS components are known to have several other regulatory functions. Most prominent among these functions is signaling to the chemotaxis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref011">11</xref>], which is believed to occur via binding of EI (and likely also EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>) at the cytoplasmic face of the sensory complexes formed by the chemotaxis receptors, the kinase CheA and an adaptor protein CheW [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref012">12</xref>]. These interactions apparently ensure that the activity of CheA is regulated dependent on the phosphorylation state of EI [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Although most studies of the PTS-mediated regulation focused on a single (glucose) branch of the PTS network, other PTS sugars and even non-PTS compounds can elicit similar effects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref016">16</xref>]. This indicates a more general regulatory function of the PTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref002">2</xref>], but the processing and integration of these multiple inputs within the network has remained unclear up to now.</p>
<p>Here we used Förster (fluorescence) resonance energy transfer (FRET) to investigate in vivo the dynamic behavior of the PTS network upon stimulation with PTS or non-PTS substrates. We observed that multiple protein interactions within the PTS network are stimulation-dependent, and we used these interactions to investigate the intracellular processing of signals by the PTS network. Our results suggest that the PTS network serves as a global sensor of the sugar influx and also monitors the levels of several non-PTS compounds. This information is integrated and propagated linearly within the network and towards the chemotaxis system, which is in stark contrast to processing of conventional chemotactic stimuli. We further demonstrate strong correlation between the default influx and the quality of the carbon source and propose that such proportional adjustment of the carbon uptake represents an optimal regulatory strategy.</p>

<title>Cytoplasmic PTS Components Are Recruited to Transporters upon Stimulation</title>
<p>To understand the cellular dynamics of the PTS network, we tested interactions of over 60 protein pairs using a FRET assay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref018">18</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s012">S1 Table</xref>). Proteins of interest were C-terminally tagged with cyan and yellow fluorescent proteins (CFP and YFP, respectively) and changes in their pairwise interactions upon stimulation with sugars were monitored using the ratio of the YFP to CFP emission (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), which is proportional to the extent of energy transfer and thus to the amount of complex formed by the tagged proteins.</p>
<p>Our analysis revealed nine pairs that were responsive to stimulation by PTS sugars (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s012">S1 Table</xref>). Among those, four pairs reflected stimulation-dependent changes in interactions between PTS proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). These included interactions of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> with both of its cognate transporter components that are involved in glucose uptake, EIICB<sup>Mal</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g001">Fig 1B</xref>) and EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), as well as interaction of the cytoplasmic component of the mannose transporter EIIAB<sup>Man</sup> with its respective membrane component EIIC<sup>Man</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Interestingly, in the latter case no interaction of EIIAB<sup>Man</sup> with another mannose-specific transporter component EIID<sup>Man</sup> could be detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s012">S1 Table</xref>). Surprisingly, we also observed a stimulation-dependent complex formation between the general PTS component EI and the N-acetylglucosamine (GlcNAc) transporter EIICBA<sup>Nag</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s002">S2B Fig</xref>), which to our knowledge is the first reported interaction of a bacterial EI with sugar-specific PTS components. The observed increase in FRET suggests that in all of these cases cytoplasmic PTS proteins become recruited to the membrane transporters upon exposure to sugars. This increase in interaction was steady, indicating that on the time scale of our experiments, the overall activity of the PTS system shows no adaptation/desensitization in the presence of constant background stimulation.</p>

Phosphotransfer reactions between components are shown with solid lines and observed stimulation-dependent protein interactions are shown with dashed lines. Note that EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is shared between EII<sup>Glc</sup> and EII<sup>Mal</sup>, and EII<sup>Man</sup> has an additional component EIID<sup>Man</sup>. (B) Example of a FRET measurement for a pair of glucose-specific PTS components. Cells expressing EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>-CFP and EIICB<sup>Mal</sup>-YFP were stimulated by the stepwise addition of PTS sugars and the response was followed as a change in the ratio of YFP to CFP fluorescence. Measurements were acquired every second for a population of several hundred cells, as described in Materials and Methods. (C) Example of a FRET measurement for a EIIAB<sup>Man</sup>-YFP and EIIC<sup>Man</sup>-CFP pair upon stimulation by the stepwise addition of 100 μM of the indicated PTS sugars. (D) The amplitude of FRET response for indicated pairs to saturating levels (100 μM) of PTS sugars, normalized to the glucose response. Error bars indicate standard errors of the mean of three independent replicates.

<p>In addition, we also observed a stimulation-induced reduction in FRET between the two membrane domains (EIIC<sup>Glc</sup>) of the glucose-specific PTS transporter EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s002">S2C Fig</xref>). This reduction likely reflects a conformational rearrangement within the transporter upon glucose binding, and it could also be seen in the PTS-deficient strain lacking EI (Δ<italic>ptsI</italic>). No changes in FRET were observed for the other pairs of PTS proteins tested (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s012">S1 Table</xref>). While most of these pairs are likely to be genuine negatives, in some cases including the expected interaction between EI proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref019">19</xref>], the efficiency of energy transfer might be too low to be detected by FRET [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref018">18</xref>].</p>

<title>PTS Network Senses the Overall Influx of Sugars</title>
<p>We observed that all phosphorylation-dependent interactions between different PTS proteins were similarly responsive to all tested PTS sugars (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g001">1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s002">S2A and S2B</xref>). For example, the increase in the EIIAB<sup>Man</sup>–EIIC<sup>Man</sup> interaction was stronger upon stimulation with glucose or GlcNAc than with its cognate substrate mannose. Even more strikingly, when compared across different phosphorylation-dependent pairs, relative response amplitudes observed upon stimulation with saturating concentration of different PTS sugars were equal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s016">S1 Data</xref>). This result suggests that EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>, EIIAB<sup>Man</sup>, and EI, and presumably also their membrane interaction partners, are dephosphorylated to the same extent upon stimulation with any PTS sugar. The relative response amplitudes for the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>–EIICB<sup>Glc</sup> pair were somewhat different (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s002">S2A Fig</xref>), indicating additional regulation, but the pair was also responsive to different sugars. These results imply that the phosphorylation state of proteins within the network can rapidly (within seconds) equilibrate, suggesting that reversibility, which has been previously observed for several reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref021">21</xref>], is a general property of the PTS.</p>
<p>Such reversibility of the phosphotransfer reactions means that the PTS network has no intrinsic preference for a specific sugar (e.g., glucose) but rather senses the overall sugar influx into the cell. Indeed, the activity of the EI–EIICBA<sup>Nag</sup> pair remained unaltered upon exchange of equivalent subsaturating concentrations of mannitol, GlcNAc, or glucose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g001">Fig 1E</xref>).</p>

<sec id="sec005">
<title>Inducer Exclusion Is a General Phenomenon</title>
<p>In addition to the interactions between different PTS proteins, we observed that sugars stimulate interactions of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> with a number of transporters for non-PTS sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s012">S1 Table</xref>). These include the galactose symporter GalP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) as well as the ATP binding subunits of the maltose, galactose and ribose ABC transporters—MglA, MalK, and RbsA, respectively (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g002">2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s003">S3A and S3B</xref>). Interactions of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> with the ABC transporters were stimulated by multiple PTS sugars, apparently directly reflecting the phosphorylation state of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>. Their response amplitudes were generally consistent with the response within the PTS network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g002">Fig 2A</xref>), although additional regulation might exist for the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>–MalK pair (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s003">S3A Fig</xref>).</p>

<p>In contrast, the interaction of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> with GalP was stimulated only by glucose but not by other PTS sugars, e.g., GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g002">Fig 2B</xref>). Since glucose (along with galactose) is as a substrate of GalP [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref022">22</xref>], we hypothesized that this interaction may require not only dephosphorylation of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>—induced by glucose through the PTS—but also a conformational change induced by glucose binding to GalP. Indeed, an increase in the EIIA<sup>Glc</sup>–GalP interaction could be observed when cells were co-stimulated with GlcNAc and galactose, which combined induce both dephosphorylation of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> and the conformational change within GalP.</p>
<p>These interactions likely reflect the inhibition of sugar uptake via inducer exclusion, which was previously only described for the lactose symporter and for the maltose ABC transporter [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref004">4</xref>], suggesting that this phenomenon is more general. Although several symporters and ABC transporters of non-PTS sugars showed no stimulation-dependent interactions with EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> in our FRET assay (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s012">S1 Table</xref>), some of these interactions might be again too weak to be detected by FRET.</p>

<title>PTS Signals Propagate Linearly to the Chemotaxis Pathway</title>
<p>We next investigated the processing of PTS signals and their propagation to the chemotaxis pathway. For that, we measured dose-response curves for two PTS sugars, glucose and GlcNAc using several FRET pairs. These curves showed a clear alignment of response to both sugars (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g003">Fig 3A and 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s016">S1 Data</xref>) at all measured points of the PTS network, including ligand-induced changes in the transporter conformation (for glucose).

<p>More surprisingly, the dose alignment was also observed at the level of the chemotaxis system. Here we utilized a FRET reporter that relies upon phosphorylation-dependent interaction between the response regulator CheY and its phosphatase CheZ and reflects changes in the activity of the chemotaxis pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref023">23</xref>]. Because <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> chemotactic response to glucose is known to be mediated by both the chemotaxis receptor (Trg) and by the PTS, we conducted measurements in the strain RS4 that is not capable of chemoreceptor-mediated sensing of glucose. In this background, the CheY–CheZ dose-response curve was consistent with the responses of the PTS FRET pairs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). As positive (attractant) stimuli inhibit the activity of the chemotaxis pathway, this FRET signal decreased with increasing sugar concentration. Similar alignment of the dose-response curves was observed for GlcNAc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g003">Fig 3B</xref>), which is sensed solely through the PTS. Furthermore, the dose-response curves for the chemotactic response to glucose and GlcNAc were the same in a receptorless strain expressing only one major chemoreceptor Tar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s005">S5A and S5B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s016">S1 Data</xref>), confirming that the PTS-mediated response is independent of the specific set of chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref012">12</xref>].

<title>PTS Integrates and Transmits Additional Metabolic Signals</title>
<p>Several non-PTS compounds can elicit PTS-like responses, such as catabolite repression, but their connection to the PTS network remained unclear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref015">15</xref>]. Moreover, recent work has shown that catabolite repression does not require a functional PTS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref008">8</xref>].

<p>In contrast to glycerol and pyruvate, the chemotactic responses to serine and oxaloacetate are primarily mediated via the chemoreceptor Tsr. Nevertheless, the PTS apparently provides a secondary sensing system for these compounds, the existence of which in the case of serine has already been postulated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref025">25</xref>].

<p>Notably, we observed that the PTS responses to saturating concentrations of pyruvate, oxaloacetate and serine were not additive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s008">S8A Fig</xref>), suggesting that these compounds affect PTS activity through a shared pathway.

<title>Default Uptake of Carbon Sources Correlates with Their Metabolic Efficiency</title>
<p>Finally, we asked whether the amplitudes of the PTS response to individual metabolites, which reflect their uptake efficiency, could be correlated with the metabolic efficiency of these compounds. Importantly, cells for FRET experiments were grown in a tryptone broth medium, i.e., without sugars, and experiments themselves were performed in the buffer, i.e., in absence of protein expression. Thus, the FRET response reflects the default (basal) sugar uptake by <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells that had no previous exposure to sugars.

<p>We thus conclude that the default relative uptake efficiency of different carbon sources by non-stimulated <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> cells is pre-adjusted to match metabolic efficiency, i.e., the relative growth rates that can be attained on these carbon sources. To test whether such correlation could stem from evolutionary optimization of growth, we mathematically modeled the dependence of the rate of biomass production on the basal rate of uptake (i.e., the rate prior to sugar-specific induction) for sugars with different metabolic efficiency (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s015">S1 Text</xref>). In our initial model, the transporters are inducible by their phosphorylated substrates, as reported for a number of PTS sugars in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref032">32</xref>], and for simplicity we also assumed that maximal fold induction of uptake relative to the basal rate is equal for all sugars. Indeed, we observed that the optimal basal uptake rate increases with the metabolic efficiency of sugar (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g005">Fig 5B</xref>), and this correlation is roughly linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000074.g005">Fig 5B</xref> Inset), similar to the experimentally observed correlation. Qualitatively, such correlation arises due to a trade-off between energy gained from sugar catabolism and energy spent on sugar uptake, with the higher metabolic efficiency of sugar leading to the higher optimal basal rate of uptake (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s015">S1 Text</xref> for details). Importantly, this correlation holds even in the absence of the transporter induction by the phosphorylated sugar (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s010">S10A and S10B Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s016">S1 Data</xref>) or when the maximal induction does not depend on the basal rate of uptake (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s010">S10C and S10D Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s016">S1 Data</xref>). It is thus likely to be also relevant for PTS transporters that rely on different mechanisms of induction, such as those controlled by the PTS regulation domain (PRD)-containing transcriptional regulators [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref034">34</xref>].

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The bacterial PTS is one of the most prominent examples of a cellular network that combines metabolic and sensory functions. Nevertheless, although the principle mechanism of the PTS-mediated sugar uptake and the sensory functions of its glucose branch are well established [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref002">2</xref>], the holistic operation of the network in the cell—including the interplay between the different branches of the PTS—has up to now remained unknown. In this study, we used an intracellular FRET assay to follow signal processing within the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> PTS network, demonstrating that the network can be seen as a linear sensor of the overall sugar influx into the cell. We observed that multiple protein interactions within the network are similarly affected by every PTS sugar, including alignment of dose-response curves for all measured pairs. Thus, dephosphorylation of any PTS transporter by its substrate must rapidly equilibrate within the network, suggesting that reversibility, which was previously observed for several phosphotransfer reactions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref035">35</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref036">36</xref>], is a general feature of the PTS network. Here we did not observe any hierarchical preference for the uptake of individual sugars, including glucose, meaning that all sugars compete with each other for uptake. Importantly, such a general view of the network as a global sugar influx sensor does not contradict sugar-specific downstream regulation of cellular functions by individual PTS branches, such as differential dephosphorylation of the transcriptional antiterminator BglG by branch-specific substrates versus other PTS sugars [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref034">34</xref>].</p>
<p>Besides sensing sugar influx, the PTS activity was observed to reflect levels of other metabolites, including pyruvate, glycerol, oxaloacetate, and serine. Sensing of these metabolites might be mediated by the pyruvate to PEP ratio [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref037">37</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref038">38</xref>] that influences the phosphorylation state of the PTS network. Notably, pyruvate, oxaloacetate, and serine appear to affect the PTS response through the same pathway, whereas glycerol does not. Nevertheless, a number of other metabolites that were previously implicated in PTS-like responses or proposed to directly regulate PTS, including glucose-6-phosphate, gluconate, lactose, and α-ketoglutarate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref039">39</xref>] did not elicit changes in PTS activity in our experiments.</p>
<p>Another important observation was that the cytoplasmic components of multiple PTS systems become recruited to the respective membrane transporters upon sugar-induced dephosphorylation. These include protein interactions within sugar-specific branches, such as binding of EIIAB<sup>Man</sup> to EIIC<sup>Man</sup>, but also recruitment of the general PTS component EI to EIICBA<sup>Nag</sup>, both of which have not being reported previously. In the latter case, it is likely that the EI–EIICBA<sup>Nag</sup> complex may also recruit Hpr, which is expected to transfer the phosphoryl group from EI to EIIA, but that Hpr binding is not sufficiently strong to be detected by FRET. Overall, such formation of transporter complexes could increase the efficiency of phosphotransfer reactions and thus of sugar uptake by relieving diffusional limitation on the reaction rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref043">43</xref>], although this limitation might be less severe in bacteria than in eukaryotes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref044">44</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref045">45</xref>]. Interestingly, formation of these transport complexes is stimulated by any PTS sugar and even by the non-PTS compounds, not only by the substrate for the respective PTS transporter.</p>
<p>PTS stimulation also induced interaction of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> with several non-PTS sugar transporters, including the ABC transporters for maltose, ribose, and galactose, as well as the galactose symporter (GalP). Thus, inhibition of the non-PTS sugar uptake via inducer exclusion, which has been previously characterized for lactose and maltose, may be a general phenomenon. Notably, whereas dephosphorylation of EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> is sufficient to induce its interactions with the ABC transporters, its interaction with GalP requires the presence of GalP substrate (galactose or glucose). Such cooperativity in binding of the sugar substrate and dephosphorylated EIIA<sup>Glc</sup> might represent a general feature of the PTS-mediated regulation of sugar symporters, and possibly also other cellular functions, consistent with previous reports for LacY [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref046">46</xref>] and the melibiose symporter MelB [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref047">47</xref>], as well as for the glycerol kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref048">48</xref>].</p>
<p>Furthermore, the PTS provides an integrated metabolic input to the chemotaxis system, which reflects not only the overall influx of PTS sugars but also the presence of other metabolites that affect PTS activity. Signaling through the PTS network might thus be at least partly responsible for the metabolism-related tactic responses, summarily known as energy taxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref049">49</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref050">50</xref>], as well as for the previously described Tsr-independent response to serine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref025">25</xref>]. Notably, dose alignment of the chemotactic and the PTS response means that the PTS signals are not further amplified by the chemotaxis system. This stands in contrast to chemoreceptor-mediated signals, which undergo amplification due to allosteric interactions within the chemoreceptor clusters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref054">54</xref>]. Such lack of amplification implies a fundamental difference between the receptor- and the PTS-mediated chemotactic signaling; for the former, the chemotactic response is observed at concentrations that are significantly lower than ligand binding affinity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref055">55</xref>], aiding recognition of the low levels of ligand. In contrast, the PTS-mediated response directly reflects the overall influx of sugars and several other key metabolites, likely enabling cells to maximize the uptake of nutrients by navigating in their environment. Furthermore, the receptor- and the PTS-mediated stimuli apparently induce similar conformational changes in the cytoplasmic part of the chemoreceptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref012">12</xref>]. The observed lack of amplification of PTS signals thus indicates that chemoreceptor-mediated signals might be amplified through interactions among membrane-proximal parts of the receptors, in an apparent contradiction to a recently proposed model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref056">56</xref>] of signal amplification through interactions between CheW and CheA at the cytoplasmic face of the receptor clusters.</p>
<p>Finally, we observed a strong correlation between the PTS response to saturating levels of individual metabolites and the growth rate on these metabolites as a carbon source. This correlation is highly nontrivial considering that the PTS activity measurements were performed on non-growing cells that had no prior exposure to sugars and thus reflect the basal (default) rate of sugar uptake in uninduced cells. In contrast, during growth <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is free to regulate gene expression to maximize sugar uptake and catabolism, and this induced uptake rate does not need to reflect the default rate. Nevertheless, default uptake rates are apparently pre-adjusted in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to reflect the metabolic efficiency of the substrate, i.e., growth rates that are achieved on a particular carbon source. Using computer simulations, we could show that such tuning of the default uptake enables <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> to maximize its growth rate upon exposure to different sugars, apparently representing an optimal regulation strategy.</p>

<p>Cells were grown in tryptone broth (TB 1% and 0.5% NaCl) with antibiotics (100 μg/ml ampicillin, 50 μg/ml kanamycin, 34 μg/ml chloramphenicol) and inducers added at appropriate concentrations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s014">S3 Table</xref>). Overnight cultures were grown at 30°C, diluted 1:100, and grown at 34°C and 275 rpm on a rotary shaker. Cells were harvested at OD<sub>600</sub> of 0.5–0.6 by centrifugation (10,000 rpm, 5 min) and washed thrice with tethering buffer (10 mM KPO4, 0.1 mM EDTA, 1 μM methionine, 10 mM lactic acid, pH 7) that is typically used for FRET experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref018">18</xref>], and resuspended in 2 ml of tethering buffer. Cells were stored at 4°C prior to FRET measurements.</p>

<title>FRET Measurements</title>
<p>FRET measurements were performed as described previously [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref018">18</xref>] on a custom-modified Zeiss Axiovert 200 microscope. Cells were concentrated and attached to poly-L-lysine coated coverslips and placed into a flow chamber of 50 μl volume, which was kept under constant flow (300 μl/min) of tethering buffer by a syringe pump (Harvard Apparatus). Cells were stimulated with sugar solutions in tethering buffer by rapid exchange of buffer reservoir. CFP fluorescence was excited at 436/20 nm through a 455 nm dichroic mirror by a 75 W Xenon lamp. To detect CFP and YFP emissions, 480/40 nm band pass and 520 nm long pass emission filters were used, respectively. The signal was collected with integration time of 1 s using Peltier-cooled photon counters (Hamamatsu) equipped with a PCI-6034 counting board connected to a computer with custom written LabView7 software (National Instruments). FRET amplitude was calculated from changes in ratio of yellow and cyan fluorescence signals. Acquired data was fitted to multisite Hill model for calculation of EC<sub>50</sub> as described before [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000074.ref017">17</xref>].</p>

<title>Mathematical Model of PTS-Mediated Regulation</title>
<p>Function of the PTS was modeled using a set of ordinary differential equations (ODEs; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000074.s015">S1 Text</xref>). The model assumes that sugar is converted to sugar-phosphate during uptake in a two-step process, and that sugar-phosphate is subsequently converted to ATP (energy). The rate of ATP production is assumed to depend on the metabolic efficiency of the sugar. Fractions of ATP are further utilized for producing the biomass as well as for sugar uptake and for expression of the metabolic enzymes. The final biomass produced within a certain amount of time is assumed to reflect the growth rate. The model further includes transcriptional induction of the sugar-specific transporter and metabolic enzymes by sugar-phosphate. The ODEs were constructed based on mass action kinetics. Simulations of this model were performed by varying the basal uptake rate and the metabolic efficiency, either for growth on single sugar or on a mixture of multiple sugars. The basal uptake rate for which the growth rate is maximal was defined as the optimal basal uptake rate for a particular sugar. Moreover, we derived a simple analytical equation that illustrates the relation between the optimal uptake rate and the metabolic efficiency of the sugar.</p>
