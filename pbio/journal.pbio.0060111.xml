				<article-title>Posttranscriptional Gene Regulation by Spatial Rearrangement of the 3' Untranslated Region</article-title>
			</related-article><abstract>
        <p>The nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) pathway subjects mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) to rapid decay. The conserved Upf1–3 complex interacts with the eukaryotic translation release factors, eRF3 and eRF1, and triggers NMD when translation termination takes place at a PTC. Contrasting models postulate central roles in PTC-recognition for the exon junction complex in mammals versus the cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) in other eukaryotes. Here we present evidence for a unified model for NMD, in which PTC recognition in human cells is mediated by a competition between 3′ UTR–associated factors that stimulate or antagonize recruitment of the Upf complex to the terminating ribosome. We identify cytoplasmic PABP as a human NMD antagonizing factor, which inhibits the interaction between eRF3 and Upf1 in vitro and prevents NMD in cells when positioned in proximity to the termination codon. Surprisingly, only when an extended 3′ UTR places cytoplasmic PABP distally to the termination codon does a downstream exon junction complex enhance NMD, likely through increasing the affinity of Upf proteins for the 3′ UTR. Interestingly, while an artificial 3′ UTR of &gt;420 nucleotides triggers NMD, a large subset of human mRNAs contain longer 3′ UTRs but evade NMD. We speculate that these have evolved to concentrate NMD-inhibiting factors, such as PABP, in spatial proximity of the termination codon.</p>

          <title/>
          <p>The nonsense-mediated mRNA decay pathway is responsible for rapidly degrading mRNAs with premature termination codons. This is important because it prevents the production of potentially deleterious truncated proteins from aberrant mRNAs, such as those that have undergone erroneous processing. How does the cell discriminate aberrant mRNAs from those that are normal? Here we present evidence that in human cells, the targeting of an mRNA to nonsense-mediated mRNA decay depends on a competition between proteins associated with the mRNA 3′ UTR that stimulate or antagonize mRNA decay. We show that cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein, a protein associated with the mRNA 3′ end poly(A) tail, antagonizes mRNA decay. By contrast, a protein complex deposited onto mRNAs upon pre-mRNA splicing, called the exon junction complex, stimulates mRNA decay. Our observations suggest that the competition between these proteins, and probably other unknown proteins with similar activities, determines whether a key protein complex in the pathway, the Upf complex, is recruited to the mRNA upon translation termination, which leads to mRNA decay.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The process of nonsense-mediated decay (NMD) subjects mRNAs with premature termination codons (PTCs) to rapid decay. This helps rid the cell of aberrant mRNAs that have acquired PTCs through mutation or faulty processing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b003">3</xref>]. Moreover, several lines of evidence suggest that NMD is also used as a posttranscriptional mechanism of normal gene regulation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b004">4</xref>]. The NMD pathway employs a set of factors that are conserved amongst eukaryotes. Central to the NMD pathway is the Upf complex, which consists of the proteins Upf1, Upf2, and Upf3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b003">3</xref>]. The Upf complex interacts with the eukaryotic translation release factors, eRF3 and eRF1, and triggers NMD when translation termination takes place at a PTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b003">3</xref>]. In addition, the Smg proteins, which are conserved in metazoans, regulate Upf1 function by phosphorylation and dephosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b003">3</xref>].</p>
      <p>A fundamental question is how mRNAs with PTCs are distinguished from those with normal termination codons. Despite the conservation of core NMD factors, contrasting models have been proposed in mammalian cells as opposed to other eukaryotes. Evidence in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Saccharomyces cerevisiae</named-content> and in cell lines from <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Drosophila melanogaster</named-content> suggests that termination codons are recognized as PTCs when positioned too far upstream of the poly(A) tail [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b007">7</xref>]. This is thought to be a consequence of an impaired interaction between eRF3 at the terminating ribosome and factors associated with the normal 3′ UTR, including cytoplasmic poly(A)-binding protein (PABP) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b007">7</xref>], which on mRNAs with regular stop codons (proximal to the poly(A) tail) stimulates normal translation termination [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b008">8</xref>]. Consistent with this model for NMD, termed the “faux 3′ UTR” model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b007">7</xref>], 3′ UTRs of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> mRNAs are generally short, on average ∼100 and ∼330 nucleotides in length, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b010">10</xref>]. Interestingly, recent observations show evidence that cytoplasmic PABP is not required for the discrimination of normal termination codons from PTCs in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b011">11</xref>]. Thus, cytoplasmic PABP may function redundantly with other 3′ UTR–associated factors to antagonize NMD.</p>
      <p>3′ UTRs of human mRNAs are on average longer (∼750–800 nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b012">12</xref>]) than those of <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>, and current models for NMD in mammalian cells do not involve the length of the 3′ UTR. Rather, the exon junction complex (EJC), which is deposited 20–25 nucleotides upstream of mRNA exon-exon junctions after pre-mRNA splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b013">13</xref>], is thought to play a central role. A termination event more than ∼30 nucleotides upstream of one or more EJCs is thought to trigger NMD through EJC-mediated recruitment of the Upf complex [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b003">3</xref>]. This is consistent with observed direct interactions between EJC components and Upf3 proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b018">18</xref>]. However, the EJC plays no apparent role in NMD in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b019">19</xref>] or in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">Caenorhabditis elegans</named-content> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b020">20</xref>] and no evidence for the existence of an EJC has been reported in yeast. Nevertheless, a conceptually similar model to the EJC model was proposed earlier for NMD of the PGK1 mRNA in yeast, in which a “downstream sequence element” (DSE), when present downstream of a termination codon, promotes NMD through recruitment of the protein Hrp1p, which interacts with Upf proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b021">21</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b022">22</xref>].</p>
      <p>A fundamental difference between the faux 3′ UTR and the EJC/DSE models for NMD is that the EJC/DSE models propose that NMD-stimulating factors (the EJC and Hrp1p, respectively) trigger NMD when positioned downstream of a termination codon, whereas the faux 3′ UTR model postulates that NMD is caused instead by the absence of NMD-antagonizing factors, such as cytoplasmic PABP, which normally positively influence translation termination and mRNA stability. Here, we present evidence for a merged model for NMD in human cells, which likely can be extended to other eukaryotes. According to this model, PTC recognition is determined by a competition between 3′ UTR–associated factors, which stimulate (including the EJC) or antagonize (including cytoplasmic PABP) the recruitment of the Upf complex to the terminating ribosome. Our observations suggest that the fundamental principles of the NMD pathway are much more conserved between mammals and other eukaryotes than previously anticipated.</p>

        <title>3′ UTR Introns Are Not Sufficient for Triggering Human NMD</title>
        <p>The EJC model for human NMD postulates that any translation termination event taking place &gt;50–55 nucleotides upstream of an exon-exon junction should result in NMD. However, during our studies of the human NMD pathway, we observed that a β-globin mRNA, in which the adenovirus major late (AdML) intron was inserted into the 3′ UTR 175 nucleotides downstream of the normal β-globin mRNA translation termination codon, did not show enhanced mRNA decay as compared to the wild-type β-globin mRNA in human HeLa Tet-off cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">1</xref>B). Moreover, in contrast to a well-characterized β-globin NMD substrate, which contains a premature termination codon at position 39 (β39; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>C), the AdML intron containing β-globin mRNA is not stabilized when the central NMD factor hUpf1 is knocked down (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, middle panel and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg001">Figure S1</xref>) or when a point mutation causes translation termination to take place downstream of the inserted intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>A, bottom panel). Sequencing of cDNAs derived from the mRNAs in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>A revealed the expected splicing patterns (unpublished data). Thus, in contrast to the prediction from the EJC model for human NMD, the AdML intron is not sufficient for triggering NMD when positioned in the 3′ UTR of β-globin mRNA, even though the AdML intron has been previously demonstrated to recruit an EJC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b013">13</xref>].</p>

        <p>The observation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>A was surprising, because a β-globin mRNA in which the MINX-intron had been placed in the 3′ UTR was previously found to cause reduced mRNA steady-state levels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b023">23</xref>]. Therefore, to rule out the possibility that the observations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>A represent an unusual property of the specific mRNA reporter, we tested two other substrates. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>D and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">1</xref>E, insertion of the triosephosphate isomerase (TPI) mRNA intron 6 or the AdML intron, 140 or 149 nucleotides downstream of the termination codons of β-globin or TPI mRNAs, respectively, failed to cause hUpf1-dependent mRNA decay, despite the previously demonstrated ability of each of these introns to recruit an EJC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b013">13</xref>]. Sequencing of cDNAs derived from the tested mRNAs revealed the expected splicing patterns (unpublished data), although a minor fraction of the βTPIi6 mRNA fails to remove the TPI intron (see asterisk in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>D). We attempted to test the β-globin mRNA with the MINX-intron in the 3′ UTR, which was previously found to accumulate at reduced steady-state levels as compared to wild-type β-globin mRNA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b023">23</xref>] (construct generously provided by A. Kulozik and M. Hentze). However, the MINX intron (as well as a number of other introns tested in this study) failed to be spliced out of the β-globin mRNA 3′ UTR in the HeLa Tet-off cells used here (unpublished data). We conclude that a 3′ UTR intron is not sufficient to trigger NMD in human cells. This contradicts an EJC-centric model for human NMD.</p>

        <title>Extended 3′ UTRs Trigger Human NMD</title>
        <p>Our observation that 3′ UTR introns are not sufficient for triggering human NMD spurred us to test whether cytoplasmic PABP may antagonize NMD in human cells, as it does in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content> and <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">D. melanogaster</named-content>. We therefore first manipulated the position of the poly(A) tail relative to the termination codons of β-globin and TPI reporter mRNAs and tested the effect on mRNA decay.

Moreover, the introduction of single point mutations in the termination codons that results in termination on the same mRNAs in proximity (180–357 nucleotides upstream) of the poly(A) tail, results in mRNA stabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g002">Figure 2</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g002">2</xref>B and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg002">S2</xref>, bottom panels). Even though sequencing of cDNAs derived from the tested mRNAs revealed no cryptic splicing in the extended 3′ UTRs (unpublished data), depletion of the central EJC component eIF4AIII results in stabilization of the βGAP mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg003">Figure S3</xref>), possibly reflecting the ability of the EJCs in the β-globin mRNA open reading frame to stimulate translation as has been previously observed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b025">25</xref>]. Successive shortening of the 3′ UTR of the βGAP mRNA revealed that a 3′ UTR as short as 422 nucleotides can trigger NMD (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). This is surprising because a large fraction of human mRNAs contain 3′ UTRs longer than 422 nucleotides [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b012">12</xref>]. We conclude that artificially extended 3′ UTRs trigger NMD in human cells. This is consistent with recent reports in which steady-state levels of PTCs containing TPI, β-globin, and Ig-μ reporter mRNAs lacking 3′ UTR introns were measured [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b028">28</xref>], and with observations using unspliced Rous sarcoma virus RNAs in chicken cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b029">29</xref>].

        <title>An Intron-Less mRNA Can Undergo NMD</title>
        <p>Having observed that 3′ UTR introns are not required for NMD, we asked whether a completely intron-less mRNA can undergo NMD. It was observed previously that introduction of PTCs in the naturally intron-less Hsp70 and histone H2A mRNAs does not result in their decreased steady-state levels, which led to speculations that intron-less mRNAs are immune to NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b030">30</xref>]. However, it has been pointed out that wild-type Hsp70 and histone H2A mRNAs are both highly unstable and may thus not be further destabilized by a PTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b005">5</xref>]. We therefore tested the stability of three naturally occurring intron-less mRNAs (encoding eRF3b, SFN, and TBCC) and found that both wild-type and PTC containing versions of these mRNAs were unstable (∼100- to 150-min half-lives, unpublished data). Thus, mRNA instability may be a general feature of natural intron-less mRNAs. However, when the only intron in the Glutathione Peroxidase 1 (GPx1) mRNA is removed, introduction of a PTC triggers NMD, although not as efficiently as in the presence of the intron (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g002">Figure 2</xref>C, compare lower and upper panels). Thus, neither 3′ UTR introns nor internal introns are essential for human NMD. However, similarly to a previous report [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b030">30</xref>] we have not been able to identify a natural human intron-less mRNA for which NMD could be observed, perhaps due to the observed inherent instabilities of the tested mRNAs.</p>

        <title>Cytoplasmic PABP Antagonizes Human NMD</title>
        <p>To more directly test whether cytoplasmic PABP antagonizes NMD in human cells, we examined the effect of positioning cytoplasmic PABP in proximity of a PTC using two different approaches. First, as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">3</xref>B, when an MS2-PABPC1 fusion protein (PABPC1 is one of five human cytoplasmic PABPs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b031">31</xref>]) is artificially tethered downstream of a PTC in two different β-globin NMD reporter mRNAs, a partial rescue of NMD is observed. This rescue is due to tethered PABPC1, because similar levels of unfused PABPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) or MS2 coat protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">Figure 3</xref>A and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">3</xref>B) do not stabilize the mRNAs. Moreover, tethering of the nuclear poly(A)-binding protein PABPN1 does not rescue NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">Figure 3</xref>A) even though it is expressed at levels similar to MS2-PABPC1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). The efficiency of the rescue from NMD by tethered PABPC1 decreases as the MS2 binding sites are moved more distal to the PTC in the β-globin PTC-39 mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

        <title>A Subset of Naturally Occurring Long 3′ UTRs Can Antagonize NMD</title>
        <p>Our observations raise the question of whether naturally occurring mammalian mRNAs with long 3′ UTRs, which can be several kilobases in length, are normal targets of NMD or whether they have evolved mechanisms to evade the NMD pathway. We noted that mRNAs identified by microarray assays to be upregulated upon hUpf1 knockdown in HeLa cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b032">32</xref>] contain on average significantly longer 3′ UTRs than those mRNAs unaffected by hUpf1 knockdown (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). Moreover, the majority of these 3′ UTRs (75%) are longer than the ∼420 nucleotides observed here to trigger NMD in the βGAP reporter mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg004">Figures S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg007">S7</xref>). It is possible that at least a subset of these transcripts undergo NMD due to an increased distance between the termination codon and the poly(A) tail. Indeed, when the 1,342-nucleotide 3′ UTR of one of these mRNAs, encoding hSmg5, is replaced for the β-globin 3′ UTR (βSmg5), the chimeric mRNA undergoes NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g004">Figure 4</xref>, top two panels). Thus, the Smg5 3′ UTR stimulates NMD, and a subset of mRNAs may have evolved long 3′ UTRs to be regulated by the NMD pathway. However, numerous mRNAs with long 3′ UTRs are not upregulated upon hUpf1 knockdown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b032">32</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg007">Figure S7</xref>). When the 3′ UTRs from two such mRNAs, Cript1 and Tram1, were inserted into the β-globin mRNA, no NMD was observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g004">Figure 4</xref>, bottom panels). This is in sharp contrast to the observations using artificial long 3′ UTRs (compare to <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0060111-sg004">S4</xref>) and suggests that the ability of a subset of endogenous long 3′ UTRs to evade NMD is an acquired property (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

We therefore tested the effect of inserting the AdML intron into the 3′ UTR of an mRNA, which already undergoes NMD due to an extended 3′ UTR. Interestingly, insertion of the AdML intron downstream of the termination codon of βGAP mRNA results in enhanced mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g005">Figure 5</xref>; βGAP-AdML mRNA). This effect is only observed when the intron is positioned in the 3′ UTR, as insertion of the same intron upstream of the termination codon (without disrupting the open reading frame) does not enhance mRNA decay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g005">Figure 5</xref>; βAdML-GAP mRNA).

        <title>PABPC1 Can Out-Compete the Interaction between hUpf1 and eRF3 In Vitro</title>
        <p>How does cytoplasmic PABP antagonize NMD when positioned in proximity of the termination codon? Both cytoplasmic PABP and Upf1 have been previously observed to stimulate translation termination in yeast cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b034">34</xref>] and to associate with translation release factor eRF3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b035">35</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b040">40</xref>]. This raised the possibility that cytoplasmic PABP inhibits NMD by preventing Upf1 from interacting with eRF3 and the terminating ribosome. As seen in the co-immunoprecipitation (co-IP) assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref>A, endogenous hUpf1 and PABPC1 can both be observed in complex with eRF3 in RNase-treated HeLa cell extracts.

        <p>To test whether PABPC1 can antagonize the interaction between eRF3 and hUpf1 in vitro, we immunopurified transiently expressed epitope-tagged eRF3, PABPC1, and hUpf1 proteins from HEK 293T cells and tested the ability of hUpf1 to associate with eRF3 in the presence of increasing amounts of PABPC1. As seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, in contrast to the negative control protein hnRNP A1, increasing amounts of PABPC1 efficiently prevent the interaction between hUpf1 and eRF3, even when hUpf1 is present in 10- to 40-fold excess over PABPC1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref>B, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 4 and 7). Thus, PABPC1 can antagonize the interaction between hUpf1 and eRF3 in vitro. However, no reduction in the co-IP efficiency between hUpf1 and eRF3 was observed upon transient over-expression of FLAG-tagged PABPC1 in HeLa or HEK 293T cells (unpublished data). Thus, either exogenous PABPC1 failed to express at adequate levels to observe a competition in cells, or the relation between hUpf1, PABPC1, and eRF3 is more complex in cells than it is in vitro.</p>
        <p>To test whether amino acid residues of eRF3, which are important for cytoplasmic PABP interaction, are also important for the interaction with hUpf1, we constructed a eRF3 protein (eRF3 KAKA) mutated in four N-terminal residues that are conserved between cytoplasmic PABP-binding proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b038">38</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b043">43</xref>]. As seen in the co-IP assays in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, the exogenously expressed eRF3 KAKA mutant protein is equally impaired in interaction with PABPC1 and hUpf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref>C, compare lanes 5 and 6 with lanes 2 and 3). As a control, the mutant eRF3 KAKA protein associates with eRF1 with similar affinity as wild-type eRF3, suggesting that these mutations do not cause gross structural alterations, although local changes cannot be ruled out. Thus, hUpf1 and PABPC1 interact with a similar, though not necessarily overlapping region of eRF3. The ability of PABPC1 to antagonize the association between hUpf1 and eRF3 in vitro could therefore be a result of a direct competition for eRF3 binding, or of a local structural alteration of eRF3 upon PABPC1 binding, which prevents hUpf1 association.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Previous contrasting models for PTC-recognition in NMD invoke either 3′ UTR–associated factors that stimulate NMD, the EJC in human cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b044">44</xref>], and DSE-binding proteins in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b021">21</xref>], or factors that stimulate normal translation termination and antagonize NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b045">45</xref>]. Our observations, together with the observations in the paper by Eberle et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b046">46</xref>], are consistent with a unified model for human NMD, in which the balance between NMD-antagonizing (such as PABPC1) and NMD-stimulating (such as the EJC) factor(s) that are associated with the mRNA 3′ UTR, determines whether termination is considered normal or premature (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>A). According to this model, a translation termination event proximal to cytoplasmic PABP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">Figure 3</xref>), or other unknown NMD-antagonizing factors, precludes the interaction of hUpf1 with eRF3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref>C) and thus prohibits NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, top). By contrast, if hUpf1 associates with eRF3, NMD ensues (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, bottom). This occurs when cytoplasmic PABP, or other inhibitory factors, are spatially distant from the termination event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g002">Figure 2</xref>) and is enhanced when a splicing event downstream of a termination codon results in deposition of an EJC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g005">Figure 5</xref>), which provides higher affinity for the hUpf complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>A, bottom). However, an exon-exon junction in the 3′ UTR is not sufficient for NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g001">Figure 1</xref>). This suggests that a proximal cytoplasmic PABP is dominant over 3′ UTR exon-exon junctions, which is consistent with the observation that the affinity of PABPC1 for eRF3 appears to be several orders of magnitude higher than that of hUpf1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref> and unpublished data). However, while introns are observed to only stimulate NMD of the substrates tested in this study, it cannot be ruled out that a subset of human mRNAs requires downstream introns for NMD. Previous experiments, in which EJC or hUpf proteins tethered to an mRNA 3′ UTR were observed to trigger NMD, may have been assisted by the extended 3′ UTRs resulting from insertion of multiple tethering sites and/or by the recruitment of multiple NMD-promoting factors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b049">49</xref>]. The model depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>A may be extended to eukaryotes other than mammals and is consistent with the observation in <italic>Drosophila</italic> S2 cells that the decay of an NMD reporter mRNA is inhibited upon cytoplasmic PABP depletion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b005">5</xref>]. In this case it is predicted that a large subset of normally stable endogenous mRNAs become NMD substrates, thus out-titrating the NMD pathway.</p>

      <p>How does cytoplasmic PABP antagonize NMD? While PABPC1 can out-compete the association of hUpf1 with eRF3 in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g006">Figure 6</xref>B), a more complex relationship may exist between these proteins in the cell. For example, we failed to observe exogenously expressed PABPC1 out-compete the co-IP of endogenous hUpf1 with eRF3 (unpublished data). Moreover, in <named-content content-type="genus-species" xlink:type="simple">S. cerevisiae</named-content>, cytoplasmic PABP truncated of its C-terminal eRF3-interaction region was capable of suppressing NMD when tethered in proximity of a PTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b007">7</xref>]. However, we found no loss of eRF3-association of a similarly truncated PABPC1 in co-IP assays between exogenously expressed human proteins (unpublished data), suggesting that eRF3 may form a complex with PABPC1 through additional regions. Understanding the specific mechanism by which NMD is antagonized by cytoplasmic PABP, and likely other 3′ UTR–associated factors, is an important goal for future studies and could involve both direct competition with the Upf complex as well as modulation of the translation termination event that excludes Upf complex recruitment in a more indirect manner. Another open question is how the interplay between eRF3, PABP, and the Upf complex influences events downstream of translation termination. Interestingly, it was previously observed that the interaction between eRF3 and cytoplasmic PABP stimulates mRNA deadenylation in yeast [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b050">50</xref>], and that deadenylation can be an early step in NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b051">51</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b053">53</xref>]. Clearly, a great deal remains to be learned about the relationship between eRF3, the Upf complex, and cytoplasmic PABP and how it controls the fates of mRNAs after translation termination.</p>
      <p>It is likely that 3′ UTR–associated factors (indicated by a question mark in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>A) other than cytoplasmic PABP can antagonize NMD. This hypothesis is consistent with the observation that in yeast cells, cytoplasmic PABP is not required for discriminating tested NMD substrates from their normal counterparts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b011">11</xref>]. An excellent candidate for such an activity is the yeast protein Pub1p, which has been identified as a factor that binds downstream of upstream open reading frames (uORFs) in GCN4 and YAP1 mRNAs to prevent NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b054">54</xref>]. It is possible that Pub1p and factors with similar activities are found in a subset of normal 3′ UTRs. It remains to be tested whether Pub1p acts on the terminating ribosome in a manner similar to cytoplasmic PABP. Similarly, factors other than the EJC could provide an enhanced affinity for the Upf complex and stimulate NMD. For example, the protein Hrp1p appears to serve such a role in the yeast PGK1 NMD substrate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b021">21</xref>]. Moreover, human Staufen1 and histone mRNA stem loop binding protein have been shown to recruit hUpf1 to the 3′ UTR of specific mRNAs to trigger NMD-like mRNA decay [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b056">56</xref>]. Thus, our observations suggest that the NMD pathway is much more conserved between mammals and other eukaryotes than previously appreciated. Nevertheless, there is evidence that differences exist between yeast and mammalian cells as to which round of translation can stimulate NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b057">57</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b059">59</xref>].</p>
      <p>Our observations suggest that while artificial long 3′ UTRs trigger NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g002">Figure 2</xref>), a subset of mRNAs containing long 3′ UTRs have evolved mechanisms to evade NMD (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Future studies should reveal the mechanism by which this is accomplished. This could conceivably be achieved by (i) induced looping of the 3′ UTR, thus placing the poly(A) tail and cytoplasmic PABP in close spatial proximity to the translation termination event (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, top), or (ii) by recruitment of factors that antagonize NMD (such as PABPC1 or Pub1p) to the 3′ UTR in proximity to the termination codon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g007">Figure 7</xref>B, bottom). The observation that cytoplasmic PABP alleviates NMD when placed in the vicinity of a PTC (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0060111-g003">Figure 3</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b046">46</xref>] and the finding in the paper by Eberle et al. that artificially induced 3′ UTR looping rescues reporter mRNAs with extended 3′ UTRs from NMD [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b046">46</xref>], provides proof-of-principle evidence for each of these models. The mechanism by which specific mRNAs evade the NMD pathway is an important subject for future investigation and is likely to vary between individual mRNAs.</p>
      <p>After the submission of this paper, we have become aware of two other studies reporting that cytoplasmic PABP antagonizes human NMD when placed in proximity to a PTC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b061">61</xref>].</p>

        <title>Plasmid constructs.</title>
        <p>All plasmid sequences are available upon request. Plasmids expressing different β-globin reporter mRNAs were derived from the pcTET2-βwt plasmid that was constructed by inserting the human β-globin gene between HindIII and ApaI sites of a pcDNA3-based plasmid containing six copies of the Tet-operator sequences upstream of the TATA box. For extended 3′ UTR constructs, parts of the GAPDH mRNA coding sequence and the entire GAPDH 3′ UTR (pcTET2-βGAP) or the GFP ORF (pcTET2-βGFP) were inserted between NotI and XbaI sites of the pcTET2-βwt plasmid, thus replacing the β-globin 3′ UTR. The β-globin stop codon was mutated to UAC by site-directed mutagenesis to generate pcTET2-βGAP-UAC and pcTET2-βGFP-UAC. Plasmids expressing βGAP-UAC-696, βGAP-UAC-485, and βGAP-UAC-422 mRNAs were generated by site-directed mutagenesis of pcTET2-βGAP-UAC to introduce a stop codon (UAA) in the GAPDH sequence, respectively, 696, 485, or 422 nucleotides upstream of the polyadenylation site. The plasmid expressing βwt mRNA was described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b047">47</xref>]. To construct plasmids expressing β39–2xMS2-Ex2, β39–2xMS2-Ex3, and β39–2xMS2-3UTR, the 2xMS2 cassette from the previously described plasmid pcβ-2bs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b047">47</xref>] was inserted into the BamHI, EcoRI, or NotI sites, respectively, of the pPC-β39 plasmid described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b062">62</xref>]. A stretch of A<sub>30</sub> (pPC-β39-A<sub>30</sub>) or N<sub>30</sub> (pPC-β39-N<sub>30</sub>) was inserted into the BamHI site of pPC-β39 plasmid using annealed DNA oligos. Similarly, A<sub>30</sub> (pcTET2-βGAP-A<sub>30</sub>) or N<sub>30</sub> (pcTET2-βGAP-N<sub>30</sub>) was inserted into the XbaI site of the pcTET2-βGAP plasmid. To construct the pcTET2-βGAP-4xMS2 plasmid, four MS2 binding sites were amplified from a previously described plasmid pcβ-4bs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b047">47</xref>] and inserted into the XbaI site of pcTET2-βGAP. Plasmids expressing βAdML, βAdML-UAC, and βTPIi6 mRNAs were constructed by cloning the AdML intron or TPI intron 6 (TPIi6) and flanking exon sequences into the XbaI site in pcTET2-βwt or pcTET2-βwt-UAC plasmids. βGAP-AdML and βAdML-GAP mRNA– expressing plasmids were constructed by inserting the same AdML intron into XbaI and EcoRI sites, respectively, in the pcTET2-βwtGAP plasmid. Plasmids expressing chimeric β-globin mRNAs with 3′ UTRs from Smg5, Cript1, and Tram1 genes, the respective 3′ UTRs, were cloned into the NotI-XbaI sites of pcTET2-βwt.</p>
        <p>Plasmids expressing TPI reporter mRNAs were constructed by inserting the entire human TPI gene between HindIII and XbaI sites of the pcTET2 plasmid. A NotI site was inserted into exon 6 (in a manner that preserved the encoded protein) by site-directed mutagenesis. Codon 189 was mutated to TGA using site-directed mutagenesis to generate pcTET2-TPI-189. To remove intron 6, a NotI-XbaI fragment containing exon6-intron6-exon7 was replaced by the same region amplified from TPI cDNA, to generate pcTET2-TPIΔi6–189. To extend the TPI 3′ UTR, a fragment containing part of the GAPDH coding region and 3′ UTR was inserted into the NotI site of pcTET2-TPIΔi6–189 to generate pcTET2-TPIΔi6–189-GAP, or into the NotI site of pcTET2-TPIΔi6 to give rise to pcTET2-TPIΔi6-GAP. TPI-AdML mRNA–expressing plasmid was constructed by inserting the AdML intron and flanking exonic sequences into the XbaI site of pcTET2-TPI.</p>
        <p>The plasmid expressing intron-containing GPx1 mRNA with a PTC (pPC-GPx1-UAA) was described earlier [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0060111-b018">18</xref>]. GPx1 cDNA (HindIII-XbaI) sequence replaced the intron-containing sequence in pPC-GPx1Δi-UAA.</p>

          <p>mRNA decay assays showing decay rates of TPI mRNAs with different length 3′ UTRs, due to insertion of a fragment of GAPDH mRNA (see schematics below), in human HeLa Tet-off cells co-expressing siRNAs targeting hUpf1 or Luciferase (Luc; as a control) as indicated. Constitutively expressed βwt mRNA was used as an internal control for quantification. Numbers indicated above the panels indicate time after transcriptional repression. Schematics on the bottom show the used construct with TPI exons indicated as light-gray bars (not to scale), introns as lines, and GAPDH sequences as dark-gray bars. PTC(189) refers to a PTC at codon 189. Numbers on the right indicate mRNA half-lives (t<sub>1/2</sub>; in minutes) calculated from the shown experiment with the average fold increase and standard deviation over the half-life of TPI-189Δi6-GAP mRNA in the presence of Luc siRNA calculated from three or more experiments given in parentheses below.</p>
