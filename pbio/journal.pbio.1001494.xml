        <p>During the development of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> nervous system, the developmentally regulated Hedgehog pathway, together with a series of temporal transcription factors, schedules the end of neurogenesis.</p>
      </abstract>
      <abstract>
        <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic> postembryonic neuroblasts, transition in gene expression programs of a cascade of transcription factors (also known as the temporal series) acts together with the asymmetric division machinery to generate diverse neurons with distinct identities and regulate the end of neuroblast proliferation. However, the underlying mechanism of how this “temporal series” acts during development remains unclear. Here, we show that Hh signaling in the postembryonic brain is temporally regulated; excess (earlier onset of) Hh signaling causes premature neuroblast cell cycle exit and under-proliferation, whereas loss of Hh signaling causes delayed cell cycle exit and excess proliferation. Moreover, the Hh pathway functions downstream of Castor but upstream of Grainyhead, two components of the temporal series, to schedule neuroblast cell cycle exit. Interestingly, <italic>hh</italic> is likely a target of Castor. Hence, Hh signaling provides a link between the temporal series and the asymmetric division machinery in scheduling the end of neurogenesis.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>In almost all metazoans, neurons are produced by a group of neural stem cells/progenitors in a precise temporal manner, which is important for generating a functional nervous system. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, this “timing” mechanism is mainly governed by the sequential switching of transcription factors in neural stem cells called neuroblasts, such that neuronal fate is associated with its birth order. These temporal factors also coordinate the termination of neuroblast division towards the end of neurogenesis. In this study, we show that Hedgehog (Hh) signaling also regulates the division rate of neuroblasts during their proliferative phase at larval stage, as well as the cessation of proliferation at early pupal stage. Excessive Hh signaling causes premature neuroblast cell cycle exit and early termination of neurogenesis, while loss of Hh signaling results in prolonged proliferation of neuroblasts beyond its physiological window. We also find that Hh signaling acts in concert with the temporal transcription factors, and is itself regulated by these factors. We hypothesize that this mode of interaction (temporal transcription factors with developmentally regulated signals like Hh) during neurogenesis could be widely conserved in other organisms.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Both intrinsic and extrinsic mechanisms are deployed during development to generate cellular diversity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Hawkins1">[1]</xref>. Extrinsic mechanisms involve cell-cell communication, while intrinsic mechanisms ensure preferential segregation of cell fate determinants into one of the two daughter cells upon completion of cell division. The latter is well exemplified during <italic>Drosophila</italic> neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Doe1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Chia1">[5]</xref>. <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryonic neuroblasts (NBs) delaminate from the neuroepithelium and these neural stem cells undergo repeated self-renewing asymmetric divisions. Each division generates a larger daughter that retains NB identity and a smaller daughter, ganglion mother cell (GMC), that normally divides one more time to produce two neurons/glia depending on lineage specificity. At the end of embryogenesis, most NBs enter a proliferative quiescent stage and subsequently resume mitotic activity during early larval stages. These larval NBs, like their embryonic counterparts, undergo extensively repeated divisions to self-renew and at the same time produce postmitotic neurons/glia to build a functional nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Truman1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Ito1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>During NB divisions, cell fate determinants including Numb, Prospero (Pros), and Brain tumor (Brat) are asymmetrically localised onto one side of the NB cortex (referred to as the basal cortex) via two coiled-coil adaptor proteins, Partner of Numb (Pon, the adaptor for Numb) and Miranda (Mira, the adaptor for Pros and Brat), and are subsequently segregated into the small GMC daughter at the end of NB divisions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Rhyu1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Shen1">[18]</xref>. The basal localization and segregation of these cell fate determinants into GMCs are controlled by two evolutionarily conserved protein complexes: the Bazooka (Baz, the fly Par-3 homolog)/DmPar6/DaPKC (atypical protein kinase C) complex and the Partner of Inscuteable (Pins)/Gαi complex, which localize on the opposite side of the cortex (referred to as the apical side) and are bridged together to form a larger protein complex via Inscuteable (Insc) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Cai1">[19]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Schaefer2">[27]</xref>. Pros is a homeodomain-containing transcriptional factor and acts as a binary switch between self-renewal and differentiation during neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Choksi1">[28]</xref>. It suppresses genes required for NB self-renewal; but its activity is also required to activate genes necessary for GMC differentiation. Hence mis-expression of Pros in the NBs leads to their loss via precocious differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Bayraktar1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Cabernard1">[30]</xref>, while in the absence of Pros, GMCs fail to differentiate, express NB markers, and exhibit increased proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Choksi1">[28]</xref>. Thus, an imperative task of NB asymmetric division is to segregate Pros exclusively into GMCs. In embryonic NBs, Pros and Mira are transiently localized onto the apical cortex during late interphase and early prophase prior to their basal localizations. The localization of Pros and Mira is initiated by the DaPKC-mediated direct phosphorylation on Mira, which results in the displacement of Mira from the apical cortex and subsequently, via an unidentified mechanism, localize onto the basal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Atwood1">[31]</xref>. Recently, the conserved protein phosphatase (protein phosphatase 4 [PP4]) complex was identified as an essential mediator for the localization of Pros and Mira during both interphase and mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-SousaNunes1">[32]</xref>. In the absence of PP4 activity, Pros and Mira are mislocalized to the nucleus during interphase and cytoplasm during mitosis. Consistent with a role of Pros in suppressing NB self-renewal genes, PP4 mutant NBs exhibit reduced proliferation.</p>
      <p>Repeated segregation of the same sets of cell fate determinants does not fully explain how extensive cellular diversity can be generated from NB lineages. The generation of diverse progeny from a single NB is also regulated by another NB intrinsic mechanism such that each NB will undergo a specific number of divisions in a defined temporal and spatial context to generate a lineage with distinct neuronal or glial fates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange1">[33]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Pearson1">[34]</xref>. During embryonic neurogenesis, this “timing” mechanism (or temporal series/mechanism) is controlled by sequential expression of a series of transcription factors in the NBs: Hunchback (Hb)→Krupple (Kr)→POU homeodomain protein 1/2 (Pdm)→Castor (Cas)→Grainyhead (Grh), although some NB lineages only express a subset of this series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Kambadur1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Isshiki1">[37]</xref>. Grh is the last transcription factor expressed in embryonic NBs and its expression persists in the postembryonic NBs throughout the larval stage, presumably to maintain mitotic activity of the NB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Almeida1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Prokop1">[41]</xref>. The linearity and robustness of the temporal series involves an intricate network of transcriptional regulation encompassing additional players, such as Seven-up (Svp) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Kambadur1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Isshiki1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Kanai1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Baumgardt1">[43]</xref>. Temporal series continues during the larval stage with the redeployment of embryonic temporal regulators Cas and Svp to achieve two major transitions in NB lineages: (1) the neuronal identity switch from larger Chinmo<sup>+</sup>Br-C<sup>−</sup> early-born neurons to smaller Chinmo<sup>−</sup>Br-C<sup>+</sup> late-born neurons at L2 stage, and (2) termination of NB proliferation (cell cycle exit) at pupal stage, which is concomitant with cytoplasmic localization of Mira and a burst of nuclear Pros during early mitosis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. Furthermore, an early burst of Pros is sufficient to trigger cell cycle exit in type I NBs and cessation of neurogenesis in larvae. Therefore nuclear Pros may act as the physiological means for promoting NB cell cycle exit and cessation of neurogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. However Cas is transiently expressed during early larval development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. It is unclear how this transient Cas expression acts to trigger a later burst of nuclear Pros in pupae to promote cell cycle exit. It is also unclear how the temporal mechanism is coupled with the asymmetric division mechanism to generate a functional nervous system.</p>
      <p>The Hedgehog (Hh) pathway is repeatedly deployed throughout animal development to mediate diverse functions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Ingham1">[45]</xref>. The core machinery of Hh signalling is evolutionarily conserved from flies to humans, although there is clear divergence in its mechanistic details <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Cohen1">[46]</xref>. In general, Hh ligands are synthesized as precursor molecules that undergo autocatalytic cleavage to yield an N-terminal fragment with a cholesterol moiety tethered to its C-terminal end before its secretion from producing cells. The receptor for Hh is a 12-pass transmembrane protein, Patched (Ptc), which, in the absence of Hh, inhibits the activity of a second downstream effector molecule, Smoothened (Smo). Smo is a seven-pass transmembrane protein that bears resemblance to the mammalian G-protein coupled receptor (GPCR) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Ogden1">[47]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Cheng1">[48]</xref>. The ultimate effector of Hh signalling pathway is the transcription factor Cubitus interruptus (Ci), which can act as a full length transcriptional activator, Ci-155, or a proteolytically cleaved transcriptional repressor, Ci-75 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-AzaBlanc1">[49]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Chen1">[50]</xref>. In the absence of Hh ligand, Smo activity is suppressed by Ptc and, consequently, Ci is phosphorylated and is processed into the repressor form, Ci-75. The binding of Hh to its receptor inhibits Ptc and alleviates its inhibition of Smo, resulting in the stabilization and phosphorylation of Smo C-terminal tail <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Zheng1">[51]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Zhang1">[53]</xref>, and subsequently stabilization of the Ci activator form, Ci-155. In <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryos, Hh signaling is implicated in the specification of a subset of NBs in a spatial pattern. Furthermore, the Hh pathway also functions to reactivate NBs from their quiescent stage during early larval stages <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Park1">[54]</xref>. However, its role, if any, after NB reactivation is unknown.</p>
      <p>In this study, we investigate the function of Hh signaling during the development of <italic>Drosophila</italic> postembryonic brain. We show that <italic>hh</italic> expression is temporally regulated in the postembryonic larval brain and Hh signaling promotes NB cell cycle exit in the early pupae, possibly by mediating nuclear localization of Pros. Earlier (excess) activation of Hh signaling results in defective Pros localization, and leads to under-proliferation and premature cell cycle exit, whereas loss of Hh signaling causes delayed NB cell cycle exit and excess proliferation. Hh expression in postembryonic larval brain depends on an earlier pulse of expression of a component of the NB temporal series, Cas. Hh signaling in NBs in turn shuts down the expression of Grh, the terminal component of the NB temporal series required for the mitotic activity of larval NBs. Hence the timely exit of NBs from the cell cycle depends on the intricate interplay between Hh signaling, components of the NB temporal series (<italic>cas</italic>, <italic>grh</italic>) as well as Pros, a component of the NB asymmetric division machinery.</p>

        <title>Hedgehog Signaling Restricts Proliferation of NBs in the Central Brain</title>
        <p>Using the mosaic analysis of a repressible marker (MARCM) system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Lee2">[55]</xref> to screen for potential signaling pathways required for asymmetric division of type I NBs in the central brain, we found that components of the Hh signaling pathway were involved in regulating aspects of asymmetric division, as well as the proliferative capacity of NBs. To examine the effects of compromised Hh signaling in the central brain, we generated homozygous clones of a mutant allele of <italic>smo</italic>, <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic>, which has a substitution mutation in the Cys rich domain of the extracellular N-terminal domain and fails to transduce downstream signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Nakano1">[56]</xref>. Conversely, <italic>hh</italic> gain-of-function clones were produced using a loss-of-function allele, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic>, which fails to repress Smo function and results in constitutive Hh signal activation, even in the absence of the Hh ligand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Chen2">[57]</xref>. In wild-type (wt) animals, Baz/Par6/aPKC and Insc/Pins/Gαi proteins form a complex and localize on the apical cortex of dividing NBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s001">S1C</xref>), and these apical proteins exhibited largely normal localization in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> and <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> mutant NBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s001">Figure S1E</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s001">S1G, S1I</xref>–S1K, and unpublished data). Numb and its adaptor Pon were correctly localized on the basal cortex in all <italic>wt</italic>, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic>, and <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> mutant NBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s001">Figure S1D, S1H, S1L</xref>, and unpublished data). While Mira/Pros complex was localized to the basal cortex in both <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> mutant NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figures 1D, 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">2D, 2F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s001">S1C, S1K</xref>); however, both Mira and Pros were largely delocalized and showed cytoplasmic accumulation in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> mutant NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figures 1E</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s001">S1G</xref>).

        <p>In addition to these asymmetry defects, we also observed that both <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> and <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> mutant NBs exhibited defective proliferation compared to <italic>wt</italic> NBs. At 96 h after larval hatching (ALH), a typical <italic>wt</italic> type I NB clone induced at 24 h ALH (soon after NB reactivation) contained 40.1±11.7 cells (<italic>n</italic> = 19). However, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones were smaller than their <italic>wt</italic> counterparts and contained 26.9±9.8 cells (<italic>n</italic> = 29, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001), whereas <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> produced noticeably larger clones with 50.4±20.5 cells (<italic>n</italic> = 24, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0283) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figures 1A–1F′</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">2O</xref>). Moreover, most of the <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs appeared to be arrested in interphase based on the appearance of diffused DNA with markedly reduced cortical Mira (93.3%, <italic>n</italic> = 45), whereas the surrounding heterozygous interphase NBs displayed strong cortical Mira (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1B and 1G</xref>). To further confirm that the clone size difference in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> and <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> mutants was a consequence of alteration in NB proliferative capacity, we measured the mitotic index using phospho-histone H3 (PH3) as a mitotic marker. Indeed, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs were significantly less mitotically active than their <italic>wt</italic> counterparts, whereas a higher proportion of <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> NBs were engaged in mitosis at all time points examined (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). We also noted that the increase in mitotic index in <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> NBs was most likely associated with inactivation of Hh signaling as NB clones mutant for the <italic>hh</italic> null allele, <italic>hh<sup>AC</sup></italic>, were equally mitotically active (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1H</xref>). This phenotype, together with an enlarged <italic>hh<sup>AC</sup></italic> clone size (49.4±19.3 cells; <italic>n</italic> = 33, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0177; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s004">Figure S4A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s004">S4C</xref>), indicated that Hh functions in a lineage confined manner to restrict the proliferation of the NBs in the central brain (also see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>
        <p>One drawback of using PH3 as a proliferative marker is that its index does not distinguish between alteration in the cell cycle time and proliferative capability of the marked cells. Hence, we conducted a 5-bromo-2′-deoxyuridine (BrdU) labeling assay to investigate the propensity of the NBs to undergo cell cycle progression at around 90 h ALH. By allowing 4 h of BrdU nucleoside analogue incorporation, we found that all the <italic>wt</italic> NBs and 9.0±2.7 of progeny (<italic>n</italic> = 33) had BrdU labeling in the nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). In contrast, about half of the <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> mutant NBs (55.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 34) were devoid of BrdU labeling while most of the rest that managed to incorporate BrdU showed fairly weak signal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1J</xref>). In addition, significantly fewer progeny of <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> mutant NBs (2.7±2.5, <italic>n</italic> = 34, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) had BrdU labeling compared to their <italic>wt</italic> counterparts. This observation confirms that <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> mutant NBs were not actively proliferating. Conversely, all <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones comprised a single BrdU-labeled NB, along with an increased number of progeny that harbored nuclei BrdU (11.4±2.5, <italic>n</italic> = 41, <italic>p</italic> = 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1K</xref>), consistent with a higher mitotic index of <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> NBs. Collectively, these data showed that ectopic Hh signal activation resulted in reduction in NB proliferation, while defect in Hh signaling increased the proliferative capability/rate of the NBs.</p>

        <title>Canonical Hh Signaling Controls NB Proliferation but Not Neuronal Differentiation</title>
        <p>In order to understand the mechanism that underlies changes in NB proliferation, we sought to examine whether there is any alteration to NB and neuronal fates due to the loss and gain of Hh signaling using molecular markers Deadpan (Dpn), Pros, and Elav. In <italic>wt</italic>, all the NB clones examined contained a single large NB that expresses nuclear Dpn (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). The newborn GMC was transiently Dpn-positive due to perdurance of the protein after division. In contrast, Dpn expression was severely reduced in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2B</xref>), while <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> NBs continued to express Dpn as normal (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> NB clones, despite having a larger clone size and higher mitotic index than <italic>wt</italic>, did not exhibit supernumerary NB-like cells as seen in <italic>pros</italic> or <italic>brat</italic> mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Lee1">[10]</xref>. In <italic>wt</italic> and <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> NBs, Pros is under our detection threshold during interphase, but accumulates on the basal side of the NBs during mitosis, while in GMCs and neurons, Pros is nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2D and 2F</xref>). Notably, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs often exhibited nuclear Pros during interphase and cytoplasmic enrichment of Pros during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and unpublished data). Since it had been shown recently that Pros-dependent NB cell cycle exit in early pupae may depend on nuclear localization of Pros during interphase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>, our observations suggested that the reduced proliferation in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones may be an indication of premature NB cell cycle exit. Indeed, ectopic <italic>pros</italic> expression during larval stage promoted premature NB cell cycle exit with concomitant down-regulation of NB marker Dpn and delocalization of Mira as observed in <italic>ptc</italic> mutant NBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s002">Figure S2A and S2B</xref>).</p>
        <p>To understand if GMC division and neuronal differentiation were affected, we examined the neuronal marker Elav. In <italic>wt</italic> clones, all of the cells expressed Elav, except for the large Dpn-positive NB and three to five Dpn-negative GMCs (4.4±0.9 cells per clone, <italic>n</italic> = 23) adjacent to it (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2G and 2O</xref>). In contrast, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones had very few Elav-negative GMC-like cells (1.8±1.2 cells per clone, <italic>n</italic> = 53) compared to the <italic>wt</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2H and 2O</xref>). This is consistent with the <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs being less mitotically active. However, <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones often contained four to 15 GMC-like cells (6.7±2.6 cells per clone, <italic>n</italic> = 25), which were Elav-negative and in direct contact with, or at close proximity to the NB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2I and 2O</xref>). There were two possible explanations for this GMC-like pool expansion: (1) an increase in NB division rate (which we confirmed with live imaging, see below) leading to accumulation of GMCs or; (2) some GMCs remained mitotically active after division and did not differentiate. Our data favored the first possibility as we failed to detect any GMC clones comprising of more than two cells (<italic>n</italic>&gt;50), suggesting that the GMCs did not undergo extra divisions. Furthermore, differentiation was not arrested in <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones as all the mutant cells expressed Elav when examined at adulthood (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). These results showed that Hh signaling plays a key role in controlling NB proliferation but does not block differentiation in type I NB lineages. Expectantly, <italic>hh<sup>AC</sup></italic> clones also contained ectopic GMC-like cells (8.1±1.9 cells, <italic>n</italic> = 12), again reinforcing the view that the diffusion of Hh ligand is restricted within a single lineage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>
        <p>While type I NBs generate GMCs that undergo terminal divisions to produce two neurons/glia, type II NBs generate trans-amplifying GMCs that undergo multiple rounds of asymmetric divisions to generate many neurons/glia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Bowman1">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Bello2">[60]</xref>. Hh signaling appears to play a similar role in type II NBs. In <italic>wt</italic>, each type II NB clone contains 96.8±31.1 cells (<italic>n</italic> = 21; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2O</xref>). <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones were smaller and contained only 61.7±29.9 cells (<italic>n</italic> = 19; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2O</xref>), while <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> mutant exhibited larger clones with 138.6±48.6 cells (<italic>n</italic> = 16; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2O</xref>). Together, these data suggest that Hh signaling is likely utilized as a common mechanism in regulating NB proliferation in the larval brain.</p>
        <p>To assess whether Hh signaling exerts its effect on NBs via the canonical pathway, we examined NB proliferation in <italic>ci</italic> clones. When Ci function was compromised in <italic>ci<sup>94</sup></italic> mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Methot1">[61]</xref>, NB clones exhibited a GMC-like pool expansion phenotype similar to <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2J–2L</xref>), albeit at a lower frequency (20.0%, <italic>n</italic> = 15). Pros localization was largely unaffected in both NBs and GMCs/neurons within <italic>ci<sup>94</sup></italic> clones, similar to those observed in <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2M</xref>). In contrast, NB clones expressing a constitutively active form of <italic>ci</italic>, <italic>ci<sup>Nc5m5m</sup></italic>, contained fewer Elav-negative GMC-like cells (2.1±1.1 cells per clone, <italic>n</italic> = 15) similar to <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2N</xref>). Moreover, ectopic Hh signaling induced by over-expressing a constitutively active form of <italic>ci</italic>, <italic>ci<sup>5m5m</sup></italic>, or <italic>smo</italic>, <italic>smo<sup>RA1234</sup></italic>, could also lead to aberrant nuclear Pros localization in the NB, but at a lower phenotypic penetrance than <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s005">Figure S5</xref> and unpublished data). Incidentally, removing one copy of <italic>smo</italic> in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> background (<italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup>, smo<sup>3/+</sup></italic>) largely suppressed NB proliferation defects as these clones typically consisted of 4.1±1.1 GMC-like cells per clone (<italic>n</italic> = 25), a number that was comparable to that in <italic>wt</italic> clones (4.4±0.9 cells; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s003">Figure S3B</xref>). Furthermore, these NBs exhibited strong Mira crescent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s003">Figure S3C</xref>; compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Similarly, Pros localization defect was largely rescued as normal crescent could be observed in all mitotic NBs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s003">Figure S3D</xref>, compared with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). These data indicate that a canonical Hh signaling cascade acts to control proliferation in NB lineages.</p>

        <title>Hh Signaling Promotes Cell Cycle Progression of Postembryonic NBs</title>
        <p>We next address the direct involvement of Hh signaling in regulating NB division rate by live imaging NBs in various genetic backgrounds.

However, the cell cycle lengths of <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> NBs were shorter than their <italic>wt</italic> counterparts at 72 h and 96 h ALH, clocking 76.4±21.8 min (<italic>n</italic> = 11) and 118.9±24.0 min (<italic>n</italic> = 9), respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g003">Figure 3C and 3P</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s015">Video S2</xref>). Conversely, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs significantly extended their cell cycle length at 48 h and 72 h ALH, averaging 183.3±28.4 min (<italic>n</italic> = 3), and 191.4±34.5 min (<italic>n</italic> = 7) respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g003">Figure 3B and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s016">Video S3</xref>). In agreement with the low mitotic index at 96 h ALH in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs, no dividing NB was observed despite many attempts.

Such delay in cell cycle exit could be largely reverted by expressing <italic>ptc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> in the <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> mutant background (E–E′). (F–G′) <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> and <italic>svp<sup>1</sup></italic> clone had increased numbers of Dpn-negative, Elav-negative, GMC-like cells at 96 h ALH (Dpn in red, Elav in blue; arrows, in focus; and arrowhead, out of focal plane). (H–I′) This phenotype of <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> clones can be largely suppressed by the introduction of <italic>ptc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (H–H′) or <italic>PP4-19C<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> (I–I′).

        <p>Supporting the notion that Hh signaling is likely to exert an effect on NB cell cycle progression, we found that <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs down-regulated cyclin E (CycE) prematurely at 96 h ALH compared to <italic>wt</italic> NBs that retained high level of CycE expression in the nucleus (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s007">Figure S7A and S7B</xref>).

        <title>An Early Transient Pulse of Cas Expression Is Required for the Later <italic>hh</italic> Expression</title>
        <p>Is Hh signaling temporally regulated during NB development? Using RNA in situ hybridization against an intronic region of <italic>hh</italic>, which detected nascent nuclear transcripts, we first detected <italic>hh</italic> transcripts in late L2/early L3 larval stages and its expression level strongly increased in late L3 stage brains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5A and 5B</xref>) (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> for staging of larvae). Labeling of a single NB lineage showed that <italic>hh</italic> transcripts were expressed in the nuclei of the GMCs, particularly the newborn GMCs, based on their close proximity to the NB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5C and 5D</xref>). Interestingly, the dynamics of <italic>hh</italic> transcripts appeared to be cell-cycle specific in NBs as they were below detection threshold during interphase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), but became detectable during mitosis, suggesting that <italic>hh</italic> is likely transcribed during the G2 phase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). As the intronic probe detects <italic>hh</italic> pre-mRNA and RNA splicing is repressed during M-phase <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Loyer1">[64]</xref>, we used an exonic probe to detect the presence of mature <italic>hh</italic> mRNA in interphase NBs. Predictably, mature <italic>hh</italic> cytoplasmic transcripts were detected in NBs and adjacent GMCs, but not in neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Consistent with this expression pattern, Hh protein was found to show a corresponding age-dependent accumulation. Hh was not detected in L2 brains but became progressively apparent by L3 stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s006">Figure S6A and S6B</xref>). Interestingly, Hh protein built up and clustered around the cell surfaces as well as in intracellular puncta of some NBs. Hence, it is likely that Hh acts directly on the NBs to control their proliferation. Moreover, the pattern of <italic>hh</italic> reception using a <italic>ptc</italic> reporter line carrying a 2.8-kb upstream sequence fused to lacZ, as well as a <italic>ptc<sup>H84</sup></italic> enhancer trap insertion line (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s006">Figure S6C</xref> and unpublished data), clearly showed that NBs (and possibly the GMCs as well) were the signal receiving cells.</p>

            <p>(A–B) <italic>hh</italic> transcript (red) was detected mainly in the GMCs of 72 h ALH brain lobe (B), but not in that of 48 h ALH brain lobe (A). CD8:GFP (green) was driven with <italic>elav</italic>-Gal4 to mark the outlines of the cells. (C–C″) In situ hybridization of <italic>hh</italic> (red) in a <italic>wt</italic> clone showed that the transcript was expressed in the GMC adjacent to the Dpn-expressing NB. (D–D′) <italic>In situ</italic> hybridization using an intronic probe that detects <italic>hh</italic> pre-mRNA (red) in a <italic>wt</italic> clone showing <italic>hh</italic> expression in the mitotic NB (note the nuclear morphology, arrow), as well as in the GMC next to it (arrowhead). (E–E′) The mature form of <italic>hh</italic> mRNA (red) was detected in the cytoplasm of the NB (arrow) and to a lesser extent, the adjacent GMC (arrowhead). (F–H) Immuno-staining against Cas (red) showed its expression in cells (NBs and intermediate neural precursors [INPs]) that were also co-expressing Dpn (blue, arrowhead), as well as in some other neurons at different developmental time points. The outlines of the cells were marked with membrane GFP (green). The brain lobes were position such that the dorsal side is facing up and the dotted line indicated the midline of the brain. (I–J′) In situ hybridization of <italic>hh</italic> mRNA showed that embryonic Cas was required for normal <italic>hh</italic> expression. <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> clones induced at 24 h ALH did not affect <italic>hh</italic> expression (I–I′) while <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> clones induced during late embryonic stage could reduce or abolish <italic>hh</italic> expression (J–J′). Pon (blue) showed the outline of the newly born GMCs that typically expressed <italic>hh</italic> mRNA. (A–F, I–J) Scale bar = 10 µm for all panels. (K) ChIP for Flag-tagged Cas transfected into S2 cells showed that Cas was heavily enriched within the 6-kb region at the 5′ UTR of <italic>hh</italic> gene (orange box). There are 19 putative Cas binding sites within that region. The enrichment of any region of the chromatin was counted as the multiple of specific binding (anti-Flag) against non-specific binding (anti-IgG), and normalized to the enrichment at the actin promoter site (negative control). A known target of Cas, pdm-1 was used as a positive control (grey box) for comparison purposes. The value of the blue bars was the average enrichment (times) from three independent transfections and five independent ChIPs. Error bar correspond to standard error of the mean (SEM).</p>

        <p>We also investigated the temporal expression profile of <italic>cas</italic> during development and found that Cas was transiently expressed in NBs during early larval development at about 24 h ALH, which coincided with timing of NB reactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Ito1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Ebens1">[65]</xref>, and its expression became quickly restricted to a small population of NBs by 28–30 h ALH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Subsequently, Cas was detected mainly in GMCs and neurons, as well as a cluster of smaller-sized, Dpn-expressing intermediate neural precursors (INPs) located at the dorsal medial region of the central brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5H</xref>).</p>
        <p>Since Cas acts as a transcription factor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Mellerick1">[66]</xref> and given the temporal expression profiles of <italic>hh</italic> and <italic>cas</italic>, we tested the possibility that <italic>hh</italic> expression might be under the control of <italic>cas</italic>. In <italic>wt</italic>, <italic>hh</italic> transcript was often detected in the GMCs, which could be identified by the presence of cortical Pon. Although <italic>hh</italic> transcript levels remain high in the majority of the <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> mutant clones induced at early L2 after the pulse of Cas during NB reactivation (68.4%, <italic>n</italic> = 19) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5I</xref>), <italic>hh</italic> expression was abolished or significantly reduced in 82.6% of the <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> clones (<italic>n</italic> = 23) induced during embryonic development, presumably affecting the <italic>cas</italic> expression in early larval stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5J</xref>); thus placing <italic>hh</italic> downstream of <italic>cas</italic> and suggesting that the competency for <italic>hh</italic> expression was likely dependent on the larval pulse of Cas, which occurred around 24 h ALH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5F</xref>). Intriguingly, constitutive expression of Cas by inducing <italic>UAS-cas</italic> clones in the central brain at both embryonic and larval stages (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s008">Figure S8A and S8B</xref>) also affected <italic>hh</italic> expression in a similar fashion as <italic>cas</italic> loss-of-function. Together, these data showed that stalling the temporal series either by removing or mis-expressing <italic>cas</italic> could negatively influence <italic>hh</italic> expression. Furthermore, <italic>UAS-cas</italic> expressing clones often harbored a Mira-positive NB at 24 h APF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s008">Figure S8C</xref>), signifying that misregulation of temporal progression, similar to loss of <italic>hh</italic> signaling, can also extend the NB proliferative phase beyond its normal developmental limit.</p>
        <p>Cas is a zinc finger protein capable of acting both as a transcriptional activator and repressor by binding to recognition sites with the consensus sequence of <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">G/C C C/T C/T AAAAA A/T N</named-content> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Kambadur1">[35]</xref>. Does the regulation of <italic>hh</italic> expression by Cas reflect the direct binding of Cas to the <italic>hh</italic> promoter? By scanning about 30 kb of genomic sequence flanking <italic>hh</italic> locus, we identified multiple potential DNA-binding sites that contained the Cas recognition sequence. We performed quantitative chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) assays on S2 cells transiently transfected with Flag-tagged Cas and used the genomic region from <italic>pdm-1</italic>, a known Cas target, as a positive control. Cas directly binds to several consensus sites in the genomic region flanking <italic>pdm-1</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Kambadur1">[35]</xref> and personal communication with W. Odenwald). Indeed, ChIP results showed that the <italic>pdm-1</italic> cis-regulatory region were about three times more enriched with Flag-tagged Cas compared to control <italic>actin-5C</italic> promoter site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5K</xref>) and it was approximately 18 times more enriched compared to the non-transfected control (unpublished data). Supporting the notion that Cas directly associates with <italic>hh</italic> genomic region, Cas was highly enriched at a 6-kb genomic region encompassing <italic>hh</italic> transcription initiation site where there were 19 sites that matched at least eight out of ten bases of the Cas consensus binding sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g005">Figure 5K</xref>). Specifically, the enrichments for Cas at <italic>hh</italic> genomic region compared to that at <italic>actin-5C</italic> promoter site and to the non-transfected control were up to 4.2 and 21.6 times, respectively. Thus, our results suggest that Cas is a direct positive regulator of <italic>hh</italic>, and its transient pulse of expression during early larval development is necessary for the subsequent Hh expression in postembryonic GMCs.</p>
        <p>To further substantiate the relationship between <italic>cas</italic> and <italic>hh</italic> expression, we examined whether Hh signaling interacts genetically with <italic>cas</italic>. As shown earlier, <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> NBs underwent persistent proliferation till late pupal stage as evidenced by the expression of proliferative markers Mira and PH3 at 48 h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4C and 4J</xref>). Ectopic activation of Hh signaling in this background by simultaneous expression of <italic>ptc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> partially suppressed the extended proliferation phenotypes (persistent Mira expressing NBs; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4C, 4E, and 4J</xref>) as well as expanded GMC-like cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4F, 4H, and 4K</xref>), while NBs expressing <italic>ptc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> alone did not exhibit any noticeable phenotype compared to <italic>wt</italic> NBs at that stage (unpublished data). These data indicate a clear genetic interaction between Hh signaling and <italic>Cas</italic> (thus the temporal series) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4J and 4K</xref>). To further substantiate this interaction, we used an alternative approach to introduce elevated Hh signaling in <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> clones. It has been shown that the PP4 and PP4R subunits complex functions to down-regulate Hh signaling by dephosphorylating and destabilizing Smo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Jia2">[67]</xref>. Hence, compromising PP4 activity leads to elevated Hh signaling activity. Indeed, suppression of the persistent proliferation phenotype associated with <italic>cas</italic> mutant NBs was also evident when PP4-19C, the catalytic subunit of PP4 complex, was compromised in the <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4I–4K</xref>). The total GMC-like cells within <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> clones were brought down from 8.2±1.5 (<italic>n</italic> = 14) to 5.5±1.3 (<italic>n</italic> = 23) and 4.5±1.2 (<italic>n</italic> = 21) cells per clone with the introduction of <italic>ptc<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> and <italic>PP4-19C<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> transgenes, respectively, a level close to that seen in <italic>wt</italic> clones (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4K</xref>). Similarly, unlike <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic>, the majority of the NBs in <italic>ptc<sup>RNAi</sup>; cas<sup>24</sup></italic> and <italic>PP4-19C<sup>RNAi</sup></italic>; <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> double-mutant clones were no longer mitotically active at 48 h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4E and 4J</xref>). Together, these data indicate that Hh signaling interacts genetically with the temporal series.</p>
        <p>Previous studies placed <italic>svp</italic> downstream of <italic>cas</italic> in type I NB lineages during the progression of temporal series at larval stage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. Incidentally, we found that <italic>svp</italic> clones exhibited GMC-like cell expansion as well as an extension of the NB proliferation window similar to those seen in <italic>cas</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4D, 4G, 4J, and 4K</xref>). As Cas is potentially a direct regulator of Hh, we first sought to investigate if Hh signaling could in turn, affect the expression of <italic>svp</italic>. In <italic>wt</italic> clones, Svp was detected in the nucleus of the NBs and a minority of neurons at 40 h ALH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s009">Figure S9A</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>svp</italic> expression was unaffected in <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones in which Hh signaling was compromised (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s009">Figure S9C</xref>), indicating that Hh signaling does not function upstream of <italic>svp</italic>. Consistent with this observation, neither did up-regulation of Hh signaling in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones cause ectopic (or elevated) <italic>svp</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s009">Figure S9B</xref>). It is also conceivable that there is a requirement for <italic>svp</italic> as a downstream component of <italic>cas</italic> to activate <italic>hh</italic> expression. Surprisingly, <italic>hh</italic> transcript remained detectable in the GMCs of <italic>svp<sup>1</sup></italic> mutant clones, whereas constitutive <italic>svp</italic> mis-expression clones did not trigger ectopic <italic>hh</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s009">Figure S9D and S9E</xref>). These results indicated an unlikely placement of <italic>hh</italic> downstream of <italic>svp</italic> as well. To gain a better perspective of Svp in the temporal series, we looked at its temporal expression pattern in the postembryonic central brain. We found that <italic>svp</italic> was expressed at a high level in the NBs at 24 h ALH, as early as the time when <italic>cas</italic> expression was detected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s009">Figure S9F</xref>). However, unlike <italic>cas</italic>, which was expressed in a short pulse, <italic>svp</italic> had a much wider expression window where medium levels of Svp can be detected in the NBs until 50 h ALH and it continued to be expressed weakly till 96 h ALH (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s009">Figure S9G–S9I and S9K</xref>). Given the similar time frames of <italic>cas</italic> and <italic>svp</italic> expression at early larval stage, we generated embryonic <italic>cas<sup>24</sup></italic> clones and assayed for <italic>svp</italic> expression at 24 h ALH. It was found that <italic>svp</italic> expression was not abolished in <italic>cas</italic> mutant NBs, showing that <italic>svp</italic> might not be genetically downstream of <italic>cas</italic> in the NBs of the central brain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s009">Figure S9J</xref>).</p>

        <title>Hh Signaling Interacts with Grainyhead to Orchestrate NB Cell Cycle Exit</title>
        <p>How does Hh signaling act to control NB cell cycle exit downstream of Cas? One of the positive targets of the temporal series is Grh, which is expressed as a terminal temporal series component in the late embryo. It is expressed upon activation by Cas and its expression persists during larval stages to maintain the mitotic activity of type I NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Brody1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Almeida1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Cenci1">[40]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. Down-regulation of Grh in the NBs coincides with cell cycle exit, which is accompanied by the reduction of NB size, delocalization of Mira from the cortex to the cytoplasm during early mitosis, as well as Pros translocation into the nucleus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. We noted that <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs also exhibited similar Mira and Pros mislocalization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figures 1E</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">2E</xref>), although there were rare events in which some <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs managed to reach telophase with poorly localized Mira and Pros along the entire mitotic phase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s010">Figure S10A–S10D</xref>). Moreover, there was a noticeable enrichment of Pros within the nuclei of interphase <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs as compared to the neighbouring <italic>wt</italic> NBs with 22.8%±4.1% increase in the intensity of Pros (<italic>n</italic> = 72, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figures 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s010">S10A</xref>, and S10E). In addition, the size of <italic>ptc</italic> mutant NBs at 96 h ALH (9.9±1.2 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 72 for <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> mutant, and 9.2±1.1 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 36 for <italic>ptc<sup>13</sup></italic> mutant) was consistently smaller than that of <italic>wt</italic> NBs (11.2±0.9 µm, <italic>n</italic> = 61) (<italic>p</italic> = 1.0×10<sup>−10</sup>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s011">Figure S11A–S11C</xref>). We hypothesized that Hh signaling might function through Grh in promoting NB cell cycle exit, hence we examined the pattern of Grh expression in NB clones at various time intervals from early L3 until 24 h post-pupation.</p>
        <p>In <italic>wt</italic> L3, within the window of 72–96 h ALH, a high level of Grh was always detected in the NBs in conjunction with relatively lower expression levels in some GMCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g006">Figure 6A and 6B</xref>). Down-regulation of Grh occurred at around 12 h APF during which the NBs retained low levels of Grh while the GMCs were devoid of Grh (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). By 24 h APF, Grh became barely visible in the NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), consistent with the reported cessation of NB proliferation between 20–30 h APF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Ito1">[7]</xref>. However, in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones, NBs appeared to down-regulate Grh expression prematurely. At 72 h ALH, Grh expression was absence from GMCs and its level was significantly reduced in NBs at 96 h ALH, and subsequently lost completely from all NBs at 12 h APF (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g006">Figure 6E–6G</xref>). This was consistent with the lack of mitotic activity in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g001">Figure 1H</xref>), presumably most of the NBs had exited the cell cycle (or struggled with cell cycle progression) by 96 h ALH. As for <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones, the NBs and some GMCs persistently expressed Grh from larval stages until 12 h into pupal stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g006">Figure 6H–6J</xref>). At 24 h APF, all NBs (<italic>n</italic> = 8) within <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones remained Grh-positive but some GMCs began to down-regulate Grh expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g006">Figure 6K and 6L</xref>). More intriguingly, Grh expression persisted in all of the NBs for all the <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones examined at 36 h APF (<italic>n</italic> = 16), and as much as 86.7% of the clones still retained some level of Grh expression in the GMCs (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s011">Figure S11D</xref>).

        <p>To substantiate a mechanistic link between Hh signaling, Grh expression as well as the temporally regulated cell cycle exit, we reduced the level of Grh by RNA-mediated interference in <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones. At 24 h APF, 68.5%±7.8% of <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones (<italic>n</italic> = 54) contained a NB that was positive for the proliferative marker Mira (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). In contrast, expression of <italic>grh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> within <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> background significantly reverted this NB cell cycle termination defect by bringing down the frequency of clones with a proliferating NB at 24 h APF to 17.6%±9.9% (<italic>n</italic> = 68, <italic>p</italic> = 0.009), a level that was comparable to that of the control <italic>grh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> clones (21.6%±10.9%, <italic>n</italic> = 51, <italic>p</italic> = 0.07) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g007">Figure 7B and 7C</xref>). Moreover, the number of GMC-like cells at 96 h ALH, which is indicative of the proliferative capacity of the NBs, was reduced to 3.4±1.2 cells per <italic>grh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> expressing <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clone (<italic>n</italic> = 18, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.0001), as compared to 6.7±2.6 cells per <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clone and 2.7±1.3 cells per control <italic>grh<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> clone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g007">Figure 7D and 7E</xref>). On the other hand, the NB proliferative defect seen in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> clones was only marginally modulated by <italic>grh</italic> ectopic expression. Compared to <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> mutant NBs with a mitotic index of 21.6%±8.4%, <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> mutant NBs with forced <italic>grh</italic> expression exhibited a mitotic index of 26.1%±9.8% (<italic>n</italic>&gt;45, <italic>p</italic> = 0.23). Hence, it is conceivable that Hh signaling might regulate NB behavior by other mechanisms in addition to Grh. Despite that, we noted that Mira delocalization defect was significantly rescued with 69.7%±18.4% of the <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup> ;grh<sup>o/e</sup></italic> NBs showing proper Mira localization (<italic>n</italic> = 96, <italic>p</italic> = 0.008) as compared to only 37.8%±19.6% among the corresponding <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs (<italic>n</italic> = 142) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g007">Figure 7F–7I</xref>).

        <title>Links between the Temporal Cascade, Hh Signaling, and the Asymmetric Division Machinery</title>
        <p>On one hand, Pros as a component of NB asymmetric division machinery, is normally tethered onto the cortex by Mira and kept out of the NB nucleus. On the other hand, a burst of interphase nuclear Pros (accompanied by cytoplasmic localization of Mira) is triggered by the temporal mechanism during the terminal division of NBs, indicative of cell cycle exit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. However, how the temporal mechanism can mediate nuclear Pros localization in NB is unknown. <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs were associated with a higher level of nuclear Pros during interphase and cytoplasmic Pros during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001494.s010">S10A–S10D</xref>). Pros functions by repressing genes required for NB self-renewal and activating genes implicated in neuronal differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Choksi1">[28]</xref>. Hence, we reasoned that the slower mitotic cycle and premature cell cycle exit in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs may be a result of mislocalized/nuclear Pros.

        <p>Like <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic>, mutations in the subunits of PP4 complex had been reported to exhibit a NB under-proliferation phenotype with similar defects in the localization of Mira and Pros <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-SousaNunes1">[32]</xref>. The majority of mitotic NBs in <italic>flfl<sup>N42</sup>/flfl<sup>795</sup></italic> (the regulatory subunit of PP4) trans-heterozygotes exhibited nuclear Pros during interphase (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-SousaNunes1">[32]</xref> and unpublished data) and lacked a well-defined Mira crescent but instead, showed cytoplasmic accumulation of Mira during mitosis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g008">Figure 8C and 8G</xref>). Like <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs, removal of one copy of <italic>pros</italic> in <italic>flfl<sup>N42</sup>/flfl<sup>795</sup></italic> trans-heterozygotes could partially restore Mira crescent to the cortex as the percentage of NBs with strong Mira crescent increased from 13.0% to 34.6% (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g008">Figure 8D and 8G</xref>). As PP4 is known to be a Smo phosphatase that dephosphorylates Smo thus dampening Hh signaling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Jia2">[67]</xref>, abolishing the function of PP4 will invariably lead to elevated Hh signaling. Supporting the idea that excess Hh signaling may in part be the cause for Mira/Pros delocalization in <italic>flfl</italic> mutants, we knocked down <italic>ci</italic> by RNAi in the <italic>flfl<sup>795</sup></italic> background and observed that the number of NBs with strong Mira crescent increased from 21.4% to 43.5%, while NBs expressing <italic>ci<sup>RNAi</sup></italic> did not exhibit any noticeable phenotype in that respect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g008">Figure 8E, 8G</xref>, and unpublished data). Thus, our data suggest that PP4 regulates NB divisions, in part, by dephosphorylating Smo and modulating Hh signaling to keep NBs in a proliferative state. Supporting this, compromising PP4 function suppressed the formation of expanded GMC-like pools and promoted cell cycle exit in a <italic>cas</italic> mutant background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g004">Figure 4I–4K</xref>). Together, our results suggest that Hh signaling plays a role in NB asymmetric division via the regulation of Mira/Pros localization; it also acts both downstream (<italic>cas</italic>) and upstream (<italic>grh</italic>) of components of the temporal series to control NB cell cycle exit. Thus Hh signaling appears to be a key player in coordinating the asymmetric division machinery with the temporal cascade to schedule the termination of postembryonic neurogenesis in line with developmental timing.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Here, we show that Hh signaling functions during later postembryonic development and acts together with the NB temporal transcription factor cascade to regulate NB cell cycle exit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001494-g009">Figure 9</xref>). We further demonstrate that <italic>hh</italic> is a downstream target of Cas, a member of temporal series that determines the time at which NBs terminate proliferation via down-regulation of Grh. While increased Hh signaling results in increased cell cycle length and premature NB cell cycle exit, loss of Hh signaling decreases NB cell cycle length and also prolongs the duration of NB proliferation.</p>

          <p>(A) An early pulse of Cas at early larval stage primes the expression of <italic>hh</italic> in both NB and GMCs. The Hh ligand (unpublished data) acts in an autocrine and/or paracrine fashion to activate Hh signalling transduction in the NB. Among the outcomes of Hh signaling pathway activation in the context of postembryonic NB, <italic>grh</italic> expression is down-regulated and Pros moves into the nucleus, eventually leading to NB cell cycle exit at early pupal stage. The strength of Hh signaling activation is likely to be regulated PP4, which dampen Hh pathway activity by dephosphorylating Smo. <italic>svp</italic> probably constitutes a parallel pathway, which may or may not converge with <italic>cas</italic>→<italic>hh</italic> pathway at a point prior to the eventual NB cell cycle exit. Dotted lines and double question marks denote uncertainties while solid lines represent availability of experimental evidences.

        <title>Hh Acts at Short Range in the Larval Brain</title>
        <p>Hh family proteins can act as short- or long-range morphogens covering distances as few as ten cell diameters (20 µm), or as far as a field containing many more cell diameters (200 µm) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Briscoe1">[68]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Huangfu1">[69]</xref>. In the postembryonic brain, <italic>hh</italic> is expressed predominantly in the NBs and the newborn GMCs, whereas the expression of its target gene reporter, <italic>ptc-lacZ</italic> is observed in a narrow area covering the adjacent NB and the sibling GMCs, indicating a limited response to and suggesting a limited spread of Hh ligand. In addition, Hh protein is always found to be enriched and clustering around the NBs in a punctuated form rather than forming a gradient. These data, together with the lineage autonomous phenotype of <italic>hh</italic> mutant NB clones, strongly suggest that Hh acts locally at short range in the larval brain. This is consistent with the structural arrangement of the larval brain, where each NB lineage comprising of the NB itself, GMCs, and neurons, is encapsulated by a meshwork of glial processes that form a three-dimensional scaffold that potentially acts as a stem cell niche <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Hartenstein1">[70]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Chai1">[71]</xref>. Such a spatial arrangement may serve as a barrier to restrict spread of the ligand and confine signaling events within a particular lineage so that an individual NB lineage can development with considerable independence from its neighbouring lineages. Indeed, a NB clone derived from a <italic>hh</italic> null allele exhibits the GMC pool expansion phenotype even though GMCs from its neighbouring lineages are competent in producing Hh ligand.</p>
        <p>While it is tempting to assume that Hh can also act on the GMCs in an autocrine mode of action judging from the presence of <italic>ptc-lacZ</italic> expression, we did not observe any noticeable GMC fate transformation or change in their proliferative capability in <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> and <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones. The higher mitotic rate in <italic>hh</italic> loss-of-function NBs could largely explain the amplification of the GMC pool and enlarged clone-size; however, we are unable to rule out a possible delay in GMC differentiation. The proposition that Hh ligand, which is produced by the NB and daughter GMCs, feeds back on the NB to control its own proliferative capacity and the timing of cell cycle exit is interesting but not totally unfamiliar. Similar feedback signalling mechanism has been demonstrated in the mouse brain in which post-mitotic neurons signal back to the progenitor to control cell fate decisions, as well as the number of neurons and glia produced during corticogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Seuntjens1">[72]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Temporal Regulations of Hh Signalling</title>
        <p>Hh signal reception is detectable in NBs as early as in L2 and persists throughout larval life and in early pupae when NBs undergo Pros-dependent cell cycle exit. This delay of approximately 96 h between the start of Hh reception and the ultimate outcome of cell cycle exit may be due to a requirement for cumulative exposure of NBs to increasing local concentrations of Hh. Such a graded response will enable the <italic>wt</italic> postembryonic NBs to progress from high to low proliferative stages before ceasing division, in line with the development of the larva. Evidence supporting this notion includes gradual accumulation of Hh on the NBs, lengthening of NB cell cycle time, as well as the necessity of high levels of Hh signaling to trigger cell cycle exit (unpublished data). It is worthwhile to note that even at pre-pupal stage during which most NBs are starting to undergo cell cycle exit, fewer than 20% of them are associated with Hh puncta at any point of time. One likely explanation is that not all the NB lineages within the larval central brain respond synchronously to Hh-mediated temporal transition. However, unlike the embryonic central nervous system in which <italic>hh</italic> expression is localized to rows 6–7 of the neuroectoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Matsuzaki1">[73]</xref>, we find it difficult to pinpoint a specific expression pattern in the postembryonic central brain due to the disorganized array of NB lineages. It is equally possible that different NBs exit cell cycle progression at different time points. This is also consistent with the structural organization of individual NB into different “trophospongium” or stem cell niches. Nevertheless, we cannot rule out the possibility that Hh signal activation primes another yet-to-be-identified developmentally regulated signal/event to schedule NB cell cycle exit.</p>
        <p>Interestingly, a recently proposed “cell cycle length hypothesis” postulates that cell cycle length, particularly the length of G1 phase in neural stem cells acts as a switch to trigger the transition from proliferative to neurogenesis mode <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Salomoni1">[62]</xref>. In fact, experiments have shown that manipulation of cdk4/cyclinD1 expression and cdk2/cyclinE activity that result in the lengthening of G1 is sufficient to induce precocious neurogenesis; while inhibition of physiological lengthening of G1 delays neurogenesis and promotes expansion of intermediate progenitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Calegari1">[74]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Lange1">[75]</xref>. Our results show that <italic>Drosophila</italic> postembryonic NBs in the central brain exhibit a comparable trend of cell cycle lengthening from young to old larval stages. Interestingly, NBs with excess Hh signaling have an extended cell cycle time, consistent with the idea that there is a forward shift of the “perceived” age, leading to premature cell cycle exit. In contrast, Hh loss-of-function NBs have a shorter cell cycle time compared to their <italic>wt</italic> counterparts of the same actual age; hence, they have a younger “perceived” age and are able to maintain their proliferative phase over a longer period of time. Consistent with this, we showed that persistent NB proliferation in <italic>smo<sup>IA3</sup></italic> clones as well as the early termination of <italic>ptc<sup>S2</sup></italic> NBs proliferation, are always associated with the presence and absence of CycE expression, respectively. However, loss of Hh signaling in NBs merely extends their proliferative phase but is not sufficient to ensure perpetual proliferation as we failed to observe any mitotic NB in the adult brain. We also note that a previous report suggested that the cell cycle time of the larval NBs reduced during their growth and reached a peak at late third instar with a minimum cell cycle time of 55 min. However, this study was conducted on thoracic NBs from the neuromeres T1 to T3, which have a very distinctive proliferative profile to the central brain NBs assayed in the current study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Truman1">[6]</xref>. Indeed, it was shown in their study that abdominal NBs exhibited significantly different cell cycle times compared to their thoracic counterparts.</p>
        <p>In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the precise timing of NB cell cycle exit is governed by a highly regulated process that involves sequential expression of a series of transcription factors: Hb→Kr→Pdm1→Cas, known as the temporal series <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Brody1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Isshiki1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Chell1">[76]</xref>. It is known that the temporal series probably utilizes Grh in the postembryonic NBs to regulate Pros localization or apoptotic gene activity, thus determining the time at which proliferation ends. In addition, the temporal series also regulate postembryonic Chinmo→Br-C neuronal switch, which specifies the size and the identity of the neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Zhu1">[77]</xref>. Our data show that Hh signaling does not regulate early to late neuronal transition as Chinmo and Br-C expression timings appear unaffected in both <italic>ptc</italic> and <italic>smo</italic> mutant clones (unpublished data). In contrast, excess Hh signaling leads to a variety of features associated with NB cell cycle exit: (1) premature down-regulation of Grh, (2) nuclear localization of Pros (in NBs), and (3) reduction of NB size. Taken together with the extended proliferative duration of Hh loss-of-function NBs, it is apparent that Hh signaling is a potent effector of the temporal series and functions late to promote NB cell cycle exit.</p>
        <p>The results from our current genetic interaction assays with Hh pathway components and <italic>grh</italic> reaffirmed the conclusions from previous studies that Grh is necessary to maintain the mitotic activity of the postembryonic NBs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Kanai1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. The loss of Hh signaling keeps the central brain type I NBs in their proliferative state and this is largely contributed by persistent <italic>grh</italic> expression past their normal developmental timing at around 24 h APF. Even though Grh is necessary to extend the proliferative phase of these NBs, it is not sufficient to rescue all aspects of the premature cell cycle exit phenotype seen in <italic>ptc</italic> mutant NBs. Hence, down-regulation of <italic>grh</italic> by over-activating Hh signaling is not solely responsible for NB proliferative defects, and this implies that Hh signaling may terminate NB cell cycle via other mechanisms in addition to Grh.</p>
        <p>The expression of <italic>hh</italic> appears to be dependent on the pulse of Cas expression at the transition between L1 and L2, as induction of <italic>cas</italic> mutant clones after that stage does not significantly affect <italic>hh</italic> expression. Moreover, ChIP assays suggest that Cas binds the <italic>hh</italic> genomic region, thereby placing Hh as a direct downstream target of the temporal series. However, it is intriguing to speculate on how the early pulse of Cas can mediate <italic>hh</italic> expression, which only comes on later during larval development. One possible explanation involves a relay mechanism in which that pulse of Cas activates an (or a cascade of) unknown components, which persist and eventually turns on the later <italic>hh</italic> expression. Yet, in such a model, Cas need not interact directly with the <italic>hh</italic> locus as our ChIP assay clearly suggests. Moreover, there are at least two pulses of <italic>hh</italic> expression during larval brain development, and the earlier, shorter pulse that is required for the activation of quiescent NBs appear to be independent from Cas regulation as Cas is only switched on in the larval NBs upon reactivation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Hartenstein1">[70]</xref>. Most importantly, our data show that mis-expression of <italic>cas</italic> abolishes, rather than triggers ectopic <italic>hh</italic> expression. Thus, our findings do not favour the continuous expression of a <italic>hh</italic> activator downstream of Cas. Alternatively, Cas may be involve in the epigenetic modifications of the <italic>hh</italic> locus such that it is primed for expression at a much later stage. This may also explain why saturating the system with Cas for prolonged period of time via mis-expression can negatively affect subsequent <italic>hh</italic> expression because of to its potential aberrant association with the chromatin. Although such a function has not been reported for Cas, previous studies have postulated that components of the temporal series, such as Hb (or mammalian homolog Ikaros) and Svp (or mammalian homolog COUP-TFI/II), play a role in modulating chromatin structure, hence modifying the competency of downstream gene expression subsequently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Naka1">[78]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Pearson2">[80]</xref>.</p>
        <p>The relationship between <italic>svp</italic> and Hh signaling within the postembryonic temporal series cascade is interesting yet unexpected. <italic>svp</italic> was thought to be a downstream component of <italic>cas</italic> on the basis of studies in postembryonic NBs in the thoracic segment of the ventral nerve cord <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. This is supported by the observations that the pulse Svp occurs at 40–60 h ALH following the pulse of Cas at 30–50 h ALH. Moreover, both <italic>svp</italic> and <italic>cas</italic> mutant clones affect Chinmo/Br-C neuronal target transition, apart from causing NBs' failure to exit the cell cycle at early pupal stage. However, examinations of Svp and Cas expression patterns in the central brain region in this study reveal that the Cas expression window overlaps with the peak of the Svp expression window, even though the latter has a much wider expression window in which low expression levels can still be detected in the NBs at 96 h ALH. Moreover, our data show that abolishment of <italic>cas</italic> function starting from the embryonic stage does not reduce Svp expression in the NBs at 24 h ALH. Hence, previous interpretation that <italic>svp</italic> functions downstream of <italic>cas</italic> in the thoracic postembryonic NBs may not be easily extrapolated to NBs in other brain regions. On the basis of our results, it is tempting to postulate that Cas and Svp constitute two parallel pathways within the temporal series and Hh signaling is regulated by Cas but not Svp. Nevertheless, such a hypothesis warrants more in depth studies.</p>

        <title>Hh Signaling Provides a Link between NB Asymmetry and the Temporal Series</title>
        <p>The precise generation of diverse cell types with distinct function from a single progenitor is important for the formation of a functional nervous system during animal development. It has been shown that, in <italic>Drosophila</italic>, the developmental timing mechanism (the temporal series) is tightly coupled with the asymmetric machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Maurange2">[44]</xref>. However, the underlying mechanism of this coordination remains elusive. Our data suggest that on the one hand, Hh signaling is under the control of the temporal series (<italic>hh</italic> expression is directly regulated by Cas), while on the other hand, Hh signaling participates in asymmetric segregation of Mira/Pros during NB division. Introduction of ectopic/premature Hh signaling (in <italic>ptc</italic> mutant clones) during developmental stages in which NBs are proliferating results in cytoplasmic localization of Mira/Pros during mitosis, reduction of NB size, and slow-down of NB cell cycle progression, reminiscent of the final division of NBs in early pupa just before cessation of proliferation. Consequently, these NBs exit the cell cycle prematurely. We speculate that Pros may be a direct or indirect target of Hh signaling as elevated pathway activity invariantly leads to increased <italic>pros</italic> expression in the NBs. Furthermore, reducing the level of Pros protein by removing one copy of function <italic>pros</italic> is able to rescue the Mira delocalization phenotype seen in <italic>ptc</italic> mutant NBs. Thus, it is plausible that Hh signaling impinges on the asymmetric division apparatus, likely through Pros, to diminish NB fate gradually (as seen with the absence of Dpn and Mira delocalization) prior to the final cell cycle exit. Despite our results indicating a tight correlation between nuclear entry of Pros into the NBs and the eventual cell cycle exit of these NBs during pupal stage, we would like to caution the readers that Pros may not be the direct causative agent in controlling NB cell cycle exit. Therefore the actual role of Pros in this process is purely speculative as far as this study is concerned.</p>
        <p>On the other hand, loss of Hh signaling (e.g., in <italic>Smo</italic> mutant clones) maintains NBs in their “younger” proliferating stage far beyond the time when they normally exit the cell cycle. Thus, Hh signaling couples the developmental timing mechanism (the temporal series) with the NB intrinsic asymmetric machinery for the generation of a functional nervous system.</p>

        <title>The Anti-proliferative Role of Hh Signaling</title>
        <p>In vertebrates, constitutive activation of the Sonic hedgehog (SHH, a homologue of <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hh), signaling pathway through inactivation mutations in PTCH1, activating mutations in SMO, as well as other mutations involving SHH, IHH, GLI1, GLI2, GLI3, and SUFU, has been implicated in a vast array of malignancies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Cohen2">[81]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Kar1">[82]</xref>. The proven association of Hh signaling pathway with tumourigenesis and tumour cell growth fuel the view that Hh constitutes a mitogenic signal that promotes pro-proliferative responses of the target cells. Moreover, Hh acts as a stem cell factor in somatic stem cells in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> ovary, human hematopoietic stem cells, and mouse embryonic stem cells, possibly by exerting its effects on the cell cycle machinery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Zhang2">[83]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Bhardwaj1">[86]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our report here provides an opposing facet of Hh signaling where it is required for timely NB cell cycle exit in the postembryonic pupal brain. This may sound astonishing, but the essential roles of Hh signaling as a negative regulator of the cell cycle has been eclipsed by the common bias that it stimulates proliferation, given the many examples of malignancies with the Hh pathway dysregulation. Indeed, studies have indicated that cell cycle exit and differentiation of a number of cell types, such as absorptive colonocytes of the mammalian gut, zebrafish, and <italic>Drosophila</italic> retina, require Hh activities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Neumann1">[87]</xref>. A more recent article also showed that SHH signaling pathway is highly activated in human embryonic stem cell (hESC) and such activity is crucial for hESC differentiation as embryoid bodies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001494-Wu2">[88]</xref>. The opposing functions of Hh signaling pathway in different cell types reveal that the ultimate effect of this pathway is likely to be tissue specific, depending on its interaction with other regulatory pathways. Our data indicate that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> postembryonic NBs of the brain this does indeed appear to be the case, because in this system, Hh signaling pathway interacts with NB-specific temporal series and likely the asymmetric cell division machinery to promote <italic>pros</italic> nuclear localization to trigger cell cycle exit.</p>
