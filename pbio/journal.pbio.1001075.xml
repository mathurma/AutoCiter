        <p>Replicating chromatin involves disruption of histone-DNA contacts and subsequent
                    reassembly of maternal histones on the new daughter genomes. In bulk, maternal
                    histones are randomly segregated to the two daughters, but little is known about
                    the fine details of this process: do maternal histones re-assemble at preferred
                    locations or close to their original loci? Here, we use a recently developed
                    method for swapping epitope tags to measure the disposition of ancestral histone
                    H3 across the yeast genome over six generations. We find that ancestral H3 is
                    preferentially retained at the 5′ ends of most genes, with strongest
                    retention at long, poorly transcribed genes. We recapitulate these observations
                    with a quantitative model in which the majority of maternal histones are
                    reincorporated within 400 bp of their pre-replication locus during replication,
                    with replication-independent replacement and transcription-related retrograde
                    nucleosome movement shaping the resulting distributions of ancestral histones.
                    We find a key role for Topoisomerase I in retrograde histone movement during
                    transcription, and we find that loss of Chromatin Assembly Factor-1 affects
                    replication-independent turnover. Together, these results show that specific
                    loci are enriched for histone proteins first synthesized several generations
                    beforehand, and that maternal histones re-associate close to their original
                    locations on daughter genomes after replication. Our findings further suggest
                    that accumulation of ancestral histones could play a role in shaping histone
                    modification patterns.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>It is widely believed that chromatin, the nucleoprotein packaged state of
                    eukaryotic genomes, can carry epigenetic information and thus transmit gene
                    expression patterns to replicating cells. However, the inheritance of genomic
                    packaging status is subject to mechanistic challenges that do not confront the
                    inheritance of genomic DNA sequence. Most notably, histone proteins must at
                    least transiently dissociate from the maternal genome during replication, and it
                    is unknown whether or not maternal proteins re-associate with daughter genomes
                    near the sequence they originally occupied on the maternal genome. Here, we use
                    a novel method for tracking old proteins to determine where histone proteins
                    accumulate after 1, 3, or 6 generations of growth in yeast. To our surprise,
                    ancestral histones accumulate near the 5′ end of long, relatively inactive
                    genes. Using a mathematical model, we show that our results can be explained by
                    the combined effects of histone replacement, histone movement along genes from
                    3′ towards 5′ ends, and histone spreading during replication. Our
                    results show that old histones do move but stay relatively close to their
                    original location (within around 400 base-pairs), which places important
                    constraints on how chromatin could potentially carry epigenetic information. Our
                    findings also suggest that accumulation of the ancestral histones that are
                    inherited can influence histone modification patterns.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>In addition to the information encoded in DNA sequence, replicating cells can inherit
                epigenetic information, which refers to variable phenotypes that are heritable
                without an underlying change in DNA sequence. It is widely accepted that chromatin,
                the nucleoprotein packaging state of eukaryotic genomes, provides one potential
                carrier of epigenetic information. Although definitive proof that chromatin per se
                carries epigenetic information during replication exists in very few cases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Ptashne1">[1]</xref>, genetic
                studies in numerous organisms have identified key roles for chromatin regulators in
                multiple epigenetic inheritance paradigms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Ringrose1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Rusche1">[3]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The idea that chromatin structure carries epigenetic information poses a central
                mechanistic question—since chromosome replication involves dramatic
                perturbations to chromatin structure ranging from old histone displacement to
                widespread incorporation of newly synthesized histones, how can chromatin states be
                stably maintained? To understand the mechanism by which chromatin states could be
                inherited, it is necessary to understand the unique challenges posed by histone
                protein dynamics during replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Annunziato1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kaufman1">[7]</xref>. First, histones must at least
                transiently dissociate from the genome during passage of the replication
                fork—if old histones carrying epigenetic information do not re-associate with
                daughter genomes at the location from which they came, this could lead to
                “epimutation,” analogous to DNA bases moving relative to one another
                during genomic replication. Second, it is unknown to what extent newly synthesized
                histones deposited at different loci differ in their covalent modification patterns.
                Finally, how old histones influence new histones, the basis for positive feedback,
                can be considered analogous to asking what the equivalent of base-pairing is during
                chromatin replication.</p>
      <p>Classic radioactive pulse-chase studies demonstrated that, in bulk, maternal histones
                segregate equally to the two daughter cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Annunziato1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Jackson1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Jackson3">[10]</xref>. It is unknown, however,
                whether maternal histones remain close to the locus from which they were evicted by
                the replication fork or whether maternal histones are incorporated at preferred
                genomic loci in the two daughter genomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Groth1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kaufman1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Corpet1">[11]</xref>. The extent of maternal histone
                dispersal affects the stability of epigenetic states in theoretical models of
                chromatin inheritance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dodd1">[12]</xref>, making experimental determination of this parameter a
                key goal for epigenetics research.</p>
      <p>To address these fundamental questions, we carried out a genetic pulse-chase with
                epitope-tagged histone H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Verzijlbergen1">[13]</xref> to follow ancestral H3 for several cell divisions after
                removal of the ancestral tag. We find that old histone proteins do not accumulate at
                epigenetically regulated loci such as the subtelomeres but instead accumulate at the
                5′ ends of long, poorly transcribed genes. As expected, old histones do not
                accumulate at loci exhibiting rapid histone turnover, but we also find that 3′
                to 5′ movement of old histones along coding regions and histone movement
                during replication are required to explain the patterns of ancestral histone
                retention we observe. We estimate that maternal histones stay within ∼400 bp of
                their original location during replication, providing the first measure of this
                crucial parameter. Finally, we identify a number of factors that affect old histone
                localization, such as topoisomerase I and the H4 N-terminal tail, which both affect
                the 5′ bias in localization patterns. In contrast, CAF-1 mostly affects
                histone turnover at promoters. Together, these results provide a detailed overview
                of the movement of ancestral histones across multiple cell generations and identify
                a number of mechanisms that play a role in shaping the landscape of ancestral
                histone retention.</p>

      <title>Results</title>
      <p>To follow the movement of old histone proteins over multiple cell generations, we
                utilized a novel pulse-chase technique <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Verzijlbergen1">[13]</xref> to follow ancestral
                epitope-tagged histone H3 for several cell divisions after swapping epitope tags
                from H3-HA to H3-T7 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g001">Figure 1A,
                    B</xref>). We have previously described use of this technique to assay
                replication-independent H3 turnover in arrested cells and have shown that prior to
                recombination all cells carry the H3-HA, and that recombination is 98%
                efficient in cells that are not dividing due to nutrient deprivation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s001">Figure S1</xref>).

          <p>(A) Recombination-based swapping of epitope tags on histone H3. Histone H3 is
                        tagged at its endogenous locus with a C-terminal HA epitope tag surrounded
                        by LoxP sites. Upon induction of Cre recombinase with β-estradiol, the
                        HA tag is recombined out and H3 is left with a C-terminal T7 tag. (B)
                        Experimental overview. Yeast carrying HA-tagged H3 are arrested by nutrient
                        depletion, and the HA→T7 swap is induced by overnight incubation with
                        β-estradiol. After the tag swap, yeast are released from arrest and HA
                        and T7 tags are mapped across the genome at varying times post-release. (C)

                        chromosome III at 3 generations after release. Notable in this view is a
                        lack of accumulation of H3-HA at TEL3L or the silent mating loci. (D)

                eliminated via recombination leaving new H3-T7, high HA/T7 ratios indicate loci
                enriched for ancestral histone H3. Surprisingly, many of the highest HA/T7 levels
                were associated with coding regions (discussed below).</p>
      <p>Overall, HA/T7 patterns are consistent at 3 and 6 generations, but the dynamic range
                of HA/T7 enrichment diminished from 3 to 6 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g001">Figure 1D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s002">Figure S2</xref>).
                This is an expected consequence of the fact that ∼1%–2% of
                cells do not recombine the HA tag away (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s001">Figure S1</xref>)—since the amount of ancestral H3
                is decreasing by at least 2-fold in each generation, the relative contribution of
                the ∼2% of cells still expressing H3-HA will increase over time, with
                this genomic background eventually competing with the real signal from increasingly
                rare ancestral H3 (&lt;2% of total H3 after 6 doublings).</p>

        <title>Ancestral Histones Are Retained Over Long, Poorly Transcribed Genes</title>
        <p>To extend our analyses to the entire genome, we carried out deep sequencing of HA
                    and T7 libraries. HA- and T7-tagged H3 were immunoprecipitated after the tag
                    swap but before release from arrest (0 generations), after release into a G2/M
                    cell cycle block, and at 1, 3, and 6 generations after release. Sequencing reads
                    were mapped to the yeast genome, normalized for read count, and HA/T7 ratios
                    were computed genome-wide. These data correlated well with our microarray data,
                    and we further validated these measurements by q-PCR at <italic>SPA2</italic>
                    and <italic>BUD3</italic>, two genes which both exhibit high and low HA/T7

                    there is a partial correlation between transcription levels and
                    replication-independent histone dynamics. To understand how transcription might
                    affect multigenerational histone retention in our system, we aligned all yeast
                    genes by their transcription start site (TSS) and clustered genes (K-means,
                    K = 5) based on the pattern of the 3-generation HA/T7
                    ratios along the gene body (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s004">Figures S4</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s005">S5</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s019">Table S1</xref>).
                    We observed a striking enrichment of H3-HA just downstream of the 5′ ends
                    of genes (typically peaking around the +3 nucleosome). One exception to the
                    5′ pattern described is found in one cluster of short genes with uniformly
                    low H3-HA levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s004">Figure S4</xref>, Cluster 1), which is enriched for
                    GO categories (such as protein translation) related to high gene expression
                    levels. In contrast, long genes were generally associated with higher levels of
                    ancestral H3 (see for example Cluster 5).</p>
        <p>To better visualize these trends, we sorted genes by the extent of ancestral H3
                    retention after 3 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2A–B</xref>). Retention of ancestral histones correlates both
                    with low expression levels and with longer genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s006">Figure S6</xref>).
                    While it is the case that longer genes tend to be expressed at lower levels than
                    short genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2E</xref>),
                    these factors are partially independent here—even when we focus on genes
                    of 1–2 kb length, we still observe the correlations between ancestral
                    histone retention and low expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2E–F</xref>, and see below).
                    Interestingly, in both microarray and sequencing datasets we found that
                    epigenetically repressed loci such as the silent mating loci and subtelomeres

        <p>What properties of short or highly transcribed genes might lead to loss of
                    ancestral histones? Replication-independent histone replacement occurs most
                    rapidly over intergenic regions and over the coding regions of highly
                    transcribed genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Rufiange1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Mito1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Deal1">[23]</xref>, the converse of the pattern of ancestral H3
                    retention we observe. Indeed, ancestral histone retention is broadly correlated
                    with “cold” regions of low H3/H4 turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Importantly, however, for a given
                    level of H3/H4 turnover, ancestral H3 retention varied
                    significantly—retention at a given nucleosome was better correlated with
                    the average turnover rate of several surrounding nucleosomes than with the
                    immediate turnover rate (see, for example, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g003">Figure 3B–C</xref>). This observation suggests
                    that maternal histones preferentially re-associate with daughter genomes near
                    the location from which they originated—if old histones scattered randomly
                    at replication, ancestral H3 retention patterns should more precisely

        <title>Accumulation of Ancestral Histones at 5′ Ends of Genes</title>
        <p>Why do old histone proteins accumulate near the 5′ ends of genes? We
                    considered two alternative possibilities for classes of mechanisms causing this
                    pattern. In the first mechanism, we reason that if histone proteins tend to
                    maintain their locations along the genome, the 5′ enrichment of old
                    histones implies that old 3′ histones are evicted and replaced by new
                    histones during some phase of the cell cycle. However, previous measures of
                    turnover in G1- or G2/M-arrested yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kaplan1">[26]</xref> cannot explain the
                    5′/3′ ratios we observe. Furthermore, we found that mutations in
                    candidate 5′/3′-marking complexes such as cohesin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Glynn1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Lengronne1">[28]</xref> or
                    H3K4/K36 methylases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kouzarides1">[29]</xref> did not affect 5′-biased retention of old
                    histones at target loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s008">Figure S8A</xref>).</p>
        <p>A second possible explanation for widespread 5′ accumulation of ancestral
                    histone proteins is that the histone proteins move from 3′ to 5′
                    over genes over time. This could result from RNA polymerase passage, because
                    some RNA polymerases pass histone octamers in a retrograde direction during
                    transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Studitsky1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Studitsky2">[31]</xref>. Although it is debatable whether this is true of
                    Pol2 in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kulaeva1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Hodges1">[33]</xref>, in vivo we previously observed that inactivation of
                    Pol2 leads to a modest shift of nucleosomes from 5′ to 3′ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Weiner1">[34]</xref>, consistent
                    with the idea that Pol2 movement normally shifts nucleosomes in a 5′
                    direction. To test whether this movement was related to transcription, we asked
                    whether the 5′ peak of H3-HA accumulation shifted further 5′ with
                    increasing transcription rate. We normalized all gene lengths to one, then
                    plotted the HA/T7 ratio for all genes sorted by transcription rate (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s009">Figure S9</xref>).
                    Consistent with the prediction of transcription-dependent retrograde movement,
                    we did observe a subtle signal of H3-HA peaks shifting further 5′ at
                    higher transcription rates. While this analysis could be confounded by the
                    higher transcription rates seen over shorter genes, even when we focus on
                    1–2 kb genes, we observe that poorly transcribed genes exhibit a much
                    flatter profile than genes expressed at average levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2F</xref>), as expected if Pol2 transit were
                    required for H3/H4 “passback.” Finally, we show below that per-gene
                    estimates of passback exhibit significant correlation with Pol2 levels.
                    Together, these results are most consistent with a model in which histone
                    proteins move from 3′ to 5′ over coding regions over time (further

        <title>Quantitative Estimation of Nucleosome Dynamics During Replication</title>
        <p>A key question we sought to address in this study is whether maternal histones
                    re-associate near their original positions after passage of the replication
                    fork. We reasoned that changes in HA/T7 patterns over the course of several
                    generations might provide insight into the effects of replication on nucleosome
                    dynamics. HA/T7 patterns change dramatically between arrest and 1 generation of
                    release (with or without G2/M arrest) and then are very similar between 1 and 3
                    generations, before the background of nonswitching cells starts to dominate the
                    profile at 6 generations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g004">Figure
                        4</xref>). As expected, HA/T7 data at generation 0 exhibited widespread HA
                    loss/T7 gain at promoters and +1 nucleosomes as a result of the rapid
                    replication-independent turnover at these loci <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Verzijlbergen1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Rufiange1">[17]</xref>.
                    Importantly, to rule out the possibility that 5′ accumulation of H3-HA was
                    an effect of our arrest-release protocol, we also measured HA/T7 distributions 6
                    h after inducing recombination in actively growing midlog cultures of yeast
                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s003">Figures

                    times in this protocol (only 65% of yeast have switched from HA to T7 3 h
                    after switch induction, 85% after 6 h), we nonetheless observed that
                    HA/T7 distributions were remarkably similar in midlog-switching cells to HA/T7
                    patterns observed in cells undergoing the arrest/release protocol, with
                    preferential ancestral histone accumulation at the 5′ ends of long, poorly
                    transcribed genes.</p>

        <p>We asked whether these dynamic observations could be used to quantitatively rule
                    out specific models concerning the mechanisms for segregation of maternal
                    histones to daughter genomes. However, the resolution of this question is
                    complicated by replication-independent processes we discuss above that can
                    remove or shift ancestral histones, and that cannot be fully removed
                    experimentally (for example, yeast will not proceed through the cell cycle in
                    the absence of RNA polymerase). To understand the relationship between these
                    issues, we designed an analytical model that accounts for three processes that
                    affect H3 molecules in coding sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g005">Figure 5A</xref>) and then examined the effect of
                    removing any of the three. Briefly, our model includes a nucleosome-specific
                    term for H3 turnover taken from prior experimental results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref>, with H3 turnover resulting
                    in loss of HA. In addition, it includes a gene-specific parameter accounting for
                    lateral movement of histones (“passback”). Further, the model also
                    includes a global parameter that describes the extent of histone
                    “spreading” via dissociation/re-association during replication.

                            5′ movement along coding regions. (D) Estimation of

                    examined this model with two starting conditions—the first started with a

                    start from the G2/M distribution). Examination of estimated parameters revealed
                    expected behaviors. For instance, the distribution of lateral histone movement
                    estimates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g005">Figure 5C</xref>) was
                    strongly biased towards retrograde 3′ to 5′ movement of histones,

                    the likelihood of the full model plotted for various values for
                    replication-dependent histone spreading. The best fit model allowed histones to
                    spread ∼400 bp in either direction, or roughly two nucleosome widths, during
                    replication (more precisely, in this model two-thirds of histones stay within
                    400 bp of their original locations, as this value is the standard deviation of a
                    Gaussian function describing spreading; see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s023">Text S1</xref>).

        <p>Elimination of any one or two of the three components of the
                    model—spreading, turnover, or passback—resulted in significantly
                    worse fits between model predictions and experimental data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). This can be intuited as follows.
                    First, in the absence of histone spreading, unmitigated histone movement from
                    3′ to 5′ results in a much tighter 5′ ancestral histone peak
                    and results in much more extensive change from one generation to the next than
                    we observe. Second, eliminating histone turnover shifts the 5′ ancestral
                    peak closer to the +1/+2 nucleosome. Third, preventing lateral histone
                    movement results in a 3′-shifted, flatter ancestral histone profile.</p>
        <p>While our model provided good quantitative fits of ancestral H3 patterns for many
                    genes, we nonetheless note that many genes were not perfectly fit by this model.
                    Generally, we found that the model poorly fit short genes, and overall the model
                    almost universally predicted lower HA/T7 at the +N nucleosome (the last
                    nucleosome in a gene) than was observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s011">Figures S11</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s013">S13</xref>). We
                    ascribe these failures to the fact that we considered each gene in isolation and
                    therefore did not model shifts of old nucleosomes from adjacent genes, which
                    would result in poor fits over short genes in particular. Interestingly, the
                    better fit at the +1 nucleosome than at the +N nucleosome is
                    consistent with rapid promoter turnover more effectively isolating genes from
                    one another at their 5′ ends in vivo.</p>
        <p>Overall, the strong correlation between our model and the experimental data
                    supports the hypothesis that at least three dynamic processes affect nucleosomes
                    and shape the landscape of ancestral histone retention and provide the first
                    quantitative estimate of maternal histone dynamics during replication.</p>

        <p>To investigate this link experimentally, we examined whether mutations of the H4
                    tail influenced ancestral histone H3 retention. In an H4K5,12R mutant that
                    cannot be acetylated on these two tail residues, the 5′-biased HA/T7 was
                    partially lost (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s008">Figure S8B</xref>), consistent with the possibility that acetylation of H4
                    tail lysines may contribute to H3/H4 passback. We also deleted the H4 N-terminal
                    tail, although in this strain background this mutation proved lethal and so all
                    recovered strains retained a wild-type copy of the H4-H3 locus
                        (<italic>HHF2-HHT2</italic>). Thus, results with this strain must be
                    interpreted with extreme caution, as we do not know the effect of wild-type,
                    untagged nucleosomes on the behavior of the epitope-tagged histones.</p>
        <p>Nonetheless we present here results of mapping of HA and T7 3 generations after
                    release from the HA/T7 tag swap, since the H4 tail deletion has dramatic effects
                    on global nucleosome dynamics (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), with low HA/T7 at 5′ ends followed by a nearly
                    flat profile over the remainder of coding regions. This profile suggests a
                    requirement for the H4 tail in H3/H4 passback, and possibly on
                    replication-mediated spreading (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). Interestingly, the effect of H4 tail deletion was much
                    more pronounced at TFIID-dominated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), suggesting that the exaggerated
                    H3/H4 passback inferred at these genes involves the H4 tail. The effects of the
                    H4 tail deletion were not simply due to the extensive changes in the
                    transcriptome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Yu1">[43]</xref>, as we measured changes in genome-wide RNA Pol2
                    localization in our H4 mutant strains, finding that the relationship between
                    Pol2 levels and HA/T7 behavior qualitatively changed in this mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s014">Figure
                    S14</xref>). While we must be cautious interpreting results obtained with the H4
                    tail deletion, the fact that H4K5,12R mutants (which were viable and did not
                    retain any wild-type H3/H4) also exhibit diminished 5′ bias in ancestral
                    H3 retention provides independent support for a key role for the H4 tail in
                    H3/H4 passback.</p>
        <p>We also explored the role of supercoiling in the 5′-biased retention of old
                    histones. Topoisomerases relax DNA supercoiling and thereby help to maintain
                    chromatin architecture. Transcription of DNA templates by Pol2 differentially
                    affects supercoiling in front of and behind the passing polymerase, thereby
                    differentially affecting 5′ and 3′ nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Pommier1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Koster1">[45]</xref>. To assess the role of this
                    activity in 5′ accumulation of old histones, we examined the consequences
                    of inactivation of the major topoisomerase Top1, which in vitro can resolve both
                    negative and positive supercoils <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-FernandezBeros1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Goto1">[47]</xref>. Cells

                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), indicating
                    that resolving DNA topology problems before or after passage of the
                    transcription or replication machinery influences the mobility and/or stability
                    of nucleosomes. Consistent with expectations of a greater buildup of supercoils
                    over longer transcription units, we confirmed a stronger effect of
                        <italic>TOP1</italic> deletion at longer genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7F</xref>).</p>

        <p>We finally turn to the role of replication factors in ancestral histone
                    retention. We first asked whether replication timing affected H3-HA retention.
                    Nucleosomes surrounding early-firing origins tended to lose H3-HA more rapidly
                    than late-firing origins (unpublished data), but this likely stems from the fact
                    that replication timing correlates with replication-independent turnover <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Deal1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kaplan1">[26]</xref>. Focusing
                    only on nearby coding regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s015">Figure S15</xref>), we found that late-replicating
                    genes were associated with slightly 5′ shifted ancestral H3 peaks relative
                    to genes near early origins (consistent with decreased spreading or turnover),
                    suggesting that different replication forks might affect chromatin in different
                    ways, although the modest effect precludes a stronger interpretation.</p>
        <p>To directly address the role of fork-associated chromatin proteins in histone
                    spreading at replication, we examined mutations of PCNA and Chromatin Assembly
                    Factor (CAF-1), which plays a key role in replication-coupled histone deposition

                    interactions with replication proteins or with replication-coupled
                    chromatin-assembly factors showed only minor effects on 5′ retention of

                        (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s008">Figure
                        S8C</xref>). In contrast, ancestral H3 retention at the 5′ ends of

                    CAF-1 subunit <italic>CAC1</italic> (unpublished data). To further explore the
                    role of CAF-1 in histone retention patterns, we deep sequenced HA and T7 tags
                    from <italic>cac1Δ</italic> yeast 3 generations after release (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g008">Figure 8</xref>). These data show a
                    dramatic 5′ shift in the peak of ancestral H3 retention in these mutants.
                    This shift is most consistent with a decrease in histone turnover at the
                    5′ ends of genes in this mutant, which we have independently confirmed
                    using G1-arrested yeast expressing p<italic>GAL</italic>-driven Flag-H3 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-LopesdaRosa1">[50]</xref>.
                    However, we cannot rule out the possibility that the role of CAF-1 in retention
                    of old histones in 5′ and promoter regions involves interactions with PCNA
                    during DNA replication. Interestingly, the 5′ accumulation observed in
                    wild-type yeast is otherwise little changed in the CAF-1 mutant over long genes

                    normal, and that preferential retention of old histones at their maternal
                    locations may be carried out by alternative histone chaperones such as the Hir

        <title>Consequences for Histone Modification Patterns</title>
        <p>Our results are most consistent with histone retrogression from 3′ to
                    5′ over genes, which raises the question of whether old histones carry
                    modifications associated with mid- and 3′ coding regions (e.g., H3K36 and
                    H3K79 methylation) towards the 5′ end of genes. Alternatively, there could
                    be active erasure of these modifications. We therefore compared genes exhibiting
                    high levels of ancestral H3 retention with prior genome-wide analyses of histone
                    modifications <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Pokholok1">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Schulze1">[53]</xref>. Histone modification patterns generally conformed to
                    the patterns expected based on transcriptional behavior—genes that retain
                    high levels of ancestral histones are poorly transcribed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2D</xref>), and correspondingly exhibit low
                    levels of transcription-related marks H3K9ac, H3K14ac, H4ac, and H3K4
                    methylation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s017">Figure S17</xref> and unpublished data). However, these are all

                    therefore not expected to accumulate with age.</p>
        <p>More interestingly, we found that genes with high levels of old nucleosomes were
                    enriched for H3K79me3 throughout their coding regions, particularly at the

                    with the above hypotheses that old histones move from 3′ to 5′ and
                    thus might carry typical mid-CDS and 3′-end histone modifications to the

      <p>The fate of stable proteins in rapidly dividing cells is of great interest for fields

                understanding of the fate of specific maternal histone proteins during the

                states require that old nucleosomes are retained near their original positions,

        <title>Ancestral Histones Accumulate at the 5′ Ends of Genes</title>
        <p>Most surprising to us was the observation that ancestral H3 molecules accumulate
                    near the 5′ ends of coding regions, peaking around the +3 nucleosome.
                    The high HA/T7 ratio observed at the 5′ ends of genes is not an artifact
                    of the epitope tags used, as we have observed the converse behavior (high T7/HA)
                    when we switch the epitope tags used (unpublished data). Furthermore, this
                    unusual behavior is not an artifact of the conditions used for growth arrest and
                    release, as we observe a similar 5′/3′ gradient of H3-HA when yeast
                    are subjected to the epitope switch during active midlog growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s010">Figure
                    S10</xref>).</p>
        <p>What is the mechanistic basis for the 5′/3′ gradient of HA/T7 we
                    observe? We consider two classes of mechanisms—in one, histone proteins do
                    not move laterally and the 5′/3′ gradient results from preferential
                    loss of 3′ H3/H4, while in the other the gradient results from lateral
                    histone movement combined with loss at the 5′ end. While we cannot
                    definitively answer which mechanism explains our results, we strongly disfavor a
                    model with preferential 3′ nucleosome eviction and no lateral movement
                    based on the following observations. First, we tested a number of relevant
                    mutants for changes in the 5′/3′ HA/T7 bias (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s008">Figure S8</xref>).
                    Loss of H3K4 methylation (a 5′-biased histone mark) or H3K36 methylation
                    (a mid and 3′-biased histone mark) did not affect HA/T7 patterns at
                    selected target genes. Similarly, 5′ retention of ancestral H3 was
                    unaffected by mutants of cohesin, whose loading is associated with regions of
                    high H3/H4 turnover and which accumulates at the 3′ ends of genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Glynn1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Lengronne1">[28]</xref>. Second,
                    direct measurements of H3/H4 turnover using a p<italic>GAL</italic>-driven
                    epitope tagged H3 do not provide evidence for ubiquitous 3′ histone
                    replacement during G1 arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref>, during G2/M arrest <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kaplan1">[26]</xref>, or in unsynchronized yeast
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref>. Thus,
                    while we cannot definitively rule out some cryptic 3′ replacement event in
                    this system, all direct tests have failed to support this hypothesis.</p>
        <p>Conversely, multiple observations support the hypothesis that H3/H4 proteins move
                    from 3′ to 5′ over protein-coding regions over time. First, seminal
                    in vitro studies on transcription of nucleosomal templates showed that several
                    RNA polymerases can transcribe through a nucleosome without displacing the H3/H4
                    tetramer. The proposed mechanism by which histones remain associated with the
                    DNA is a “bubble propagation” mechanism—DNA partially unwraps
                    from the histones, RNA polymerase enters, and DNA behind the polymerase
                    re-associates with the histone octamer, resulting in a net retrograde movement
                    of histones after the polymerase has passed. This mechanism is relatively well
                    established for SP6 polymerase and RNA Polymerase III <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Studitsky1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Studitsky2">[31]</xref>, whereas there is some
                    controversy regarding the effect of RNA Polymerase II on nucleosome positioning
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kulaeva1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Hodges1">[33]</xref>. Of course, it is not unreasonable to expect that
                    nucleosome movement during transcription in vivo will also be affected by
                    polymerase-associated factors such as histone chaperones and ATP-dependent
                    remodelers that are not present in the in vitro systems. In any case, these
                    studies provide a plausible mechanism by which RNA polymerase transit results in
                    retrograde nucleosome movement.</p>
        <p>Second, we have previously found that inactivation of Pol2 using the
                    temperature-sensitive <italic>rpb1-1</italic> allele results in a net 5′
                    to 3′ shift in the majority of coding region nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Weiner1">[34]</xref>, consistent
                    with the hypothesis that polymerase transit normally shuttles nucleosomes from
                    3′ to 5′. Third, highly transcribed genes (such as those encoding
                    ribosomal proteins) in yeast paradoxically exhibit very tightly spaced coding
                    region nucleosomes (e.g., 155–160 bp between adjacent nucleosomes rather
                    than ∼165 bp), and this tight spacing relaxes upon Pol2 inactivation, again
                    consistent with nucleosomes being passed upstream during transcription <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Weiner1">[34]</xref>. Taken
                    together with the absence of any evidence for 3′ H3/H4 eviction, we
                    therefore argue that the most parsimonious explanation of the surprising
                    5′ accumulation of ancestral histones is retrograde movement of histones
                    over genes against the direction of transcription. Note that while we favor the
                    hypothesis that the act of RNA polymerase transit itself is the mechanism
                    linking transcription to H3/H4 passback, polymerase is not the only candidate
                    factor leading to retrograde histone movement. Notably, we found that
                        <italic>top1Δ</italic> mutants exhibit diminished signatures of H3/H4
                    passback (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7</xref>), and
                    this decrease was stronger at longer genes, suggesting the possibility that some
                    aspect of cleavage and rotation of twisted DNA by Top1 contributes to the
                    passback observed. However, it is also possible that Top1 differentially affects
                    histone turnover in 5′ and 3′ regions or affects passback by
                    affecting Pol2 passage <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-DurandDubief1">[60]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We analytically assess several predictions of the “passback” model.
                    First of all, if RNA polymerase transit were the driver of retrograde histone
                    movement, then one might predict that passback should correlate with
                    transcription rate. We find the expected correlation to be statistically
                    significant (<italic>p</italic> = 9.6439e-19, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s012">Figure S12</xref>)
                    but weak nonetheless (R = 0.12). Importantly, we previously
                    observed that 5′ to 3′ nucleosome movement in
                        <italic>rpb1-1</italic> mutants was also significantly but poorly correlated
                    with transcription rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Weiner1">[34]</xref>. The reason for the mediocre correlation between
                    polymerase abundance and passback is hinted at by the fact that TFIID-dominated
                    genes exhibit much greater passback values than do SAGA-dominated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We have previously
                    noted that SAGA-dominated (“stress”) genes exhibit higher levels of
                    H3 turnover, <italic>per polymerase</italic>, than do TFIID-dominated genes
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref>. In
                    vitro, a single polymerase's transit displaces an H2A/H2B dimer from the
                    histone octamer, but a second polymerase encountering a histone hexamer will
                    displace the remaining histones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kulaeva2">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kulaeva3">[62]</xref>. Coupled with the
                    observation that SAGA-dominated genes exhibit larger “bursts” of
                    polymerase, this suggests that closely spaced polymerases are required for H3/H4
                    eviction over coding regions, but evenly spaced polymerases leave time for dimer
                    replacement on damaged nucleosomes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Rando1">[54]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kulaeva3">[62]</xref>. We believe this model
                    also explains some of the behavior of ancestral histones in this
                    study—SAGA-dominated genes display little passback and overall diminished
                    levels of ancestral H3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure
                        7A–B</xref>), an expected consequence of the loss of old histones via
                    turnover. Correlations between polymerase and passback are therefore expected to
                    be subtle—at increasing transcription rates, we expect an increased
                    likelihood of a closely spaced pair of polymerases, and the resulting H3/H4
                    eviction would eliminate any trace of the passback that had occurred to that
                    point.</p>
        <p>It is important to note that the transcription-dependent passback postulated here
                    cannot simply be interpreted as a model in which every round of polymerase
                    passage shifts the histone octamer upstream by one position (∼165 bp). In
                        <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7A</xref>, our estimates
                    of passback per cell cycle have a mean of ∼90 bp at TFIID-dominated genes,
                    less than the spacing between adjacent nucleosomes. If taken literally, these
                    values would be difficult to reconcile with the observation that the majority of
                    yeast nucleosomes are well positioned <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Yuan1">[20]</xref>. Instead, we interpret the
                    passback values in terms of probability that an octamer will be passed back in a
                    given cell cycle in each cell—a passback value of ∼80 bp suggests that
                    there is a 50% chance that histones on a given gene will be shifted back
                    one position towards the 5′ end in a single cell cycle. Physically, we
                    imagine that polymerase passage results in relatively short retrograde movement
                    of H3/H4, which then have some probability of returning to their original
                    position, and some probability of shifting to a new upstream location.</p>
        <p>Our results show a surprising pattern of ancestral histone retention in yeast,
                    with old histone proteins accumulating near the 5′ ends of genes—the
                    histone proteins located at the +3 nucleosome are the oldest histone
                    proteins over a typical yeast gene. These data are best explained by a model in
                    which H3/H4 proteins shuttle from 3′ to 5′ over coding regions over
                    time, with eventual loss of old histone proteins when they are eventually moved
                    into the +1 and +2 nucleosome positions.</p>

        <title>Maternal Histone Spreading During Replication</title>
        <p>The process of genomic replication is enormously disruptive to chromatin
                    structure, as the melting of the DNA double helix is accompanied by histone
                    dissociation from the genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Annunziato1">[4]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Kaufman1">[7]</xref>. Thus,
                    understanding where maternal histones re-associate relative to the locus from
                    which they were evicted is a key constraint for understanding the potential of
                    chromatin as an epigenetic information carrier. The ideal experiment for
                    measuring this would be to epitope tag the histones at one specific locus (e.g.,
                    the +5 nucleosome over <italic>BUD3</italic>) in a large population of
                    yeast, allow replication to proceed, and measure the new locations of the tagged
                    histones. Despite numerous attempts, this type of tagging has proven technically
                    intractable to date. Here we measure instead the bulk distribution of ancestral
                    histones. Importantly, this still provides information on locus-specific histone
                    behavior—as turnover rates are not homogeneous across the genome, even
                    before we release yeast into the cell cycle the landscape of H3-HA exhibits
                    variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g004">Figure 4</xref>, see
                    generation 0), and so in effect only a subset of ancestral locations are
                    epitope-tagged before release. This enables us to infer the dynamic behavior of
                    histone proteins during replication via analysis of the evolution of the H3-HA
                    distributions over time.</p>
        <p>Two observations provide an intuition regarding the effects of replication on
                    histone locations. First, ancestral histone retention exhibits the expected
                    anticorrelation with replication-independent turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). However, old histones are more
                    efficiently retained at cold (low turnover) loci that occur in long cold
                    domains, whereas short domains of cold nucleosomes lose ancestral histones over
                    time. This observation is inconsistent with two extreme models for histone
                    behavior during replication—if old histones were to completely dissociate
                    from the genome during replication and randomly re-associate with the genome,
                    then ancestral histone retention should precisely recapitulate turnover
                    measurements. Conversely, if old histones were to reassociate precisely with
                    their original locations, then ancestral retention should essentially integrate
                    turnover for multiple generations. Thus, some process that shuffles histone
                    proteins locally must be invoked along with turnover to shape the ancestral
                    retention landscape.</p>
        <p>In principle, the preferential retention of old histones on longer genes could
                    simply result from passback—shorter genes will more quickly have all of
                    their histones passed “over a cliff” at the 5′ end. However,
                    we find relatively static 5′/3′ gradients of old histone retention
                    over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g004">Figure 4</xref>). While
                    it is the case that H3-HA domains gradually shorten over time as predicted by
                    the model that passback results in old histones being moved to promoters where
                    they are replaced (unpublished data), this effect is subtle and is
                    quantitatively much less dramatic than predicted from passback alone. This leads
                    to the second intuition regarding histone spreading during replication. Many
                    examples exist for relatively static gradients in biological systems being
                    established via a combination of directional active transport coupled with
                    passive diffusion. Most relevant in our opinion is the “pump leak”
                    model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Hoffmann1">[63]</xref>
                    for membrane ion gradients—active transport of ions across membranes,
                    coupled with a passive leak of ions back into the cell, results in a static
                    gradient. Here, we envision transcription-related passback as the active
                    transport mechanism, with spreading during replication being somewhat analogous
                    to the leak that results in a steady gradient rather than a continuous 3′
                    to 5′ march of histone proteins.</p>
        <p>We present a quantitative model that recapitulates our experimental data with
                    only three dynamic processes—turnover, passback, and spreading.
                    Locus-specific turnover rates were previously measured <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Dion1">[15]</xref> and are not fit by the model.
                    Passback is estimated for each gene separately, while spreading is a single
                    global parameter affecting all histones. Thus, our model has 4,811 free
                    parameters, which are used to fit over 100,000 HA/T7 ratios. This model does not
                    overfit the data, and this can best be appreciated by the fact that eliminating
                    a single parameter (spreading) greatly diminishes the agreement between model
                    and data.</p>
        <p>Using this model, we estimate that maternal histones spread little
                    (∼1–2 nucleosomes) during replication. This value has not been
                    measured before but is consistent with several related observations. First,
                    electron microscopy studies on replicating chromatin show a stretch of
                    ∼650–1,100 bp of nucleosome-free DNA surrounding replication forks
                        <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Gasser1">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Sogo1">[36]</xref>, consistent
                    with histone movement of ±400 bp we estimate here. Second, histone
                    proteins are retained in cis during in vitro replication even in the presence of
                    competitor DNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-BonneAndrea1">[64]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Gruss1">[67]</xref>, indicating that histones do not freely diffuse away
                    from replication forks but likely are retained locally. Finally, we previously
                    observed that upon gene repression, loss of the active chromatin mark H3K4me3
                    occurs during S phase, but at very highly methylated nucleosomes H3K4me3 does
                    not return to baseline levels immediately, with methylation levels falling
                    little more than the 2-fold predicted by a dilution-based mechanism (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s005">Figure S5</xref>
                    in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-RadmanLivaja2">[68]</xref>). This final result indicates that
                    “overmethylated” old histone proteins are retained near their
                    original location, since extensive spreading of old histone proteins would
                    enable a greater than 2-fold drop in methylation levels during S phase.</p>
        <p>Together, these results support the prospect of chromatin as a
                    “sloppy” epigenetic information carrier (“sloppy” in the
                    sense that some spreading of histones will preclude mononucleosome-resolution
                    information passage) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Talbert1">[69]</xref>, even if chromatin-based inheritance occurs
                    infrequently <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Ptashne1">[1]</xref>. Thus, chromatin states are unlikely to be inherited
                    with mononucleosome precision, a view consistent with the fact that most or all
                    proposed epigenetic chromatin domains are associated with long (&gt;1 kb) blocks
                    of histone modifications such as H3K9me3 or deacetylated H4K16 (reviewed in

        <title>Mutant Studies</title>
        <p>To further investigate the mechanisms underlying the patterns of ancestral H3
                    retention, we assessed HA/T7 ratios at target genes in 12 mutants and further
                    characterized HA/T7 genome wide for three of these mutants. Interestingly, a
                    number of histone modifying factors, including Swd1, Swd3, Rtt109, Nhp6, and
                    Set2, had either no effect or subtle effects (e.g., Rtt109) on the 5′
                    accumulation of old histones at our target genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s008">Figure S8</xref>).
                    These results suggest either that these mutants will have subtle global effects
                    on ancestral H3 retention or that they have more localized roles that do not
                    extend to the two target genes on which we focused.</p>
        <p>The three mutants we characterized at full genome coverage each had a distinct
                    effect on ancestral H3 retention. Most dramatically, loss of the H4 N-terminal
                    tail abolished the 5′ accumulation of ancestral histones—while the
                    H4 tail deletion results are complicated by the retention of wild-type H3/H4 in
                    this strain, the fact that similar results were obtained with clean H4K5,12R
                    mutants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s008">Figure
                        S8B</xref>) provides independent support for observations obtained with the
                    H4 tail deletion. The mechanistic basis for the loss of 5′ H3-HA retention
                    is unknown to us—a flat HA/T7 profile is of course consistent with
                    complete loss of passback. Alternatively, the observed profile in this mutant
                    could be consistent with complete shuffling of maternal histones every
                    generation, which as described above would be expected to more closely
                    recapitulate a turnover-dominated profile. Importantly, loss of the H4 tail also
                    affects H3/H4 turnover—in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g007">Figure 7D</xref>, the increased HA/T7 ratio at the 5′ ends of
                    SAGA-dominated genes suggests a decrease in histone turnover in this mutant, and
                    we have independently confirmed a decrease in replication-independent turnover
                    in this mutant (F.v.L., manuscript in preparation). Analysis of Pol2 ChIP in H4
                    tail deletions shows that the effects of the H4 tail do not simply reflect
                    altered transcription but instead reflect a change in the relationship between
                    RNA Polymerase and histone dynamics over genes in this mutant (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s014">Figure
                    S14</xref>).</p>
        <p>We also observe a similar, albeit muted, effect of Topoisomerase I on the
                    5′ accumulation of ancestral histones. Interestingly, loss of both
                    topoisomerase I and II affects nucleosome occupancy and dynamics in <italic>S.

                    dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-DurandDubief1">[60]</xref>. Here, we find that <italic>top1Δ</italic>
                    mutants exhibit diminished 5′ accumulation of ancestral H3 and that this
                    effect is stronger at longer genes than at shorter genes. As RNA polymerase
                    passage will cause greater changes in supercoiling over longer genes, the
                    preferential effects of Top1 on longer genes is consistent with the observation
                    in <italic>S. pombe</italic> that topoisomerase mutants show evidence of stalled
                    or slowed RNA polymerase over longer genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-DurandDubief1">[60]</xref>. In addition to its
                    role in transcription, topoisomerase I plays a key role in replication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-Koster1">[45]</xref>. We note
                    that the profile of <italic>top1Δ</italic> mutants here most closely mimics
                    the predictions of our analytical model with both passback and spreading being
                    compromised, but since neither of these is likely to be completely eliminated in
                        <italic>top1Δ</italic> mutants, more detailed kinetic analyses will be
                    required to make a quantitative statement about the role of Top1 in
                    replication-related movement of histones.</p>
        <p>Finally, we assessed the role of the histone chaperone CAF-1 in ancestral H3
                    retention. To our surprise, we found that H3-HA exhibited even stronger 5′
                    accumulation in this mutant, with the 5′ peak of HA/T7 occurring closer to
                    the +1 or +2 nucleosome (compared to the +3 peak location for
                    wild-type strains). This result most closely matches the predictions of a model
                    in which H3/H4 turnover has been slowed without loss of passback or spreading
                        (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g005">Figure 5E</xref>). We recently
                    tested this prediction using an alternative system for measuring
                    replication-independent turnover (p<italic>GAL</italic>-driven Flag-H3) and
                    confirmed the prediction that <italic>caf</italic> mutants affect
                    replication-independent histone replacement <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-LopesdaRosa1">[50]</xref>. As CAF-1 and the Hir
                    complex are known to complement one another in yeast, we predict that a
                        <italic>caf hir</italic> double mutant would be necessary to uncover effects
                    of replication-coupled spreading. Unfortunately, since both <italic>hir</italic>
                    and <italic>asf</italic> mutants are lethal in our strain background, this
                    prediction cannot be tested at present.</p>

        <title>Perspective</title>
        <p>Taken together, our results provide a surprising view of histone dynamics over
                    multiple generations, with 5′ accumulation of ancestral histone proteins
                    over coding regions and little evidence for preferential histone retention at
                    epigenetically regulated loci such as subtelomeric genes. One unanticipated
                    implication of this observation is that 3′ histone marks are expected to
                    move towards the 5′ ends of genes over time, thereby shaping histone
                    modification profiles (as we document in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g009">Figure 9</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s017">Figure
                    S17</xref>). This potentially necessitates mechanisms for erasure of these
                    inappropriate marks in order to maintain accurate encoding of gene polarity.
                    However, we note that active erasure of H3K4me3 after gene repression occurs
                    most efficiently at 5′ ends of genes, whereas nucleosomes over coding
                    regions mostly lose H3K4me3 by passive dilution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001075-RadmanLivaja2">[68]</xref>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001075.s009">Figure S9</xref>).
                    If other old histone marks are not erased over coding regions, then we speculate
                    that the accumulation of old histone proteins at the +3 nucleosome could
                    potentially provide a mechanism by which a gene's transcriptional history
                    could be integrated to play a role in regulation of the transition from
                    transcriptional initiation to elongation.</p>
        <p>Most importantly, we find that old histones do not re-associate with daughter
                    genomes at precisely the locus from which they dissociated. Thus, any
                    inheritance of chromatin states must occur at the scale of ∼5–10
                    nucleosome domains rather than at single nucleosome resolution. These results
                    therefore constrain the maximum amount of information theoretically carried by
                    chromatin between generations. It will be of great interest in future studies to
                    identify mutants that affect histone movement during replication and to measure
                    their effects on the stability of epigenetic inheritance and to measure how
                    maternal histone incorporation differs between leading and lagging strand
                    daughter genomes.</p>

          <p>Short genes and 3′ ends are poorly predicted by the model. Genes are

                        the model predicts excessive old nucleosome loss, or lower HA/T7 ratios than
                        measured. Notably, the +N nucleosome is universally predicted to lose
                        more H3-HA than is measured. This is almost certainly a consequence of the
                        fact that our model considers all genes in isolation—there is no way
                        for histones to spread onto the 3′ end of a gene from adjacent genomic
                        loci in this model, although this likely occurs in vivo.</p>

          <p>The H4 N-terminal tail qualitatively changes the relationship between

                        median HA/T7 over the 5′ 1 kb. (B) Pol2 ChIP was carried out in the H4
                        tail deletion strain 2 generations after release from arrest. Data here show
                        an 80 gene running window average of Pol2 ChIP level per gene. (C) As in
                            <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2D</xref>. Genes
                        with high HA/T7 ratios in the H4 tail deletion mutant actually tend to be
                        slightly <italic>more</italic> enriched for Pol2 than those with low HA/T7
                        levels, the opposite of what is seen in wild-type (although it is important
                        to note that the correlation with Pol2 levels in this mutant is very
                        weak—note that the scale bar for Pol2 ChIP here ranges from −0.1
                        to 0.1, whereas the scale bar in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001075-g002">Figure 2D</xref> ranges from −0.2 to 1).
                        Thus, we can conclude with confidence that the effects of the H4 tail
                        deletion do not simply result from extensive transcription reprogramming in
                        these mutants, since the relationship between Pol2 and H3-HA retention
