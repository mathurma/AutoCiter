<p>Timed pulses of WNT and FGF signaling convert human and mouse pluripotent stem cells into neuromesodermal progenitors that can be directed to differentiate into spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm cells</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Cells of the spinal cord and somites arise from shared, dual-fated precursors, located towards the posterior of the elongating embryo. Here we show that these neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs) can readily be generated <italic>in vitro</italic> from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells by activating Wnt and Fgf signalling, timed to emulate <italic>in vivo</italic> development. Similar to NMPs <italic>in vivo</italic>, these cells co-express the neural factor Sox2 and the mesodermal factor Brachyury and differentiate into neural and paraxial mesoderm <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic>. The neural cells produced by NMPs have spinal cord but not anterior neural identity and can differentiate into spinal cord motor neurons. This is consistent with the shared origin of spinal cord and somites and the distinct ontogeny of the anterior and posterior nervous system. Systematic analysis of the transcriptome during differentiation identifies the molecular correlates of each of the cell identities and the routes by which they are obtained. Moreover, we take advantage of the system to provide evidence that Brachyury represses neural differentiation and that signals from mesoderm are not necessary to induce the posterior identity of spinal cord cells. This indicates that the mesoderm inducing and posteriorising functions of Wnt signalling represent two molecularly separate activities. Together the data illustrate how reverse engineering normal developmental mechanisms allows the differentiation of specific cell types <italic>in vitro</italic> and the analysis of previous difficult to access aspects of embryo development.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Stem cells are providing insight into embryo development and offering new approaches to clinical and therapeutic research. In part this progress arises from “directed differentiation” – artificially controlling the types of cells produced from stem cells. Here we describe the directed differentiation of mouse and human pluripotent stem cells into cells of the spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm (the tissue that generates muscle and bone that is normally found adjacent to the spinal cord). During embryo development, spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm arise from a shared group of precursors known as neuromesodermal progenitors (NMPs). We show that signals to which NMPs are exposed in embryos can be used to generate NMPs from pluripotent stem cells in a dish. We define conditions for the conversion of these NMPs into either spinal cord or mesoderm cells. Using these conditions, we provide evidence that the decision between spinal cord and mesoderm involves a gene, <italic>Brachyury</italic>, that promotes mesoderm production by inhibiting spinal cord generation. Together the data illustrate how mimicking normal embryonic development allows the generation of specific cell types from stem cells and that this can be used to analyse cells that are otherwise difficult to study.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The differentiation of embryonic stem cells (ESCs) to specific cell types offers insight into developmental mechanisms and has potential therapeutic applications. For example the differentiation of neural progenitors (NPCs) from monolayers of ESCs seeded in serum free conditions is a model of neural induction and regional patterning <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Ying1">[1]</xref>. In the absence of additional signals, NPCs differentiated from ESCs adopt an anterior-dorsal neural (telencephalon) identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Ying1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Simeone1">[2]</xref>. The addition of Sonic Hedgehog (Shh) ventralises these neural progenitors, mimicking the <italic>in vivo</italic> role of Shh <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Jessell1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Panman1">[4]</xref>. Exposing NPCs to retinoic acid (RA) results in the repression of anterior identity and the induction of genes that typify hindbrain and anterior spinal cord (cervical) identity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wichterle1">[5]</xref>. This has been taken as support for the idea that newly generated NPCs are by default anterior and are then posteriorised by exposure to specific extrinsic signals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Kiecker1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Nieuwkoop1">[7]</xref>. It is notable, however, that RA is actively excluded in the progenitors of the posterior spinal cord after gastrulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-OliveraMartinez1">[8]</xref> and that commonly used ESC differentiation protocols do not efficiently generate neural cells of the more posterior spinal cord such as thoracic and lumbar spinal cord cells marked by posterior Hox gene expression, including Hoxc8–10 expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Liu1">[9]</xref>.</p>
<p>The anterior and posterior nervous system has distinct origins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Mathis1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Forlani1">[12]</xref>. Anterior epiblast expresses <italic>Otx2</italic> and contributes cells to the anterior nervous system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Simeone1">[2]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-McGrew1">[13]</xref> whereas spinal cord progenitors are located posteriorly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Cambray1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wilson1">[16]</xref>. Clonal analysis indicates that the spinal cord shares a common lineage, at least in part, with the trunk paraxial mesoderm that forms the somites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tzouanacou1">[15]</xref>. The dual-fated neuromesodermal precursors (NMPs) of these tissues are located in the node-streak border (NSB), caudal lateral epiblast (CLE) cell layer adjacent to the regressing node and the chordoneural hinge of the tail bud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-McGrew1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Cambray1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-DelfinoMachin1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Kondoh1">[18]</xref>. Cells in these regions coexpress the neural marker Sox2 and nascent mesoderm marker Brachyury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-OliveraMartinez1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tsakiridis1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Martin1">[20]</xref>. Genetic lineage tracing experiments confirm that many spinal cord cells previously expressed Brachyury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Imuta1">[21]</xref> indicating that as cells from regions harbouring NMPs move into the neural tube they downregulate <italic>Brachyury</italic> but maintain <italic>Sox2</italic> expression and consolidate neural identity. By contrast, NMPs that enter the primitive streak delaminate basally, downregulate <italic>Sox2</italic> and acquire expression of the paraxial mesoderm marker <italic>Tbx6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Takemoto1">[22]</xref> en route to somite formation. Strikingly, in embryos lacking <italic>Tbx6</italic>, paraxial mesoderm cells express Sox2 and transdifferentiate into neural cells, providing additional support for the inter-relationship between spinal cord and somitic mesoderm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Takemoto1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Chapman2">[24]</xref>. As yet, however, the existence of NMPs has only been revealed <italic>in vivo</italic> and the inaccessibility of this population makes them difficult to study.</p>
<p>The region occupied by NMPs is exposed to Wnt and Fgf ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wilson1">[16]</xref>. These signals are required for body axis elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wilson1">[16]</xref> and both Wnt and Fgf signalling have been implicated in mesoderm and neural induction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Takemoto1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Streit1">[25]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Stern1">[31]</xref>. <italic>In vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> evidence has suggested that Wnt signalling is responsible for posteriorising tissue by inducing posterior Hox genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Mazzoni1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Nordstrom1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-vandeVen1">[33]</xref>. Together, the data suggest that the generation of posterior neural tissue and paraxial mesoderm proceeds by Wnt and Fgf signalling inducing a neuromesodermal bipotential intermediate. To test this idea, we developed an efficient <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation method for spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm from mouse and human pluripotent stem cells. We show that carefully timed and calibrated pulses of Wnt and Fgf signalling generate a population of cells that transiently coexpress Sox2 and Brachyury in which the expression of posterior Hox genes are induced. Transcriptome analysis is consistent with the equivalence of these cells to the NMPs found <italic>in vivo</italic>. <italic>In vivo</italic> grafting and directed <italic>in vitro</italic> differentiation confirm the ability of NMPs to assume spinal cord or paraxial mesoderm cell fates. We further show that Brachyury is not required for the production of posterior neural cells or for the induction of posterior Hox genes, hence separating the posteriorising and mesoderm inducing functions of Wnt signalling. Taken together the data define a means to generate posterior neural and paraxial mesodermal tissues <italic>in vitro</italic> and illustrate how the directed differentiation of stem cells provides novel insight into developmental mechanism.</p>

<title>Generation of Neural Progenitor Cells with Spinal Cord Identity</title>
<p>To identify conditions for the generation of posterior neural cells from monolayers of mouse ES cells (mESCs), we cultured mESCs in serum free media containing bFgf for 3 days (D1–D3) and then transferred these to media lacking bFgf for an additional 2 days <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Ying1">[1]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). This resulted in the induction of a post-implantation epiblast-like intermediate by D2, indicated by the downregulation of the “naïve” pluripotency marker Zfp42 (Rex1) and the upregulation of the epiblast marker Fgf5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tesar1">[34]</xref>. At this stage, Pou5f1, which is expressed in both mESCs and epiblast-like cells, is maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tesar1">[34]</xref>. In all experiments a Shh agonist, SAG, was added at D3 in order to generate a predictable ventralised identity for subsequent comparisons. The transcriptome of cells was then analysed at D5 by mRNA-seq. Consistent with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Watanabe1">[35]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Colombo1">[39]</xref>, cells in these conditions had acquired an anterior neural identity (N<sub>A</sub>), exemplified by the expression of <italic>Otx1</italic> and <italic>Otx2</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Simeone1">[2]</xref>. The presence of SAG induced the expression of ventral neural markers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). Addition of retinoic acid (RA) and SAG to differentiating mESCs at D3 downregulated anterior neural markers (e.g. <italic>Otx2, Six3, Lhx5</italic>) and instead genes typical of hindbrain identity, including <italic>Hoxa2</italic>, <italic>Hoxb2</italic>, <italic>Mafb</italic>, <italic>Epha4</italic> and <italic>Ephb2</italic> were expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tumpel1">[40]</xref>. However markers of spinal regions of the neural tube, such as the 5′ Hox genes <italic>Hoxc6</italic>, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic> were not detected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wichterle1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Liu1">[9]</xref>.

<title>Generation of neural cells with specific AP identities from ESCs.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic representation of differentiation conditions used for the generation of NPCs with specific Anterior (N<sub>A</sub>), Hindbrain (N<sub>H</sub>) and Spinal cord (N<sub>P</sub>) identities. (B) Relative expression levels of the indicated genes from N<sub>A</sub>, N<sub>H</sub> and N<sub>P</sub> cells at day 5 (D5) of differentiation indicate that N<sub>A</sub>, N<sub>H</sub> and N<sub>P</sub> cells express distinct sets of genes. The standard scores (z-scores) of the indicated genes from mRNA-seq analysis reveals that N<sub>A</sub> cells express high levels of forebrain markers including <italic>Otx1</italic> and <italic>Otx2</italic>; N<sub>H</sub> cells express genes characteristic of hindbrain including <italic>Mafb</italic> and <italic>Hoxa2</italic> genes; N<sub>P</sub> cells express high levels of posterior 5′ Hox genes including <italic>Hoxc8</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic>. The individual Z-score for each replicate is indicated on the graph with circles, triangles and squares. (C) Time course of Hoxb and Hoxc cluster activation in cells cultured in N<sub>H</sub> and N<sub>P</sub> conditions showing fold change compared to D1. Posterior Hox genes are selectively activated only in the N<sub>P</sub> conditions and show temporal colinearity with the induction of anterior Hox genes prior to posterior Hox genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Kmita1">[74]</xref>. In N<sub>H</sub> cells <italic>Hoxb1</italic> and <italic>Hoxb2</italic> are induced prior to <italic>Hoxc4</italic>. However, the more posterior Hox genes are not induced. By contrast, in N<sub>P</sub> conditions the 5′ Hox genes <italic>Hoxc6</italic>, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic> are induced at D4 and their expression is maintained at day 5. (Note log<sub>2</sub> scale). (D) Immunohistochemistry indicates that N<sub>H</sub> cells analysed at D8 differentiate into MNs of hindbrain identity coexpressing Hoxb4 and Phox2b. (E) N<sub>P</sub> cells exposed to SAG generate spinal neurons coexpressing Hoxc6 and Hoxc9 with b-tubulin (Tuj1). These were not detected in N<sub>H</sub> conditions. Coexpression of Hoxc6 and Hoxc9 with Islet1 indicates the generation of spinal MNs of forelimb and thoracic identity, respectively. These MNs also expressed Lim3/Raldh2 and HB9. (F) Graph showing the standard scores (z-scores) of Zfp42 (Rex1), Pou5F1 (Oct3/4) and Fgf5 from the mRNA-seq from D1 to D3. The kinetics of gene expression indicate that ESCs progressively lose their stem cell identity and acquire a transient epiblast identity at D2. (G) Hoxc6/Tuj1 and Hoxc9/Tuj1 positive cells were quantified in independent fields of D8 cells differentiated in N<sub>P</sub> conditions. All data used to generate the plots of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1</xref> can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s009">Data S1</xref>.</p>

<p>To recapitulate the sequence of signalling events that generate the spinal cord, we seeded mESCs into serum free media containing bFgf. At D2, Wnt signalling was induced by the addition of the Wnt agonist CHIR99021 (CHIR). bFgf and Wnt agonist were removed at D3 and cells exposed to media containing RA and SAG until D5. Examination of gene expression profiles indicated that cells subjected to the FGF/CHIR/RA regime expressed genes characteristic of the spinal cord including high levels of 5′ Hox genes <italic>Hoxb6, Hoxb8, Hoxc6, Hoxc8, Hoxc9</italic> and low levels of the anterior neural and brainstem markers <italic>Otx2</italic> and <italic>Mafb</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Together, the data suggested that a brief pulse of Wnt signalling between D2–D3 was sufficient to posteriorise differentiating mESCs. We termed the neural cells generated in this regime N<sub>P</sub> cells and cells that display anterior and brainstem identity N<sub>A</sub> and N<sub>H</sub>, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>
<p>We confirmed the posteriorisation and neural identity of N<sub>p</sub> cells using qRT-PCR and immunostaining (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s001">Figure S1C</xref>–D). Analysis of the time course of Hox gene expression in N<sub>H</sub> and N<sub>P</sub> cells indicated that their temporal sequence of induction matched the <italic>in vivo</italic> time course <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tumpel1">[40]</xref>: <italic>Hoxb1</italic> was induced within 12 h of exposure to Wnt signalling, whereas more 5′ Hox genes were induced later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Notably the more posterior Hox genes, e.g, <italic>Hoxc6</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic> were not induced in N<sub>H</sub> cells. In N<sub>p</sub> cells <italic>Hoxc6</italic>, <italic>Hoxc8</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic> were strongly induced at D4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Delaying the addition of CHIR to differentiating mESCs until D3 resulted in a concomitant shift in the timing of Hox gene induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–C). Furthermore, in agreement with studies indicating that RA represses the most posterior Hox genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Nordstrom2">[41]</xref>, exposure of cells to FGF/CHIR without subsequent addition of RA induced <italic>Hoxc10</italic> characteristic of the lumbar spinal cord (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s002">Figure S2E</xref>). Finally we passaged N<sub>H</sub> and N<sub>P</sub> cells at D5 and allowed them to differentiate until D8, at which point we assayed the expression of genes expressed in motor neurons (MNs). Both N<sub>H</sub> and N<sub>P</sub> cells adopted a neuronal morphology and expressed the neuronal marker class III β-tubulin (Tuj1).

<title>Generation of N<sub>P</sub> Cells Proceeds via Neuromesodermal Progenitors</title>
<p>To address how the combination of Wnt and Fgf signalling induces spinal cord identity we examined gene expression in differentiating ESCs at D2.5 and D3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). ESCs that had been exposed to Fgf/Wnt signalling for 12 h (D2.5) and 24 h (D3) induced the expression of <italic>Cdx2</italic> and the mesoderm transcription factors <italic>Brachyury</italic> and <italic>Tbx6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). Recombinant Wnt3a protein had a similar activity to CHIR in these assays (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s002">Figure S2F</xref>). By contrast, ESCs cultured in the absence of Wnt agonist, expressed significantly lower levels of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). These data suggest that Wnt signalling, in combination with Fgf, is initiating a mesodermal transcriptional program.

Activation of Wnt signalling with CHIR upregulated Brachyury within 12 h.

(C) Immunostaining of cells treated with FGF/Wnt revealed the coexpression of Brachyury with Sox2 (NMPs). In the absence of Wnt, NPCs express Sox2 but the expression of Brachyury is only evident in a very small proportion of cells. (D) mRNA expression values of neural (<italic>Sox1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic>, <italic>Sox3</italic>) and mesodermal progenitors markers (<italic>Tbx6</italic>, <italic>Bra</italic>, <italic>Msgn1</italic>) in posterior neural (N<sub>P</sub>) and mesodermal cells (Meso) at D5 show the generation of distinct populations depending on treatment after D3. Removal of Wnt at D3 results in the generation of neural cells expressing Sox1–3 whereas continued Wnt exposure induces expression of Tbx6, Brachyury and Msgn1, characteristic of paraxial mesodermal. (E) Immunostaining indicates that continued Wnt exposure generates paraxial mesodermal progenitors that express Tbx6 at D5 and Desmin and MyoD at D8.

<p>It was also noticeable that the levels of <italic>Sox2</italic> mRNA were transiently reduced in D2.5 and D3 N<sub>P</sub> cells treated with FGF/CHIR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). We therefore assayed Sox2 and Brachyury proteins by immunostaining in D3 N<sub>P</sub> and N<sub>A</sub> cells. Strikingly, the level of Sox2 protein was similar in N<sub>P</sub> and N<sub>A</sub> cells, consistent with the long half-life of Sox2 protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Buckley1">[46]</xref>. Moreover, ∼80% of N<sub>P</sub> cells coexpressed Brachyury and Sox2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) whereas only a small number of N<sub>A</sub> cells expressed Brachyury. These data suggest that the exposure to bFgf and Wnt signalling induces a cell identity reminiscent of the dual-fated neuromesodermal progenitors present during axial elongation in the CLE <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tzouanacou1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-OliveraMartinez2">[44]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s004">Figure S4E</xref>).</p>
<p>If D2–D3 N<sub>P</sub> cells represent NMPs, they should form mesoderm. To test this, we transferred cells at D3 into media containing Wnt agonist but lacking bFgf. In these conditions (termed Meso) the expression of <italic>Sox1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and <italic>Brachyury</italic> were downregulated and several genes characteristic of paraxial mesoderm, including <italic>Tbx6</italic> and <italic>Msgn1</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wittler1">[47]</xref>, were significantly upregulated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). Immunostaining revealed that more than 90% of cells in this condition expressed Tbx6 protein at D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). By D8 Desmin, the intermediate filament protein of muscle sarcomeres <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Paulin1">[48]</xref> and the muscle transcription factor MyoD were highly expressed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2E</xref>). Thus the continued exposure of cells to Wnt signalling induces a paraxial mesodermal identity that differentiates to a muscle-like identity. This provides evidence that ESCs exposed to Wnt and bFgf at D2–D3 represent bipotential neuromesodermal cells that can differentiate into either mesoderm or neural tissue.</p>
<p>We next tested the <italic>in vivo</italic> potential of NMP cells. For these experiments we took advantage of the chick. Cells with NMP-like behaviour have been identified in chick <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wilson1">[16]</xref> and chick embryos provide an accessible and experimentally tractable vertebrate host for grafts of mouse ESCs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Peljto1">[49]</xref>. We grafted small groups of DiI labelled D3 N<sub>A</sub> cells, not exposed to Wnt signalling, or D3 NMPs, exposed to Fgf/Wnt signalling for 24 h, into the caudal lateral epiblast of Hamburger-Hamilton (HH) stage 8–9 chick embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2F</xref>). Analysis of embryos 24 h later revealed efficient incorporation and migration of the NMP cells to both the neural tube and the somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Transplanted cells from a single graft contributed to multiple anterior-posterior levels and most embryos showed contribution to both spinal cord and somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2G–J</xref>). In several embryos grafted cells were also observed in the tail bud of the embryo as well as the neural tube and somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). Contribution to endoderm was not observed. By contrast, transplanted N<sub>A</sub> cells showed somewhat lower rates of engraftment and contributed only to the neural tube and not to somites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g002">Figure 2K–L</xref>). These data confirm the bipotency of the <italic>in vitro derived</italic> NMP cells and demonstrate that similar to <italic>in</italic> vivo NMPs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tzouanacou1">[15]</xref> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-OliveraMartinez2">[44]</xref> they contribute to both neural and paraxial mesoderm lineage.

Strikingly, the first principal component (PC) appeared to represent developmental time and the second PC the tissue identity of the differentiated cells.

By contrast, the induction of genes such as <italic>Tbx6</italic>, <italic>Hes7</italic> and <italic>Hoxc8</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic> in D5 cells subjected to mesodermal conditions confirmed the posterior paraxial identity of these cells. Moreover, the analysis indicated a bifurcation in the transcriptional programmes that generate anterior neural and brainstem cells from those that produce posterior neural and paraxial mesodermal cells. It was notable that gene expression typical of paraxial mesoderm was evident at D4 of N<sub>P</sub> differentiation suggesting a gradual separation of neural and mesodermal identity. Together these data provide a molecular correlate to the distinct cellular origins of anterior and posterior neural tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tzouanacou1">[15]</xref> and identifies the NMP state as the branch point in the developmental trajectories.</p>

<p>We identified genes upregulated in NMPs compared to mESCs at D1 and N<sub>A</sub> cells at D3. Comparing these to genes induced in D5 neural and mesodermal cells revealed a large intersection. Thus, in part, NMPs have a transcriptional programme that is a combination of neural and mesodermal gene expression.

<title>Generation of NMPs from Mouse Epiblast Stem Cells</title>

<p>Assaying a broader panel of genes supported the idea that FGF/CHIR was inducing NMP identity. The expression of the pluripotency factor Nanog was undetectable and the majority of the Sox2 expressing cells expressed minimal levels of Oct4, suggesting that they had exited pluripotency (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s004">Figure S4D</xref>).

We did not observe contributions to endoderm or other tissues.

Strikingly, few cells grafted into the node of E7.5 embryos showed any incorporation (2 out of 8 embryos had 8–10 incorporated cells/embryo), suggesting that these conditions produce a population incompatible with gastrulation-stage development.

<p>To test the potency of hNMPs, we treated hESCs with FGF/CHIR for 72 h to drive the generation of BRACHYURY<sup>+</sup>/SOX2<sup>+</sup> cells and then re-plated them for a further 48 h in serum free media without additional factors to promote the induction of spinal cord identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). We termed these cells N<sub>P</sub> and compared them to neural cells derived from hESCs using a dual SMAD inhibition protocol involving Nodal and BMP inhibitors (SB/LDN) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Chambers1">[57]</xref>. Both conditions induced neural identity, exemplified by increased levels of <italic>SOX2</italic>, <italic>TUBB3</italic> and <italic>PAX6</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). As expected, neural cells generated using dual SMAD inhibition expressed the anterior marker <italic>OTX2</italic> but lacked expression of HOX genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). By contrast, neural cells derived from NMPs expressed <italic>SOX1</italic> and the posterior HOX genes <italic>HOXC6</italic>, <italic>HOXC8</italic> and <italic>HOXC9</italic> but not <italic>OTX2</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). A similar expression profile was obtained after treatment with RA and dual Shh agonists SAG and purmorphamine (Pur). This also induced expression of the motor neuron progenitor marker <italic>OLIG2</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s005">Figure S5D</xref>). Antibody staining verified HOXC8 expression in N<sub>P</sub> conditions and revealed that the majority of HOXC8<sup>+</sup> cells co-expressed SOX2, confirming their neural identity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g005">Figure 5E, F</xref>). Treatment of neural cells for 48 h with FGF/CHIR following 72 h dual SMAD inhibition did not result in HOXC8 induction suggesting that posteriorisation is necessary before or concomitant with neural induction (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s005">Figure S5E</xref>). Together these data suggest that neural differentiation of hNMPs generates spinal cord progenitors similar to mNMPs.</p>
<p>We next tested whether hNMPs differentiate into mesoderm by culturing them in the presence of CHIR alone. This resulted in the expression of paraxial/somitic mesoderm markers <italic>TBX6</italic>, <italic>MSGN1</italic> and <italic>MEOX1</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s005">Figure S5D</xref>), but little if any expression of <italic>KDR</italic>, a lateral plate mesoderm marker (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s005">Figure S5D</xref>). Taken together these findings provide evidence of a human NMP population that gives rise to spinal cord and paraxial mesoderm derivatives but not anterior neurectoderm or lateral plate mesoderm. Moreover, a similar set of developmental cues induces and directs NMPs in human and mouse, consistent with a similar ontogeny of trunk tissues in these species.</p>

<title>Brachyury Is Required for the Induction of Mesoderm but Not Posterior Neural Identity</title>
<p>The ability to generate NMPs <italic>in vitro</italic> allows experimental investigations of trunk development that are challenging or impossible <italic>in vivo</italic>. For example, although the requirement for <italic>Brachyury</italic> in mesoderm formation is well-established <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Martin2">[58]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Martin3">[60]</xref>, the truncation of embryos lacking Brachyury has complicated analysis of its role in the elaboration of spinal cord identity. In zebrafish, a non-autonomous role for <italic>Brachyury</italic> orthologues has been identified <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Martin3">[60]</xref>. It is unclear whether in mammals Brachyury is required directly to maintain NMPs and therefore generate spinal tissue or indirectly via Wnt induction to establish a mesodermal niche that signals to generate or maintain posterior neural tissue. To address this we took advantage of Brachyury null mESCs (BTBR10) derived from embryos lacking Brachyury <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Rashbass1">[61]</xref>.</p>
<p>Assaying Brachyury null cells at D3 of differentiation indicated that, in contrast to wild-type ESCs, Tbx6 expression was not upregulated by exposure to FGF/CHIR signalling, whereas <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Hoxb1</italic> expression were induced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). This is consistent with the lack of posterior mesoderm induction in Brachyury mutant embryos and prompted us to address the fate of Brachyury mutant cells that would normally form mesoderm. In wild type cells exposed to Meso conditions, Tbx6 was highly expressed at D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6D</xref>), as were Desmin and MyoD at D8 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). By contrast Brachyury null cells subjected to the same conditions failed to differentiate into paraxial mesoderm as indicated by the absence of Tbx6 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Instead these cells expressed <italic>Sox1</italic>, <italic>Sox2</italic> and posterior Hox genes (<italic>Hoxc6</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic>) at D5 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) and differentiated into β-Tubulin expressing neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). These data indicate that within mouse NMPs, Brachyury not only specifies mesodermal identity via mechanism(s) in addition to its direct stimulation of Wnt signalling, but also represses neural identity. In the absence of Brachyury, NMPs adopt a neural differentiation route. Thus the induction of posterior neural tissue is not dependent on Brachyury. Moreover the data separate the mesoderm inducing and posteriorising activity of Wnt signalling and provide evidence that posteriorisation of the CNS is not dependent on mesoderm derived signals.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic of the conditions used for mesoderm differentiation. (B) qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of <italic>Tbx6</italic>, <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Hoxb1</italic> relative to b-actin at D3 of differentiation in wild-type (wt) and Brachyury null cells (Bra<sup>−/−</sup>) with and without CHIR. In wild-type cells activation of Wnt signalling induces the expression of these three genes. In the absence of Brachyury while <italic>Cdx2</italic> and <italic>Hoxb1</italic> continue to be induced by Wnt signalling, Tbx6 induction is lost. (C) qRT-PCR analysis of the expression of mesodermal, neural and posterior marker genes at D5 of differentiation in wt and Bra<sup>−/−</sup> ESCs exposed to CHIR from D2–D5 (Meso conditions). Posterior Hox genes <italic>Hoxc8</italic> and <italic>Hoxc9</italic> are induced in both wt and Brachyury null cells. However, in contrast to wild-type cells neural markers <italic>Sox1</italic> and <italic>Sox2</italic> are expressed only in Bra<sup>−/−</sup> cells exposed to Meso conditions. (D) Immunostaining of Tbx6 and Sox2 at D5 of Meso differentiation in Bra<sup>−/−</sup> and wild-type ESCs. Wild-type cells efficiently differentiate to paraxial mesoderm and expresses Tbx6 but not Sox2. By contrast Bra<sup>−/−</sup> cells differentiate to a neural identity exemplified by Sox2 expression in the absence of Tbx6. (E) At D8 wt cells cultured in CHIR express Desmin/MyoD but not β-Tubulin (Tuj1) whereas Bra<sup>−/−</sup> cells fail to produce Desmin/MyoD and differentiate into neurons expressing β-Tubulin (Tuj1). (F) The time course of Cdx gene expression in posterior neural (N<sub>P</sub>) and mesodermal inducing conditions (Meso). Cdx genes are transiently induced in posterior neural cells but continuously upregulated in mesodermal cells. (Note, log<sub>2+</sub> scale). All data used for the plots can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001937.s014">Data S6</xref>. (G) Model for the generation of spinal cord and paraxial mesodermal tissue from ESCs. ESCs cultured in N2B27 with FGF generate anterior but not posterior neural tissue. The activation of Wnt signalling in differentiating ESCs results in the generation of a bipotential neuromesodermal progenitor, equivalent to those found in the CLE of the embryo, which generate spinal cord or paraxial mesodermal tissue. Wnt signalling activates homeodomain proteins of the Cdx family in these progenitors that could account for the posteriorisation. In addition, Wnt signalling activates the mesodermal specifier Brachyury (Bra) that is required for Tbx6 induction and the repression of Sox2. The induction of Brachyury induces the Brachyury-Wnt autoregulatory loop that is necessary for mesoderm induction. In the absence of this gene ESCs differentiate into posterior neural tissue even in the presence of continued Wnt signalling.</p>

<p>What could be responsible for the induction of posterior Hox genes? Analysis of the transcriptome data revealed the induction in NMPs of the Cdx genes <italic>Cdx1</italic>, <italic>2</italic> and <italic>4</italic>, which have been implicated in the regulation of Hox gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6F</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Mazzoni1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-vandenAkker1">[62]</xref>. Induction of both <italic>Cdx1</italic> and <italic>Cdx2</italic> were detectable within 12 h of FGF/CHIR exposure and the levels of all three genes increased further at D3 and D4 of N<sub>P</sub> differentiation and at D5 of Meso differentiation. Moreover, the induction of <italic>Cdx2</italic> by Fgf/Wnt signalling was maintained in Brachyury null ESCs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Thus the induction of Cdx proteins by Fgf/Wnt signalling represents a good candidate for the posteriorisation of NMPs. Moreover the temporal accumulation of Cdx levels following Wnt exposure might provide a timing mechanism for the progressive induction of increasingly more posterior Hox genes.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We describe the <italic>in vitro</italic> generation of bipotential neuromesodermal progenitors from both mouse and human pluripotent stem cells that are capable of producing posterior neural tissue and paraxial mesodermal tissue. This recapitulates the behaviour of NMPs residing in the CLE and NSB <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Tzouanacou1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Takemoto1">[22]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001937-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). Moreover, we provide evidence that Wnt signalling has two distinct functions in NMPs, initiating a mesodermal differentiation programme by regulating Brachyury expression and independently posteriorising these cells. It is also likely that Brachyury maintains NMPs during axis elongation by forming a positive feedback loop with Wnt gene expression as has been previously shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Martin3">[60]</xref>. Strikingly, a neuromesodermal precursor is also present in ascidian embryos <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Lemaire1">[63]</xref>. Similar to vertebrates, the induction of these cells depends on the timing of Wnt and Fgf signalling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Hudson1">[64]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Hudson2">[65]</xref>. Moreover the mesoderm and posterior nervous system of many arthropods, including short germband insects, arises from a shared progenitor population that is exposed to Wingless signalling and expresses Cdx <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Martin4">[66]</xref>. Thus molecular and cellular features of the development of the neural and mesodermal components of the trunk appear to be evolutionarily conserved across bilaterian embryos. This emphasizes the distinct developmental origins of cells that form anterior and posterior regions of bilaterian embryos, suggesting an explanation as to why it has proved difficult to generate spinal cells and skeletal muscle from ESCs. More generally, the ability to produce and manipulate NMPs in vitro has the potential to increase the efficiency with which cell types derived from posterior neural and paraxial mesodermal tissue can be generated and analysed.</p>

<p>The mouse ES cell lines, HM1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Magin1">[67]</xref> and BTBR10 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Wilson3">[68]</xref> were maintained in ES cell medium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001937-Evans1">[69]</xref> with 1000 U/ml LIF (Chemicon) on mitotically inactive primary mouse embryo fibroblasts. To initiate differentiation, ES cells were removed from feeders by dissociation using 0.05% trypsin and then plated onto tissue culture plates for two short successive periods (20–30 mins) to remove feeder layers. To induce differentiation, the cells were plated on CellBINDSurface dishes (Corning) precoated with 0.1% gelatin (Sigma) at a density of 5×10<sup>3</sup> cells cm<sup>−2</sup> in ‘N2B27’ medium. This medium comprised Advanced Dulbecco's Modified Eagle Medium F12 (Gibco) and Neurobasal medium (Gibco) (1∶1), supplemented with 1×N2 (Gibco), 1×B27 (Gibco), 2 mM L-glutamine (Gibco), 40 µg/ml BSA (Sigma), 0.1 mM 2-mercaptoethanol. Cells were grown in N2B27 supplemented with 10 ng/ml bFgf (R&amp;D) for 3 days (D1–D3) and then were transferred into serum free media without bFgf (D3–D5). To induce ventral hindbrain identity NPCs (N<sub>H</sub>) 100 nM RA (Sigma) and 500 nM SAG (Calbiochem) was added from D3–D5. Spinal cord identity (N<sub>P</sub>) was induced by the addition of 5 µM CHIR99021 (Axon) or 100 ng/ml Wnt3a (R&amp;D) from D2 to D3 followed by 100 nM RA, 500 nM SAG from D3–D5. To induce mesodermal differentiation the cells were treated with CHIR99021 from D2–D5. To induce terminal differentiation, cells were trypsinised and plated as single-cell suspension on plates coated with Matrigel (BD Biosciences) at a density of 1×10<sup>5</sup> cells cm<sup>−2</sup> in N2B27 medium supplemented with bFgf (10 ng/ml).

The medium was replaced the following day with fresh N2B27 containing the same components minus the ROCK inhibitor. For directed differentiation of hESCs, cultures were differentiated in the presence of CHIR99021/bFgf for 72 h as described above. For neural/spinal cord differentiation 72 h CHIR99021/bFgf-differentiated cells were treated with Accutase (Sigma) and transferred onto Geltrex (Life Technologies)-coated plates either in N2B27 alone or N2B27 supplemented with RA (0.1 µM; Sigma), SAG (0.5 µM; Calbiochem) and purmorphamine (1 µM; Calbiochem) for 48 h. For mesodermal differentiation 72 h CHIR99021/bFgf differentiated cells were cultured in N2B27 supplemented with CHIR99021 (3 µM) for a further 48 h. For dual SMAD inhibition Sox2-GFP hES cells were plated at 10,000 cells/cm<sup>2</sup> on Geltrex™-coated wells in N2B27 supplemented with LDN193189 (100 nM; Stemgent) and SB431542 (10 µM; Sigma).

(C–D) PCA Biplots of the (C) first and second (PC1∼PC2) or (D) second and third (PC3∼PC2) principal components of a PCA performed with the 43 transcription factors that showed the highest variance across the data set. Samples are labelled in black and transcription factors labelled with red arrows; the arrow length is proportional to the variance of the transcription factor levels. Primary axes reflect the eigenvalues of the transcription factors, secondary axes reflect the eigenvector components of the samples. All sample triplicates are shown unless the labels of the same sample overlapped. Note the Biplot of the PC3∼PC2 indicates the separation of the R5 (N<sub>H</sub>) and W5 (N<sub>P</sub>) conditions along PC3.</p>
