<abstract>
<p>During development, progenitor expansion, lineage allocation, and implementation of differentiation programs need to be tightly coordinated so that different cell types are generated in the correct numbers for appropriate tissue size and function. Pancreatic dysfunction results in some of the most debilitating and fatal diseases, including pancreatic cancer and diabetes. Several transcription factors regulating pancreas lineage specification have been identified, and Notch signalling has been implicated in lineage allocation, but it remains unclear how these processes are coordinated. Using a combination of genetic approaches, organotypic cultures of embryonic pancreata, and genomics, we found that sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p), signalling through the G protein coupled receptor (GPCR) S1pr2, plays a key role in pancreas development linking lineage allocation and specification. S1pr2 signalling promotes progenitor survival as well as acinar and endocrine specification. S1pr2-mediated stabilisation of the yes-associated protein (YAP) is essential for endocrine specification, thus linking a regulator of progenitor growth with specification. YAP stabilisation and endocrine cell specification rely on G<sub>αi</sub> subunits, revealing an unexpected specificity of selected GPCR intracellular signalling components. Finally, we found that S1pr2 signalling posttranscriptionally attenuates Notch signalling levels, thus regulating lineage allocation. Both S1pr2-mediated YAP stabilisation and Notch attenuation are necessary for the specification of the endocrine lineage. These findings identify S1p signalling as a novel key pathway coordinating cell survival, lineage allocation, and specification and linking these processes by regulating YAP levels and Notch signalling. Understanding lineage allocation and specification in the pancreas will shed light in the origins of pancreatic diseases and may suggest novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>The pancreas develops from a field of progenitor cells localised in a restricted region of the embryonic endoderm. These progenitor cells proliferate and eventually differentiate to generate the three distinct lineages comprising the endocrine (which include insulin-producing β cells), acinar, and ductal cells. The molecular pathways implicated in the early generation of pancreas progenitors and their proliferation are well understood. It is also known that the Notch signalling pathway is implicated in sequential binary cell fate decisions that generate the three lineages; however, other signals that may regulate this process remain unknown. Here, we show that a phospholipid, sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p), generated by the progenitor cells themselves, acts as a signal necessary to define the acinar and endocrine lineage. We observe that in the absence of S1p only duct cells are generated and the survival of pancreas progenitors is compromised. The function of this signalling pathway in the generation of the endocrine cells is two-fold. Firstly, it stabilises yes-associated protein (YAP), a transcriptional gene coactivator known to regulate pancreatic progenitor proliferation, and we show that this stability is necessary for the activation of the endocrine specification program. Secondly, it attenuates Notch signalling, allowing the generation of endocrine and acinar cells. Notch attenuation is necessary for the stabilisation of the transcription factor Ngn3, which is required for the generation of endocrine cells. We conclude that S1p acts as an autocrine signal regulating YAP stabilisation and Notch attenuation to mediate pancreas specification. Understanding lineage allocation and specification in the pancreas will shed light on the origins of pancreatic diseases and may suggest novel therapeutic approaches.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The pancreas is the origin of some of the most debilitating and fatal diseases, including pancreatic cancer and diabetes. Understanding the signalling pathways and gene regulatory networks underlying pancreas development will shed light in the origins of these diseases and suggest novel therapeutic approaches. Mouse reverse genetics and studies in humans have uncovered multiple transcription factors that regulate formation of the pancreatic anlagen and its subsequent expansion, branching morphogenesis, and cell specification into the endocrine, acinar, and ductal lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref002">2</xref>]. Several extracellular signals have also been implicated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref003">3</xref>], but the molecular mechanisms coordinating lineage allocation with lineage specification remain elusive.</p>
<p>The early pancreatic multipotent progenitor cells (MPCs) emerge at the posterior foregut region of the definitive endoderm and are defined by the expression of the transcription factors Pdx1, Ptf1a, and Sox9 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref008">8</xref>]. Maintenance of high Notch signalling is necessary for the expansion of MPCs to form a tree-like branched epithelium and prevent early differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref012">12</xref>]. The Hippo signalling effectors, the transcription factor TEAD1 and its coactivator yes-associated protein (YAP), activate key pancreatic signalling mediators and transcription factors to regulate expansion of pancreatic progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref013">13</xref>], but the signal(s) regulating YAP stability are not known. Decreased Notch activity at the tips of the epithelium and the antagonistic functions of Ptf1a and Nkx6 transcription factors delineate the acinar progenitor and endocrine/duct bipotent trunk territories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref014">14</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref017">17</xref>]. In the trunk, differential Notch signalling enables progenitors to differentiate into ductal and endocrine cells. High Notch levels divert cells to the duct fate through repression of the expression of the Ngn3 transcription factor. Cells escaping high Notch levels induce Ngn3 and become endocrine progenitors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref018">18</xref>]. A Notch-mediated posttranslational mechanism for Ngn3 stabilisation has been proposed [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref019">19</xref>]. Endocrine progenitors provide Notch-dependent and Notch-independent feedback to maintain proliferative growth of the bipotent cell population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref022">22</xref>]. Despite the central role of Notch signalling, it is not understood whether levels of Notch activity are intrinsically regulated as a function of time or whether unidentified extracellular signals play a role in this process.</p>
<p>We used genetic approaches and organotypic cultures of mouse embryonic pancreata to reveal the implication of sphingosine-1-phosphate (S1p) signalling in progenitor survival, differentiation and lineage allocation. Our data show that S1p signals through the S1p receptor 2 (S1pr2) and YAP to up-regulate connective tissue growth factor (CTGF) that participates in mediating survival of endocrine and acinar progenitors. Signalling specifically through G<sub>αi</sub> and YAP stabilisation is necessary for endocrine specification. Additionally, S1p signalling attenuates Notch signalling to regulate lineage allocation. Both YAP stabilisation and Notch attenuation are necessary for endocrine and acinar specification. Taken together, the data uncover a novel mode of coordinating lineage allocation and cell specification through S1p signalling and link these processes with tissue growth control.</p>

<title>Expression of S1p signalling components peaks during pancreas secondary transition</title>
<p>S1p is a lipid mediator secreted in the extracellular milieu, where it interacts with the S1p G protein-coupled receptors to regulate different cellular responses such as migration, survival, and differentiation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref024">24</xref>]. Because S1pr2-mediated S1p signalling guides the migration of endocrine progenitors to form islets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref025">25</xref>], we decided to examine its implication in earlier stages of pancreas development. We first tracked its expression during mouse pancreas development by following β-galactosidase activity in heterozygous <italic>S1pr2</italic><sup><italic>tm1lacz</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref026">26</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s011">S3 Table</xref>) embryos and by quantitative PCR (qPCR) analysis in wild-type (wt) embryos. Consistent with an early role for this receptor in mesenchymal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref027">27</xref>], <italic>S1pr2</italic> <sup><italic>tm1lacz</italic></sup> expression was predominantly mesenchymal from 9.5 days post coitum (dpc) to 12.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). During secondary transition, its expression was significantly up-regulated, and in the developing epithelium, it was colocalised with both trunk and tip progenitors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g001">Fig 1A–1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). By 16.5 dpc, <italic>Lacz</italic> expression was eliminated in nascent endocrine cells and significantly reduced in the rest of the developing organ, whereas it was completely abolished by postnatal day 1 (P1) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). qPCR analysis confirmed this pattern, clearly indicating that <italic>S1pr2</italic> expression in the developing pancreas peaked during secondary transition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). To further investigate the epithelial expression of <italic>S1pr2</italic>, we isolated by fluorescence-activated cell sorting (FACS) the epithelial and mesenchymal components of the developing pancreas at 13.5, 14.5, and 15.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>S1p is a systemically circulating sphingolipid generated by platelets and endothelial cells but it may also be generated in situ. Sphingosine kinases (Sphk) 1 and 2 catalyse the formation of secreted S1p using endogenous cellular sphingosine [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref028">28</xref>]. Analysis of <italic>Sphk1</italic> and <italic>Sphk2</italic> expression by qPCR showed that their expression peaked during secondary transition and suggested a predominantly epithelial expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g001">Fig 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>Taken together, the temporal expression profile of <italic>S1pr2</italic> and <italic>Sphks</italic> suggested that this signalling pathway may act as an autocrine signal to mediate pancreas specification.

<title>Developmental delay of the <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata reveals key role in lineage specification</title>
<p>To address the role of <italic>S1pr2</italic> in pancreas development, we first compared the RNA Seq gene expression profiles of <italic>S1pr2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Rlp</italic></sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s011">S3 Table</xref>) null [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref029">29</xref>] embryonic pancreata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s002">S2 Fig</xref>) with those of 13.5, 14.5, and 15.5 dpc wt embryonic pancreata.</p>
<p>Principal component analysis (PCA) suggested that <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata were developmentally delayed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g002">Fig 2A</xref>).

<p><italic>S1pr2</italic> null embryos develop to full term but show perinatal mortality and display a range of phenotypes, particularly in the hematopoietic and vascular systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref029">29</xref>]. Surprisingly, immunofluorescence analysis of <italic>S1pr2</italic> <sup><italic>tm1Rlp</italic></sup> null pancreata at P1 showed no major defects in the development of the endocrine, acinar, and ductal lineages. Additionally, fasting glucose levels and glucose tolerance tests in the surviving adults failed to uncover glucose homeostasis defects, suggesting no gross alterations, at least concerning endocrine cell function (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To investigate whether systemic signals were necessary for functional compensation, we used serum free air–liquid interface (ALI) cultures of embryonic pancreata. ALI cultures mimic normal embryonic development and thus also give a means to temporally manipulate signalling conditions and elucidate their effects on lineage specification [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref031">31</xref>]. Wt 14.5 dpc pancreata in ALI cultures continue their developmental program over the course of 6 d, giving rise to acinar, endocrine, and duct cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). However, <italic>S1pr2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Rlp</italic></sup> 14.5 dpc null pancreata failed to develop normally, because both the endocrine and acinar lineages were severely compromised and there was a strong increase in the number of duct-like cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). This was consistent with the strong down-regulation of endocrine and acinar differentiation markers at 14.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g002">Fig 2B and 2C</xref>) and in contrast to the eventually normal development of <italic>S1pr2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Rlp</italic></sup> null pancreata in utero. We next looked for up-regulated related receptors that may mediate functional compensation of the <italic>S1pr2</italic> null mutation and rescue the early pancreatic phenotype of the <italic>S1pr2</italic> nulls.</p>
<p><italic>S1pr2</italic> belongs to the family of the closely related lysophospholipid (LPL) receptors (LPLrs) that have similar expression patterns and overlapping functions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref033">33</xref>]. RNA Seq data showed that only <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>lysophosphatidic receptor 1 (Lpar1)</italic>, which are functionally related to <italic>S1pr2</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref032">32</xref>], were expressed to any appreciable extent and to levels comparable to that of <italic>S1pr2</italic> in the 14.5 wt pancreata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Interestingly, <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> expression increased in the 14.5 dpc <italic>S1pr2</italic><sup><italic>tm1Rlp</italic></sup> null total pancreata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). To independently confirm that this up-regulation was a consequence of abrogating S1pr2 signalling, we acutely blocked S1pr2 function by injecting intraperitoneally (ip) pregnant dams at 13.5, 14.5, and 15.5 dpc with either 2 or 5 mg/Kg body weight of the specific S1pr2 antagonist JTE013 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref034">34</xref>]. In both treatments, expression of both <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> was up-regulated in 16.5 dpc pancreata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Expression of <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> is primarily mesenchymal in 13.5, 14.5, and 15.5 dpc wt pancreata (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), but, strikingly, their expression was selectively up-regulated, by 5- and 7-fold, respectively, in the epithelium of 14.5 dpc <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g002">Fig 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s002">S2 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>To establish that these receptors mediate the recovery of the endocrine lineage, we blocked their function in ALI cultures by applying for 3 d the specific S1pr3 and Lpar1 inhibitors VPC23019 and Ki16425 at 50 μM and 20 μM, respectively, in ALI cultures of 13.5 dpc wt and <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata. Either inhibitor on its own was not sufficient to block endocrine specification, but when used in combination, they essentially shut off endocrine specification, specifically in S1pr2 null pancreata but not in wt pancreata (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g002">Fig 2F–2J</xref>), demonstrating that <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> mediate the functional compensation in the <italic>S1pr2</italic> nulls.</p>
<p>These findings established an important role for S1p signalling in the specification of pancreas progenitors and uncovered extensive functional compensation among specific LPL receptors in pancreas development.</p>

<title>S1pr2 signalling has a dual role in promoting survival and commitment of pancreas progenitors</title>
<p>To fully address the role of S1pr2 signalling in pancreas development, we decided to isolate systemic signals mediating the functional compensation in <italic>S1pr2</italic> null embryos using ALI cultures. The presence of 15 μM JTE013 in ALI cultures of 14.5 dpc <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata did not alter their growth, survival, and differentiation patterns, further confirming its specificity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s003">S3 Fig</xref>). In contrast, blocking S1pr2 function in wt pancreata resulted in obvious morphological defects, most notably the absence of light-reflective, dense cell clusters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s003">S3 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>The progression of the developmental program in ALI cultures of wt 14.5 dpc pancreata is apparent 2 d following culture initiation. The segregation of the endocrine and ductal lineages from the Nkx6.1<sup>+</sup> bipotent progenitors has progressed and is shown by the reduction in the numbers of Nkx6.1<sup>+</sup> and Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells, the increase of strongly labelled Pdx1<sup>+</sup> cells, and the appearance of numerous C-pep<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup> as well as CK19<sup>+</sup> cells. Acinar cells become numerous, as seen by the appearance of Ptf1a<sup>+</sup>/Pdx1<sup>-</sup> and Amy<sup>+</sup> cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g003">Fig 3A–3D with 3E–3H</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g003">Fig 3M–3P</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref016">16</xref>]. However, in the absence of S1pr2 signalling, development of both acinar and endocrine lineages was blocked, as shown by the loss of Amy<sup>+</sup> and C-Pep<sup>+</sup>, whereas the development of CK19<sup>+</sup> duct-like cells did not appear affected (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). These findings correlated with the persistence of a large number of Nkx6.1<sup>+</sup> cells, the loss of Ptf1a<sup>+</sup>/Pdx1<sup>-</sup> cells, the reduction of strongly labelled Pdx1<sup>+</sup> cells as well as the dramatic reduction in the number of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g003">Fig 3E–3H with 3I–3L</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g003">Fig 3M–3P</xref>).

<p>(A-H) Immunofluorescence analysis of embryonic pancreata at 14.5 dpc and after 2 d in ALI cultures (14.5 dpc + 2 d) shows the progression of the developmental program.

(I-L) Immunofluorescence analysis at 14.5 dpc + 2 d in the absence of S1pr2 signalling clearly showed that the Nkx6-1<sup>+</sup> population was expanded (I), Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells (K) and strongly labelled Pdx1<sup>+</sup> cells (J) were dramatically reduced, and Ptf1a<sup>+</sup>/Pdx1<sup>-</sup> cells were lost (L).

<p>To reveal the full extent of the changes, we analysed the transcriptome of ALI pancreatic explants cultured for 2 d. Similarly to the transcriptome analysis of <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata at 14.5 dpc, the expression of progenitor markers, upon S1pr2 blocking with 15 μM of JTE013, was only mildly affected, with the striking exception of the transcription factor <italic>Nkx6</italic>.<italic>2</italic> and the Notch membrane-bound ligand <italic>Dll1</italic>, two genes that are important for the segregation of the bipotent trunk population from the acinar progenitor pool and Notch-mediated lineage segregation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s009">S1 Table</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref018">18</xref>]. On the other hand, and in agreement with the transcriptome analysis of <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata at 14.5 dpc, there was coordinated repression of transcription factors and terminal differentiation markers of the endocrine and acinar lineages. In contrast, the ductal lineage was much less affected because, similarly to <italic>S1pr2</italic> null phenotype at 14.5, expression of several important genes, such as <italic>Hnf1b</italic>, <italic>Car2</italic>, and <italic>Slc9a1</italic>, was not affected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g003">Fig 3Q–3S</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Consistent with an important role of S1pr2 signalling for lineage commitment during secondary transition, the total number of regulated genes in its absence increased by 2.5-fold at 14.5 dpc + 2 d (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>After 6 d in culture in the absence of S1pr2 signalling, beta cells and acinar cells were virtually eliminated, and the explants were taken over by a greatly expanded number of CK19<sup>+</sup> duct-like cells (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g004">Fig 4A–4C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g004">Fig 4E–4G and 4N</xref>).

<p>(A-H, M, N) Immunofluorescence analysis showed that S1pr2 block with 15 μM JTE013 in ALI cultures of 14.5 dpc embryonic pancreata for 6 d (14.5 dpc + 6 d) lead to the elimination of C-peptide<sup>+</sup> endocrine cells (A, E, N) and Amylase<sup>+</sup> acinar cells (B, F, N) and to a greatly expanded number of CK19<sup>+</sup> duct-like cells (B, F, N).

<p>These findings showed that S1p signalling, through S1pr2, was necessary for both cell survival and lineage commitment. To address whether these effects were distinct from one another, we sought means to rescue the cell survival independently of cell specification. CTGF was a plausible candidate to participate in mediating survival, as it has been implicated as such a signal downstream of S1p signalling and it is expressed in the developing pancreas in both the epithelium and the mesenchyme (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s005">S5 Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref035">35</xref>]. Importantly, its expression was significantly repressed (3.5-fold) upon blocking S1pr2 signalling for 2 d in ALI 14.5 dpc explants (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Addition of 50 ng/ml CTGF at the onset of the ALI culture in the absence of S1pr2 signalling eliminated cell death 6 d later (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g004">Fig 4D, 4H and 4L</xref>). However, this was not sufficient to reverse the early differentiation block, and results were very similar in this respect. After 2 d in culture, there were again very few Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells, no Ptf1a<sup>+</sup>/Pdx1<sup>-</sup> cells, the number of strongly labelled Pdx1<sup>+</sup> cells did not increase compared to the 14.5 dpc stage, and proliferation rates in the epithelium remained low (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g003">Fig 3G, 3K, 3H and 3L</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s005">S5 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s005">S5 Fig</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref>).

These findings, the loss of Ptf1a<sup>+</sup> cells, and the persistence of a large number of Pdx1<sup>+</sup> and Nkx6.1<sup>+</sup> cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g004">Fig 4C, 4G and 4K</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s005">S5 Fig</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g004">Fig 4M</xref>) suggest that cells are stabilised in a trunk bipotential identity when S1pr2 signalling is blocked but survival is rescued by CTGF. To further corroborate that cell survival was mediated independently of cell fate commitment, we compared gene expression changes of 14.5 + 2 d ALI embryonic pancreata cultured in conditions of S1pr2 block in the presence or absence of 50 ng/ml CTGF. Gene expression changes of progenitor, endocrine, acinar, and duct markers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref030">30</xref>] were strikingly similar in the two conditions as compared to untreated controls (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s005">S5 Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s009">S1 Table</xref>). Furthermore, PCA showed that S1pr2 blocked explants with or without CTGF clustered much closer together (PC2, 16% variance) than with control pancreata (PC1, 68% variance) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s005">S5 Fig</xref>).

<p>These data showed that S1p signalling through S1pr2 mediates cell fate commitment to the endocrine and acinar lineages. Independently of that, it promotes progenitor cell survival at least partly through up-regulation of CTGF.</p>

<title>YAP mediates S1pr2 signalling and is important for endocrine specification</title>
<p>We next sought to determine the transcriptional mediator of this signalling cascade. The transcriptional responses following S1p activation are not fully understood, but recent work has shown that S1p receptors can stabilise the transcriptional coactivator YAP, a central player in tissue growth control [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref041">41</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref045">45</xref>]. YAP is a component of the Hippo signalling cascade that phosphorylates it, leading to its retention in the cytoplasm and its degradation by the proteasome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref046">46</xref>]. Additionally, CTGF is a direct target of YAP transcriptional activation, mediating cell survival in different cellular contexts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref049">49</xref>]. Importantly, the TEAD obligatory YAP transcriptional partners have been shown to bind to multiple enhancer elements of genes implicated in pancreas development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref013">13</xref>].</p>
<p>Expression of <italic>YAP</italic> can be detected from the early stages of pancreas development, but, similarly to <italic>S1pr2</italic> and <italic>Sphk</italic> expression, it peaks during secondary transition, and transcript levels are significantly higher in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Immunostaining with E-cadherin clearly showed that the protein is stabilised and detectable only in the epithelium (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Therefore, we asked whether S1pr2 signalling regulates YAP levels and, therefore, YAP-mediated transcriptional regulation. RNA Seq and qPCR results clearly showed that <italic>YAP</italic> expression was not affected in either <italic>S1pr2</italic> nulls, S1pr2 blocked ALI cultures, or G<sub>αi</sub> blocked ALI cultures (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In contrast, YAP protein levels were significantly reduced in both <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata at 14.5 dpc and 14.5 pancreatic explants subjected to S1pr2 signalling block for 2 d in culture (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6A, 6B, 6D, 6E and 6G</xref>).

To show direct dependence of YAP stability upon S1p signalling, we titrated the amount of exogenous S1p and found that 20 μM S1p in explants treated with 15 μM JTE013 was sufficient to rescue YAP protein stability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6D–6F and 6G</xref>). The determined binding affinities are slightly higher for S1p <sup>34, 52</sup> and therefore in these concentrations S1p is in small molecular excess. Additionally, S1p, being the natural ligand, should diffuse faster in the explant tissue. This finding further confirmed that YAP protein stability depends on S1p signalling through S1pr2.</p>

<p>S1pr2 signalling can be conveyed through G<sub>αq</sub>, G<sub>α</sub>12/13, and G<sub>αi</sub> subunits [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref052">52</xref>], and we sought to determine whether selective blocking of each of these Ga subunits would affect YAP protein stability. Blocking of the G<sub>αq</sub> subunits with 50 uM of the specific G<sub>αq</sub> antagonist-2A (GP2A) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref053">53</xref>] or blocking the function of G<sub>α</sub>12/13 subunits with 5 ug/ml of the C3 exoenzyme [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref054">54</xref>] in explants had no effect on YAP stability (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). In contrast, inactivation of G<sub>αi</sub> subunits by 10 μg/ml PTX resulted in a dramatic loss of YAP protein stabilisation, showing that signalling specifically through G<sub>αi</sub> subunits is an important component of YAP stabilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6C and 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>To address the potential role of YAP in pancreas specification, we first sought to rescue the protein stability in ALI embryonic pancreas explants where S1pr2 signalling was blocked. Addition of 2 d of 1 μM of the reversible proteasome inhibitor MG132, used previously to restore YAP stability [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref055">55</xref>], resulted in the YAP stabilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Strikingly, this restored specifically endocrine but not acinar specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6H and 6I</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), suggesting that S1pr2 signalling acts through G<sub>αi</sub> and YAP stabilisation to promote the endocrine lineage. To directly address this, we used the <italic>Tg</italic><sup><italic>Pdx1CreERT2</italic></sup> Cre driver and the <italic>YAP</italic><sup><italic>fl/fl</italic></sup> allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s011">S3 Table</xref>) to temporally inactivate YAP and bypass its early role in the expansion of the pancreatic epithelium [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref013">13</xref>]. Following tamoxifen administration permissible for normal pregnancy and embryo development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref056">56</xref>], the <italic>Tg</italic><sup><italic>Pdx1CreERT2</italic></sup> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref057">57</xref>] allele partially labelled all three lineages in the presence of a conditional <italic>ROSA26</italic><sup><italic>LSLtdTomato</italic></sup> reporter allele (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s011">S3 Table</xref>) at similar efficiencies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). Thus we used <italic>Tg</italic><sup><italic>Pdx1CreERT2</italic></sup> and tamoxifen administration to inactivate YAP (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>) in a temporally delayed manner. Whereas there was no effect on the number of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells at 14.5 dpc (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>), the number of endocrine Cpeptide<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup> cells was reduced by nearly 40% at P1 compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6J–6L</xref>). The number of Amy<sup>+</sup> acinar and CK19<sup>+</sup> duct cells was not affected, demonstrating the specific role of YAP in endocrine specification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>). There was no cell death in these pancreata, suggesting that the remaining YAP<sup>+</sup> epithelial cells generated sufficient secreted CTGF and/or other secreted factors to maintain cell survival. To further confirm that S1p signalling acts through YAP in endocrine specification, we treated 14.5 dpc YAP-deleted pancreata with 20 μM S1p for 6 d in culture. This treatment failed to restore the loss of endocrine cells, confirming that YAP mediates the S1p effects on endocrine specification (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s007">S7 Fig</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these results reveal a distinct mechanism whereby S1p signalling acts through G<sub>αi</sub> subunits to stabilise YAP, which in turn is necessary for endocrine specification. Importantly, YAP destabilisation does not affect the number of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells, suggesting that a distinct S1p-dependent pathway regulates Ngn3 expression.</p>

<title>S1pr2-mediated attenuation of Notch signalling is necessary for endocrine and acinar differentiation</title>

YAP destabilisation could not account for this effect, as shown above by the conditional inactivation of <italic>YAP</italic>.

Both of these effects could be a result of high Notch activity that has been shown to destabilise Ngn3 and induce the formation of supernumerary duct cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref058">58</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref059">59</xref>]. To investigate this, we activated Notch signalling above the endogenous levels using 10 μM of the soluble Notch ligand peptide Delta-Serrate/lag-2 (DSL) in ALI cultures of 14.5 dpc pancreata. This peptide is derived from the Jag-1 ligand domain, and it also corresponds to the conserved, receptor binding part of the other Notch ligands, thus eliciting canonical Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref060">60</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref061">61</xref>].

Simultaneous inhibition of Notch and S1pr2 signalling in 14.5 dpc + 2 d ALI cultures transiently resulted in a large increase in the number of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells (B, G) shown by immunofluorescence.

<p>Therefore, we next determined whether S1pr2 signalling was necessary to down-regulate Notch signalling. Notch levels normally drop, concurrently with differentiation, on 14.5 dpc explants maintained for just 1 d in culture, as shown by Notch intracellular domain (NICD) and Hes-1 immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8B, 8C, 8E and 8F</xref>). Notch down-regulation failed to take place in explants with S1pr2 signalling block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8H and 8I</xref>) but was restored by the addition of 20 μM of S1p (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), further establishing the down-regulation of Notch signalling by S1p. Because transcript levels of Notch signalling components did not point to an overall transcriptional regulation of Notch by S1pr2 signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s009">S1 Table</xref>), we investigated whether such regulation may occur posttranscriptionally. Sel-1 suppressor of lin-12-like (Sel1l) is a member of the endoplasmic reticulum (ER)-associated protein degradation (ERAD) pathway, first identified in <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> as a negative posttranscriptional regulator of Notch signalling [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref063">63</xref>]. <italic>Sel1l</italic> is expressed in the epithelium of the developing pancreas [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref064">64</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8A</xref>), and its disruption resulted in loss of endocrine and acinar differentiation and prolongation of the progenitor cell state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref065">65</xref>], a phenotype strikingly similar to that of the S1pr2 signalling block. Consistent with a role in differentiation, Sel1l is up-regulated in differentiating pancreas explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). S1pr2 signalling block resulted in the loss of the Sel1l protein, concomitant with maintenance of Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8G</xref>). Further confirming this finding, activation of the Notch signalling above the endogenous levels with the addition of 10 μM of DSL resulted in a strong decrease of Se1l1 levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Moreover, addition of 20 μM of S1p restored Se1l1 levels, confirming its dependence upon S1p signalling (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s008">S8 Fig</xref>). Se1l1 protein levels were also restored in the absence of S1pr2 signalling by 1 μM of the specific proteasome inhibitor MG132 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8J</xref>), and this was sufficient to restore attenuation of Notch signalling (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8K and 8L</xref>). Therefore, S1pr2 signalling stabilises the Sel1l protein that in turn mediates the Notch signalling down-regulation that is necessary for acinar and endocrine differentiation.</p>

<p>(A-F) Immunofluorescence analysis showed that Sel1l is strongly expressed in 14.5 dpc pancreata maintained for 1 d (14.5 dpc + 1 d) in ALI cultures compared to 14.5 dpc pancreata (A, D), and this correlated with a drop in the expression levels of NICD (B, E) and Hes1 (C, F). (G-I) S1pr2 signalling block with 15 μM JTE013 in 14.5 dpc + 1 d ALI cultures resulted in loss of Sel1l expression (G), concomitant with maintenance of high NICD (H) and Hes1 (I) expression.

<p>These results suggested that S1pr2 signalling mediates Notch down-regulation to induce endocrine and acinar differentiation but did not clarify whether this was sufficient and whether Notch signalling affected YAP levels. To answer these questions, we first blocked Notch signalling without affecting endogenous S1pr2 signalling using 10 μM of the gamma-secretase inhibitor DAPT in ALI cultures of 14.5 dpc pancreata [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref066">66</xref>]. This induced a large increase in the number of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells and resulted in preferential endocrine differentiation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g007">Fig 7B and 7D</xref>) (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g004">Fig 4A, 4B, 4E and 4F</xref> with <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g007">Fig 7E and 7F</xref> and compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s008">S8 Fig</xref>, see also <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g007">Fig 7C</xref>).</p>
<p>We then addressed whether Notch down-regulation in the absence of S1pr2 signalling would be sufficient to initiate and maintain differentiation. We found that despite the large number of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells at 14.5 dpc + 2 d explants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g007">Fig 7B and 7G</xref>) and the transient initiation of differentiation (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s004">S4 Fig</xref> with <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s008">S8 Fig</xref>), neither endocrine nor acinar cell differentiation were maintained (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g007">Fig 7F and 7I</xref>), suggesting that Notch down-regulation is not sufficient but acts in concert with other effectors of S1pr2 signalling. We have shown above that with regard to endocrine specification YAP plays an important role. Importantly, we have further found that YAP levels depend upon S1pr2 but not Notch signalling. YAP levels did not change when Notch signalling alone was inhibited or when Notch signalling was inhibited concurrently with S1pr2 inhibition (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). This suggested that YAP levels are regulated by S1pr2 signalling through the G<sub>αi</sub> function and not Notch attenuation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g006">Fig 6G</xref>).</p>
<p>Taken together, these experiments showed that S1pr2 signalling attenuates Notch activity through the protein stabilisation of its negative regulator Sel1l. Both this attenuation and the YAP stabilisation are necessary for the specification of the endocrine and acinar lineages.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>During development, cell fate decisions need to be coupled to the implementation of differentiation programs so that different cell types in each organ are generated in the appropriate numbers. Notch signalling is widely employed as a regulator of binary cell fate decisions, and it also plays a key role in sequential lineage segregation during pancreas development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref019">19</xref>]. How Notch activity is coordinated with the implementation of specification programs is not well understood. Furthermore, signalling molecules that trigger lineage differentiation remain largely elusive. Our findings revealed the implication of the S1p signalling pathway in key pancreas developmental decisions. We found that the S1p signalling pathway has a dual role in pancreas development by regulating lineage allocation and differentiation and thus coordinating these processes.</p>
<p>Consistent with the notion that S1p is an important signalling molecule for pancreas development, expression of the S1p generating enzymes at both the protein and the mRNA levels is substantially higher in the epithelium and gradually increases during the secondary transition. We found that S1pr2 is the main S1p receptor expressed in the developing epithelium. Development of the acinar and endocrine lineages was severely delayed in <italic>S1pr2</italic> null embryos, but specific up-regulation of the functionally related receptors <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> in the epithelium compensated and eventually restored pancreas development. Acute S1pr2 blocking in wt explants prevented this compensation, resulting in complete loss of the endocrine and acinar lineages and a massive appearance of duct-like cells. Down-regulation of <italic>Sox9</italic> expression may contribute to the loss of endocrine and acinar lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref067">67</xref>]. The remaining cells are clearly of ductal identity, although ductal gene expression is perturbed consistent with the interdependence of pancreatic lineage development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref022">22</xref>].</p>
<p>This experimental set up provided us with a means to unravel the downstream events. Specific blocking of the S1pr2 downstream effector G<sub>αi</sub>, either in explants or genetically, dramatically and selectively reduced endocrine lineage specification, suggesting that different Ga subunits mediate distinct aspects of pancreas development that could be exploited in stem cell differentiation protocols. Loss of S1pr2 signalling or G<sub>αi</sub> function resulted in destabilisation of the YAP transcriptional coactivator. Inactivation of the Hippo pathway by pancreas selective disruption of the Mst1/2 kinases led to increased levels of YAP in acinar cells and their subsequent ductal metaplastic conversion [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref069">69</xref>]. However, the role of YAP during pancreas development has not been genetically explored. Genetic temporal inactivation of <italic>YAP</italic> specifically reduced endocrine specification without affecting the appearance of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells. YAP stabilisation by proteasome inhibition in the absence of S1pr2 signalling restored endocrine specification. Furthermore, additional S1p signalling could not restore endocrine specification levels in the <italic>YAP</italic>-deleted pancreata, establishing that an S1p to S1pr2, G<sub>αi</sub>, and YAP stabilisation cascade is necessary for the endocrine differentiation program to be triggered (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g009">Fig 9</xref>). YAP mRNA levels are significantly higher in the epithelium, and these findings explain the selective importance of the S1p signalling/YAP axis for the development of the epithelium.</p>

<title>S1pr2 signalling regulates pancreatic lineage allocation and specification.</title>
<p>S1pr2 signalling attenuates Notch signalling to promote the segregation of tip MPCs that will give rise to acinar progenitors and bipotent trunk progenitors and, in the latter, to promote the generation of endocrine progenitors via Ngn3 stabilisation. These are two temporally distinct steps shown here as one for simplicity. Ngn3 is stabilised post-translationally in Notch<sup>low</sup> cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref019">19</xref>]. Additionally, S1p signalling stabilises YAP to enable progenitor survival. G<sub>αi</sub> activation mediates the stabilisation of the YAP protein to enable endocrine specification. Both YAP stabilisation and Notch down-regulation are necessary for endocrine specification.</p>

<p>S1p signalling block was accompanied by cell death and down-regulation of <italic>CTGF</italic>, a secreted survival factor and known YAP target gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref047">47</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref049">49</xref>]. Exogenous addition of CTGF in S1pr2 blocked pancreata rescued the cell death but not the specification defects underlining distinct functions of S1p signalling in progenitor survival and specification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g009">Fig 9</xref>).</p>
<p>Several effects of S1pr2 signalling loss would be consistent with maintenance of high Notch activity, raising the possibility that S1p signalling regulates Notch. We found that S1p signalling is necessary for the maintenance of Sel1l protein levels, a member of ERAD pathway, and negative Notch regulator [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref062">62</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref063">63</xref>]. <italic>Sel1l</italic> deficiency impaired endocrine and acinar differentiation and maintained the progenitor cell state [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref065">65</xref>]. Consistent with that, S1p signalling attenuates Notch activity, a necessary step to trigger differentiation of the acinar and endocrine lineages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref014">14</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref019">19</xref>]. Rescue of the Sel1l protein levels by proteasome inhibition restored Notch down-regulation in the absence of S1pr2 signalling. However, Notch down-regulation on its own was not sufficient to sustain endocrine and acinar differentiation in the absence of S1pr2 signalling, demonstrating that another effector of the latter is also necessary for endocrine specification, and we have shown that this effector is G<sub>αi</sub>, which mediates YAP stabilisation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g009">Fig 9</xref>). Interestingly, Ngn3 protein levels are dependent upon Notch signalling but not on YAP, suggesting that S1p-dependent YAP stabilisation may be acting as a primer of the endocrine program that is then realised in the cells that stabilise Ngn3 protein levels.</p>
<p>Developmental pathways are often employed in adult tissues during regeneration, and their application has also been pivotal in the generation of glucose responsive beta-like cells from human pluripotent stem (PS) cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref070">70</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref072">72</xref>]. During pancreas development, TEAD and its coactivator YAP activate key pancreatic signalling mediators and transcription factors to regulate the expansion of pancreatic MPCs that will generate all the pancreatic lineages. After the onset of differentiation, YAP is rapidly degraded in acinar and endocrine cells but is retained in ductal cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref068">68</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref069">69</xref>]. Our findings suggested an additional role for YAP in activating the endocrine differentiation program and identified S1p as an important signal that maintains its stability through the secondary transition.</p>
<p>This work identified a new signalling pathway in pancreas development that leads to YAP stabilisation and Notch attenuation in the developing pancreas, thus linking lineage allocation and differentiation with a molecular player central for tissue growth control. These findings have important implications for the efficient generation of endocrine cells from pluripotent stem cells and for pancreas regeneration.</p>

<title>Morphometric analysis</title>
<p>Morphometric analysis on embryonic pancreata and pancreatic explants was performed using immunofluorescent images taken at saturation and the ImageJ (Fiji) software. More specifically, the “Analyse Particles” tool of ImageJ was used to quantitate the number of pixels that correspond to signal area on an immunofluorescent image. For the 14.5 dpc pancreata and all pancreatic explants, analysis was performed using at least three 12-μm-thick cryosections per sample 24 μm apart, spanning the entire tissue. For the 19.5 dpc and P1 pancreata, analysis was performed using at least six 12-μm-thick cryosections per sample, 120 μm apart, spanning the entire tissue. For endocrine, acinar, and ductal cell quantitation, the signal area of C-peptide/Glucagon-, amylase-, and Cytokeratin19-positive immunofluorescence, respectively, was measured and divided by the corresponding total signal area for DAPI, thus normalising for mass. The same procedure was followed for Pdx1-, Ptf1a-, Nkx6.1, and YAP-signal area quantitation. For quantitation of epithelial mitotic activity, PH3-positive nuclei were counted and divided over the DAPI area of the epithelium as marked by E-cadherin co-staining. Similarly, for endocrine progenitor quantitation, Ngn3-positive nuclei were counted and divided over total DAPI area. To quantify the recombination efficiency, double Tdt + each marker (Cpeptide+Glucagon, Amylase, CK-19) positive cells were counted and this number divided for the total number of cells expressing each marker. For each quantitation, at least three pancreata of each genotype and/or condition were analysed.</p>

<title>RNA sequencing and bioinformatic analysis</title>
<p>Embryonic pancreata (13.5, 14.5, or 15.5 dpc) from up to three pups of the same genotype were pooled to generate one sample. For ALI cultures, up to three pancreata having undergone the same treatment (normal medium, JTE013 or JTE013, and CTGF supplemented) were pooled to generate one sample. Three independent samples from each stage/genotype or ALI condition were used as biological replicates.</p>
<p>Total RNA was prepared using the RNeasy kit with on-column genomic DNA digestion (Qiagen), and only RNA with an integrity number of ≥8 was used. mRNA was isolated from 1 ug total RNA by poly-dT enrichment using the NEBNext Poly(A) mRNA Magnetic Isolation Module according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Final elution was done in 15 ul 2x first strand cDNA synthesis buffer (NEBnext, NEB). After chemical fragmentation by incubating for 15 min at 94°C, the sample was directly subjected to the workflow for strand-specific RNA-Seq library preparation (Ultra Directional RNA Library Prep, NEB). For ligation, custom adaptors were used (Adaptor-Oligo 1: 5'-ACA-CTC-TTT-CCC-TAC-ACG-ACG-CTC-TTC-CGA-TCT-3', Adaptor-Oligo 2: 5'-P-GAT-CGG-AAG-AGC-ACA-CGT-CTG-AAC-TCC-AGT-CAC-3'). After ligation, adapters were depleted by an XP bead purification (Beckman Coulter) adding bead in a ratio of 1:1. Indexing was done during the following PCR enrichment (15 cycles) using custom amplification primers carrying the index sequence indicated with ‘NNNNNN’. (Primer1: Oligo_Seq AATGATACGGCGACCACCGAGATCTACACTCTTTCCCTACACGACGCTCTTCCGATCT, primer2: GTGACTGGAGTTCAGACGTGTGCTCTTCCGATCT, primer3: CAAGCAGAAGACGGCATACGAGAT NNNNNN GTGACTGGAGTT). After two more XP beads purifications (1:1), libraries were quantified using Qubit dsDNA HS Assay Kit (Invitrogen). Libraries were equimolarly pooled and sequenced on an Illumina HiSeq 2500, resulting in ca. 16–20 million single end reads per library.</p>
<p>After sequencing, FastQC (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.bioinformatics.babraham.ac.uk/</ext-link>) was used to perform a basic quality control on the resulting reads. As an additional control, library diversity was assessed by redundancy investigation in the aligned reads. Alignment of the short reads to the mm10 reference was done with GSNAP (v 2014-12-17) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref077">77</xref>], and Ensembl gene annotation version 69 was used to detect splice sites. The uniquely aligned reads were counted with featureCounts (v1.4.6) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref074">74</xref>] and the same Ensembl annotation.</p>
<p>Normalisation of the raw read counts based on the library size and testing for differential expression between the different conditions was performed with the DESeq2 R package (v1.6.2) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref078">78</xref>]. To calculate the number of regulated genes between two conditions, we accepted a maximum of 10% false discoveries (padj ≤ 0.1) and considered only genes with normalised counts &gt;100 in either condition and fold change &lt;0.6 or &gt;1.6. Unknown transcripts, pseudogenes, and RNAs other than mRNAs were not considered.</p>
<p>For the PCA, the raw read counts of the conditions to be analysed and their replicates were transformed with the variance stabilising transformation of the DESeq2 package. The top 500 genes that showed the highest variance were selected and used for the PCA calculation.</p>

<title>TUNEL assays</title>
<p>TUNEL assays on cryosections were performed using a fluorescent cell death detection kit (Roche) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Briefly, cryosections were washed in PBS and incubated in Permeabilisation solution (0.1% Triton X-100 in 0.1% Na-citrate) for 2 min at 4°C. For labelling of DNA strand breaks, slides were incubated with 50 μl of TUNEL reaction mixture (fluorescein-labelled nucleotides mixed with terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase) for 1 h at 37°C. Slides were finally rinsed in PBS, mounted with DAPI (Vectashield), and analysed by fluorescent microscopy. Slides that were incubated with DNase I prior to the labelling reaction were used as a positive control.</p>

<title>Western blotting</title>
<p>Protein extraction, gel electrophoresis, and immunoblotting procedures were according to standard protocols. For protein extraction, samples were lysed in RIPA buffer (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.4, 1% NP-40, 0.5% Na-deoxycholate, 0.1% SDS, 150 mM NaCl, and 2 mM EDTA) and supplemented with protease and phosphatase inhibitor cocktails (Sigma). Proteins were loaded at 30 μg/lane on a polyacrylamide gel for electrophoresis, and protein transfer was subsequently performed on a standard nitrocellulose membrane (Amersham). Blocking was performed in 5% milk in TBST (50 mM Tris-HCl pH 7.6, 150 mM NaCl, and 0.05% Tween-20) for 1 h at room temperature, and primary and secondary antibodies were diluted in 1% milk in TBST and incubated overnight at 4°C or for 2 h at room temperature, respectively. Signal was developed using the ECL kit (Perkin Elmer) according to the manufacturer’s instructions. Primary antibodies used were rabbit anti-Yap1 (1:1000; Proteintech), rabbit anti-S1P2 (1:500; Thermo Fisher Scientific), rat anti-E-Cadherin (1:2,000; Zymed), and mouse anti β-actin (1:5,000; Santa Cruz).

<title>Fluorescence activated cell sorting</title>
<p>The epithelial and mesenchymal components of embryonic and cultured pancreata were separated by FACS based on the epithelial expression of Cd49f as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref079">79</xref>]. Briefly, pancreata were dissected and incubated in a 0.05% Trypsin/EDTA solution (Gibco) for 5 min at 37°C. The reaction was terminated with 10% FBS (Sigma), tissues were dispersed with mild pipetting, and single cells were collected by centrifugation (400 g; 4 min). Cells were resuspended in PBS with 0.5% FBS, and after blocking with rat IgG (Abcam) for 15 min, cells were incubated with a Cd49f-FITC (BD Pharmigen) antibody, added at 1:50 dillution for 1 h on ice with gentle rocking. Cells were collected by centrifugation, resuspended in PBS with 0.5% FBS, and sorted by FITC fluorescence intensity on a BD FACS Aria III, following standard procedures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2000949.ref079">79</xref>]. Two fractions were collected consisting of fluorescent (epithelial) and non-fluorescent (mesenchymal) cells, which were subsequently processed for RNA isolation and real-time PCR analysis. The efficiency of the separation was independently confirmed by determining Pdx1 expression in the two fractions.</p>

<title>X-gal stainings</title>
<p>Cryosections of embryonic pancreata were washed in PBS and incubated with 1 mg/ml 5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl-β-D-galactopyranoside (X-Gal; Roche) in staining solution [5mM K<sub>3</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, 5mM K<sub>4</sub>Fe(CN)<sub>6</sub>, 2 mM MgCI<sub>2</sub>, and 5 mM EGTA] for 8 h at 37°C. For double stainings, X-gal–treated sections were rinsed in PBS, incubated in blocking solution (10% normal goat serum, 0.3% Triton X-100) for 1 h at room temperature, and subsequently processed for immunofluorescence as described. For imaging, X-gal stainings were photographed in bright field, and the image was inverted and assigned to the green colour of the RGB composite. This was then merged with the immunofluorescent image (in red) and the DAPI image (in blue) of the corresponding field photographed under UV.</p>

<p>(A-F) Tracking β-galactosidase activity with the X-gal assay from heterozygous <italic>S1P2<sup>tm1lacz</sup></italic> mouse embryos revealed that <italic>S1pr2</italic> was expressed in the pancreas at 9.5 dpc (A, D) and was mainly detected in the mesenchyme until 12.5 dpc because immunofluorescence showed that <italic>S1pr2 </italic>expression was apparent in a few Pdx1<sup>+</sup> (B, C) and E-cadherin<sup>+</sup> (E, F) epithelial cells. (G-I, Q) Epithelial <italic>S1pr2</italic> expression detected by the x-gal activity of the modified allele in heterozygous <italic>S1P2<sup>tm1lacz</sup></italic> mouse embryos peaked at 14.5 dpc, and immunofluorescence showed that it was co-locoalized with Nkx6.1<sup>+</sup> trunk cells (eg arrows in G) as well as with Ptf1a<sup>+</sup> tip cells (eg arrows in H). The same analysis showed that by 16.5 dpc, <italic>S1pr2</italic> expression was eliminated in nascent endocrine C-Pep<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup> (Endo) cells and significantly reduced in the rest of the tissue (I). At P1 expression had disappeared completely (Q).(J-L) Quantitative PCR analysis on FACS-isolated epithelial and mesenchymal components of the developing pancreas at 13.5, 14.5 and 15.5 dpc confirmed that <italic>S1pr2</italic>, <italic>Sphk1</italic> and <italic>Sphk2</italic> expression peaked at 14.5 dpc (K, L), and that <italic>Sphk1</italic> and <italic>Sphk2</italic> expression was predominantly epithelial (L).

<p>(A-G) RNA Seq gene expression profiling revealed that transcription factors and other genes implicated in epithelial progenitor specification and maintenance were not significantly affected in <italic>S1pr2<sup>tm1Rlp</sup></italic> null pancreata at 14.5 dpc (A). RNA seq counts of both <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> were increased in the <italic>S1pr2<sup>tm1Rlp</sup> </italic>null pancreata at 14.5 dpc (B). Abrogating S1pr2 signalling by intraperitoneally injecting pregnant mice with 2 or 5 mg/kg of body weight JTE013 at 13.5, 14.5 and 15.5 dpc resulted in upregulation of both <italic>S1pr3</italic> and <italic>Lpar1</italic> at 16.5 dpc as shown by qPCR (C). Quantitative PCR analysis on isolated epithelial and mesenchymal components of the wt developing pancreas at 13.5, 14.5 and 15.5 dpc showed that expression of expression of both <italic>S1pr3</italic> (D) and <italic>Lpar1</italic> (E) was predominantly mesenchymal. Quantitative PCR for <italic>Pdx1</italic> expression was used to confirm the efficiency of mesenchymal and epithelial separation by FACS (F). Immunofluorescence and quantitation of the ratio pH3<sup>+</sup> / E-cadherin<sup>+</sup> cells in wt and <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata showed that epithelial proliferation was not affected (G).

<title><italic>S1pr2<sup>tm1Rlp</sup></italic> null embryonic pancreata in ALI cultures showed defects in lineage specification; S1p rescues endocrine specification in JTE013-treated pancreata in ALI cultures.</title>
<p>(A-I, M, N) Immunofluorescence analysis showed that 14.5 dpc <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata in ALI cultures for 6 days (14.5 dpc + 6ds) gave a strongly reduced number of C-pep<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup> endocrine cells (B, E, N), a strongly reduced number of Amy<sup>+</sup> acinar cells and an increased number of CK19<sup>+</sup> duct-like cells (C, F, N). S1pr2 block by 15μM JTE013 in 14.5 dpc + 6ds ALI cultures of wild-type pancreata resulted in morphological defects characterised by an absence of the dense cell clusters observed by brightfield microscopy in untreated wt and <italic>S1pr2<sup> tm1Rlp</sup></italic> null cultures (compare M to A and D). In contrast, 14.5 dpc + 6ds ALI cultures of <italic>S1pr2</italic> null pancreata in the presence of 15μM JTE013 caused no such morphological defects (G), and immunofluorescence analysis showed that it did not further affect specification of endocrine (C-peptide<sup>+</sup> and Glucagon<sup>+</sup>)(B, E, H, N), acinar (Amylase<sup>+</sup>) or ductal (CK19<sup>+</sup>) (C, F, I, N) cells confirming the specificity of JTE013 for S1pr2 also in this context. (J-L) Immunofluorescence analysis showed that the presence of 20 μM S1p rescued specification of endocrine (Cpep<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup>) cells in JTE013-treated 14.5 dpc + 6 ds ALI cultures (K), and to a lesser extent specification of acinar (Amy<sup>+</sup>) and ductal (CK19<sup>+</sup>) cells (L).

<p>(A-C) Quantitative PCR analysis showed that <italic>CTGF </italic>expression peaks at 14.5 dpc (A) and that it was expressed in both the mesenchyme and the epithelium of 13.5, 14.5 and 15.5 dpc embryonic pancreata (B). S1pr2 block in 14.5 dpc + 2 ds ALI pancreatic cultures with 15 μM JTE013 causes a 3.5-fold decrease in <italic>CTGF</italic> expression as shown by RNA Seq (C).

(C) Quantitative PCR analysis showed that <italic>YAP </italic>is expressed in both the mesenchyme and the epithelium of 13.5 embryonic pancreata but is predominantly expressed in the epithelium at 14.5 and 15.5 dpc pancreata. (D) RNA Seq analysis on 14.5 dpc pancreata and pancreatic ALI cultures showed that YAP gene expression is not affected in S1pr2-nulls and in S1pr2-blocked explants in the presence or absence of CTGF (E) Quantitative PCR analysis showed that <italic>YAP</italic> levels remain unchanged in 14.5 dpc + 2ds ALI cultures treated with 10μg/ml PTX compared to untreated controls. (F) Western blot analysis on 14.5 + 2 ds ALI cultures treated with 50μM of the G<sub>αq</sub> inhibitor GP-2A or 5μg/ml of the G<sub>α</sub>12/13 inhibitor C3-exoenzyme, showed that YAP levels remained unchanged in both cases, compared to untreated controls.(G-J, N, O) A conditional <italic>ROSA26<sup>LSLtdTomato</sup> </italic>allele was activated using the <italic>Tg<sup>Pdx1CreERT2</sup></italic> driver and tamoxifen ip injections in pregnant mice. Analysis by immunofluorescence at 14.5 dpc showed that endocrine (C-pep<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup>)(G), acinar (Amy<sup>+</sup>) (H) and ductal (CK19<sup>+</sup>) (I) cells were labeled with tdTomato, with a similar efficiency ranging between 38–50% (J). Immunofluorescence analysis of these samples showed that there was no effect on acinar (N) or duct (O) cell specification. (K-M) Immunofluorescence analysis on the above samples at 14.5 dpc indicated that YAP expression in Tg<sup>Pdx1CreERT2</sup> / YAP<sup>fl/fl</sup> pancreata (L, M) drops by 64% compared to their wild-type counterparts (K, M). (P-R) However, no differences in the numbers of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells were observed between YAP inactivated (Q,R) and control YAP<sup>fl/fl</sup> pancreata (P,R). (S-V) Tg<sup>Pdx1CreERT2</sup> / YAP<sup>fl/fl</sup> E14.5 pancreata kept in culture for 6 days displayed a 30% reduction in the levels of endocrine cells compared to control YAP<sup>fl/fl</sup> pancreata explants (S, T, V). Treatment with 20 μM S1P, did not restore the numbers of endocrine cells in the YAP inactivated explants (U, V). Scale bars, 70μm (G-I, P, Q, S-U), 100μm (K, L); ***<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, ns not significant in reference to S1pr2-blocked controls (A), to E14.5 samples (B), to expression in the mesenchymal component of the corresponding time point (C), to untreated control explants (E) or to expresion in control (YAP<sup>fl/fl</sup>) pancreata (N, O, R); Error bars in B, C, E show SEM; Error bars in A, J, M, N, O, R, V show SD.

<title>Interaction of Notch and S1pr2 signaling in pancreatic ALI cultures.</title>
<p>(A-C) Immunofluorecence analysis showed that stimulation of Notch signalling with 10 μM DSL resulted in elimination of Ngn3<sup>+</sup> cells (A, quantitations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) in 14.5 dpc + 2ds ALI cultures and in a significant reduction in the number of C-pep<sup>+</sup>, Gcg<sup>+</sup> (B, quantitations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) and Amy<sup>+</sup> cells in favour of an expanded population of CK19<sup>+</sup> cells (C, quantitations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2000949.g008">Fig 8C</xref>) in 14.5 dpc + 6ds ALI cultures (D-F) Immunofluorescence analysis in 14.5 dpc + 1d ALI cultures showed that Sel1l expression was restored in the absence of S1pr2 signalling by 20 μM of S1p (D), and this was sufficient to restore attenuation of both Hes1 (E) and NICD (F) expression. (G-H) Notch inhibition of 14.5 dpc + 2 ds ALI cultures with 10 μM DAPT caused a dramatic transient expansion of C-pep<sup>+</sup> and Gcg<sup>+</sup> cells (G), at the expense of Amy<sup>+</sup> and CK19<sup>+</sup> cells (H). (I-J) Notch inhibition with 10 μM DAPT together with S1pr2 block with 15 μM JTE013 in 14.5 dpc + 2 ds ALI cultures transiently restored endocrine (C-pep<sup>+</sup>) (I) and acinar (Amy<sup>+</sup>) (J) cell specification. (K-L) Immunofluorescence analysis in 14.5 dpc + 2d ALI cultures showed that Notch stimulation with 10 μM DSL resulted in a significant reduction of Sel1l expression (K, L). Scale bars, 70μm (A-C and G-J), 50μm (D-F, K, L). For raw data please refer to the <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2000949.s014">S2 Data</xref> file.</p>
