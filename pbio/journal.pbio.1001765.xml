<p>Electron tomography reveals the structural organization of actin comet tails generated by a baculovirus, providing an understanding of how this pathogen hijacks host machinery to propel itself between cells.</p>
</abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Several pathogens induce propulsive actin comet tails in cells they invade to disseminate their infection. They achieve this by recruiting factors for actin nucleation, the Arp2/3 complex, and polymerization regulators from the host cytoplasm. Owing to limited information on the structural organization of actin comets and in particular the spatial arrangement of filaments engaged in propulsion, the underlying mechanism of pathogen movement is currently speculative and controversial. Using electron tomography we have resolved the three-dimensional architecture of actin comet tails propelling baculovirus, the smallest pathogen yet known to hijack the actin motile machinery. Comet tail geometry was also mimicked in mixtures of virus capsids with purified actin and a minimal inventory of actin regulators. We demonstrate that propulsion is based on the assembly of a fishbone-like array of actin filaments organized in subsets linked by branch junctions, with an average of four filaments pushing the virus at any one time. Using an energy-minimizing function we have simulated the structure of actin comet tails as well as the tracks adopted by baculovirus in infected cells <italic>in vivo</italic>. The results from the simulations rule out gel squeezing models of propulsion and support those in which actin filaments are continuously tethered during branch nucleation and polymerization. Since <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic>, <italic>Shigella flexneri</italic>, and Vaccinia virus among other pathogens use the same common toolbox of components as baculovirus to move, we suggest they share the same principles of actin organization and mode of propulsion.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Several bacteria and viruses hijack the motile machinery of cells they invade to generate networks of actin filaments (comet tails) to propel themselves from one cell to another. A proper understanding of the mechanism of propulsion has so far been hampered by a lack of information about the structure of the machinery. Using electron tomography we present here the three-dimensional structure of actin comet tails propelling a baculovirus, the smallest pathogen known to recruit the actin nano-machinery. We show that baculovirus is propelled by a fishbone-like array of actin filaments constructed from subsets linked by branch junctions, with an average of four filaments pushing the virus by their fast polymerizing ends at any one time. Using a stochastic mathematical model we have simulated comet tail organization as well as the tracks adopted by baculovirus inside cells. The simulations support a model of baculovirus propulsion in which the actin filaments are continuously tethered to the virus surface as they grow, branch, and push. Since larger pathogens like Listeria, Shigella, and Vaccinia virus generate comet tails exhibiting the same general morphology and components as those of baculovirus, the basic mechanism of their propulsion is likely a scaled up version of the one described here.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The seminal finding of Tilney and Portnoy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Tilney1">[1]</xref> that <italic>Listeria monocytogenes</italic> exploits the actin cytoskeleton of infected cells to invade neighboring cells opened a new chapter in motile processes based on actin. Major progress in understanding how <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> uses actin to move came from the identification of the Arp2/3 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Machesky1">[2]</xref> as the downstream target promoting actin polymerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Welch1">[3]</xref> and from the subsequent elucidation of the minimal protein cocktail required for propulsion <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Loisel1">[4]</xref>. Essential in the <italic>in vitro</italic> motility mix was actin, the Arp2/3 complex, ADF/cofilin, an actin capping protein and an activator of the Arp2/3 complex, ActA on <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, or N-WASP on plastic beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Loisel1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Wiesner1">[5]</xref>. Subsequent studies have revealed a growing list of bacterial and viral pathogens that exploit the actin-based motile machinery of infected cells by mimicking or recruiting N-WASP to activate the Arp2/3 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Goley1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Dodding1">[7]</xref> or other actin nucleators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Haglund1">[8]</xref>. To gain more insight into the mechanism of propulsion, several efforts have been directed at establishing the structure of the actin comet tail induced by pathogens. Electron microscopy of plastic-embedded, negatively stained <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> comet tails, or critical point dried tails on ActA-coated beads <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Tilney1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Sechi1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Gouin1">[11]</xref> showed actin filaments more or less randomly oriented, but the high density of filaments precluded definition of their spatial organization by conventional 2D imaging.</p>
<p>Using electron tomography we recently showed that lamellipodia networks comprise subsets of actin filaments linked by branch junctions structurally homologous to those formed from the Arp2/3 complex and actin <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Vinzenz1">[12]</xref>. With electron tomography practical limits are set by the thickness of the sample and <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> are more than twice as thick as lamellipodia, making them less suitable for structural analysis. The timely finding that a baculovirus species, <italic>Autographa californica</italic> multiple nucleopolyhedrovirus, just 50 nm in diameter, moves on an actin comet tail in infected cells and bears a minor capsid protein p78/83 that directly activates the Arp2/3 complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Goley2">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Machesky2">[15]</xref> offered an ideal object for resolving comet architecture. In the present report we provide the first structure, to our knowledge, of an actin comet tail driving a pathogen and use this new information to re-evaluate alternative models (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Mogilner1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Dickinson1">[17]</xref>) of pathogen propulsion by actin.</p>

<title>Baculoviruses Generate Actin Comets in Vertebrate Cells</title>
<p>Lepidopteran cells, the natural host of baculovirus, proved too thick for analysis by electron tomography. However, we found that baculovirus was readily taken up by thinner vertebrate cells of mouse (B16 melanoma, NIH 3T3 fibroblasts), fish (CAR fibroblasts), and human (HeLa) origin. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and Movie S1 show a B16 melanoma cell expressing GFP-actin that was infected with baculovirus tagged with mCherry <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Ohkawa1">[14]</xref>.

<title>Electron Tomography of Intracellular Comet Tails Induced by Baculovirus</title>
<p>By applying cryo-electron tomography to intact cells and cytoskeletons, we previously showed that actin networks in lamellipodia are preserved using a cytoskeleton preparation procedure involving simultaneous extraction with Triton X-100 and fixation in glutaraldehyde <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Urban1">[18]</xref>. This procedure leads to a marked improvement in filament contrast and resolution as compared to un-extracted cells. Using the same routine with baculovirus infected cells, we could show that the fluorescence intensity profile and length of actin comet tails were retained by this extraction/fixation method (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
<p>The ultrastructural organization of baculovirus actin comet tails was resolved in cytoskeletons of infected cells using two complementary approaches involving embedment either in negative stain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">Figure 2</xref>) or in vitreous ice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g003">Figure 3</xref>). A section of an electron tomogram of a negatively stained baculovirus comet tail in the cytoplasm of a fish fibroblast cytoskeleton and the model derived by filament tracking are shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">Figure 2</xref> (see also Movie S2). As shown, the comet tail filaments form a fishbone-like array generated through the frequent formation of branch junctions (highlighted in the insets in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) with an average angle of 75.2±8.0° (s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 652). From tracking of filaments in the comet tail network, they appeared to be organized into subsets (averaging 14.2±8.3 filaments per subset, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 34) highlighted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">Figure 2B</xref> in different colors, each linked by a separate group of branch junctions (red spots in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">Figure 2B,C</xref>).

<p>The filament array belonging to the actin comets was mainly separated in Z from the actin filaments of the cytoplasm (see additionally Figures S4 and S5), which were typically longer and randomly oriented. Intermingling of the two filament populations also occurred, but it was relatively straightforward to assign filaments to the comets according to additional criteria: 1, termination within the comet core; and 2, extension of filaments from the core towards the virus.</p>
<p>To circumvent the partial collapse of comet tails in negatively stained preparations, we analyzed them also by cryo-electron tomography. Optimal contrast for filament tracking in actin comets was obtained by imaging them in cytoskeletons of infected cells within cytoplasmic regions that lay over holes in the supporting film (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g003">Figure 3</xref> and Movie S3). Branch junctions with the typical angle were readily identified (insets, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g003">Figure 3A</xref> and Movie S4) with the comet tail filaments oriented at an average angle of 50.9±23.7° (s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 485) to the core axis. The number of filaments transecting a core region of the comet tail corresponding to the cross-section of the virus (highlighted in yellow in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g003">Figure 3B</xref>) at different axial positions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g003">Figure 3C</xref>. These data indicated an average number of filaments involved in pushing of 3.9±1.4 (s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 252, range 1–8). Taken together, the data from three negative stain and three cryo-electron tomograms gave an average filament length of 121.1±99.9 nm (s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 961) (cryo 107.8±89.8 nm, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 477, negative stain 134.2±107.3 nm, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 482), average branch angles of 75.2±8.0° (s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 652) (cryo 74.7±8.7°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 331, negative stain 75.8±7.3°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 321), and an average interbranch spacing of 37.7 nm±30.1 nm (s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 290) (cryo 37.1 nm±32.8 nm, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 154, negative stain 38.4 nm±26.8 nm, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 136). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g003">Figure 3D</xref> shows a projection of the 3D model of the comet tail together with (in translucent grey) the endogenous actin filaments of the cytoskeleton that were mainly located above and below the comet (see also Movie S3 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s006">Figure S6</xref>).</p>

<title>Architecture of Baculovirus Actin Comets Formed <italic>in Vitro</italic></title>
<p>By exposing the p78/83 capsid protein of budded baculoviruses from cell supernatants using detergent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g004">Figure 4A,B</xref>) we could reconstitute comet tail formation <italic>in vitro</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Loisel1">[4]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g005">5</xref>). In the motility cocktail (actin, Arp2/3 complex, gelsolin, ADF/cofilin, and profilin) filament length was influenced most strongly by variations in gelsolin concentration (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g004">Figure 4F,G</xref>).

<title>Mathematical Model of Baculovirus Propulsion</title>
<p>Using a quasi-static approach in a two-dimensional model (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s017">Text S1</xref>) we sought to mimic the intracellular movement of baculovirus and the structural features of the comet tails. We assumed several forces acting on the virus: Cytoplasmic friction, Brownian forces, and the forces exerted by the actin filaments. In the model, actin filaments are simulated as stiff, immobile rods, which can push the virus due to polymerization. We initially considered three variations of the model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>). In the “tethered” case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6A</xref>) actin filaments proximal to the virus surface are continuously tethered, both during pushing and when they lag behind. When lagging behind they exert a pulling force described by a spring connection (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6A</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">2</xref>). In the “tethered during branching” case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) tethering to the virus occurs only during branching events (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">2</xref>) and is described by a spring connection to the Arp2/3 complex. In the “untethered” case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) no tethering takes place between the filament plus ends or the branch points with the virus surface. In the latter two cases, the untethered, lagging filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figures 6B,C</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">7</xref>) may convert into pushing or capped filaments. The primary difference between the three cases is then the degree of pulling forces exerted on the virus by the filament network. In each case, Arp2/3-dependent branches (marked in red in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>) are induced by the p78/83 nucleation promoting factor at the rear of the pathogen. Filaments that move laterally off the rear of the virus continue to polymerize (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g004">4</xref>) until they are capped (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6A–C</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g005">5</xref>), and those at the rear of the tail de-polymerize from their minus ends (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6A–C, 6</xref>).</p>

<p>(A–C) Schematic representation of the three different models considered. (A). Tethered model. (B) Tethered during branching model. (C) Untethered model. Actin filaments are in green, branchpoints in red, and the virus is depicted in grey. Polymerizing filaments can push (1). The virus surface is continuously tethered to the barbed ends (A, 2) or to the Arp2/3 complex during branching (B, 2) or not at all (C). Tethering is modeled by a spring connection. Branches (3) are initiated by Arp2/3 complex (red) recruited to the plus ends of actin filaments at the virus surface. Elongation of filaments that can no longer push (4) continues until they are capped (5). Filaments at the rear of the tail become de-branched and depolymerize from their minus ends (6). In (B) and (C) filaments lagging behind are not tethered (7). (D) Baculovirus actin comet tail in a B16 melanoma cell observed in vitreous ice, shown in two z-sextons, 18 nm thick.

<p>To compare the electron microscope data with the simulations, we quantified (1) the angles that filaments subtended with the axis of the comet tails (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6D,E</xref>), (2) the length distribution of the filaments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6K</xref>), and (3) the number of filaments joined together in subsets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). By an appropriate choice of input parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s014">Table S1</xref>) we could mimic the measured parameters only for the “tethered” case (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6F,J,K</xref>; summarized in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s015">Tables S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s016">S3</xref>). In the “tethered” situation, the distribution of angles subtended to the trajectory (52.6±26.8°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 49,321) compared closely to the value obtained from three cryo-tomograms (50.9±23.7°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 485), whereas the “tethered during branching” and “untethered” models produced tails with filaments emanating at significantly higher angles (64.8±42.6°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 58,895, and 59.7±41.1°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 51,168, respectively; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6F,G,H,J</xref>). Pushing the virus along a straight path tends to be dynamically unstable due to its elongated shape <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Lacayo1">[21]</xref>. To obtain in the model a persistent and relatively straight movement, an average of 3–4 filaments evenly distributed over the rear of the virus were required at any one time. Due to statistical variation, this condition was not satisfied by a single subset of filaments. Instead, regions on the virus rear, where filaments became sparse, required the engagement of new mother filaments, through <italic>de novo</italic> nucleation or recruitment from the cytoplasm that then initiated new filament subsets. In the “tethered” case, the simulations generated an average of 11 filaments per subset, comparable to the value determined from the tomograms, whereas for the “untethered” case a new mother filament was required after every 2–3 branching events, leading to an average of 3 filaments per subset.</p>
<p>The straightness of tracks adopted by the virus in cells was compared to the simulations by measuring the angular divergence of 200 nm segments along the comet tail axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">Figure 7</xref>). Experimental data were derived from 19 comet tails imaged by conventional 2D electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">Figure 7C,D</xref>). Again, the range of observed turning angles fitted best the values obtained with the “tethered” case simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">Figure 7F</xref>). With simulations run for extended periods of time (at least 30 min of real time each), tracking in the “tethered” model generally mimicked the undulating course of baculovirus observed by live cell imaging and electron microscopy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">Figure 7A,F</xref> and Movies S1 and S6), whereas tracks were highly tortuous in the “untethered” simulations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">Figure 7B,F</xref> and Movie S6) as also previously reported for simulated trajectories of <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Dickinson2">[22]</xref>. Values of the angular divergence of trajectories from tails acquired by transmission electron microscopy (22.0±24.4°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 255 angles in 19 individual tails) and “tethered” simulations (17.4±14.8°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 1,449) were significantly smaller than those from “untethered” simulations (51.2±38.0°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 2,681) and those from simulations for the case of “tethered during branching” (44.4±33.2°, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 2,337) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">Figure 7F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s016">Table S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the electron tomography data indicated branching only towards the virus surface, we also considered a “tethered” model in which branching could also occur away from the virus, leading to a subpopulation of filaments unable to engage in pushing. Surprisingly, simulations of this “tethered random branching” case produced relatively straight tracks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">Figure 6I</xref>) with normal deviations (24.5±20.9, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 1,430, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g007">Figure 7F</xref>) but failed to reproduce the typical fishbone-like array of actin filaments. This was reflected in significantly higher filament to trajectory angles as well as in a 40% decrease in the number of filaments per subset. In addition the number of productive, pushing filaments was significantly less (3.47±1.27, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 3,185,000 compared to 4.10±1.25, s.d., <italic>n</italic> = 1,965,000) despite an increase of 20% in the number of filaments per µm tail length.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The resolution achievable by electron tomography is dependent on a number of factors, not least the thickness of the specimen. Baculovirus is at least 20-fold smaller than <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic>, with a diameter only six times the thickness of an actin filament, making it an ideal object for electron tomography. For cryo-electron tomography, we found that filament tracking and polarity analysis was only possible in energy-filtered tomograms obtained by imaging comet tails in cytoskeletons over holes in perforated films, to reduce background noise. As we show, useful complementary structural information was also provided from electron tomography of negatively stained samples due to higher image contrast and filament detail. Taking into account these different factors we have been able to provide the first 3D structure, to our knowledge, of an actin comet tail propelling a pathogen. Our demonstration of a minimal actin filament cassette for propulsion provides a new framework for analyzing and modeling the underlying mechanisms of actin force production by Arp2/3-complex-dependent actin assemblies.</p>
<p>The actin-based propulsion of loads (from <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> to beads) has already attracted the interest of several groups <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Mogilner1">[16]</xref>,. In the case of the baculovirus tail with its limited number of filaments, we can exclude the squeezing mechanism proposed in the active gel model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Plastino1">[23]</xref>. Mogilner and Oster <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Mogilner2">[25]</xref> and Dickinson and Purich <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Dickinson3">[26]</xref> provide useful alternative models of how actin filaments may push at the pathogen surface disregarding actin tail architecture. Alberts and Odell's <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Alberts1">[27]</xref> comprehensive <italic>in silico</italic> model simulates details of the actin filament organization but without knowledge of the actual structure. We chose a tractable modeling approach (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s017">Text S1</xref>) using a minimal number of parameters (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s014">Table S1</xref>) to define the essential set of mechanisms required to simulate the observed filament organization and the motion of the virus <italic>in vivo</italic>.</p>
<p>By comparing alternative mathematical simulations with our experimental data, we may propose key mechanistic features of comet tail propulsion. In particular, comet tail organization and the trajectories of the virus were best explained by assuming continuous attachment of actin filament to the virus surface, supporting the hypothesis that tethering, possibly by VASP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Breitsprecher1">[28]</xref>, which is present in the baculovirus tail, and pulling forces between the tail and the pathogen <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Dickinson1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Tsuchida1">[29]</xref> are needed to stabilize viral movement. A critical parameter influencing the modeling outcome was Brownian motion (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s017">Text S1</xref>). Without it, there was little difference between the simulations for tethered and un-tethered filaments. Since the virus must experience external jostling forces in the cytoplasm, we consider the model featuring Brownian motion and tethering to mimic more closely the situation <italic>in vivo</italic>. An interesting feature of the model was the prediction that nucleation of filaments on the virus is required not only to initiate movement, but also intermittently to correct sharp turns and a stochastic, regional paucity of pushing filaments. As a consequence, sequential subsets of branched filaments are created, consistent with the tomography data and reminiscent of the organization of actin filaments in lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Vinzenz1">[12]</xref>. The fishbone-like array of filaments in the comet tail could only be simulated if branching was biased toward the virus surface with the result that all new filaments are involved in pushing. The viral nucleation promoting factor, p78/83, therefore seems to restrict branching from tethered mother filaments in a biased way, through conformational constraints, or possibly as a result of local bending of actin filaments at the filament–virus interface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Risca1">[30]</xref>. The delay of capping protein incorporation in the comet tail corresponding to around 1 s (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) is consistent with the observed filament length distribution ranging from 10 nm to 800 nm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g002">Figures 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g003">3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g006">6K</xref>). The later incorporation of cofilin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001765-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) is likewise consistent with its preferential binding to ADP-F-actin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Carlier1">[31]</xref>.</p>
<p>Fishbone-like patterns of actin have been described in comet tails induced in cells by vaccinia virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Cudmore1">[32]</xref> as well as by <italic>L. monocytogenes</italic> in <italic>in vitro</italic> motility assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Wiesner1">[5]</xref> at low gelsolin concentrations. The principles of organization of actin filaments in the baculovirus actin comet tail shown here thus likely apply generally to comets formed on pathogens that hijack the Arp2/3 complex machinery for propulsion and invasion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Goley1">[6]</xref>.</p>

<p>Coverslips carrying baculovirus-infected cells were mounted in an open chamber on a heating platform (Harvard Instruments) in prewarmed medium. Intracellular virus-induced tails were usually observed after about 20 min postinfection. The samples were observed on an inverted Zeiss Observer epifluorescence microscope equipped with a Perkin Elmer UltraView spinning disc system (ProSync2). For kymograph analysis, Fiji together with a MatLab-based script were used. Statistical analysis was performed using Prism. Intensity values of tail components were normalized to tail length based on the linear relationship between tail length and speed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001765.s001">Figure S1E</xref>).</p>

<title>Electron Microscopy</title>
<p>For negative staining electron microscopy, cells were grown on Formvar-coated 200 mesh hexagonal nickel grids (Agar Scientific) or 135 mesh NHF15-A gold Finder grids (Maxtaform) in standard medium and allowed to spread overnight. After spreading, the samples were washed with cytoskeleton buffer (10 mM MES buffer, 150 mM NaCl, 5 mM EGTA, 5 mM glucose, 5 mM MgCl<sub>2</sub>, pH 6.8), fixed and extracted with 0.5% Triton X-100 and 0.25% glutaraldehyde in cytoskeleton buffer for 1 min, and kept in 2% glutaraldehyde with 1 µg/ml phalloidin in cytoskeleton buffer at 4°C. For routine inspection in an 80 kV transmission electron microscope (Morgagni, FEI), grids were stained with 70 µl 2% SST including 1 µg/ml phalloidin. For electron tomography, grids were stained with 70 µl 6%–8% sodium silicotungstate (SST) including 1 µg/ml phalloidin. For cryo-electron tomography, virus-infected cells were plated in growth medium onto Quantifoil R1/4, R1.2/1.3, and R2/2 perforated carbon films on 200 mesh Au grids, and allowed to spread for 6 h. The cells were fixed as for negative staining and the grids subsequently transferred to forceps in a grid-plunging device (Leica EM GP), supplemented with 4 µl of medium and 10 nm BSA-saturated colloidal gold <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Vinzenz1">[12]</xref>. During mounting and blotting, the grid was held in a chamber with controlled humidity and temperature (95% and 22°C) and was blotted automatically for 1.5–2 s with humidified Whatman No. 1 filter paper applied to the backside of the grid to avoid any contact with the cells. Samples were frozen by plunging into liquid ethane cooled to 80 K by liquid nitrogen. <italic>In vitro</italic> polymerized actin tails were prepared for electron microcopy as follows. For negative staining the incubation mix was fixed after different times on the 200 mesh Au grids by injecting 2% glutaraldehyde (final concentration 0.5%) for 4 min and stained with 70 µl 2% sodium silicotungstate (SST). For cryo-electron microscopy, samples were incubated on Quantifoil R3.5/1 perforated carbon films on 200 mesh Au grids for 45 min, rinsed with 70 µl X-Buffer, followed by 70 µl X-Buffer with 1∶10 BSA-colloid gold, and without fixation or fixed as above, frozen as described above with blotting times between 1.2 and 1.6 s. Tilt series were acquired on an FEI Tecnai F30 Helium (Polara) microscope, operated at 300 kV, and cooled to approximately 80 K. Automated acquisition of tilt series was driven by SerialEM 3.x. Normally, the tilt range was −60° to +60° using the Saxton tilt scheme based on 1° increments for negative stain and 2° increments for cryo-samples from 0° tilt, at a nominal defocus value of −5 µm to −7 µm for negative stain and −8 µm to −12 µm for cryo-samples. For negative stain samples, two tilt series around orthogonal axes were recorded on a Gatan UltraScan 4000 CCD camera at on-camera magnifications typically from 23,000× to 59,000×. For frozen hydrated samples, zero-loss images were recorded on a Gatan MSC 2 k camera on a GIF 2002 using a slit width of 15 eV. The total electron dose for the cryo-tilt series was less than 130 electrons per Å<sup>2</sup>, and the primary on-screen magnification was from 20,000× to 29,000×.</p>

<title>Image Processing and Analysis</title>
<p>Re-projections from the tilt series with gold particles as fiducials for alignment and contrast transfer function corrections were performed using IMOD software <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Kremer1">[38]</xref>. A typical tomogram comprised a z-stack of 60–120 sections of 0.4–1.5 nm each. The polarity of actin filaments in tomograms of negatively stained and frozen samples was determined using a filament straightening protocol and cross-correlation analysis as described elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Narita2">[20]</xref>. Filaments were manually tracked using IMOD, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Vinzenz1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>The identity of branch junctions was based on filament tracking analysis, performed by three investigators independently. Filaments were tracked individually and branch junctions identified as blunt intersections of filament pairs subtending an acute angle in the range of 60–90°, as deduced for branch junctions in lamellipodia <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001765-Vinzenz1">[12]</xref>. An example of the tracking analysis in the cryo-tomograms is shown in Movie S4.</p>

Red arrows indicate direction of intensity measurements. (C) Average of 20 measurements along the tail shown in (A). To average signals along the comet tail trajectories, the intensity value of the background around 1 µm in front of the virus was subtracted from all measurements along the trajectory. The resulting data were normalized to maximal intensity, plotted on the <italic>y</italic> axis, and to tail length, plotted on the <italic>x</italic> axis. At the position of the virus, defined by the mCherry-label (<italic>n</italic> = 689 measurements in 26 individual tails), the GFP-actin intensity corresponded to 0.15 times the maximal intensity. This intensity value was used to define the beginning and end of the tail, in the case of actin (<italic>n</italic> = 2,776 in 111 tails). For VASP (<italic>n</italic> = 929 in 30 tails), ArpC5 (<italic>n</italic> = 300 in 20 tails), capping protein β (<italic>n</italic> = 313 in 13 tails), and cofilin (<italic>n</italic> = 395 in 17 tails) co-labeling with fluorescent actin was used in the same way to determine the limits of the comet tail.
