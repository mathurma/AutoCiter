In some fruits such as pears, which are typically stored under a controlled atmosphere with reduced O<sub>2</sub> and increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels to extend their commercial storage life, anoxia may occur, eventually leading to physiological disorders. In this manuscript we have developed a mathematical model to predict the internal gas concentrations, including permeation, diffusion, and respiration and fermentation kinetics. Pear fruit has been selected as a case study. The model has been used to perform in silico experiments to evaluate the effect of, for example, fruit size or ambient gas concentration on internal O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels. The model incorporates the actual shape of the fruit and was solved using fluid dynamics software. Environmental conditions such as temperature and gas composition have a large effect on the internal distribution of oxygen and carbon dioxide in fruit. Also, the fruit size has a considerable effect on local metabolic gas concentrations; hence, depending on the size, local anaerobic conditions may result, which eventually may lead to physiological disorders. The model developed in this manuscript is to our knowledge the most comprehensive model to date to simulate gas exchange in plant tissue. It can be used to evaluate the effect of environmental stresses on fruit via in silico experiments and may lead to commercial applications involving long-term storage of fruit under controlled atmospheres.</p></abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title><p>Respiration plays an important role in the overall metabolism of plants, and certainly is related to gas exchange of plants with the environment. In roots and bulky storage organs such as fruit and tubers, where the length of the diffusion path may be considerable, anoxic conditions may even occur. This is of particular importance in fruit, which are often stored under low-oxygen conditions to extend their storage life. In this manuscript, we have developed a new mathematical model to describe the gas transport and respiration kinetics in intact pear fruit. Michaelis-Menten kinetics was used to describe the respiration behavior of tissues. Diffusion was the main driving force for gas exchange. Differences in diffusion rates of the different gasses led to total pressure gradients that caused convective exchange as described by Darcy's law. The model incorporates the actual shape of the fruit and was solved using fluid dynamics software. It is a first step towards a multiscale model that addresses all spatial scales relevant to gas transport. These findings can be used to evaluate the effect of environmental stresses on fruit via in silico experiments and may lead to commercial solutions for long-term storage of fruit under controlled atmospheres.</p></abstract><funding-group><funding-statement>Financial support by the K.

Plants do not have specialised systems for gas exchange but rely on apertures in the epidermis such as stomata and lenticels and the intercellular air space within the tissue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Drew1">[1]</xref>. Also, in metabolically active organs such as leaves, the diffusion path is usually very short, thus facilitating gas transport. O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> gradients have, however, been observed in plant organs such as roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Sinclair1">[2]</xref>, tubers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Geigenberger1">[3]</xref>, stems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-VanDongen1">[4]</xref>, inflorescences <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Seymour1">[5]</xref>, seeds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Porterfield1">[6]</xref> and fruit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn1">[7]</xref>. In roots and bulky storage organs such as fruit and tubers, where the length of the diffusion path may be considerable, anoxic conditions may even occur. Geigenberger et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Geigenberger1">[3]</xref> observed internal O<sub>2</sub> concentrations below 5 kPa, causing partial inhibition of respiration, decrease in the cellular energy status, and partial inhibition of other energy-consuming processes. In some fruits such as pears, which are typically stored under a controlled atmosphere with reduced O<sub>2</sub> and increased CO<sub>2</sub> levels to extend their commercial storage life, anoxia may even occur, eventually leading to cell death and loss of the product <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Franck1">[8]</xref>. Similar atmosphere conditions, however, do not seem to affect other fruit such as apples appreciably <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Saquet1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Veltman1">[10]</xref>. While it is likely that this is related to differences in concentration gradients resulting from differences in tissue diffusivity and respiratory activity, there is little information about such gas gradients in fruit in the literature. Such knowledge would be, nevertheless, very valuable both to understand gas exchange in plant tissue but also to guide commercial storage practices, since disorders under controlled atmosphere related to fermentation are a prime cause of concern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Veltman1">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ma1">[13]</xref>.</p><p>Microsensors have been used to measure oxygen concentrations in stem transects and phloem exudate of intact <italic>Ricinus communis</italic> plants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-VanDongen1">[4]</xref>, roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Bidel1">[14]</xref>, and fruit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Weichmann1">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Schouten1">[16]</xref>. However, no matter how small the electrodes, insertion in fruit tissue causes damage that may result in measurement artefacts. Morison et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Morison1">[17]</xref> used chlorophyll fluorescence imaging to investigate CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion into leaves; while this technique provides spatial information it obviously can only be used when there is an active photosynthetic system, which is not the case in fruit parenchyma cells. Biochemical measurements of indicators of anaerobiosis in roots such as acetaldehye, ethanol and alcohohol dehydrogenase have been carried in roots <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Crawford1">[18]</xref> and in fruit <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ke1">[19]</xref> but are indirect and do not provide quantitative data on gas concentrations.</p><p>As there is, to date, no good method to measure <italic>in vivo</italic> internal gas concentrations in fruit, a mathematical modelling approach would provide an alternative to predict the internal gas concentrations. Also, once validated such a model could be used conveniently to perform <italic>in silico</italic> experiments to evaluate the effect of, e.g., fruit size or ambient gas concentration on internal O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> levels without the need for extra experimental effort. Denison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Denison1">[20]</xref> developed a reaction-diffusion model for oxygen diffusion and respiration in legume root nodules and found large effects of flooding of the intercellular space on the O<sub>2</sub> permeability. Aalto and Juurola <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Aalto1">[21]</xref> constructed a three-dimensional model of CO<sub>2</sub> transport in leafs and implemented it into a computational fluid dynamics code. The model accounts for the actual 3D microstructure of a leaf. The authors used the model to investigate the effect of stomatal opening, photosynthetic capacity, temperature and increased ambient CO<sub>2</sub> levels on total CO<sub>2</sub> flux.</p><p>Gas exchange in fruit and other bulky storage organs was first modelled macroscopically with Fick's first law as a diffusion process, which is driven by concentration gradients <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Burg1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Banks1">[24]</xref>. The concentration gradients appear because of consumption of O<sub>2</sub> and production of CO<sub>2</sub>. However, Fick's first law is not capable of describing spatial gas concentration gradients. Several authors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Mannapperuma1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn3">[26]</xref> therefore, developed reaction-diffusion models to describe the exchange of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> inside fruit of different plant species. Diffusion properties of fruit tissue were determined by measuring gas exchange through small tissue samples <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn4">[27]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ho3">[32]</xref>. The results showed that the CO<sub>2</sub> diffusivity in apple and pear tissue was much higher than the O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity. However, as this may cause the outflow of CO<sub>2</sub> to be larger than the inflow of O<sub>2</sub>, a pressure difference between the inside of the fruit and the external atmosphere may develop. Hence, besides gas diffusion driven by concentration gradients, gas exchange in the fruit may occur by permeation due to pressure gradients in the fruit tissues. The aforementioned models are not capable of describing this effect, and Ho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ho2">[31]</xref> therefore developed a permeation-diffusion-reaction model for describing O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub> exchange in pear fruit which does take into account permeation. While this model was used successfully to simulate transport properties in simple disk-shape geometries, it cannot be used to study gas transport in intact pear fruit for the following reasons:</p><list list-type="bullet"><list-item><p>A pear has a complicated shape which cannot be approximated well by a generic geometry such as a slab, sphere or cylinder.</p></list-item><list-item><p>While the model has been used to evaluate the anisotropy of the gas transport properties of the tissue, its actual formulation is isotropic.</p></list-item><list-item><p>Respiration is considered to be constant while it is known to depend heavily on the gas concentration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn5">[33]</xref>; this is actually the basis for the success of controlled atmosphere storage of pome fruit, and any model to be used to understand gas transport in fruit tissue during such storage procedures should incorporate this behaviour.</p></list-item><list-item><p>The model cannot predict carbon dioxide production through fermentation at low O<sub>2</sub> concentrations which actually puts a biochemical limit on how low the O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure can be reduced in commercial postharvest storage procedures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Franck1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ke1">[19]</xref>.</p></list-item></list><p>The objective of this manuscript was, therefore, to extend this model to account for O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> dependent respiration and fermentation processes.

The model assumes that gas exchange can be modeled by the lumped properties of the different fruit tissues. Gas exchange properties were independently and experimentally determined. The measurement protocols of gas exchange properties of pear epidermis and cortex tissue were described by Ho et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ho1">[30]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ho2">[31]</xref>.

Differences in diffusion rates of the different gasses led to total pressure gradients that caused convective exchange as described by Darcy's law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ho2">[31]</xref>. Gas exchange was coupled with the respiration kinetics of fruit tissue.

They rely on the assumption that the diffusion resistance of the cortex tissue is low compared to that of the skin, which would exclude the existence of a gas gradient in the cortex tissue. The corresponding O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> diffusion coefficients are then measured by effusion experiments. However, the steep gas gradient in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000023-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1000023-g004">4</xref> indicate that these models are not applicable to pear cv Conference. Further, in the effusion method the diffusion coefficients of O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> are calculated from that of an inert gas using Graham's law. This law states that the rate of effusion of a gas is inversely proportional to the square root of its molecular mass and would imply that the ratio of CO<sub>2</sub> to O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity would be 0.85. However, Schotsmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Schotsmans1">[28]</xref> have shown that this law does not hold for a complex matrix such as fruit tissue and leads to underprediction of the CO<sub>2</sub> diffusivity.

It is not clear why the CO<sub>2</sub> diffusivity of cortex found by Lammertyn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn3">[26]</xref> is about ten times higher than that reported here. Note that in our model a distinction was made between the diffusivity in the axial and radial direction to account for the larger diffusivity in the axial direction due to vascular bundles which run from the stem to the calyx. The higher diffusivity in the axial direction compared to that along the radial direction is probably due to the fact that vascular bundles may be not fully filled with sap during storage of the fruit. It is, therefore, well possible that the vascular bundles along the axis of the pear indeed facilitate gas exchange. Moreover, the orientation of the cells along the vertical axis could be different from that of cells in the radial direction, and further difference in gas exchange properties may be due to enhanced interconnectivity of the gas intercellular space along the vertical axis compared to the radial direction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Ho2">[31]</xref>. Finally, while gas exchange properties might be affected by the developmental stage of the fruit through changes in tissue microstructure, it is interesting to note that Schotsmans et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Schotsmans1">[28]</xref> did not find appreciable changes in gas diffusion properties of apple tissue during a period of seven weeks after harvest.</p><p>It should be emphasised that, because of the difference in diffusion coefficient, the produced CO<sub>2</sub> leaves the fruit at higher rates than O<sub>2</sub> is entering the fruit. This causes a pressure gradient inside the fruit. This pressure gradient initiates convective transport. Lammertyn et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn3">[26]</xref> found that the O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure was under-predicted by this model and increased the O<sub>2</sub> diffusivity parameter 3 times to improve the correspondence between measured and predicted O<sub>2</sub> concentration. Such an adjustment was not required in the permeation-diffusion-reaction model presented here. The pressure gradient was alleviated in the model by a flux of N<sub>2</sub> towards the center of the fruit.</p><p>While in the validation experiment at 1°C the correspondence between predicted and measured gas profiles was excellent, there was an increasing deviation for the CO<sub>2</sub> profile with increasing temperature.

We believe that this is due to the fact that fruit used for validation were different from those used for parameter estimation. In fact, the respiratory activity of pear depends on its maturity which can vary from season to season or batch to batch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Schouten1">[16]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Lammertyn3">[26]</xref>.

Denison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Denison1">[20]</xref> developed such a model for oxygen diffusion and respiration in legume root nodules while Parkhurst and Mott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Parkhurst1">[41]</xref> described a reaction-diffusion model for CO<sub>2</sub> assimilation in leaves.

These models are based on the microscale geometry, and application to large organs such as fruit would require huge computer resources if possible at all. In contrast, the model developed here can be used well to predict gas exchange at the macroscale but does not provide detailed predictions of gas concentration at the microscale. We believe that microscale gas exchange models such as the ones developed by Denison <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Denison1">[20]</xref> and Parkhurst and Mott <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Parkhurst1">[41]</xref> can be combined advantageously with macroscale models such as the one developed in this article.

The cutting process caused a film of juice at the cut surface of the samples which may fill up pores and, hence, affect the exchange properties. The cut surface was, therefore, always wiped off with cotton tissue. Further, the cell injury due to cutting leads to local enzymatic oxidation reactions which probably would not affect the apparent respiration rate considerably. However, cutting may possibly also illicit a stress response which might increase respiration. Such effects are difficult to quantify because there is currently no method available to measure in vivo gas exchange properties.

Such extended Michelis-Menten models can still be used as a semi-empirical model to describe the respiration characteristics of the whole intact fruit or vegetable.

However, the Michaelis-Menten constant <italic>K<sub>m,O2</sub></italic> of the pear cortex tissue (1.00±0.23 kPa) was 6 times lower than for the intact pear (6.2±0.9 kPa) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000023-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1000023-t002">2</xref>).

A similar result was also found for the inhibition of fermentation by CO<sub>2</sub>: the value for intact pear, <italic>K<sub>m,f,O2</sub></italic>, was 0.69±0.17 kPa while it was 0.28±0.14 kPa for cortex tissue, or more than 2 times less. The high value of <italic>K<sub>mn,CO2</sub></italic> (66.4±21.3 and 70.7±21.6 kPa for cortex tissue and intact pear, respectively) indicates that the inhibition effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on respiration was small.

Smaller values were found for broccoli (11.5±2.3 kPa), mungbean sprouts (14.2±3.1 kPa) and cut chicory (13.5±4.8 kPa). There is no clear reason why there should be such a difference; in fact, relatively little is known about the effect of CO<sub>2</sub> on the activity of respiratory enzymes.</p><p>The respiration quotient of pear cortex tissue (<italic>r<sub>q,ox</sub></italic> = 0.97±0.04) was higher than that of intact pear (<italic>r<sub>q,ox</sub></italic> = 0.76±0.03).

As the estimation of <italic>r<sub>q,ox</sub></italic> is essentially based on transient measurements of the gas profiles in the jar, it is well possible that CO<sub>2</sub> is still accumulating in the intact pear because of the much larger internal gas exchange resistance compared with that of cortex tissue.

The respiration of the skin as such might also be higher than that of cortex tissue.</p><p>The value of <italic>V<sub>m,f,CO2</sub></italic> of the cortex tissue was 1.6 times higher than that of intact pear.

However, the value of <italic>V<sub>m,f,CO2</sub></italic> for the tissue samples led to an over predicted value of the CO2 concentration in the validation experiment. Using the intact fruit value even resulted in better comparison with the validation set, but was outside the 95% confidence interval of the parameter.

The model accounts for both diffusion and pressure driven exchange of these gasses and incorporates anisotropic transport properties. O<sub>2</sub> depletion and CO<sub>2</sub> production because of respiration were modelled by means of Michaëlis Menten kinetics which were modified to account for O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> inhibition effects. As the pear shape cannot be approximated by a generic geometry such as slab, sphere or cylinder, a computer vision system was used to reconstruct the actual geometry of the pear and the model equations were discretised over this geometry. The model was validated successfully under steady and transient conditions at 1°C; there was an increasing deviation for the CO<sub>2</sub> profile with increasing temperature, probably due to season or batch effects on the parameters of the respiration kinetics. The model structure is generic: application of the model to other fleshy fruit is straightforward but the model parameters and the fruit geometry need to be measured.</p><p>Based on an <italic>in silico</italic> study it was found that considerable gradients of metabolic gases may exist in fruit, hereby invalidating earlier models in which it was assumed that gas transport could be lumped. Higher values of the Michaëlis-Menten parameters of the respiration of intact fruit compared to those of cortex tissue could be attributed to the gas exchange barrier function of fruit tissue. The larger the fruit, the lower and higher the O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressures in the fruit center, respectively, indicating a larger susceptibility to fermentation and storage disorders. Further, the large differences in apparent diffusion coefficient for O<sub>2</sub> and CO<sub>2</sub> result in an underpressure in the centre of the fruit which causes permeation gas transport.</p><p>However, diffusion remains the main mechanism of gas exchange. An <italic>in silico</italic> study revealed that, in contrast to small pears, in large pears and under extreme storage conditions the oxygen concentration can decrease well below the Michaëlis Menten constant for cytochrome c oxidase, the rate limiting enzyme of the respiration pathways. This most probably leads to fermentation and physiological disorders which have been observed under such conditions. For the first time a plausible and quantitative biophysical explanation is given for the well-known role of gas exchange in the development of physiological disorders in fruit such as core breakdown.</p><p>The model developed in this article is a first step towards a comprehensive model of gas exchange of pear fruit. Further advances require that the internal microstructure of the tissue is investigated to explain differences in gas exchange properties and to quantify the cellular and intercellular pathways for gas exchange. Also, the respiration and fermentation submodels are phenomenological and do not allow to evaluate the effect of internal gas concentrations on cellular metabolic fluxes. Such information would help to explain physiological disorders related to oxidative stresses such as typical browning patterns in pear tissue stored under hypoxic conditions. Mechanistic models incorporating more detailed knowledge of the respiratory and fermentative pathways are currently being developed in our group. Finally, the respiratory metabolism does change dramatically during maturation and ripening of climacteric fruit such as pear in response to ethylene biosynthesis. Hence, the parameters of the respiration and fermentation submodels are likely to change as well and need to be estimated for different development stages.</p></sec></sec><sec id="s4"><title>Materials and Methods</title><sec id="s4a"><title>Fruit material</title><p>Pears (<italic>Pyrus communis</italic> cv. ‘Conference’) were harvested on September, 8th, 2004, at the pre-climacteric stage at the Fruitteeltcentrum (Rillaar, Belgium), cooled and stored according to commercial protocols for a period of 21 days at −0.5°C preceding CA storage (2.5 kPa O<sub>2</sub>, 0.7 kPa CO<sub>2</sub> at −0.5°C) until they were used for the respiration experiments on tissue discs.</p></sec><sec id="s4b"><title>Respiration models</title><p>A non-competitive inhibition model <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Peppelenbos2">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Chang1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Hertog1">[45]</xref> was used to describe consumption of O<sub>2</sub> by respiration as formulated by Equation 1:<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000023.e002" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>with <italic>V<sub>m,O2</sub></italic> (mol m<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) the maximum oxygen consumption rate, <italic>P<sub>O2</sub></italic> (kPa) the O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, <italic>P<sub>CO2</sub></italic> (kPa) the CO<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, <italic>K<sub>m,O2</sub></italic> (kPa) the Michaelis-Menten constant for O<sub>2</sub> consumption, <italic>K<sub>mn,CO2</sub></italic> (kPa) the Michaelis-Menten constant for non-competitive CO<sub>2</sub> inhibition, and <italic>R<sub>O2</sub></italic> (mol m<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) the O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate of the sample.</p><p>The equation for production rate of CO<sub>2</sub> consists of an oxidative respiration part and a fermentative part <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Chevillotte1">[43]</xref>.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000023.e003" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>with <italic>V<sub>m,f,CO2</sub></italic> (mol m<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) the maximum fermentative CO<sub>2</sub> production rate, <italic>K<sub>m,f,O2</sub></italic> (kPa) the Michaelis-Menten constant of O<sub>2</sub> inhibition on fermentative CO<sub>2</sub> production, <italic>r<sub>q,ox</sub></italic> the respiration quotient at high O<sub>2</sub> partial pressure, and <italic>R<sub>CO2</sub></italic> (mol m<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) the CO<sub>2</sub> production rate of the sample.</p><p>The effect of temperature was described by Arrhenius' law <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1000023-Hertog1">[45]</xref>.<disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000023.e004" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(3)</label></disp-formula><disp-formula><graphic mimetype="image" position="float" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1000023.e005" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(4)</label></disp-formula>with <italic>V<sub>m,O2,ref</sub></italic> (mol m<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) and <italic>V<sub>m,f,CO2,ref</sub></italic> (mol m<sup>−3</sup> s<sup>−1</sup>) the maximal O<sub>2</sub> consumption rate and maximal fermentative CO<sub>2</sub> production rate at <italic>T<sub>ref</sub></italic> = 293°K, respectively; <italic>E<sub>a,VmO2</sub></italic> (kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) the activation energies for O<sub>2</sub> consumption; <italic>E<sub>a,VmfCO2</sub></italic> (kJ mol<sup>−1</sup>) the activation energies for fermentative CO<sub>2</sub> production; <italic>T</italic> (K) temperature; and <italic>R</italic> (8.314 J mol<sup>−1</sup> K<sup>−1</sup>) the universal gas constant.

Samples of cortex tissue were first cut with a professional slice cutter (EH 158-L, Graef, Germany). Subsequently, small cylinders with a diameter of 24 mm were cut with a cork borer. The thickness of the cortex tissue sample ranged from 1.5 to 2 mm. Skin samples (including both the epidermis and the hypodermis of the fruit) were cut and removed the flesh until a thickness of around 1mm was obtained. Samples of 55–65 pieces (∼50–60 g) were placed on metal meshes in 1.7 L glass jars. Three jars were connected in series and flushed with each gas mixture during 30 minutes. The jars were then closed and the initial gas mixture (O<sub>2</sub>, CO<sub>2</sub> and N<sub>2</sub>) was measured with a gas chromatograph (Chrompack CP 2002, The Netherlands).

An intact pear was put on a rotation table with a computer controlled stepper motor (Apollo, C-630.32, Physik Instrumentc GmbH, German) and pictures were taken with a CCD color digital video camera (DFW-VL500, Sony, Japan) along the fruit equator. The geometrical model of the pear was reconstructed using image processing software written in MATLAB. The image was segmented in object and background using an automatic threshold on the saturation value of the color information, and the contour of the object was extracted from the image. Subsequently, a cubic spline (smooth polygonal approximation) was fitted on the contour. In every node the normal vector to the contour was calculated, and the skin was defined as to have a thickness of 1 mm along this normal vector. The epidermis tissue (skin) was created by shrinking the contour along this normal vector until a skin thickness of 1 mm was obtained in every node. Note that skin here includes both the epidermis and the hypodermis–a relatively tightly packed diffuse layer of cells located in between the epidermis and cortex tissue to mimic the skin sample of gas exchange and respiration measurement.

Since the model for consumption of O<sub>2</sub> inside the fruit (Equation 1) does not exclude negative concentrations, numerical problems may occur when the oxygen concentration approaches zero, resulting in non-physical negative results. Therefore, two alternative approaches were introduced to solve this problem. The first method was based on modifying the respiration term to ensure that the rate of O<sub>2</sub> consumption became zero when the O<sub>2</sub> concentration approached zero. Another method was based on the exponential transformation of the O<sub>2</sub> variable in the model equations in such a way that the solution is guaranteed to be positive (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1000023.s001">Text S1</xref>).
