</abstract><abstract>
<p>Proteins from halophilic organisms, which live in extreme saline conditions, have evolved to remain folded at very high ionic strengths. The surfaces of halophilic proteins show a biased amino acid composition with a high prevalence of aspartic and glutamic acids, a low frequency of lysine, and a high occurrence of amino acids with a low hydrophobic character. Using extensive mutational studies on the protein surfaces, we show that it is possible to decrease the salt dependence of a typical halophilic protein to the level of a mesophilic form and engineer a protein from a mesophilic organism into an obligate halophilic form. NMR studies demonstrate complete preservation of the three-dimensional structure of extreme mutants and confirm that salt dependency is conferred exclusively by surface residues. In spite of the statistically established fact that most halophilic proteins are strongly acidic, analysis of a very large number of mutants showed that the effect of salt on protein stability is largely independent of the total protein charge. Conversely, we quantitatively demonstrate that halophilicity is directly related to a decrease in the accessible surface area.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Life on earth exhibits an enormous adaptive capacity and living organisms can be found even in extreme environments. The halophilic archea are a group of microorganisms that grow best in highly salted lakes (with KCl concentrations between 2 and 6 molar). To avoid osmotic shock, halophilic archea have the same ionic strength inside their cells as outside. All their macromolecules, including the proteins, have therefore adapted to remain folded and functional under such ionic strength conditions. As a result, the amino acid composition of proteins adapted to a hypersaline environment is very characteristic: they have an abundance of negatively charged residues combined with a low frequency of lysines. In this study, we have investigated the relationship between this biased amino-acid composition and protein stability. Three model proteins – one from a strict halophile, its homolog from a mesophile and a totally unrelated protein from a mesophile - have been largely redesigned by site-directed mutagenesis, and the resulting mutants have been characterized structurally and thermodynamically. Our results show that amino acids with short side-chains (like aspartic and glutamic acid) are preferred to the longer lysine because they succeed in reducing the interaction surface between the protein and the solvent, which is beneficial in an environment where water is in limited availability because it also has to hydrate the salt ions.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Halophilic archea are extremophiles that thrive in highly saline environments such as natural salt lakes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Lanyi1">[1]</xref>. To maintain positive turgor pressure, salt concentration in the cytoplasm can reach 4 M <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Pieper1">[2]</xref>. Proteins from these organisms have evolved to maximize stability and activity at high salt concentrations (haloadaptation) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Madern1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Mevarech1">[4]</xref>. Comparative analyses between the proteomes of halophilic and non-halophilic bacteria have recognized a characteristic signature in the amino acid composition of proteins with hypersaline adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Paul1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Fukuchi1">[6]</xref>. These features include a large increase in glutamic acids and, more frequently, aspartic acids; a drastic drop in the number of lysines (often replaced by arginines) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Kastritis1">[7]</xref>; and a decrease in the overall hydrophobic content <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Paul1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Britton1">[8]</xref>. The same trends are observed in taxonomically distant species, and convergent evolution to a unique solution for halophilic adaptation suggests that the same fundamental mechanism is operating <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Paul1">[5]</xref>. Understanding the haloadaptation mechanism is of particular interest given the influence of salt on function, folding, oligomerization, and solubility, and has obvious potential application in the biotechnological industry. Structural comparison of related halophilic and mesophilic proteins has revealed that changes are concentrated at the protein surface <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Fukuchi1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Premkumar1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Richard1">[12]</xref>. It has been suggested that haloadaptation and salt modulation of the hydrophobic effect have a common origin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Wright1">[13]</xref>. An alternative hypothesis suggests that hydrated ions can interact with surface acidic residues (a.r.) to stabilize the folded conformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Zaccai1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Ebel1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Here, we have investigated the mechanism of hypersaline adaptation in protein stability by extensive site-directed mutagenesis followed by a thermodynamic and structural characterization of the protein derivatives using three different domains: the halophilic 1A domain of the NAD<sup>+</sup>-dependent DNA ligase N (<italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN) from <italic>Haloferax volcanii</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Poidevin1">[16]</xref>, the homologous domain from E.coli (<italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN), and the mesophilic IgG binding domain of the protein L from <italic>Streptococcus magnus</italic> (ProtL) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Wikstrom1">[17]</xref>. <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN and <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN are functionally identical and have a 30% sequence homology, whereas ProtL and 1ALigN are not structurally nor functionally related. The three domains unfold reversibly according to a two state model. The wild type of <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN requires potassium chloride to fold and forms part of an enzyme with optimal activity at 3.2M KCl <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Poidevin1">[16]</xref>. The wild types <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN and ProtL show no changes in stability upon addition of sodium or potassium chloride <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Fayos1">[18]</xref>. Our results show that net charge exerts a negligible effect on the protein hypersaline adaptation mechanism. Conversely, the abundance of aspartate and glutamate residues results in a decrease in the protein's solvent-accessible area, which is the key mechanism for haloadaptation. By altering the amino acid composition on the protein surface, it is possible to modify the salt dependence of protein stability and interconvert halophilic and mesophilic proteins.</p>

<title>Effect of Salt on the Stability of Wild Type <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN, <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN, and ProtL</title>
<p>In the presence of 1 M KCl, <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN has a circular dichroism (CD) spectrum typical for a folded protein with a significant degree of helical content and very similar when compared to the <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN CD spectrum, indicating that the two proteins are structurally homologous (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s001">Figure S1</xref>). In the absence of salt, <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN partially unfolds. At KCl concentrations below 0.5M, <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN shows a strong non-linear stabilization with the cosolute and it becomes fully folded at concentrations higher than 0.35 M (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s002">Figure S2</xref>). ProtL, <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN, and <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN show a fully reversible thermal and chemical unfolding. Temperature-, urea-, or guanidinium chloride-induced denaturation curves monitored by CD and fluorescence spectroscopy were used to measure the changes in stability induced by NaCl or KCl (Δ<italic>G<sub>salt</sub></italic>, see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s008">Protocol S1</xref> for details). The free energy at 3.2 M KCl (or NaCl) has been determined to measure the haloadaptation of the proteins. Moreover, upon salt addition, their stabilities are proportional to the molar concentration of the cosolute, and the slope (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) was also used to quantify the protein's hypersaline adaptation. Wild type ProtL and <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN stabilities remain unaffected by the presence of KCl or NaCl (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>m<sub>KCl</sub></italic> = <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic> = 0 kcal·mol<sup>−1</sup>·M<sup>−1</sup>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s004">S4</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Fayos1">[18]</xref>.

<title>Mutation Design</title>
<p>Given the skewed amino acid composition of halophilic proteins, we performed a systematic mutational study involving the following surface amino acids: aspartic acid, glutamic acid, lysine, arginine, asparagine, serine, and glutamine. Mutations were grouped in three classes: (i) charge-preserving mutations that modify side chain length: E to D, DN to EQ, K to R, and R to K (XY to WZ involves a change from X or Y to W or Z, respectively); (ii) size preserving mutations that change the protein's charge: NQ to DE and DE to NQ; and (iii) mutations that change both size and charge: K to QES and DES to K. A cumulative strategy was used to amplify the response by introducing multiple mutations of the same type (XYx<italic>n</italic>WZ represents a mutant with <italic>n</italic> substitutions of this specific class). The complete list of 102 mutants, including the specific positions of the residues involved, is shown in the supplementary materials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s009">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s010">S2</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s011">S3</xref>).</p>
<p>To evaluate the effect of the surface modifications in hypersaline adaptation, the free energies at 3.2 M salt (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>) have been determined by equilibrium denaturation experiments and are plot versus the number of substituted residues in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g002">2</xref>. Moreover, the protein's mid-denaturation point (<italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic>) varies linearly with the molar concentration of NaCl or KCl (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s003">Figures S3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s004">S4</xref>), and the experimental <italic>m<sub>salt</sub></italic> values are also plotted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figures 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g002">2</xref>. Panels A to F (G to L) in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figure 1</xref> show the effect of the mutants that conserve the charge (size). Reduction in the side chain by one methylene without altering overall charge (E for D) improves the halophilic adaptation of <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN (black circles in panels A and D) and generates a salt-dependent stabilizing effect in the mesophilic proteins <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN (black circles in panels B and E) and ProtL (black circles in panels C and F). Changing aspartate to bulkier glutamate has the opposite effect and <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN mutants are not only less stabilized by salt than the wild type, but when four or more aspartates are replaced by glutamates, potassium chloride <italic>destabilizes Hv</italic> 1ALigN (white squares in panels A and D). A similar effect is observed for <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN and ProtL, and DNx4EQ is strongly destabilized by NaCl (white squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figures 1C and 1F</xref>). These results provide an explanation for the preference for aspartate over glutamate in halophilic proteins.</p>

<p>The effect of the chain size (panels A to F) and charge (panels G to L) in haloadaptation of ProtL, <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN, and <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN was investigated by measuring the free energy at 3.2 M salt (KCl or NaCl) versus the number of substituted residues in the multiple mutations (<italic>n</italic> in XYx<italic>n</italic>WZ).

<title>The low prevalence of lysines in the amino acid composition of halophilic proteins.</title>
<p>The effect of lysines on protein haloadaptation was investigated by measuring the change in stability induced by salt (<inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, <italic>m<sub>KCl</sub></italic>, and <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic>) versus the number of substituted residues in the lysine involving mutations (<italic>n</italic> in XYx<italic>n</italic>WZ).

<p>Halophilic proteins typically have very low isoelectric points. Substitution of all the N and Q residues to D and E would cause an increase of 15% in the theoretical negative charge for <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN. In the case of ProtL the density of a.r. would change from 2.23 to 3.35 a.r./10<sup>3</sup>Å<sup>2</sup> (the average value for halophiles is 4.07 a.r./10<sup>3</sup> Å<sup>2</sup>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Premkumar1">[9]</xref>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figures 1G and 1J</xref> (black circles), within experimental error no changes in the <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> or the <italic>m<sub>KCl</sub></italic> values were observed for this type of mutant in <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN and only a minor increase in the halophilic character (higher stability in the presence of salt) was found in ProtL (black circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figures 1I and 1L</xref>). The same result is found when two Q residues are replaced by E in <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figures 1H and 1K</xref>, black circles). Negative-charge reducing mutations were also studied (see white squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figures 1G to 1L</xref>) and none of the three proteins changed their salt stabilization by a reduction in the a.r. content. Thus, charge variation has little effect on the modulation of the halophilicity of <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN, <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN, and ProtL in the explored Δe<sup>−</sup> range, in contrast to the large effects observed after altering the size of the side chains.</p>
<p>A low occurrence of lysines combined with a slight increase in the arginine content is another feature of the amino acid composition of halophilic proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Paul1">[5]</xref>. ProtL has seven lysines out of 64 residues, which is about the average percentage for mesophilic proteins. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g002">Figures 2A and 2B</xref>, changing K for R leads to salt-dependent stabilization with a magnitude of <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> (or <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic>) almost proportional to the number of replaced lysines. A similar result is obtained when K is replaced by other polar residues with smaller side chains Q, S, or E, independently of their charge. On the other hand, ProtL becomes destabilized by NaCl if a sufficient number of lysines are introduced in place of a.r. (white circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g002">Figures 2C and 2D</xref>). Finally, when three lysines are incorporated into the surface of <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN, a decrease in the protein stability at high salt concentration is observed (black circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). When lysines are incorporated in place of serines (black squares in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g002">Figure 2C, 2D</xref>), this trend is also clear and <italic>m<sub>KCl</sub></italic> becomes negative. Thus, the low prevalence of K in proteins from halophilic archea can be explained by the destabilizing effect, at high salt concentrations, of the long lysine side chain.</p>
<p>The <italic>m<sub>salt</sub></italic> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> measurements should differ due to the fact that only the latter takes into account the intrinsic effect of the mutation in protein stability. The experimental <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e010" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> values are compared to the predicted values obtained from the <italic>m<sub>salt</sub></italic> slopes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s005">Figure S5</xref>. A reasonable correlation is found and, in general, small changes in stability are introduced with the mutation when compared with the effect of salt in stability, consistent with the conservative mutational design. Outliers in this correlation correspond to the mutants that produce larger changes in protein stability upon mutation. For this subset of mutants, an increase in protein stability is found by raising the ionic strength up to 0.25 M KCl (unpublished data), suggesting an electrostatic origin for their destabilization.</p>
<p>Surface modifications with alternative mutation pathways have also been constructed and tested for six different mutation designs (data shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s006">Figure S6</xref>). For this limited dataset, the different positional mutants show equivalent trends with respect to <italic>m<sub>salt</sub></italic>, highlighting the importance of the number of surface mutations of a given type in the modulation of <italic>m<sub>KCl</sub></italic> and <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic>.

<title>Changes in Solubility upon Mutation</title>
<p>Surface mutations can significantly affect the solubility properties of the protein. We have determined the solubility for wild type ProtL and two mutants: Kx4Q and Kx4E. As shown in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-1000257-t001">Table 1</xref>, four new glutamines produce no changes in the soluble fraction while a dramatic increase in solubility is observed upon introduction of four glutamates. Thus, the large number of Asp and Glu residues found in the surface of halophilic proteins enhances the solubility of the protein in an environment of reduced water activity.</p>

<title>Correlation between Haloadaptation and the Reduction in Surface Area</title>
<p>To quantify the effect of mutations involving changes in surface area we determined high resolution NMR structures of two multiple mutants of ProtL: Kx5Q ProtL and Kx6E ProtL (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, PDB accession codes 2jzp and 2kac, respectively). Kx6E is an obligate halophile and the structure was solved in the presence of 500 mM NaCl. The structures of the mutants are very similar to that of wild type ProtL (1hz6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-ONeill1">[19]</xref> with root mean square deviation values of 0.58 Å and 0.69 Å for Kx5Q and Kx6E, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g003">Figure 3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s012">Table S4</xref>). The overall folding and the structure of the core are totally conserved and changes are localized on the protein surface. No new inter-side-chain interactions were observed in the mutant structures and the mutated side chains are placed in a very similar conformation when compared to the wild type (the overlap between the solution wild type structure and some representative side chains of Kx5Q or Kx6E is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g003">Figure 3C</xref>).</p>

The alignment between the mutant structures and wild type ProtL (1hz6) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-ONeill1">[19]</xref>, shown in (B), reveals that the changes introduced upon mutation are minimal.

<title>A metric for ProtL haloadaptation.</title>
<p>(A) The mesophilic ProtL can be converted from a folded protein that does not become stabilized by salt (Δ<italic>G<sup>U−F</sup></italic>&gt;0, <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic> = 0, wild type) to an obligate halophile (Δ<italic>G<sup>U−F</sup></italic>&lt;0, <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic>&gt;0, Kx7E). This transition is a continuous process as demonstrated by the empirical correlation found between the <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic> and Δ<italic>ASA<sup>WT−Mut</sup></italic> for the ProtL mutants: K for Q (black squares) and K for E (black circles). This data plot uses the left ordinate axis for the <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic> units. (B) An equivalent correlation can also be found for the D for E and E for D mutants <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN (black circles) and <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN (black squares). Error bars result from propagation of the experimental uncertainties in the <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> values, by Montecarlo analysis.

<p>The stability of the different ProtL mutants in the absence of salt at 298 K was determined by chemical denaturation experiments (gray circles in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). Reduction of the solvent accessible area introduced upon mutation causes a progressive destabilization of the molecule, probably due to a reduction in the protein's hydrophobic effect. As a consequence, mutations increasing salt-induced stabilization also destabilize the protein in the absence of salt, converting a mesophilic protein into an obligate halophilic form, a trend found in natural halophilic proteins. An example is Kx7E ProtL, which is unfolded at 298 K in the absence of salt since ΔG<sup>U−F</sup>(Kx7E)&lt;0. The <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum of ProtL Kx7E (in 20 mM sodium phosphate) shows a peak dispersion that is characteristic for an unfolded protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Protein dynamics, encoded in the transversal relaxation times, also agree well with an unfolded, highly flexible state. This mutant has the largest <italic>m<sub>NaCl</sub></italic> indicating that very large stabilization with NaCl is expected. Consistent with this, in the presence of 2 M NaCl the <sup>1</sup>H,<sup>15</sup>N-HSQC spectrum changes to a spectrum characteristic of a folded protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), sharing a very similar peak pattern with wild type ProtL (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Moreover, in 2 M NaCl, the relaxation times for the backbone nitrogen nuclei are much shorter than the side chain ones, as expected for a folded protein of this size.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The halophilic <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN domain is stabilized by salt while the stability of the mesophilic <italic>Ec</italic> 1ALigN and ProtL domains are completely independent of ionic strength. The <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN non-linear stabilization at [KCl]&lt;0.5 M can be attributed to electrostatic effects whereas the linear dependence with salt found at [KCl]&gt;0.5 M shall obey to a different mechanism. Surface residue replacements in the three proteins can increase or decrease the salt-induced stabilization or can even make it a destabilizing effect, depending on the nature and the number of surface residue replacements. Mutations leading towards the amino acid composition found in halophilic organisms increase the salt-induced stabilization, quantified by <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e012" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and, to a lesser extent, by <italic>m<sub>salt</sub></italic>, the slope of the ΔG versus salt concentration plot.</p>
<p>Here we show that small side chains contribute to enhancement of salt-induced protein stability, and that the excellent correlations between <italic>m<sub>salt</sub></italic> and Δ<italic>ASA<sup>WT−Mut</sup></italic> underlie the role that surface packing may play in this mechanism. Proteins with a decreased solvent accessible surface are preferred in an environment where water molecules also have to solvate the ions. The stability of a halophilic protein at high salt concentrations will result from the balance of the side chain contributions to m<italic><sub>salt</sub></italic> and to the stability in the absence of cosolute. For the Kx<italic>n</italic>E mutation design in ProtL, chemical denaturation experiments revealed that the introduction of a.r. also causes protein destabilization if NaCl is not present, offering a plausible explanation for the large number of obligate halophilic proteins (that unfold in the absence of salt) found in nature. However, this is not the case for the majority of mutants studied in the present work where minor effects in stability have been found in the absence of salt, regardless of the nature or the number of substitutions. Examples of massive surface mutations into negative charged residues with minimal effects in stability have also been reported in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Lawrence1">[20]</xref>.</p>
<p>As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g001">Figure 1</xref> altering the number of negative charges on the protein surface results in almost no variation in stability modulation by salt indicating that D and N should be equally found in the aminoacid composition of halophilic proteins. Why are then (charged) aspartate/glutamate preferred over (neutral) asparagine/glutamine? D and E are among the hydrophilic residues that most contribute to increase protein solubility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Trevino1">[21]</xref>. Our solubility measurements with ProtL are consistent with this idea. By accumulating a large number of negative charged residues in the surface, the tendency to aggregation will be reduced and the solubility at physiological pH will increase due to the lowering in the isoelectric point.</p>
<p>A decrease in the number of lysine residues results in an increase in halophilicity, independently of the charge, suggesting that the effect arises from the removal of the long lysine side chain. Inspection of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000257-g002">Figure 2</xref> reveals that substitution of lysine by glutamate indeed causes an increase in <inline-formula><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.1000257.e013" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <italic>m<sub>salt</sub></italic> (white squares), consistent with the amino acid composition found in halophilic proteins. Moreover, structures of Kx5Q and Kx6E show that the replacement of lysine by glutamate results in a higher reduction of the solvent-exposed surface area than the substitution of glutamine.</p>
<p>Depending on the natural environment, hypersaline adaptation involves KCl or NaCl. However, our data are similar for both salts, indicating that a common mechanism prevails. The linear dependence of stability with the molar concentration of the salt suggests the existence of weak non-specific interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Schellman1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Tadeo1">[23]</xref>. Some preliminary data with anions other than chloride indicate a cosolute-dependent modulation of protein stability following the Hofmeister series. Thus, salt-induced stabilization can probably be described in terms of the preferential interaction and preferential exclusion of the ions from the protein surface.</p>

<title>CD and Fluorescence Experiments</title>
<p>A JASCO J-810 spectropolarimeter with a quartz cuvette of 0.1 cm (1 cm) path length was used for the CD (fluorescence) experiments. For the CD experiments, samples were used at a concentration range of 2–4 µM and the thermal melts were run at 1 degree per minute, with monitoring at 222 nm with a bandwidth of 2 nm and a data pitch of 0.2 degrees. The thermal range of the experiment was optimized for every sample, assuring the proper determination of the baselines for both the folded and the unfolded states. Thermal denaturation curves monitored by fluorescence spectroscopy were collected at a concentration range of 1–2 µM, with measuring conditions equivalent to the CD experiments except for the use of a 2 nm excitation bandwidth centered at 280 nm. Between three and six independent measurements were obtained for each experimental condition from CD and fluorescence data, and duplicate points were used to obtain an estimation of the error. In all cases, the CD and fluorescence signal recovery after the thermal melt was monitored and is reported in the supplementary materials (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s009">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s010">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s011">S3</xref>). When signal recovery was less than 95%, a duplicate was collected at a different scanning rate (3 deg/min). A variation of <italic>T<sub>m</sub></italic> with the scanning rate is an indication of irreversible unfolding and mutants showing such change (within experimental error) were excluded from the analysis (red marks in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s009">Tables S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s010">S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s011">S3</xref>). Guanidinium chloride or urea denaturation experiments were followed by CD and used an initial volume of 1.7–2 mL at a protein concentration of 4 µM in 20 mM phosphate buffer at pH 6.0. Protein denaturation was achieved by the addition of aliquots of a solution at the same protein concentration but in 20 mM phosphate buffer and 6 M guanidinium chloride (GuHCl) or 10–11 M urea at pH 6.0, performed with an automatic titrator. GuHCl and urea concentrations were adjusted by measuring the refractive index. A comparison of the unfolding free energies obtained by chemical denaturation with guadinium chloride and urea are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000257.s013">Table S5</xref>. Due to low stability for ProtL Kx5E, Kx6E, and Kx7E, or limited solubility of NaCl and KCl in the denaturant conditions, chemical denaturation experiments were performed in the presence of different amounts of NaCl or KCl (0.25 M, 0.5 M, 0.75 M, 1 M, 1.5M, and 2.25M).

For <italic>Hv</italic> 1ALigN, the structural models succeeded in creating a structure from residues 33 to 108 and this protein segment was used for the analysis of the including residues. For the excluded residues (D26, E26, D28, E28, D31, and E31), peptide models were used instead.</p>
<p>The <sup>15</sup>N side-chain transversal relaxation rates were measured on the NHD isotopmer to circumvent the contribution from proton dipole-dipole cross-correlation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Boyd1">[31]</xref>. Protein samples were lyophilized and resuspended in 50% D<sub>2</sub>O to maximize the population of the NHD isotopmer. Transversal relaxation spectra were recorded in a two-dimensional mode with relaxation times of 0, 5, 40 (×2), 80, 160, 200, and 240 ms. Experimental data were adjusted to exponential decays to obtain the relaxation constant (<italic>T</italic><sub>2</sub>(<sup>15</sup><italic>N</italic>)).</p>

<title>Solubility Measurements</title>
<p>The method used for the solubility measurements is very similar to the one described in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000257-Trevino1">[21]</xref>: an aliquot of 10 µL from concentrated protein stock (in 20 mM phosphate buffer, pH 6.0) was mixed with 10 µL of precipitating buffer (20 mM phosphate buffer, 4 M ammonium sulfate, pH6.0) in a 0.2 mL PCR tube. The mixtures were allowed to equilibrate for at least 1 min and were then transferred to 1.5 mL Eppendorf tubes and centrifuged for 2 min at 15,000 g. The concentrations of the supernatants were measured in a Nanodrop 1000 (Thermo Scientific). Four independent solubility measurements were carried out for each protein.</p>
