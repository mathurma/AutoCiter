        <p>By combining biochemical, embryological, and mathematical approaches, this work uncovers an important role for protein-protein interactions in determining the dynamics of the somite-forming segmentation clock in vertebrates.</p>
      </abstract><abstract>
        <p>During vertebrate embryogenesis, the rhythmic and sequential segmentation of the body axis is regulated by an oscillating genetic network termed the segmentation clock. We describe a new dynamic model for the core pace-making circuit of the zebrafish segmentation clock based on a systematic biochemical investigation of the network's topology and precise measurements of somitogenesis dynamics in novel genetic mutants. We show that the core pace-making circuit consists of two distinct negative feedback loops, one with Her1 homodimers and the other with Her7:Hes6 heterodimers, operating in parallel. To explain the observed single and double mutant phenotypes of <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her7</italic>, and <italic>hes6</italic> mutant embryos in our dynamic model, we postulate that the availability and effective stability of the dimers with DNA binding activity is controlled in a “dimer cloud” that contains all possible dimeric combinations between the three factors. This feature of our model predicts that Hes6 protein levels should oscillate despite constant <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA production, which we confirm experimentally using novel Hes6 antibodies. The control of the circuit's dynamics by a population of dimers with and without DNA binding activity is a new principle for the segmentation clock and may be relevant to other biological clocks and transcriptional regulatory networks.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>The segmented pattern of the vertebral column, one of the defining features of the vertebrate body, is established during embryogenesis. The embryo's segments, called somites, form sequentially and rhythmically from head to tail. The periodicity of somite formation is regulated by the segmentation clock, a genetic oscillator that ticks in the posterior-most embryonic tissue: for each tick of the clock, one new bilateral pair of segments is made. The period of the clock appears to determine the number and the length of segments, but what controls this periodicity? In this article, we have investigated the interactions of three transcription factors that form the core of the clock's regulatory circuit, and have measured how the period of segmentation changes when these factors are mutated alone or in combination. We find that these three factors contribute to a “dimer cloud” that contains all possible dimeric combinations; however, only two dimers in this cloud can bind DNA, which allows them to directly regulate the oscillatory gene expression that underpins the periodicity of segment formation. Nevertheless, a mathematical model of the clock's dynamics based on our experimental findings indicates that the non-DNA-binding dimers also influence the stability, and hence the function, of the two DNA-binding dimers controlling the segmentation clock's period. Such involvement of non-DNA-binding dimers is a novel regulatory principle for the segmentation clock, which might also be a general mechanism that operates in other biological clocks.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Rhythmic phenomena are widespread in biology and the control of their timing is fundamental to many processes. Yet how the dynamics of genetic circuits that control rhythmicity are regulated remains poorly understood. The segmentation clock is an attractive model system to address this question. This gene regulatory network operates in the presomitic mesoderm (PSM) of developing vertebrate embryos and generates transcriptional oscillations that direct the rhythmic and sequential formation of body segments in concert with embryonic elongation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Dequeant1">[1]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oates1">[3]</xref>. Many components of the segmentation clock have been identified in the last decade <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Dequeant2">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Krol1">[5]</xref>, but how they interact to produce oscillations remains unclear. The oscillations of the segmentation clock are most easily observed at the tissue level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Palmeirim1">[6]</xref>, but they arise on the level of single cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Masamizu1">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Current models for the origin of single cell oscillations in the zebrafish segmentation clock posit a negative feedback loop involving the <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Cinquin1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Lewis1">[10]</xref>, which encode members of the Hairy and enhancer of split related (Hes/Her) family of basic helix loop helix (bHLH) transcriptional repressor proteins. Specifically, it has been proposed that oscillations arise through the auto-repression of these genes via a mix of Her1 and Her7 homo- and heterodimers, all of which have identical properties. This model is consistent with the reported redundant functions of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> in somitogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oates2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Henry1">[12]</xref> and the observation that overexpression of either <italic>her1</italic> or <italic>her7</italic> leads to repression of both genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Giudicelli1">[13]</xref>. Furthermore, direct binding of Her1 homodimers to sites in the <italic>her1</italic> promoter has recently been shown in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Brend1">[14]</xref>. However, biochemical evidence for the other regulatory interactions proposed in this model is still lacking. It is also not clear how the proposed promiscuous protein-protein interactions and the equivalent functions of the resulting dimers in the current model can be reconciled with the reported distinct loss-of-function phenotypes of either gene. Knockdown of <italic>her1</italic> results in segmentation defects preferentially located in the anterior trunk, while <italic>her7</italic> knockdown in contrast leads to fully penetrant posterior segmentation defects <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oates2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Henry1">[12]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The period of the oscillations of the segmentation clock, in concert with embryonic elongation, determines the number of embryonic and adult segments, and is therefore of key importance in determining a species-specific body plan <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Cooke1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>. How the period of single-cell oscillations is controlled molecularly is not known. The cyclically expressed genes <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> have been proposed to differentially regulate the period as a consequence of different protein production delays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Lewis1">[10]</xref>, but this has not been tested experimentally. The only bHLH factor gene for which there is experimental evidence for a role in controlling the period of oscillations is <italic>hes6</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>. <italic>hes6</italic>, in contrast to <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic>, is not cyclically expressed, but displays an FGF-dependent posterior-to-anterior expression gradient in the PSM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>. In addition to its role in setting the period of the segmentation clock, <italic>hes6</italic> contributes to stabilizing the transcriptional oscillations of <italic>her7</italic> and <italic>her1</italic> in the PSM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>. The Hes6 protein physically interacts with Her1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>, but the interactions of Hes6 with other cyclic clock components have not been explored, and consequently, the molecular mechanism by which Hes6 controls the period of the oscillations is not understood.</p>
      <p>Here we map the topology of the regulatory interactions between Her1, Her7, and Hes6 and DNA sequences in the promoters of cyclically expressed genes. We find that all of the possible dimers between Her1, Her7 and Hes6 form, but only Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers have strong DNA binding activity and target similar DNA sites. Using our experimentally determined network topology, we develop a simple mathematical model that can account for single and double mutant phenotypes that we observe. In this model, sequestration of monomers into dimers without DNA binding activity underlies the observed distinct phenotypes of genetic mutants. A surprising prediction of this model is that Hes6 protein levels oscillate post-transcriptionally, and we confirm this with a novel Hes6 antibody. Together, our results lead to a major revision of the current model of the core circuitry of the zebrafish segmentation clock and emphasize the importance of the properties of the Hes/Her protein-protein interaction network in controlling the clock's dynamics.</p>

        <title>Hes/Her Dimers Form Promiscuously, But Only Her1 Homodimers and Her7:Hes6 Heterodimers Have DNA Binding Activity</title>
        <p>To investigate the topology of the regulatory network formed by Her1, Her7, and Hes6 we first asked which dimers form between the three factors. Co-immunoprecipitation suggested that all possible dimers form rather promiscuously, and even the bHLH containing factor MyoD, but not the negative control non-bHLH protein PPARγ, was co-purified by Her1, Her7, and Hes6 to a similar extent (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s001">Figure S1</xref>). To verify these findings in an independent setup and to investigate the DNA binding activities of the different dimers, we employed a microfluidic platform and mechanically induced trapping of molecular interactions (MITOMI, schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1A–D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Maerkl1">[19]</xref>. In this system, GFP-tagged Her proteins are immobilized on the surface of a microfluidic chip, and the pulldown of mCherry-tagged proteins is used to assess protein-protein interactions. The DNA binding activity of the resulting dimers can be investigated in the same assay by adding a DNA fragment that is labeled with a different fluorophore. We therefore coupled GFP-tagged versions of each of our three Hes/Her proteins to the chip surface, expressed different mCherry-tagged bHLH proteins in individual chambers of the chip <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Gerber1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Maerkl2">[21]</xref>, and added to the expression mix a Cy5-labeled DNA fragment that contains the 12 mer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CGACACGTGCTC</named-content> from the <italic>her1</italic> promoter. We chose this sequence because it has previously been shown to interact with Her1 in electrophoretic mobility shift assays <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Brend1">[14]</xref>. Varying the amount of expression template spotted in the reaction chambers allowed us to titrate the concentration of mCherry-tagged protein in each chamber (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1E,F</xref>). Protein concentrations reached by on-chip expression are below the dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub> reported for the prototypical bHLH proteins E12 and MyoD <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Spinner1">[22]</xref>. At these concentrations, the amount of bound protein for any concentration of free protein is approximately inversely proportional to the dissociation constant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Fordyce1">[23]</xref>, and therefore the slope of the linear fit to the plots of the free mCherry signal against the normalized signal from bound mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) can be used as a measure for the relative affinities of protein-protein interactions.</p>

        </fig>
        <p>When we coupled GFP-tagged Her7 or Hes6 to the chip surface, the four mCherry-tagged bHLH proteins showed a 4- to 20-fold higher relative affinity to the immobilized protein compared to the negative control PPARγ. The differences in relative binding affinity between bHLH proteins, however, were at most 2-fold (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1F,G</xref>), in agreement with our immunoprecipitation experiments. In this assay, GFP-tagged Her1 coupled to the chip formed mainly homodimers. Heterodimerization of Her1 with Her7 and MyoD occurred with approximately 3-fold lower relative affinity, but was still significantly stronger than binding of PPARγ to Her1 (<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01), and only the strength of Hes6-mCherry with Her1-GFP was not significantly different from that of the PPARγ–Her interaction in this assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). Because this latter finding is in contrast to the results of our co-immunoprecipitation experiments, and the interactions of Hes6-GFP with Her1-mCherry in MITOMI experiments, we suspect that steric factors hinder the formation of Hes6:Her1 heterodimers when Her1 is coupled to the chip surface. Taken together, our protein-protein interaction studies indicate that interactions are non-selective between the Her1, Her7, Hes6, and MyoD bHLH proteins.</p>
        <p>As a next step we analyzed the DNA binding activity of all homo- and heterodimers detected in our protein-protein interaction experiments. In the presence of mCherry-tagged Her7 or MyoD, GFP-tagged Her7 immobilized on the chip surface did not bind the DNA sequence derived from the <italic>her1</italic> promoter, whereas the presence of Her1-mCherry conferred weak binding, and the presence of Hes6-mCherry conferred strong DNA binding activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1E,H,I</xref>). A similar situation was observed for Hes6-GFP, which bound the same DNA fragment strongly in the presence of Her7-mCherry, weakly in the presence of Her1-mCherry, but did not bind DNA in the presence of Hes6-mCherry or MyoD-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1I</xref>). Her1-GFP coupled to the chip surface bound DNA in the absence of any coexpression partner, presumably as a homodimer (unpublished data), and this binding was further increased by the presence of Her1-mCherry, but not Her7-mCherry or Hes6-mCherry (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1G</xref>). These findings suggest that, while protein-protein interactions between Hes/Her factors are promiscuous, the DNA binding activity of the resulting dimers is restricted: Of the dimers formed between the three transcription factors investigated here, Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers bind most strongly to the target sequence from the <italic>her1</italic> promoter.</p>

        <title>Her1 Homodimers and Her7:Hes6 Heterodimers Bind with Equal Preference to Multiple Sites throughout Cyclic Gene Promoters</title>
        <p>To identify additional potential Hes/Her binding sites in cyclic gene promoters and to test whether Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers have similar or distinct DNA binding preferences, we sought to systematically investigate the DNA binding specificity of the two dimer species. We did this again using MITOMI, but now deposited increasing concentrations of different labeled DNA sequences in the chambers of the microfluidic chip. For low DNA concentrations, the amount of bound DNA for any concentration of free DNA is inversely proportional to the dissociation constant K<sub>d</sub> of the complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Fordyce1">[23]</xref>. The slopes of the linear fits to the data points for individual sites can therefore be used to compare relative binding affinities of a set of sequences to a given protein. To identify the consensus binding sequence of zebrafish Hes/Her factors, we first tested binding of all 64 permutations of the sequence CACNNN by Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers. We found that both dimers prefer the consensus site CACGNG (with N = T conferring stronger binding than A, G, and C) over all other sequences (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g002">Figure 2A,B</xref>).

        <p>Although both Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers prefer binding to the H-box consensus site, it is possible that the two dimers prefer distinct bases flanking the core hexamer and thereby preferentially regulate different genes in the segmentation clock. To test this idea, we created a library comprising all H-box sequences flanked by three nucleotides 3′ and 5′ as they occur in the genomic context within 20 Kb of the <italic>her1/her7</italic> locus and 12 Kb of the <italic>dlc</italic> cyclic gene locus (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s013">Table S1</xref> for sequences and localization of these H-boxes). We first measured relative binding affinities of the sequences in this library towards Her1 homodimers. We detected a characteristic profile of sites with a range of affinities (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s013">Table S1</xref>). In this library, sequences that contain the core hexamer <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGGG</named-content> or <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGAG</named-content> were bound at most 5-fold stronger than control sequences that lacked an H-box consensus, whereas all H-box sequences with a more than 5-fold stronger relative affinity to Her1 homodimers compared to control sequences contain either a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGTG</named-content> or a <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGCG</named-content> core hexamer (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s013">Table S1</xref>). This suggests that the relevant H-box in vivo is <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACG[T/C]G</named-content>. Furthermore, we found that the bases flanking the core hexamer influence binding affinity. Certain flanking bases reduced the affinity of sites containing the optimal <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGTG</named-content> consensus by more than an order of magnitude (compare sequences 2 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">TGGCACGTGTCC</named-content>) and 7 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CATCACGTGAAA</named-content>) from the <italic>dlc</italic> promoter, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s013">Table S1</xref>). In the appropriate sequence contexts, the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGCG</named-content> hexamer was bound almost as strongly as the highest affinity <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGTG</named-content>-sites (e.g., sequence 26 (<named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">GGGCGCGTGCCG</named-content>) from the <italic>her7</italic> promoter, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s013">Table S1</xref>). With a few exceptions, H-boxes flanked by G or C were generally bound more strongly than those flanked by A or T. Importantly, we found that several H-box sites from the <italic>dlc</italic>, <italic>her1</italic>, and <italic>her7</italic> promoters were bound by Her1 homodimers with comparably high affinity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that Her1 can potentially regulate all three genes.</p>
        <p>To test whether this was also the case for Her7:Hes6 heterodimers, we determined the relative binding affinities of the same sequences to Her7:Hes6 heterodimers and plotted their values against those determined for binding to Her1 homodimers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). If the target site specificity of Her7:Hes6 heterodimers was distinct from that of Her1 homodimers, and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers preferentially regulated one of the three cyclic genes, we would expect that the datapoints corresponding to sequences derived from different promoters cluster together. However, this was not the case: the datapoints were evenly distributed along the diagonal of the plot, irrespective of their origin.</p>
        <p>Finally, motivated by our finding that Hes6:Her1 and Her7:Her1 heterodimers weakly bound an H-box sequence from the <italic>her1</italic>-promoter (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g001">Figure 1</xref>), we wanted to test whether these heterodimers target a distinct subset of H-boxes. We therefore co-expressed Hes6 or Her7 with Her1 coupled to the chip. This did not change the affinity profile of Her1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s002">Figure S2</xref>), which suggests that Her1:Hes6 or Her1:Her7 heterodimers do not bind to a subset of H-boxes distinct from the ones bound by Her1 homodimers. Combined, these results indicate that the strongest DNA binding is from Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers; these have similar DNA binding specificity, and each dimer has the potential to directly repress <italic>dlc</italic>, <italic>her1</italic>, and <italic>her7</italic>.</p>

        <title>Her1 Homodimers and Her7:Hes6 Heterodimers Target the Same Cyclic Gene Promoter Fragments in the Yeast One-Hybrid Assay</title>
        <p>To validate our findings from these biochemical assays in a more physiological setting, we employed a yeast one-hybrid (Y1H) assay to assess binding of Her proteins to cyclic gene promoter fragments in the context of a eukaryotic nucleus. We selected 18 promoter fragments from approximately 100 bp to 1 Kb in length that cover between 3 and 4 Kb upstream of the transcriptional start sites of <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her7</italic>, and <italic>dlc</italic>, cloned them upstream of the lacZ and the His3 reporter genes and stably integrated them into the yeast genome. We first used the pDEST<sub>AD</sub> vector system <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Walhout1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Deplancke1">[25]</xref> to express individual Hes/Her proteins tagged with the Gal4 activation domain (AD) as protein prey in our DNA bait strains. In this assay we found interaction of Her1, but not Her7 or Hes6, with a number of DNA baits (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g003">Figure 3A–C</xref>). This is consistent with the results of our MITOMI assays and confirms that Her1 homodimers, but not Her7 or Hes6 homodimers, have DNA binding activity. Seven of the nine fragments that displayed interactions with Her1 in this Y1H assay contain H-box sites that showed medium or high affinity binding to Her1 in the MITOMI assay (red or yellow bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g003">Figure 3D</xref>), whereas the majority of fragments that were negative in the Y1H contain no H-box sites or H-box sites with low affinity (black bars in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g003">Figure 3D</xref>). In the two fragments from the <italic>dlc</italic> and the <italic>her7</italic> promoter that contain a high-affinity H-box site but do not give a signal in this assay, steric factors such as nucleosome arrangement might hinder transcription factor binding or reporter gene expression. Taken together, these Y1H assays suggest that most of the binding sites we identified in vitro are bound by Her proteins in the context of a eukaryotic nucleus.</p>

        <p>Next, to confirm our finding that Her7 and Hes6 gain DNA binding activity through heterodimerization, we used a novel Gateway-compatible vector called pDEST<sub>AD-DIMER</sub> (Hens et al., in preparation) that allows expression of two AD-fused proteins from the same vector. This vector system has lower sensitivity than the pDEST<sub>AD</sub>-system—when we expressed two copies of Her1 from the pDEST<sub>AD-DIMER</sub> vector we detected only three interacting fragments, those that gave strong signals with the pDEST<sub>AD</sub>-system (compare <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g003">Figure 3E to Figure 3A–C</xref>). Expression of two copies of Her7 or Hes6 gave no signal, but co-expression of Her7 and Hes6 resulted in interaction with the same fragments that were targeted by Her1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). This finding is consistent with our in vitro measurements and suggests that, in the context of a eukaryotic cell, Her7 and Hes6 need to heterodimerize to gain DNA binding activity, and that Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers target the same sites in the promoters of the cyclic genes <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her7</italic>, and <italic>dlc</italic>.

        <p>To assess the relevance of the two-loop network described above for oscillatory gene expression and segmentation in the embryo, we decided to examine the phenotypes of embryos with mutations in the network's components.

We observed evidence of tissue-level transcriptional oscillations in <italic>her1</italic> mutants already at the bud stage (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s005">Figure S5A</xref>,B), suggesting that the partially penetrant anterior defects are not caused by a failure in establishing transcriptional oscillations at early somitogenesis stages. Tissue-level transcriptional oscillations of <italic>her7</italic> mRNA were also evident at the 10-somite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Because the wave pattern of transcriptional oscillations is altered in <italic>her1</italic> mutants compared to wildtype embryos, it is difficult to visualize oscillating expression of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>dlc</italic> mRNA on the tissue level using standard chromogenic reagents. Subcellularly, transcriptional oscillations manifest in a succession of distinct localizations of the mRNA of oscillating genes—in early phases of the oscillatory cycle, cyclically expressed mRNAs are found in distinct nuclear spots at the sites of transcription, whereas later in the cycle they localize to the cytoplasm and give a diffuse staining <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Julich1">[29]</xref>. We therefore used tyramide chemistry to detect changes in the subcellular localization of mRNA as a proxy for transcriptional oscillations. With this method, we were able to detect both <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>dlc</italic> mRNA in distinct subcellular localizations in different <italic>her1</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g004">Figure 4C,D</xref>), indicating that oscillations of <italic>dlc</italic> mRNA and the mutant <italic>her1</italic> mRNA continue in the <italic>her1</italic> mutant PSM. The <italic>her1</italic> mutant phenotype is therefore in agreement with the predictions from the two-loop network topology—in the absence of Her1, the function of the Her7:Hes6 heterodimer is sufficient to drive oscillatory expression of <italic>her7</italic>, <italic>dlc</italic>, and the mutant <italic>her1</italic> mRNA. The genetic <italic>her1</italic> loss-of-function phenotype described here is consistent with reports from previous studies using MO-mediated gene knockdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oates2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Henry1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Gajewski1">[30]</xref> and suggests that the more widespread segmentation defects upon <italic>her1</italic> knockdown that were reported by one other study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Holley2">[27]</xref> reflect off-target effects.</p>

        <title>Mutating <italic>hes6</italic> Alleviates Posterior Segmentation Defects Caused by Loss of <italic>her7</italic></title>
        <p>As a last test of the network's two-loop topology we examined cyclic gene expression and segmentation in <italic>her7</italic>;<italic>hes6</italic> double mutants. Since Her1 homodimers with DNA binding activity are available in this condition, the network structure predicts that oscillations will at least initiate in this double mutant. Yet because of the role of Her7 in maintaining tissue-level oscillations throughout segmentation stages that became apparent in the <italic>her7</italic> single mutant, we expected the oscillations to likewise decay in <italic>her7</italic>;<italic>hes6</italic> mutants, and segmentation to become strongly defective in the posterior trunk and tail. However, we found that most <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutants segmented normally and posterior segmentation defects occurred with a low severity and penetrance comparable to <italic>hes6</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g005">Figure 5A</xref>). Furthermore, the expression patterns of the mutant <italic>her7</italic> mRNA in <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutants at the 10-somite stage showed clear indications of tissue-level oscillations, similar to the situation in <italic>hes6</italic> single mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). These results indicate that <italic>hes6</italic> is fully epistatic over <italic>her7</italic>: Since identical phenotypes are observed in <italic>hes6</italic> single and <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutants, <italic>her7</italic> function in somitogenesis is entirely dependent on the presence of <italic>hes6</italic>. On the other hand, the fact that the decay of oscillatory gene expression and defective segmentation in a <italic>her7</italic> mutant background can be rescued by mutating <italic>hes6</italic> indicates that <italic>hes6</italic> is not neutral in the absence of <italic>her7</italic> function, but dominantly interferes with clock function in this condition. This suggests that segmentation defects in <italic>her7</italic> mutants are caused by Hes6 protein, which would contribute to Her7:Hes6 heterodimers in wildtype embryos, but in the absence of Her7 interferes with other critical components of the segmentation clock, such as Her1 homodimers. Importantly, the normal segmentation and cyclic gene expression patterns in the <italic>her7</italic>;<italic>hes6</italic> double mutant combination is in agreement with the redundant two-loop negative feedback network topology predicted by our in vitro studies.</p>

        <title>Loss of <italic>her1</italic> or <italic>her7</italic> Function Does Not Alter Somitogenesis Period</title>
        <p>While the phenotypic assays described above provide a straightforward test of the circuit's basic topology by asking whether the oscillatory state of the circuit can be initiated and maintained in mutant conditions, they do not probe more subtle aspects of the circuit's dynamics. In particular, neither the static phenotypes nor the simple topology of the network allow inference of how the period of oscillations is regulated. A previous mathematical model of the segmentation clock has emphasized the role of transcriptional and translational delays in a <italic>hes/her</italic> feedback system in setting the period of oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Lewis1">[10]</xref>. Specifically, it would be predicted that oscillations relying exclusively on a <italic>her7</italic>-based feedback loop might be faster than oscillations that are exclusively based on <italic>her1</italic>, because of shorter production delays in the <italic>her7</italic>-based loop. We have previously shown that mutating <italic>hes6</italic> slows segmentation clock period <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>, and our protein-DNA binding data indicate that Her7 requires Hes6 to gain DNA binding activity. Therefore, it seemed possible that the period slowing in <italic>hes6</italic> mutants was due to the loss of the fast Her7:Hes6 loop and reflected a slower Her1-based loop operating in isolation. If this were the case, then we would expect that the formation of anterior segments in <italic>her7</italic> single and <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutants would be slowed as in <italic>hes6</italic> mutants. Furthermore, if the slower <italic>her1</italic> loop modulated the period in the wildtype, <italic>her1</italic> mutants might segment faster than wildtype embryos.</p>
        <p>We used multiple-embryo time-lapse imaging to test this idea and recorded the periodicity of somite formation as a morphological proxy for the oscillations of the segmentation clock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Herrgen1">[32]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter2">[33]</xref>. We found that somites form with similar dynamics in wildtype, <italic>her1</italic> mutant, and <italic>her7</italic> mutant embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Somitogenesis period in <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutants was slowed compared to trans-heterozygous controls, and comparable to <italic>hes6</italic> homozgyous;<italic>her7</italic> heterozygous mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">Figure 6</xref>). These findings indicate that neither <italic>her1</italic> nor <italic>her7</italic> have a crucial role in setting the tempo of segmentation clock oscillations, and that <italic>hes6</italic> regulates segmentation clock period independently from simply providing a heterodimerization partner for Her7. The period control function of <italic>hes6</italic> can therefore not be mapped to the simple two-loop topology determined by our protein-DNA interaction studies, and this motivated us to consider a possible role for non-DNA binding dimers in regulating the dynamics of the segmentation clock.</p>

        <p>To explore the complex regulatory possibilities of the circuit we have described and determine whether wildtype and mutant phenotypes can be explained in a rigorous, internally consistent manner, we decided to investigate the dynamics of a mathematical model of the network describing the behavior of Her1, Hes6, and Her7 proteins (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s016">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s014">Tables S2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s015">S3</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s007">Figures S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s008">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s009">S9</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s010">S10</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s011">S11</xref> for details). Following our protein-protein and protein-DNA binding results, our model allows for formation of all possible dimers between Her1, Hes6, and Her7, but negative feedback regulation of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> occurs exclusively through Her1:Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers (schematically depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). We use a Hill function to describe repression through these dimers in our model. This is motivated by our finding that there are multiple binding sites for each of the dimers in every cyclic gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g003">Figure 3D</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Rubinow1">[34]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Zeiser1">[35]</xref> and does not reflect any assumptions about the binding mechanism of Hes/Her dimers to individual target sites. For simplicity, we ignore potential transcriptional regulation via dimers with weak DNA binding activity. Nevertheless, the dimers that do not bind DNA in our model still perform an important post-translational regulatory function, since they sequester monomers and thereby affect the availability of dimers with DNA binding activity. The period measurements in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">Figure 6</xref> provide strong constraints on the network's dynamics, and can be used to guide the choice of parameter values.</p>

        <p>To understand the consequences of the basic network topology, and because reliable measurements of the rate constants of the processes in this network are not available, we intentionally avoid automatic methods to optimize model parameters to obtain the best possible quantitative fit to experimental results. Instead, when possible we keep rate constants associated with production, dimerization, and repression equal between the Hes/Her proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s015">Table S3</xref>), and introduce only the minimum differences between species necessary to qualitatively reproduce experimental trends. For this reason, the parameter values we report below should not be understood as exact quantitative predictions. To simplify the model as far as possible, we focus only on the generation of oscillations within single cells and do not describe cell-cell coupling.</p>
        <p>To analyze the dynamics of this network, we obtained numerical solutions of the minimal version of the model. The different mutant conditions were simulated by setting the production rate of the corresponding component(s) to zero. We started by setting the Hes6 production rate to zero, <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> = 0, to describe a <italic>hes6</italic> mutant; in this situation, the network can support high-amplitude oscillations (blue triangle in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7B</xref> and second panel in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). As the value of <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> is increased, the period of oscillations decreases (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, bottom; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s007">Figure S7</xref>). At <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> = 90, the period of the simulated oscillations is approximately 6% faster than in a situation without <italic>hes6</italic> (black point in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7B</xref>), matching the experimentally observed difference in somitogenesis period between <italic>hes6</italic> mutant and wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>. We therefore chose <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> = 90 as the wildtype value for Hes6 production. This value for Hes6 production is higher than the corresponding values <italic>κ</italic><sub>1</sub> = <italic>κ</italic><sub>7</sub> = 10 for Her1 and Her7 production, thereby distinguishing Hes6 from Her1 and Her7 at the parameter level. A parameter sensitivity analysis shows that the period and amplitude of oscillations are robust to changes in most of the parameters of the model (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s008">Figure S8</xref>).</p>
        <p>This dependence of oscillation period on Hes6 production rate is caused by heterodimerization of Hes6 with Her1 and Her7, allowing Her1 and Her7 proteins to be degraded also as components of these heterodimers, which alters the effective stability of Her1 and Her7 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s009">Figure S9</xref>). A striking consequence of the regulation of the effective half-lives of Her1 and Her7 by dimerization with Hes6 in the model is that Hes6 protein levels also oscillate, albeit with relatively low amplitude, despite a constant production (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). We return to this distinctive prediction below.</p>
        <p>Next, we simulated the <italic>her7</italic> mutant by setting the Her7 production rate to zero, <italic>κ</italic><sub>7</sub> = 0. We find that the period of these simulated oscillations is shorter for a <italic>her7</italic> mutant than the wildtype over a range of values for <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s007">Figure S7</xref>), in contrast to our experimental measurements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">Figure 6</xref>). To fit our experimental data with our model as simply as possible, we introduce one more parameter asymmetry, choosing a slightly longer production delay <italic>τ</italic> for Her1 compared to Her7. Qualitatively, this choice appears to be justified by the physical properties of the two genes, because the <italic>her1</italic> gene is longer and contains more introns than the <italic>her7</italic> gene. Quantitatively, a relatively small difference is motivated from independent experimental data, because transcription is fast (∼4 Kb/min), intron splicing is co-transcriptional, and splicing times are short (∼5 min) and independent of length <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Singh1">[36]</xref>. For a difference of 2% between the <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> delays, the oscillations in the simulated <italic>her7</italic> mutant have a period similar to the wildtype situation, almost independently of our choice for <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). At <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> = 90, oscillations initiate in the simulated <italic>her7</italic> mutant, but the amplitude of these initial oscillations decreases over time, eventually falling to zero (green dot in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7B</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7C</xref>). This suggests that in the embryo, mutation of <italic>her7</italic> results in lower amplitude or even fully damped oscillations on the single cell level, and this gradual damping of oscillations provides an explanation for the posterior segmentation defects in <italic>her7</italic> mutants.</p>
        <p>While the amplitude of oscillations in the simulated <italic>her7</italic> mutant decays instantaneously and rapidly and Her7 trough levels are constantly elevated in this situation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7C</xref>), the amplitude of the early oscillations in bud stage embryos appears to be similar to the wildtype (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s005">Figure S5C</xref>–E). Therefore, although our model is qualitatively successful in explaining the <italic>her7</italic> mutant phenotype, there remains a quantitative difference between the model and the data. We speculate that this may be due to the particular choice of parameters in our model, which have not been optimized to capture the amplitude of oscillations in early <italic>her7</italic> mutant embryos, or due to effects of coupling between cells on the tissue level, which are not represented in our model.</p>
        <p>In our model, the reduction of amplitude in the <italic>her7</italic> mutant simulation arises because the resulting level of Her1 homodimer is insufficient to sustain oscillations (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s010">Figure S10</xref>). Although Her1 monomer production increases due to loss of repression via Her7:Hes6 heterodimers, most of it is sequestered as non-DNA binding Her1:Hes6 heterodimers. Consequently, decreasing <italic>κ</italic><sub>6</sub> in a simulated <italic>her7</italic> mutant situation leads to a recovery of the amplitude of oscillations (green line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Our model thereby also provides an explanation for the striking rescue of segmentation defects in the <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutant. The period of oscillations in <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutant simulations is slowed compared to the wildtype situation, in qualitative agreement with our experimental findings. We note, however, that our model predicts a period difference between the <italic>hes6</italic> single and <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutant situation (cyan square in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7B</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7C</xref>, bottom), which is not observed experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">Figure 6</xref>). In the model, this period difference is caused by heterodimerization and effective destabilization of Her1 by Her7 in the <italic>hes6</italic> single, but not in the <italic>her7;hes6</italic> double mutant. The difference between model and experiment suggests that we either overestimate this destabilization effect in our minimal parameterization of the model by setting all rate constants equal or that other proteins in the PSM that are not considered in this model can compensate for Her7 function in regulating Her1 stability.</p>
        <p>In summary, our mathematical model indicates that the two-loop negative feedback topology of the <italic>her</italic> gene network as determined by our protein-protein and protein-DNA interaction studies is sufficient to explain the qualitative dynamic characteristics of the different experimentally observed single and double mutant phenotypes when the effects of dimers with and without DNA binding activity are considered. The success of this model supports an important role for both types of dimers in controlling the dynamics of the circuit, since together they determine the availability of DNA binding dimers. Below, we report on three experimental tests of the formation of Hes/Her dimers described in the model.</p>

        <title><italic>hes6</italic> Dosage Affects Clock Function In Vivo</title>
        <p>Our mathematical model makes predictions about the role of Hes6 production rate in controlling the period and the amplitude of oscillations. We reasoned that the expected roles of Hes6 production rate should be testable using the <italic>hes6</italic> heterozygote mutant embryo. As predicted by our model, we observed that the periodicity of somite formation in <italic>hes6</italic> heterozygous mutant embryos was slowed compared to their wildtype siblings (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s012">Figure S12A</xref>) and leads to a reduction in segment number that is in agreement with the period measurements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s012">Figure S12B</xref>,C). Furthermore, we found a shift of the onset of defects towards the posterior when the <italic>hes6</italic> locus was heterozygous mutant in a <italic>her7</italic> mutant background, compared to <italic>her7</italic> mutants with two wildtype <italic>hes6</italic> loci (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s012">Figure S12D</xref>,E). This is consistent with the predicted tuning of the amplitude of Her1 oscillations by Hes6 levels. Together, these findings from <italic>hes6</italic> heterozygous mutants are in agreement with the predictions of our mathematical model, providing additional support for the idea that Hes6 quantitatively affects segmentation clock functions by titrating critical oscillatory monomers and affecting their effective stability.</p>

        <title>Hes6 Protein Oscillations</title>
        <p>Finally, we sought to directly investigate the predicted effects of dimerization on the effective protein stability of Hes6. Our model suggests that dimerization of Hes6 with the cyclically expressed proteins Her1 and Her7 and subsequent degradation of the Her1:Hes6 and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers will manifest in post-transcriptional oscillation of Hes6 protein levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7D</xref>), and we decided to test this prediction directly in the embryo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8</xref>). To first rule out that any potential oscillatory protein pattern could be caused by transcriptional oscillations of <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA that had previously been overlooked <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Krol1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>, we searched 5 Kb upstream of the <italic>hes6</italic> start codon for H-box sites. The only H-box-containing 12-mer within this stretch of DNA has the sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">ACTCACGTGAGA</named-content> (unpublished data). Because the central CACGTG consensus is flanked by T and A, respectively, this H-box is not expected to be strongly bound by Her1 homodimers or Her7:Hes6 heterodimers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s013">Table S1</xref>). Furthermore, when we examined the spatial pattern of <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA expression in wildtype embryos at the 10-somite stage, we observed a smooth decay of the staining intensity from posterior to anterior; there was no evidence for spatial mRNA waves, which would be expected if Her1 or Her7 controlled <italic>hes6</italic> expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8A,B</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 20). Finally, the pattern of <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA expression is not altered in <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8A,B</xref>, <italic>n</italic>≥20 for each genotype). This indicates that <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA expression is not subject to transcriptional control by Her1 or Her7. Taken together, these data indicate that <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA levels do not oscillate, in line with reports from several previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Krol1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>.</p>

        <p>To test the prediction that Hes6 protein levels oscillate, we raised monoclonal antibodies against Hes6. Whole-mount immunostaining revealed a nuclear signal in the tailbud and posterior PSM of wildtype embryos (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, left). No nuclear signal was obtained in <italic>hes6</italic> mutant embryos, indicating the specific detection of Hes6 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8C</xref>, right). When we examined Hes6 immunoreactivity in wildtype embryos, a subset (10/26) showed striped staining patterns indicative of Hes6 protein oscillations (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8D</xref>). These patterns can be compared by plotting the intensity profile of Hes6 immunoreactivity in the intermediate PSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8E</xref>). Their shape and position recapitulates the wave pattern of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> mRNA expression in this region of the PSM. Although we cannot formally rule out the possibility that these Hes6 protein oscillations might be produced by <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA oscillations below our detection limit or by an influence of cyclically expressed proteins on Hes6 translation, this finding is consistent with our prediction that the cyclically expressed proteins Her1 and Her7 regulate Hes6 protein stability in the PSM.</p>
        <p>To test the influence of Her1 and Her7 proteins on Hes6 protein oscillations, we examined Hes6 immunoreactivity in <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> mutants. If <italic>Her1</italic> and <italic>Her7</italic> oscillations were responsible for generating the tissue-level Hes6 protein oscillations, they should be lost in <italic>her7</italic> mutants, where tissue-level oscillations of all cyclic genes examined decay by the 10-somite stage (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g004">Figure 4F–H</xref>). In contrast, Hes6 protein oscillations should remain in <italic>her1</italic> mutants, where <italic>her7</italic> is still expressed in a wave pattern (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). In <italic>her1</italic> mutants, we detected anterior waves of Hes6 immunoreactivity (<italic>n</italic> = 4/16, red arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8F,G</xref>), in line with our expectation of ongoing Hes6 protein oscillations in <italic>her1</italic> mutants. These patterns were less pronounced than in wildtype embryos, consistent with the altered wave-like expression patterns of <italic>her7</italic> mRNA in the <italic>her1</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g004">Figure 4B,D</xref>). In contrast to wildtype and <italic>her1</italic> mutant embryos, we found no evidence for tissue-level protein oscillations in <italic>her7</italic> mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8F,G</xref>, <italic>n</italic> = 16). Hes6 protein levels decayed smoothly from posterior to anterior, in parallel with the shape of the <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA profile (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g008">Figure 8A,B,F,G</xref>), in line with our expectation. Taken together, our finding of characteristic cyclic wave patterns of Hes6 protein in wildtype embryos (despite smooth <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA patterns) and the differentially perturbed patterns of Hes6 protein oscillation in the <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> mutants is consistent with one of the key features of our model, namely that heterodimerization regulates effective protein stability in the segmentation clock.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this work we describe a new dynamic model for the core pace-making circuit of the segmentation clock, which is based on a systematic biochemical investigation of the network's topology and precise measurements of somitogenesis dynamics in novel genetic mutants. Our key finding is that the core pace-making circuit consists of two distinct negative feedback loops, one involving Her1 homodimers and the other involving Her7:Hes6 heterodimers, operating in parallel. We can account for the single and double mutant phenotypes of <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her7</italic>, and <italic>hes6</italic> mutants in a mathematical model of this core circuit, wherein protein-protein interactions between oscillating and non-oscillating Hes/Her genes control the availability of dimers with DNA binding activity. This is a new principle for the regulation of oscillatory dynamics that may be relevant beyond the zebrafish segmentation clock.</p>

        <title>A Novel Topology for the Segmentation Clock's Core Circuit</title>
        <p>The protein-DNA interaction assays in this article extend previous efforts to biochemically map regulatory interactions in the segmentation clock. The interaction of Her1 homodimers with the <italic>her1</italic> promoter using electrophoretic mobility shift assays was previously observed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Brend1">[14]</xref>. While this article was under review, evidence for the existence of binding sites for Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers in the <italic>her7</italic> promoter was published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Trofka1">[26]</xref>. Here we show that, in addition, Her7:Hes6 heterodimers also bind to the <italic>her1</italic> promoter, and both Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers target sequences in the <italic>dlc</italic> promoter. Using MITOMI technology, we were able to determine and compare the DNA binding specificity of both types of dimers in an exhaustive and unbiased way. We find that both dimers bind to the core consensus sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGNG</named-content>. This sequence differs from the N-box sequence <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CAC[G/A]AG</named-content> commonly reported for mouse Hes proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Sasai1">[37]</xref>, which had been determined via a candidate approach, but is similar to the consensus binding site <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACG[T/C]G</named-content> established for the <italic>Drosophila</italic> Hairy protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Ohsako1">[38]</xref>. Therefore, it appears likely that binding to the <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">CACGNG</named-content> consensus sequence is a common feature of Hairy-related bHLH transcription factors in different species, and we term this consensus binding site the H-box. When we compare the relative affinities of Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers to H-box sites in the three cyclic gene promoters, we detect differences. Although this observation is in line with recent results <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Trofka1">[26]</xref>, our data do not support the proposed hypothesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Trofka1">[26]</xref> that these differences might have functional consequences to the dimers in the context of the segmentation clock, since sites with relatively higher affinity to either of the two types of dimer do not appear to be enriched in any of the three promoters examined.</p>
        <p>Our protein-DNA interaction experiments suggest a regulatory network architecture for the segmentation clock where <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> engage in two parallel, redundant negative feedback loops, which converge on the same DNA regulatory elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). The concept of redundant <italic>her1</italic>- and <italic>her7</italic>-based feedback loops has been introduced before in dynamic models of the segmentation clock, following genetic evidence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Cinquin1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Lewis1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oates2">[11]</xref>. However, the biochemical realization of these redundant feedback loops that we determine here differs from these earlier models. Previously, all possible dimers between Hes/Her proteins were assumed to have DNA binding activity and participate in feedback regulation. We find here that although Hes/Her proteins indeed dimerize promiscuously, only Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers have strong DNA binding activity. These findings are again in general agreement with the recent study mentioned above <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Trofka1">[26]</xref>. An equilibrium description of the Hes/Her dimerization and DNA binding interactions presented in this recent work does not consider any dynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Trofka1">[26]</xref> and thus does not model temporal behavior of the segmentation clock. In summary, Hes/Her dimers with low DNA binding activity have not been considered in previous dynamic models of the segmentation clock, but in our new model they have important functions in determining the dynamics of the circuit, as we will explain below.</p>

        <title>A Protein-Protein Interaction Network Determines Clock Dynamics</title>
        <p>Our finding that Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers target the same DNA-sites in the regulatory regions of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> and within the promoter of the cyclic <italic>dlc</italic> gene thought to mediate coupling between single cell oscillators <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Lewis1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oates2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Giudicelli1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Julich1">[29]</xref> appears at first difficult to reconcile with the distinct phenotypes of <italic>her1</italic>, <italic>her7</italic>, and <italic>hes6</italic> single mutants. It is of course possible that Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers recruit distinct accessory machineries to regulate transcription at cyclic gene promoters. Alternatively, Her1, Her7, or Hes6 might gain distinct DNA binding activity by selective dimerization with bHLH factors not investigated here, and either of these scenarios might contribute to the observed phenotypic differences. However, our analysis of a mathematical model that is solely based on the experimentally determined interactions between Her1, Her7, and Hes6 suggests that this small network alone is sufficient to account for the distinct mutant phenotypes. Our finding that Hes/Her proteins dimerize promiscuously and form a “dimer cloud” that contains complexes with strong and weak DNA binding activity provides the key ingredient required to generate these phenotypic differences.</p>
        <p>In our model, period slowing upon loss of <italic>hes6</italic> is caused by the influence of Hes6 on effective protein stability. Although we assume that degradation acts equally on Hes/Her monomers and dimers, the sequestration of monomers into dimers and degradation of these dimers introduces an effective monomer degradation rate that is a function of dimer concentrations, which are nonlinear functions (products) of the monomer concentrations. Experimental support for this feature of our model comes from the expression patterns of Hes6 protein. These show evidence for Hes6 protein oscillations, despite non-oscillatory <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA expression. Our model suggests how these protein patterns might arise—the cyclically expressed proteins Her1 and Her7 dimerize with the constantly expressed Hes6 protein and thereby cyclically modulate its effective stability. Conversely, in our model dimerization of Hes6 with Her1 and Her7 results in a shorter effective half-life of the two cyclic proteins. Consequently, in the <italic>hes6</italic> mutant situation, the effective stability of the oscillating proteins Her1 and Her7 is increased, and this increases the period. Previous theoretical work also shows that increased stability leads to longer oscillation period in Hes/Her feedback systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Lewis1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Hirata1">[39]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Monk1">[40]</xref>. It will be interesting to directly investigate this hypothesis arising from our model by measuring Her1 and Her7 half-lives in wildtype and <italic>hes6</italic> mutant embryos. Furthermore, according to our model, Hes6 overexpression should further reduce the effective stability of Her1 and Her7 and might therefore reduce the period of the clock. This will have to be tested in transgenic fish carrying additional copies of the <italic>hes6</italic> gene in order to allow for controlled Hes6 overexpression and to circumvent gastrulation defects induced by <italic>hes6</italic> mRNA injection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Dimerization-induced changes in stability are known for several bHLH proteins, where complex formation usually results in an increased half-life <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Lingbeck1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-TrauschAzar1">[42]</xref>. This effect is termed cooperative stability, and theoretical studies have established that this phenomenon can affect the dynamic behavior of genetic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Zhang1">[43]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Buchler2">[45]</xref>. In the context of the segmentation clock, it has been suggested that cooperative stability could increase the region in parameter space where sustained oscillations are possible, rendering the oscillator more robust <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Campanelli1">[46]</xref>. Although different monomer and dimer stabilities can be accounted for in our model, they are not necessary to recapitulate the observed embryonic phenotypes, and we do not explore their effects here.</p>
        <p>While the effects of Hes6 on oscillation period in our model arise from its equally destabilizing effect on both Her1 and Her7, the fact that Hes6 forms heterodimers with strong DNA binding activity only with Her7 provides an explanation for posterior segmentation defects in <italic>her7</italic> mutants. In the absence of Her7, more Hes6 engages in Her1:Hes6 heterodimers with low DNA binding activity, thereby reducing the pool of Her1 homodimers available for transcriptional regulation. In our model, this results in a decrease in the amplitude of oscillations, which is a plausible explanation for the posterior segmentation defects observed in <italic>her7</italic> mutants. To directly test this idea experimentally, it will be necessary to follow oscillations in <italic>her7</italic> mutants with single cell resolution.</p>
        <p>The inactivating function of Hes6 towards Her1 in our model of the zebrafish segmentation clock contrasts with a previous report, where Hes6 was shown to increase the repressive activity of Her1 towards the <italic>her1</italic> promoter <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>, although the duration (48 h) and biological host (293T cells) used in this experiment makes direct comparison to the segmentation clock difficult. In the developing mouse nervous system, Hes6 has been shown to inactivate the Her1 homolog Hes1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Bae1">[47]</xref>, analogous to its function in our model. Negative regulation of bHLH factor activity by dimerization is a well-established concept: Id factors, which lack a basic domain, can inhibit DNA binding of tissue specific bHLH factors by forming inactive heterodimers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Massari1">[48]</xref>, and Hairy-related transcription factors can inhibit the function of lineage-specific bHLH proteins by heterodimerization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Fischer1">[49]</xref>. However, while these well-known examples of negative regulation by dimerization occur between proteins that belong to different classes of the bHLH family, the inactivation of Hes1 by Hes6 in the mouse nervous system and the formation of dimers with lowered DNA binding activity described in this work occur between proteins of the same subclass. Furthermore, our results suggest that Hes6 has opposite effects on the closely related proteins Her7 and Her1, being a necessary dimerization partner for Her7 to gain DNA binding activity, while inhibiting DNA binding of Her1. This is a new observation for bHLH proteins, and it will be interesting to investigate which structural features determine Hes6's mode of action towards different Hes/Her factors.</p>
        <p>The role of Hes/Her dimerization in the zebrafish segmentation clock may be relevant for understanding the mouse segmentation clock. While the overall topology of the mouse and zebrafish segmentation clock networks, including intercellular signaling pathways, has clear differences, the presence of multiple oscillating Hes/Her genes is conserved <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Krol1">[5]</xref>. The <italic>Hes1</italic>, <italic>Hes5</italic>, and <italic>Hes7</italic> genes oscillate in mouse PSM, and <italic>Hes7</italic> is required for oscillations via a transcriptional auto-repression negative feedback loop <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Bessho1">[50]</xref>. <italic>Hes7</italic> mutant embryos have profoundly disrupted segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Bessho2">[51]</xref>, but in contrast, <italic>Hes1</italic> and <italic>Hes5</italic> single and double mutants segment overtly normally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Ohtsuka1">[52]</xref>. This suggests that the Hes-based negative feedback loop topology differs between mouse and zebrafish. Based on our observations, we would expect that the Hes1 and Hes5 proteins, as well as non-oscillating bHLH proteins with ubiquitous expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Leimeister1">[53]</xref>, could participate in a dimer sequestration mechanism with Hes7 similar to the zebrafish clock, thereby potentially regulating the dynamics. Although there is currently no evidence that Hes genes regulate the period in mouse, the development of techniques to measure the dynamics of mouse segmentation with sufficient precision and temporal resolution may allow such effects to be detected.</p>
        <p>Because of the general role of Hes6 in controlling protein stability and its differential effects on the DNA binding properties of Her1 and Her7, the activities of these proteins need to be appropriately balanced to ensure the reliable function of the zebrafish segmentation clock in the wildtype. This need to balance competing activities appears to be a common theme in different dynamic biological systems. In the developing <italic>Drosophila</italic> eye, the activity of a network of bHLH factors has recently been shown to direct the timing and spacing of cellular differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Bhattacharya1">[54]</xref>. In the genetic network of the mouse circadian clock, loss of <italic>mPer2</italic> disrupts circadian rhythmicity, and this phenotype can be rescued by disruption of <italic>mCry2</italic> in <italic>mPer2</italic> mutant mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oster1">[55]</xref>. This rescue phenotype is similar to the restoration of segmentation clock oscillations by mutating <italic>hes6</italic> in a <italic>her7</italic> mutant background that we describe here, and by joint morpholino knockdown described recently elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Trofka1">[26]</xref>. This suggests that, similar to control of Hes6 levels by Her7 in the segmentation clock, mPer2 levels in the circadian clock need to be held in check by mCry2.</p>

        <title>Integration of Multiple <italic>her</italic> Genes' Functions and Spatial Aspects of the Zebrafish Segmentation Clock</title>
        <p>In this work, we take a reductionist approach to understand the identity and function of the core oscillator of the zebrafish segmentation clock: We investigate regulatory interactions between only three genes and try to understand their system-level loss-of-function phenotypes by modeling the dynamics of a small single-cell network. Our success in modeling a range of phenotypes with this small set of components, as well as the finding that joint loss of <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>her7</italic> or <italic>her1</italic> and <italic>hes6</italic> function completely abrogates oscillatory cyclic gene expression and segmentation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001364.s006">Figure S6</xref>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Oates2">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Henry1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Sieger1">[31]</xref>, indicates that the two-loop system described here forms the core of the zebrafish segmentation clock. Nevertheless, the dynamics of this core network may be influenced by its interaction with factors not considered here. For example, several other <italic>hes/her</italic> genes as well as <italic>tbx16</italic> display transcriptional oscillations in the PSM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Krol1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Shankaran1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Sieger2">[57]</xref>. Specifically, it has been shown that the gene products of the oscillating genes <italic>her12</italic> and <italic>her15</italic> bind targets sites from the <italic>her7</italic> promoter in vitro both as homodimers and as heterodimers with Hes6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Trofka1">[26]</xref>. In addition, we show here that Hes/Her proteins can interact with non-hairy bHLH proteins such as MyoD with considerable affinity, which presumably impacts on their activity. How cyclic and non-cyclic bHLH proteins integrate into the core network formed by Her1, Her7, and Hes6 and modulate its dynamics will depend on whether they form dimers with or without DNA binding activity amongst each other and with the three proteins investigated here.</p>
        <p>Because we focus on the regulation of oscillatory dynamics at the single cell level, we have not explicitly addressed tissue-level aspects of oscillatory gene expression in the PSM. We have previously shown that coupling of single cell oscillators through Delta-Notch signaling can modulate the period of tissue-level oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Herrgen2">[58]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Morelli1">[59]</xref>. Therefore, although our single cell model allows us to fit a range of dynamic tissue-level phenotypes, it is possible that these phenotypes do not solely arise from changes in the regulatory interactions within single cells, but might also depend on the modulation of altered single cell dynamics by cell-cell communication.</p>
        <p>Furthermore, on the tissue level the transcriptional oscillations of the segmentation clock manifest as moving stripes of gene expression, and theoretical studies have established that this spatial aspect of the clock's oscillations can be reproduced by a gradual slowing of cell-autonomous oscillations in more anterior regions of the PSM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Palmeirim1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Giudicelli1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Morelli1">[59]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Tiedemann1">[65]</xref>. While our model describes the situation in the posterior PSM, this gradual slowing could be achieved by a changing configuration of the <italic>hes/her</italic> gene regulatory network in more anterior parts of the PSM. The integration of oscillatory <italic>her</italic> genes with region-specific expression in the PSM <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Krol1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Shankaran1">[56]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Sieger2">[57]</xref> into the core network might provide one mechanism for the position-specific control of single-cell oscillatory period.</p>
        <p>The graded expression of <italic>hes6</italic> across the tailbud and PSM (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">Figure 8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Kawamura1">[18]</xref>) has been suggested to directly control the slowing of oscillations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Cinquin1">[8]</xref>, but the evidence here does not obviously support this scenario. Mutating <italic>hes6</italic> changes the period of oscillations by only 6% <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Schroter1">[17]</xref>, and theoretical work shows that such a small period change is insufficient to generate the observed wildtype wave pattern <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Campanelli1">[46]</xref>. Furthermore, we found that mutating <italic>hes6</italic> does not grossly affect the wave patterns of cyclic gene expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). In contrast, we note that the wave patterns are strongly altered in <italic>her1</italic> mutants, although the overall pace of segmentation is not (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g004">Figures 4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001364-g006">6</xref>). This suggests that <italic>her1</italic> has a primary role in period control in the anterior PSM where oscillations slow down. Conversely, in the tailbud where the pace of segmentation is determined, elevated levels of <italic>hes6</italic> expression may allow the Her7:Hes6 heterodimer to exert a dominant control over the circuit's period. Thus it is tempting to speculate that the wildtype zebrafish segmentation clock may use changing Hes6 expression levels to switch between the two core oscillatory negative feedback loops in a position-dependent manner across the PSM.</p>
        <p>In summary, combining biochemical and genetic data with mathematical modeling, we have developed a model for the zebrafish segmentation clock's core circuit with a novel regulatory topology and an unexpectedly prominent role for a “dimer cloud” of Hes/Her complexes in regulating the formation and availability of DNA binding dimers. Oscillating systems generally must display (i) negative feedback, (ii) delays in this feedback, (iii) sufficient nonlinearity, and (iv) a balance of timescales <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Novak1">[66]</xref>. Our biochemical measurements of DNA-binding Her1 homodimers and Her7:Hes6 heterodimers onto target sites from oscillating gene promoters reveal the redundant two-loop topology of the negative feedback in the core circuit, as well as a likely source of strong non-linearity via the existence of multiple binding sites <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001364-Zeiser2">[67]</xref>. This redundant two-loop topology may provide the circuit with robustness to genetic and environmental perturbation, while the distinct components of each loop could provide the core circuit with independent input and/or output regulatory linkage that might vary with the position of the cell in the PSM, or with developmental stage, or through evolutionary transitions. The balance of timescales in the system is controlled in a surprising way: Hes6 acts to tune this balance by regulating the effective degradation of the oscillating DNA binding dimers, thereby changing the period of the clock. This global regulation of the stability of the oscillating components, and hence the period, through protein-protein interaction with a component whose levels can be smoothly and gradually tuned by external signals is a new control mechanism for the segmentation clock. How widely this principle is employed in other genetic regulatory systems remains to be explored.</p>

Each data point represents one sequence, and the relative affinity towards Her1-GFP in the presence of PPARγ-mCherry is plotted against the relative affinity of that site towards Her1-GFP in the presence of Her7-mCherry (A) or Hes6-mCherry (B). Data points cluster around the line representing equal affinities (dashed red line), suggesting that presence of Her7 or Hes6 does not alter the binding energy landscape of Her1.</p>
