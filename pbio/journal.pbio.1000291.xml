<p>A yeast-based small molecule screen identifies a novel activator of human HSF1 and protein chaperone expression and which appears to alleviate the toxicity of protein misfolding diseases.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>Neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington disease are devastating disorders with no therapeutic approaches to ameliorate the underlying protein misfolding defect inherent to poly-glutamine (polyQ) proteins. Given the mounting evidence that elevated levels of protein chaperones suppress polyQ protein misfolding, the master regulator of protein chaperone gene transcription, HSF1, is an attractive target for small molecule intervention. We describe a humanized yeast-based high-throughput screen to identify small molecule activators of human HSF1. This screen is insensitive to previously characterized activators of the heat shock response that have undesirable proteotoxic activity or that inhibit Hsp90, the central chaperone for cellular signaling and proliferation. A molecule identified in this screen, HSF1A, is structurally distinct from other characterized small molecule human HSF1 activators, activates HSF1 in mammalian and fly cells, elevates protein chaperone expression, ameliorates protein misfolding and cell death in polyQ-expressing neuronal precursor cells and protects against cytotoxicity in a fly model of polyQ-mediated neurodegeneration. In addition, we show that HSF1A interacts with components of the TRiC/CCT complex, suggesting a potentially novel regulatory role for this complex in modulating HSF1 activity. These studies describe a novel approach for the identification of new classes of pharmacological interventions for protein misfolding that underlies devastating neurodegenerative disease.</p>
</abstract><abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The misfolding of proteins into a toxic state contributes to a variety of neurodegenerative diseases such as Huntington, Alzheimer, and Parkinson disease. Although no known cure exists for these afflictions, many studies have shown that increasing the levels of protein chaperones, proteins that assist in the correct folding of other proteins, can suppress the neurotoxicity of the misfolded proteins. As such, increasing the cellular concentration of protein chaperones might serve as a powerful therapeutic approach in treating protein misfolding diseases. Because the levels of protein chaperones in the cell are primarily controlled by the heat shock transcription factor 1 [HSF1], we have designed and implemented a pharmacological screen to identify small molecules that can promote human HSF1 activation and increase the expression of protein chaperones. Through these studies, we have identified HSF1A, a molecule capable of activating human HSF1, increasing the levels of protein chaperones and alleviating the toxicity of misfolded proteins in both cell culture as well as fruit fly models of neurodegenerative disease.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Neuronal tissues are exquisitely sensitive to defective protein folding, and the accumulation of misfolded proteins is proteotoxic due to dominant effects of insolubility, inappropriate intermolecular interactions, and long half-lives. Protein misfolding is associated with neurodegenerative diseases that include Parkinson disease, amyotropic lateral sclerosis (ALS), transmissible spongiform encephalopathies (prion diseases), and other devastating diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Chiti1">[1]</xref>. Hereditary protein conformational disorders are characterized by coding region trinucleotide expansions resulting in the insertion of poly-glutamine (polyQ) tracts that adopt Î²-sheet structures and that are prone to incorrect folding and aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Orr1">[2]</xref>. To date, nine hereditary gain-of-function disorders including Huntington disease, dentatorubral-pallidoluysian atrophy, spinobulbar muscular atrophy, as well as six forms of spinocerebellar ataxia have been linked to polyQ expansions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Orr1">[2]</xref>. Although studies have suggested that amyloid formation observed in these states is intrinsic to the disease pathology, recent investigations suggest that the soluble oligomeric precursors of the large aggregates are the neurotoxic form <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Caughey1">[3]</xref>. Although there is no known cure for these devastating diseases, the ability to stabilize misfolded proteins into their native conformation would likely prevent the neuronal proteotoxicity that is observed in Huntington disease and other protein conformational disorders.</p>
<p>A variety of individual protein chaperones and cochaperone complexes function to fold, process, and degrade proteins, thereby playing a central role in cellular protein homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Young1">[4]</xref>. Experiments in cell and animal models of neurodegenerative disease demonstrate that increased levels of individual protein chaperones such as Hsp70, Hsp40, or Hsp27 can significantly suppress protein aggregation, increase protein solubility and turnover, and ameliorate neuronal loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Fujimoto1">[5]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Hay1">[16]</xref>. Additional studies suggest that simultaneous increases in Hsp70 and Hsp40 can synergize the suppression of polyQ-mediated neuronal degeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Chan1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Muchowski1">[9]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Bailey1">[13]</xref>. Because most metazoan chaperones stabilize, but do not disaggregate misfolded proteins, these results are consistent with the oligomeric precursors of amyloid fibrils being toxic to neurons, rather than the aggregates themselves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Caughey1">[3]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Wacker1">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Wacker2">[15]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Nagai1">[17]</xref>.</p>
<p>In eukaryotic cells, multiple genes encoding protein chaperones are coordinately transcriptionally activated in response to proteotoxic conditions, such as acute increases in temperature, by the heat shock transcription factor 1 (HSF1) protein and <italic>cis</italic>-acting promoter sequences called heat shock elements (HSEs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Perisic1">[18]</xref>â. As such, protein chaperones are often referred to as heat shock proteins, or Hsps. Although the mechanisms for HSF1 activation are incompletely understood, a multistep process occurs in response to stress that involves the interconversion of an inactive cytoplasmic monomer to a homotrimer, nuclear accumulation, DNA binding to HSEs, hyperphosphorylation, and target gene <italic>trans</italic>-activation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Pirkkala1">[21]</xref>. Studies suggest that under low proteotoxic stress conditions, HSF1 is largely an inactive cytoplasmic monomer that is bound to Hsp90, Hsp70, and other proteins in a repressive complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Shi1">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Zou1">[23]</xref>. It is thought that under stress conditions, HSF1 dissociates from this complex, allowing homomultimerization and activation. Although the association of HSF1 with protein chaperones is one mechanism for its regulation, HSF1 is also thought to engage in intramolecular coiled-coil interactions that maintain the monomeric state and point mutations in these coiled-coil domains (leucine zippers) cause constitutive multimerization when expressed in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Rabindran1">[24]</xref>. Studies also suggest that HSF1 has intrinsic stress-sensing capacity, as both <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammalian HSF1 can be converted from a monomer to a homotrimer in vitro in response to thermal or oxidative stress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Goodson1">[25]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Zhong1">[27]</xref>.</p>
<p>Previous reports demonstrate that the conversion of HSF1 to the high-affinity DNA binding homotrimer is not robust in neuronal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Morimoto1">[28]</xref>. Although the precise mechanisms underlying this defect in HSF1 activation are not clear, this could, in part, explain the selective sensitivity of neuronal cells in neurodegenerative diseases in which misfolded proteins are expressed in all tissues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Morimoto1">[28]</xref>. A recent report demonstrated that a cellular model and a mouse model of Huntington disease expressing a constitutively active form of human HSF1 exhibited reduced polyglutamine protein aggregation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Fujimoto1">[5]</xref>. Furthermore, the expression of activated HSF1 in nonneuronal tissues prolonged the lifespan of this mouse model of Huntington disease. Yeast cells harboring an HSF molecule partially defective in <italic>trans</italic>-activation were shown to promote yeast prion formation, implying a potential role for HSF target gene products in the prevention of prion generation or propagation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Park1">[29]</xref>. Moreover, <italic>hsf1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mice inoculated with Rocky Mountain Laboratory prions exhibited a shorter lifespan as compared to wild-type mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Steele1">[30]</xref>. Taken together, many studies support the value of individual protein chaperone expression, the synergistic expression of multiple protein chaperones, or the expression of an activated form of HSF1, in cellular, worm, fly, and mouse models of protein misfolding. Given the potential therapeutic role of elevated protein chaperone levels in diseases of protein conformation and the coordinated expression of Hsps via the action of human HSF1, small molecule activation of human HSF1 is likely to be a promising avenue for therapeutic intervention in neurodegenerative disease.</p>
<p>Previous screens utilizing an HSF1-dependent reporter gene as a readout for HSF1 activation in mammalian cells have identified activators of HSF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Westerheide1">[31]</xref>. However, these screens often result in the identification of compounds that promote HSF1 activation through the proteotoxic accumulation of unfolded proteins or through the inhibition of Hsp90, a central chaperone involved in cell growth, signaling, and proliferation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Chapelsky1">[32]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Zhang1">[36]</xref>. As such, novel approaches are needed to identify novel compounds that promote HSF1 activation without the inhibition of Hsp90 or promoting the accumulation of unfolded proteins. Here, we describe a novel high-throughput screen to identify small molecule activators of human HSF1 using the budding yeast <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>. This screen, insensitive to established proteotoxic agents and Hsp90 inhibitors, identifies novel small molecules that activate HSF1 in the amelioration of neurodegenerative phenotypes in metazoan models of polyQ-based disease.</p>

<title>A Humanized Yeast Screen for Small Molecule Activators of HSF1</title>
<p>We previously demonstrated that expression of human HSF1 is unable to suppress the viability defect of <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> cells lacking endogenous HSF <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Liu1">[37]</xref>. Moreover, human HSF1 was not activated in yeast in response to proteotoxic conditions such as heat shock that potently activate protein chaperone expression in mammalian cells. Biochemical analysis and functional complementation by an HSF1 mutant that is constitutively trimerized in human cells (HSF1LZ4m) indicated that the functional defect lies in the inability of human HSF1 to homotrimerize in yeast cells. As HSF1 multimerization is an early and essential step in the HSF1 activation program in human cells, we utilized the inability of human HSF1 to multimerize in yeast to screen for small molecule activators of HSF1 that would support yeast cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g001">Figure 1A</xref>).</p>

<p>For this humanized yeast screen, an <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> strain was created harboring a deletion of the chromosomal yeast HSF locus (<italic>yhsf</italic>Î) and which expresses a wild-type episomal copy of yeast HSF from the galactose-inducible, glucose-repressible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter. Moreover, this strain expresses the wild-type human HSF1 protein from the plasmid-borne constitutive GPD promoter. To maximize small molecule uptake and retention, this strain was further modified by deleting the genes encoding the drug efflux pumps, Pdr5 and Snq2, as well as the gene encoding Erg6, an enzyme involved in ergosterol biosynthesis, which increases the permeability of small molecules through the plasma membrane, to create strain DNY75 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Emter1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Hirata1">[39]</xref>.</p>
<p>Strain DNY75 was grown to mid-log phase in galactose-containing medium to drive expression of yeast HSF and then shifted to dextrose-containing medium to extinguish expression of yeast HSF, rendering growth entirely dependent on the activation of human HSF1. Cells were seeded at low density to 96-well microtiter dishes and incubated with either DMSO solvent or an aliquot of a small molecule library. A nonbiased chemical library of over 10,000 compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-WinterVann1">[40]</xref>, built on approximately 70 scaffold structures, was screened at a final concentration of 10 ÂµM for their ability to activate HSF1-dependent growth over a 4-d period at 30Â°C, as assayed spectrophotometrically. Positive hits from the primary screen were retested in two subsequent screens at the same concentration. Two benzyl pyrazole-based molecules, which we have named HSF1A and HSF1C (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000291.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), were potent activators of human HSF1-depenent yeast growth (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000291.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). Because HSF1A was among the most potent activators of human HSF1-dependent yeast growth identified in our assay, it was chosen for further investigation.</p>
<p>HSF1A was synthesized de novo to independently confirm its ability to activate human HSF1-dependent yeast cell growth. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, HSF1A, but not DMSO solvent, stimulated HSF1-dependent growth for strain DNY75. HSF1A was unable to support growth of a <italic>yhsf</italic>Î yeast strain in the absence of human HSF1, confirming that HSF1A functions in an HSF1-dependent manner to support yeast cell growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Because the inability of HSF1 to complement the viability defect of <italic>yhsf</italic>Î cells is due to defective HSF1 multimerization in yeast, cross-linking experiments were conducted to ascertain whether HSF1A promotes increased HSF1 multimerization in yeast. Although HSF1 multimers were not detected in lysates from cells treated with DMSO, HSF1 homotrimerization is detected when yeast cells were treated with HSF1A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). The constitutive trimerization of the HSF1LZ4m protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Liu1">[37]</xref> was also further increased after HSF1A exposure, consistent with the observation that HSF1A also enhances LZ4m-dependent yeast growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g001">Figure 1F</xref>).</p>

<title>HSF1A Coordinately Activates Protein Chaperone Expression in Mammalian Cells</title>
<p>HSF1A stimulates human HSF1 multimerization in yeast and activates human HSF1-dependent yeast cell growth. To test whether HSF1A is able to activate HSF1 in mammalian cells, wild-type and <italic>hsf1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> mouse embryonic fibroblasts (MEFs) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-McMillan1">[41]</xref> were incubated in the presence of DMSO solvent or increasing concentrations of HSF1A and the expression of two protein chaperones, Hsp70 and Hsp25, assessed by immunoblotting. Although DMSO did not enhance protein chaperone expression, treatment of wild-type MEFs with HSF1A resulted in the activation of Hsp70 and Hsp25 in a dose-dependent manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). HSF1A-dependent activation of Hsp70 and Hsp25 was not detected in <italic>hsf1<sup>â/â</sup></italic> cells, demonstrating that HSF1A functions in the activation of mammalian protein chaperones through HSF1.

<title>HSF1A Promotes HSF1 Nuclear Localization and Hyperphosphorylation</title>
<p>Previous studies demonstrated that in response to proteotoxic stress mammalian HSF1 is activated in a multistep process that involves multimerization, nuclear accumulation, hyperphosphorylation, and DNA binding to promoter HSEs to activate protein chaperone gene expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Wu1">[19]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Pirkkala1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Morimoto1">[28]</xref>. To gain insights into how HSF1A promotes HSF1 activation, the subcellular localization and phosphorylation status of HSF1 was assessed in MEFs treated with HSF1A. Although under control conditions the majority of HSF1 was localized to the cytoplasmic fraction with the Cu, Zn superoxide dismutase control, within 2 h after HSF1A treatment, additional HSF1 was found in the nuclear fraction (c-fos as control), and by 6 h and beyond, the majority of HSF1 was nuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). As previously established, an acute heat shock for 2 h resulted in the HSF1 being nearly quantitatively nuclear. HSF1 that was accumulated in the nucleus in response to HSF1A treatment had a reduced electrophoretic mobility in SDS-PAGE as compared to that found in the cytosolic fraction, consistent with possible hyperphosphorylation that is observed to occur in response to an acute heat shock <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Sorger1">[42]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Sorger2">[43]</xref>. To explore whether HSF1A treatment results in HSF1 hyperphosphorylation, extracts were prepared from both HSF1A-treated and heat-shocked cells in the presence or absence of protein phosphatase inhibitors. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, extracts from cells incubated with HSF1A or subjected to a 42Â°C heat shock and prepared in the presence of phosphatase inhibitors showed an HSF1A-dependent reduction in electrophoretic mobility that was not present when extracts were prepared in the absence of phosphatase inhibitors. These results are consistent with HSF1A stimulating HSF1 phosphorylation. Although the phosphatase inhibitor-dependent shift in HSF1 electrophoretic mobility was not as dramatic as that for heat shock treatment, HSF1 phosphorylation occurred in response to both treatments in parallel with expression of the HSF1 target, Hsp70 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g003">Figure 3B</xref>).</p>

<p>(A) HSF1<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were treated with 80 ÂµM HSF1A for the indicated time in hours or heat shocked at 42Â°C for 2 h, and nuclear and cytoplasmic fractions were analyzed for HSF1 by immunoblotting. c-fos and SOD1 serve as nuclear (N) and cytoplasmic (C) markers, respectively. (B) HSF1<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were treated with HSF1A for 6 h or 9 h or heat shocked at 42Â°C for 2 h in the presence (+) or absence (â) of phosphatase inhibitors (INHIB). (C) HSF1<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were pretreated with 250 ÂµM DTT for 1 h prior to the addition of 80 ÂµM HSF1A for 15 h or a 2-h heat shock at 42Â°C followed by a 15-h recovery. For comparison purposes, the heat-shocked samples are shown at a lower exposure than the HSF1A-treated samples. (D) HSF1<sup>+/+</sup> MEFs were treated with either DMSO or HSF1A (30, 50, or 80 ÂµM) for 15 h at 37Â°C. For synergistic activation of Hsp70 expression, wild-type MEFs were treated with either DMSO or HSF1A (30, 50, or 80 ÂµM) for 1 h at 37Â°C prior to a 1-h heat shock at 40Â°C followed by a 15-h recovery period at 37Â°C. For control purposes, Hsp70 expression following a 1-h heat shock at 42Â°C, and a 15-h recovery is shown. SOD1 serves as the protein loading control.</p>

<p>Previous reports have demonstrated that heat shockâ or oxidative stressâmediated activation of HSF1 in vivo or in vitro can be abrogated by treatment with reducing agents such as DTT <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Huang1">[44]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Ahn1">[45]</xref>. Although HSF1A-mediated activation of human HSF1-dependent yeast cells growth is not inhibited by DTT (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000291.s004">Figure S4</xref>), the ability of DTT to inhibit HSF1 activation by HSF1A was tested in mammalian cells. DTT strongly inhibited heat shock-induced expression of Hsp70, but had no inhibitory effect on HSF1A-dependent activation of Hsp70 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). These observations provide additional evidence that HSF1A activates HSF1 in a manner that is mechanistically distinct from a proteotoxic stress.</p>
<p>Previous reports suggest that conditions or small molecules that activate or coactivate HSF1 can act synergistically with heat stress in enhancing protein chaperone expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Westerheide1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Lee1">[46]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Vigh1">[47]</xref>. The ability of HSF1A to activate protein chaperone expression at subthreshold HSF1A concentrations, in combination with subthreshold temperatures, was assessed by immunoblotting. HSF1A concentrations insufficient to activate HSF1 at 37Â°C (30 ÂµM and 50 ÂµM) were evaluated at a mild temperature increase (40Â°C). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g003">Figure 3D</xref>, although 30 ÂµM and 50 ÂµM HSF1A are insufficient to activate Hsp70 expression at 37Â°C, 80 ÂµM HSF1A significantly activated Hsp70 expression at this temperature. Moreover, a 1-h heat shock at 42Â°C, but not 40Â°C, followed by a 15-h recovery, was able to activate Hsp70 expression. However, MEFs treated with 30 ÂµM or 50 ÂµM HSF1A for 1 h prior to a 1-h heat shock at 40Â°C strongly activated Hsp70 expression, and expression in response to 80 ÂµM HSF1A was higher at 42Â°C. Taken together, these observations indicate that low concentrations of HSF1A can function in concert with modest temperature increases to elevate expression levels of mammalian chaperone proteins.</p>

In this model, exon 1 of human <italic>Huntingtin</italic> (htt) containing 74 glutamines fused to green fluorescent protein (GFP) (httQ74-GFP) is expressed in rat phaeochromocytoma (PC12) cells, a rat neuronal precursor cell line, via a doxycycline-inducible promoter. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, HSF1A promoted Hsp70 expression in PC12 cells, detectable by immunoblotting, at 25 ÂµM, a concentration almost 3-fold lower than that required to detect Hsp70 expression by immunoblotting in MEF cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). In addition, ELISA analysis showed that chronic exposure of PC12 cells to HSF1A at concentrations less than 25 ÂµM promoted Hsp70 activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000291.s003">Figure S3</xref>). To ascertain whether HSF1A pretreatment could ameliorate protein aggregation, cells were pretreated for 15 h with either DMSO or 10 ÂµM HSF1A prior to a 48-h induction of httQ74-GFP expression. HttQ74-GFP aggregates, which are resistant to SDS solubilization, were fractionated from soluble proteins by centrifugation, and both soluble and insoluble protein fractions assayed for abundance of the httQ74-GFP by solubilization with urea-SDS, followed by immunoblotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). Extracts from cells pretreated with DMSO displayed approximately 50% of the HttQ74-GFP protein in the insoluble fraction. However, significantly less httQ74-GFP was detected in the insoluble fraction when PC12 cells were pretreated with 10 ÂµM HSF1A prior to the induction of httQ74-GFP, suggesting that HSF1A can reduce the aggregation potential of this polyQ protein. Moreover, as previously reported, microscopic evaluation demonstrated that overexpression of httQ74-GFP resulted in the formation of large protein aggregates in approximately 80% of these cells, and this was observed when the cells were pretreated with DMSO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g004">Figure 4C</xref>). However, when this neuronal precursor cell line was pretreated for 15 h with 10 ÂµM HSF1A before httQ74-GFP expression, most cells showed diffuse, pan-cellular GFP staining and the absence of visible protein aggregates. Quantification of these results, by counting the number of cell containing aggregates as a function of the total number of cells, revealed that at HSF1A concentrations as low as 2 ÂµM, a reduced number of aggregate-containing cells were observed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g004">Figure 4D</xref>). The fraction of cells containing aggregates continued to decrease in a dose-dependent manner such that pretreatment with 12 ÂµM HSF1A resulted in â¼20% of the cells exhibiting aggregates visible by fluorescence microscopy. When PC12 cells were treated with HSF1A after protein aggregates had formed, no reduction in aggregate abundance was observed (unpublished data), supporting the notion that the protein chaperones induced by HSF1A treatment act on the oligomeric precursors rather than the larger aggregates.</p>

<title>HSF1A Does Not Bind Hsp90</title>
<p>Previous studies suggest that Hsp90 and additional cochaperones exist in a heteroprotein complex that, in addition to their central role in cellular signaling, function to repress HSF1 in the absence of stress. In response to proteotoxic stress or pharmacological inhibitors of Hsp90, this complex dissociates, resulting in the multimerization of HSF1 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Zou1">[23]</xref>. As such, we reasoned that the inability of human HSF1 to be activated in yeast might stem from a repressive interaction between yeast Hsp90 and human HSF1 and that HSF1A promotes HSF1 activation in yeast by disrupting this interaction. To test this hypothesis, the efficacy of the potent Hsp90 inhibitors geldanamycin and radicicol, in promoting human HSF1-dependent yeast growth was evaluated. Exposure to either 10 ÂµM geldanamycin or 10 ÂµM radicicol for 3 h activated expression of the yeast HSF-dependent <italic>SSA3-lacZ</italic> reporter gene, reflective of their previously established function as Hsp90 inhibitors in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Piper1">[55]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000291.s006">Figure S6</xref>).

As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g006">Figure 6B</xref>, the high-affinity Hsp90 inhibitor 17-AAG was able to compete with GD-B for Hsp90 binding at 1 ÂµM and 10 ÂµM.

Furthermore, HSF1A-B did not interact with Hsp90 or the cochaperones Cdc37, Hop, p23, or Hsp70, nor HSF1 itself in pull-down experiments with mammalian cell extracts (unpublished data). Given that geldanamycin and radicicol cannot promote human HSF1-dependent yeast growth and that HSF1A does not interact with Hsp90, together these data strongly suggest that HSF1A is not acting as an Hsp90 inhibitor in activating HSF1 in yeast or mammalian cells.</p>

To test whether HSF1A promotes the accumulation of unfolded proteins, we assessed the ability of HSF1A to activate the <italic>SSA3</italic>-<italic>LacZ</italic> reporter gene in yeast since its activation is dependent on the stress-induced activation of yeast HSF in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Boorstein1">[59]</xref>. Although a 3-h heat shock at 39Â°C activated expression of the <italic>SSA3-lacZ</italic> reporter gene, no activation of this reporter was detected after treatment with 20 ÂµM HSF1A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000291.s008">Figure S8</xref>), a concentration sufficient to promote human HSF1-dependent growth in strain DNY75 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000291-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). The inability of HSF1A to activate yeast HSF strongly suggests that HSF1A does not promote human HSF1 activation in yeast by promoting the accumulation of unfolded proteins but instead acts on structures or regulatory mechanisms unique to human HSF1, potentially through modulation of the TRiC complex. In support of this notion, human HSF1 is not activated in yeast by several compounds that enhance protein chaperone expression in yeast and mammalian cells by promoting the accumulation of damaged and misfolded proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Westerheide2">[60]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000291.s009">Figure S9</xref>).</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>Here, we describe a novel humanized yeast high-throughput screen for the identification of small molecule activators of human HSF1. Utilizing this screen, we have identified HSF1A, a molecule capable of promoting human HSF1-dependent yeast cell growth, HSF1 multimerization in yeast, as well as HSF1-dependent protein chaperone expression in mammalian cell culture and in fruit flies. Human HSF1 is normally activated by cellular stress conditions that cause proteotoxicity through protein damage. As such, previous screens for small molecule activators of HSF1 in mammalian cells have identified molecules that elevate protein chaperone expression through the imposition of proteotoxic stress conditions, such as direct protein thiol oxidation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Trott1">[34]</xref>, thereby disrupting protein homeostasis and resulting in protein damage. In addition, since HSF1 is repressed through an interaction with Hsp90, small molecule inhibitors of Hsp90 are often identified as HSF1-activating molecules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Hieronymus1">[33]</xref>.</p>
<p>Although the precise mechanism by which HSF1A activates human HSF1 is not yet understood, several observations suggest that HSF1A does not activate HSF1 through the inhibition of Hsp90 activity nor through the imposition of a proteotoxic stress. The inability of well-established inhibitors of both mammalian and yeast Hsp90, geldanamycin and radicicol, to promote HSF1-dependent yeast growth suggests that HSF1A is promoting HSF1 activation in yeast independent of Hsp90 inhibition. This is confirmed by our data showing that HSF1A does not bind to Hsp90 and does not efficiently compete with geldanamycin for Hsp90 binding. In addition, HSF1A was not able to promote yeast HSF activation, also thought to be repressed by Hsp90 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Duina1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Nadeau1">[62]</xref>. Moreover, unlike the sensitivity of acute heat shock or celastrol treatment to DTT, HSF1A activation of HSF1 was not inhibited by this exogenous thiol reductant, suggesting that HSF1A does not promote HSF1 activation by inducing thiol oxidation and protein damage.</p>
<p>Interestingly, our data show that HSF1A interacts with the TRiC/CCT complex in both yeast and mammalian cell extracts, though it remains unclear whether this interaction is direct or indirect. In addition, it remains unclear whether or not HSF1A affects TRiC activity. To date, no known role for TRiC in HSF1 regulation has been described. As such, further investigation is required to ascertain whether HSF1A modulates TRiC activity and how this might impinge on HSF1 activation. Interestingly, TRiC chaperone activity was recently shown to be a potent negative regulator of polyQ protein aggregation and cytotoxicity in yeast and mammalian systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Kitamura1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Tam1">[63]</xref>. Since HSF1A similarly ameliorated polyQ aggregation and cytotoxicity, our data are consistent with a model in which HSF1A might act as a positive regulator of TRiC activity.</p>
<p>Strong evidence in cellular and animal model systems of neurodegenerative diseases associated with protein misfolding support the idea that protein chaperones act to ameliorate the biochemical and neurodegenerative phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Fujimoto1">[5]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Bailey1">[13]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Kitamura1">[48]</xref>. Although elevated expression of Hsp70 or Hsp40 can significantly suppress protein aggregation, coexpression of the two chaperones can synergize the suppression of protein aggregation, enhance protein solubility, and ameliorate neuronal loss as a consequence of polyQ protein or Î±-synuclein expression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Chan1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Muchowski1">[9]</xref>. Moreover, a constitutively active form of HSF1 suppressed polyQ aggregation in cultured cells and in mice, and enhanced the longevity of a mouse model of polyQ-based Huntington disease <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Fujimoto1">[5]</xref>. Given that HSF1 coordinately activates the expression of multiple protein chaperones and other cytoprotective genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Hahn1">[64]</xref>â<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Trinklein1">[67]</xref>, HSF1 activation could be of potential therapeutic value in neurodegenerative diseases associated with a wide array of manifestations of protein misfolding.</p>
<p>Here, we demonstrate in cultured neuronal precursor cells, and in a fruit fly model of polyQ disease, that HSF1A can suppress the aggregation of a polyQ protein and cytotoxicity associated with polyQ expression. Interestingly, in both the cell culture and fly polyQ model, the concentration of HSF1A required to reduce cytotoxicity is significantly less than the concentration required for maximum Hsp70 expression. Similar results have been described for the Hsp90 inhibitor geldanamycin, which was able to rescue cell viability in a <italic>Drosophila</italic> model of Parkinson disease at concentrations significantly lower than that required to induce Hsp70 expression maximally <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Auluck2">[52]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Auluck3">[68]</xref>. Together, these results suggest that relatively small yet chronic increases in protein chaperone expression are sufficient to significantly stabilize misfolded polyQ proteins and thereby reduce cytotoxicity. It is also possible that low levels of HSF1A reduce the threshold of HSF1 activation in response to the accumulation of unfolded proteins at physiological temperatures. This hypothesis is supported by our results demonstrating that HSF1A can reduce the temperature threshold required for HSF1 activation. Previous studies have shown that misfolded polyQ proteins are turned over by autophagy and ubiquitin-dependent proteosomal degradation and that protein chaperones can impinge on both processes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Bilen1">[69]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Ravikumar1">[70]</xref>. In addition, HSF1 and protein chaperones have been suggested to be potentiators of oncogenic transformation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Dai1">[71]</xref>. Although we do not yet fully understand whether HSF1A-mediated protein chaperone expression affects these processes, these hypotheses are currently under investigation. Given the broad range of protein chaperone functions, the humanized yeast-based screening results described here present a new avenue for the identification of new classes of small molecules that could have therapeutic efficacy, via potentially distinct mechanisms, in neurodegenerative diseases caused by protein conformational disorders.</p>

<title>Yeast Screen for Human HSF1 Activators</title>
<p>To screen for small molecule activators of human HSF1 in yeast, we generated yeast strain DNY75 that expresses yeast HSF under control of the galactose-inducible and glucose-repressible <italic>GAL1</italic> promoter and human HSF1 under the control of the constitutive GPD promoter. Yeast cultures were grown overnight to mid-log phase in SC-URA-TRP media containing 2% raffinose and 0.01% galactose. Cultures were reinoculated to an optical density at 600 nm (OD<sub>600</sub>)â=â0.0005 in SC-URA-TRP containing 4% dextrose to extinguish expression of yeast HSF. Using a Beckman Biomek FX robot, 200 Âµl of the yeast culture were pipetted into each well of a 96-well plate and supplemented with compounds (10 ÂµM final concentration) from a combinatorial compound library (PPD Discovery) containing 10,440 compounds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-WinterVann1">[40]</xref> or DMSO as solvent at the same final percent volume. Cells were incubated at 30Â°C for 4 d and their growth monitored spectrophotometrically at OD<sub>600</sub> using a Spectra Max 384 plate reader (Molecular Devices). Chemicals promoting yeast cell growth were selected from the library and further validated in two additional rounds of screening. In total, we identified 33 positive-hit molecules (0.32% hit rate) able to promote human HSF1-dependent yeast growth. Growth curve experiments were carried out in 96-well plates. Data shown for all growth curves are averages of four independent experiments with associated standard deviations. High-throughput screening (HTS) assays are usually assessed for their suitability using a statistical Zâ²-factor by comparing positive and negative controls <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000291-Zhang2">[72]</xref>. However, during the development of this assay, we were unable to calculate a Zâ²-factor to assess this assay since a positive control molecule able to promote human HSF1-dependent growth in yeast was unavailable. Upon the identification of HSF1A, we reassessed the Zâ²-factor using the formula Zâ²â=â1â[(3Ï<sub>c+</sub>+3Ï<sub>câ</sub>)/(|Î¼<sub>c+</sub>âÎ¼<sub>câ</sub>|)], where Ïâ=âstandard deviation, Î¼â=âmean, c+â=âHSF1A, and cââ=âDMSO of the growth rate of the yeast culture between day 1 to day 4. The Zâ²-factor was calculated to be 0.51, indicating that this assay is appropriate for further HTS studies.</p>
