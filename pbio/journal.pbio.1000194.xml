<p>The enzyme phospholipase A2 (cPLA<sub>2</sub>α) is involved in the formation of intercisternal tubules that mediate transport of proteins within the Golgi complex.</p>
</abstract><abstract>
<p>The organization of intra-Golgi trafficking and the nature of the transport intermediates involved (e.g., vesicles, tubules, or tubular continuities) remain incompletely understood. It was recently shown that successive cisternae in the Golgi stack are interconnected by membrane tubules that form during the arrival of transport carriers from the endoplasmic reticulum. Here, we examine the mechanisms of generation and the function of these tubules. In principle, tubule formation might depend on several protein- and/or lipid-based mechanisms. Among the latter, we have studied the phospholipase A<sub>2</sub> (PLA<sub>2</sub>)-mediated generation of wedge-shaped lysolipids, with the resulting local positive membrane curvature. We show that the arrival of cargo at the Golgi complex induces the recruitment of Group IVA Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent, cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>α) onto the Golgi complex itself, and that this cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is required for the formation of the traffic-dependent intercisternal tubules and for intra-Golgi transport. In contrast, silencing of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α has no inhibitory effects on peri-Golgi vesicles. These findings identify cPLA<sub>2</sub>α as the first component of the machinery that is responsible for the formation of intercisternal tubular continuities and support a role for these continuities in transport through the Golgi complex.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>After their synthesis in the endoplasmic reticulum (ER), cargo proteins move to the Golgi complex. This unique structure comprises numerous compact stacks of cisternae that are laterally interconnected into the Golgi “ribbon” through tubular-reticular networks (“non-compact zones” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rambourg1">[1]</xref>). Cargo proteins then traverse the Golgi cisternal subcompartments (where they are glycosylated), and at the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi face they are sorted and delivered to their further destinations via large tubular/pleiomorphic carriers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Hirschberg1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Polishchuk3">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>Despite significant advances in recent years, important aspects of the organization of intra-Golgi trafficking remain unclear. Three main intra-Golgi transport models have been traditionally considered for higher eukaryotes: trafficking by anterograde vesicles <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rothman1">[7]</xref>, trafficking by compartment maturation-progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bonfanti1">[8]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Weiss1">[11]</xref>, and trafficking by diffusion via tubular continuities joining different Golgi cisternae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Clermont1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>. Among these, the cisternal progression model has recently gained broad consensus, although the nature of the intermediates involved in this mechanism (vesicles or intercisternal tubules) remains unclear. In addition, more recently, a new model has been proposed by which cargo molecules mix rapidly throughout the stack (compatible with cargo diffusion via intercisternal continuities) and then partition into specialized export domains before leaving the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Patterson1">[19]</xref>.</p>
<p>Thus far, intra-Golgi transport models, the last, diffusion via tubular continuities, has received the least attention <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Clermont1">[12]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh1">[17]</xref>, and even the very existence of intercisternal tubules has long remained an issue of debate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rabouille1">[20]</xref>. The main reasons for this uncertainty have probably been the technical difficulties of detecting the convoluted structures of the intercisternal tubules by traditional electron microscopy (EM) and the traffic-related dynamics of these tubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">[21]</xref>. Over the last few years, however, tomography studies have indicated that tubules can be shown to join successive Golgi cisternae in animal cells, and that they form specifically under conditions of active trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh1">[17]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">[21]</xref>. Thus, although intercisternal tubules have still not been completely characterized (for instance, quantitative data on their frequency remain scarce <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-ViveroSalmeron1">[22]</xref>), they can be considered as potential players in intra-Golgi trafficking. It is therefore of interest to understand and manipulate their molecular mechanisms of formation.</p>
<p>The formation of an intercisternal tubule is likely to depend on several molecular events, including mechanical deformation by specialized proteins and changes in the distribution/geometry of the lipids within the membrane bilayer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Antonny1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref>. These latter can be induced in several ways, including the formation of local spontaneous positive membrane curvature via the generation of lysolipids and fatty acids by PLA<sub>2</sub> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rigoni1">[25]</xref>. Indeed, a role for PLA<sub>2</sub> in membrane shaping has been suggested in vitro <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Staneva1">[26]</xref>, as well as in a series of in vivo studies that have indicated that chemical blockers of PLA<sub>2</sub> suppress tubule formation in several endomembrane compartments and inhibit the related trafficking steps (see Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref> for review).</p>
<p>Here, we show that transport through the Golgi complex coincides with the rapid recruitment of a specific molecular PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform onto Golgi membranes: Group IVA, Ca<sup>2+</sup>-dependent cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> (cPLA<sub>2</sub>α). The activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is required for the formation of intercisternal connections in the Golgi. In addition, we show that treatments that inhibit cPLA<sub>2</sub>α and suppress intercisternal tubule formation also block intra-Golgi trafficking of several cargo proteins. These data identify cPLA<sub>2</sub>α as a component of the machinery underlying intercisternal tubular continuities and support a role for these continuities in intra-Golgi transport.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2">
<title>Results</title>
<p>As indicated above, PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors have been reported to suppress membranous tubules that extend from different cellular compartments, including the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo2">[29]</xref>. We thus sought to identify the Golgi-associated PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform that might serve as the molecular target of these inhibitors and might be involved in the regulation of Golgi-associated tubular structures. The superfamily of PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes consists of 15 groups comprising secretory and cytosolic enzymes, with the latter divided into Ca<sup>2+</sup>-sensitive (cPLA<sub>2</sub>s, or Group IV PLA<sub>2</sub>s) and Ca<sup>2+</sup>-insensitive (Group VI, VII, and VIII PLA<sub>2</sub>s) isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Schaloske1">[30]</xref>. Among those that are Ca<sup>2+</sup> sensitive, one of the Group IV isoforms, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α, that is normally cytosolic has been reported to associate preferentially with the Golgi complex upon moderate increases in cytosolic Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans1">[31]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Shirai1">[34]</xref>. This affinity for Golgi membranes prompted us to examine whether cPLA<sub>2</sub>α might itself be involved in intercisternal tubule formation and intra-Golgi trafficking.</p>

<title>Traffic Induces Binding of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to the Golgi Complex in a Ca<sup>2+</sup>-Dependent Fashion</title>
<p>Initially, we asked whether cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is recruited to the Golgi complex during activation of transport through this organelle. We first generated a procollagen-I (PC-I) traffic pulse in human fibroblasts (HFs) using the 40–32°C transport synchronization protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bonfanti1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">[35]</xref>. During the 40°C block, PC-I was diffusely distributed in the ER and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α was mostly cytosolic (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). After releasing the block, PC-I reached the Golgi complex, where its levels continued to increase for 30 min (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). At the same time, remarkably, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α was partially recruited to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This cPLA<sub>2</sub>α increase on the Golgi complex lasted for at least 30 min. Similar experiments were carried out using the same 40–32°C transport synchronization protocol <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">[35]</xref> in other cell types (HeLa and MDCK cells) with the temperature sensitive mutant of the vesicular somatitis virus glycoprotein (VSVG) as cargo, a well-characterized trafficking marker <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">[35]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bergmann1">[36]</xref>. VSVG can be expressed by either transfecting or infecting cells with vesicular somatitis virus (VSV). In both cases, the generation of a traffic pulse induced the recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1F and 1G</xref>), as seen with PC-I. We further examined the distribution of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α in the Golgi by immuno-EM. We fixed VSV-infected cells expressing cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP both during the 40°C block and after releasing the block, and labelled the cells with an anti-GFP antibody (ab). Most of the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP was dispersed in the cytosol during the 40°C traffic block, with very few gold particles on the ER and the Golgi complex. In contrast, the cells fixed 30 min after releasing the block (i.e., during a traffic wave) showed significant amounts of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP at the rims of the Golgi cisternae and on rim-associated tubules (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1H–1J</xref>). Some cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP labelling was still seen in the cytosol and at low levels in the ER, but not on other intracellular membranes. Notably, this distribution is consistent with an action of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α in the formation of tubules from cisternal rims (see below).</p>

<title>cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is recruited to Golgi membranes upon arrival of cargo from the ER.</title>
<p>(A, B) HFs were incubated for 3 h at 40°C (A) and then shifted to 32°C for 30 min in the presence of ascorbic acid (B), or HFs (C) and HepG2 cells (D) were grown under steady-state conditions. After fixing, the cells were double labelled with antibodies against PC-I and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α and examined under the confocal microscope. (A) When PC-I was trapped in the ER after the 40°C block, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α enrichment was not detected in the Golgi area. (B) Arrival of PC-I at the Golgi complex after release of the temperature block induced cPLA<sub>2</sub>α binding to the Golgi complex. (C, D) Under steady-state conditions, the cells were fixed, labelled with antibodies against cPLA<sub>2</sub>α and either PC-I (C) or giantin (D). Confocal microscopy reveals that here some cPLA<sub>2</sub>α can be seen in the Golgi area together with PC-I (C) and giantin (D). (E) Fluorescence intensity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α in the Golgi region (defined as giantin-positive area) was quantified and normalized to cPLA<sub>2</sub>α intensity in the cytosol of HFs. Plot shows that Golgi/cytosol ratio of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α (mean±SD; <italic>n</italic> = 20 cells) decreases in cells subjected to 40°C transport block, but increases over the levels detected at steady-state conditions upon block release (at 32°C). (F, G) HeLa cells were infected with VSV and kept at 40°C for 3 h to accumulate VSVG in the ER. The cells were then fixed (F) or shifted to 32°C for 30 min to allow VSVG to exit from the ER (G), and prepared for confocal microscopy. Immunofluorescence labelling shows a diffuse pattern of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α when VSVG is blocked in the ER (F). In contrast, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α undergoes recruitment to the Golgi membranes as soon as VSVG arrives at the Golgi complex from the ER (G). (H) HeLa cells were transfected with cDNA encoding full length cPLA<sub>2</sub>α fused with GFP (cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP), infected with VSVG, and subjected to the 40°C block. The cells were then fixed 30 min after the 40°C block release, to allow VSVG to reach the Golgi complex, and processed for immuno-gold EM with an anti-GFP ab, to reveal cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP localization. After activation of VSVG transport, a cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP signal was detected at the rims of the Golgi cisternae and flanking tubular structures (arrows). (I, J) Quantification of gold labelling (mean±SD; <italic>n</italic> = 30 stacks) at the Golgi complex (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) shows most of the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP is bound to the tubular profiles (I) and the rims of the cisternae (J). (K, L) HeLa cells were co-transfected with the cDNAs encoding VSVG-YFP and the C2 domain of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α fused with GFP (C2-GFP), kept at 40°C for 3 h (K), and observed in vivo under the confocal microscope during VSVG-YFP release from the ER. Images extracted from the time-lapse sequence show that C2-GFP moves from the cytosol (K) to the Golgi membranes (L) when VSVG appears within the Golgi area. (M) HeLa cells were transfected and incubated as above (K, L), and then observed under the confocal microscope and fixed during VSVG release when detectable amounts of C2-GFP started to appear in the perinuclear area. Further staining with anti-giantin antibodies reveals overlap of C2-GFP perinuclear signal with giantin labelling (arrows). Scale bar, 7 µm (A–D, F, G), 160 nm (H), 9 µm (K–M).</p>

<p>To verify that this cPLA<sub>2</sub>α recruitment to the Golgi complex was due solely to changes in membrane transport rather than to the temperature changes required for inducing and releasing the trafficking block, we infected HeLa cells with VSV (as above) and then treated cells for 2 h with cycloheximide at 40°C (to deplete the cells of cargo and thus reduce transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>). Under these conditions, the temperature shift from 40°C to 32°C did not induce any significant changes in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α localization (unpublished data).</p>
<p>We next investigated whether recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to the Golgi complex could be seen also under physiological steady-state trafficking conditions, rather than only during traffic waves. Indeed, HFs showed detectable levels of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α recruitment to the Golgi complex also at steady-state (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Moreover, when PC-I transport was inhibited using the 40°C temperature block, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α lost its association with the Golgi complex, and when trafficking resumed at 32°C, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α “rebounded” to high levels on the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Quantification of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α levels on the Golgi under these conditions is shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1E</xref>. Recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to the Golgi at steady-state was detected also in other cell types (HeLa, MDCK, and HepG2). In particular, in liver hepatoma HepG2 cells, which are professional secretor cells that release up to 20 different soluble serum proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Knowles1">[37]</xref>, the Golgi showed relatively high PLA<sub>2</sub> levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Thus, collectively, these data indicate that both “pulsed” and steady-state trafficking through the Golgi complex induces the association of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α with the Golgi membranes.</p>
<p>What is the mechanism of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α recruitment to the Golgi complex? The binding of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to membranes has been shown to be due both to the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-binding C2 domain and to the catalytic domain of this protein. The C2 domain is required for initiating membrane association, in a process that depends exclusively on the intracellular Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentration ([Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>) and has thus been proposed to function as a calcium sensor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">[32]</xref>, while the catalytic domain prolongs this membrane binding of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α even after the [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub> has returned to lower levels <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">[32]</xref>. We monitored the in vivo dynamics of the calcium-sensor C2 domain of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α fused with GFP (C2-GFP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">[32]</xref>) during the 40–32°C traffic pulse. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1K</xref> shows that C2-GFP had a diffuse cytosolic pattern when most of the cargo protein (VSVG-YFP) was arrested in the ER. However, as soon as VSVG started to concentrate within the Golgi complex after the release of the traffic block (after 150–250 s), a significant portion of C2-GFP moved from the cytosol to the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g001">Figure 1L and 1M</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s007">Video S1</xref>), and then gradually returned to the cytosol. Under the same conditions, the full-length cPLA<sub>2</sub>α protein shifted to the Golgi complex and remained there for over 30 min (see above). This behaviour of C2-GFP and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP suggests that the trafficking induces a transient increase in [Ca<sup>2+</sup>]<sub>i</sub>, which in turn initiates cPLA<sub>2</sub>α recruitment to the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">[32]</xref>, an interaction that would then be prolonged by the catalytic portion of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α. While this increase remains to be further defined and clarified, it could be related to the high lumenal Ca<sup>2+</sup> concentrations in the Golgi complex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pinton1">[38]</xref> and the localization in the Golgi area of the signalling machinery that is involved in the release of Ca<sup>2+</sup> from intracellular stores <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pinton1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Wilson1">[39]</xref>. Thus, the specific recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to the Golgi complex can be explained by a local traffic-induced Ca<sup>2+</sup> release from the Golgi complex and probably, additionally, by an intrinsic affinity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α for the Golgi (possibly due to its affinity for lipids and proteins that are enriched in Golgi membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Nakatani1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pettus1">[42]</xref>). Potentially related to this, Ca<sup>2+</sup> released from the Golgi cisternae has been shown to be required for intra-Golgi transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Porat1">[43]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, traffic moving through the Golgi complex triggers the recruitment of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to the rims of the Golgi cisternae, possibly through a signalling mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pulvirenti1">[44]</xref> that might induce the local Ca<sup>2+</sup> increase that is required for cPLA<sub>2</sub>α binding to membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans2">[32]</xref>.</p>

<title>Inhibiting cPLA<sub>2</sub>α Reduces Inter-Cisternal Tubules and Suppresses Intra-Golgi Transport</title>
<p>We next examined whether cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is involved in the formation of intercisternal tubules. Tubules can interconnect the stacked Golgi cisternae in at least two ways: tubular non-compact zones can join adjacent stacks “longitudinally,” to form the continuous Golgi ribbon <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rambourg1">[1]</xref>, and tubules can link the Golgi cisternae in the <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> (“vertical”) direction within the same stack, as shown by EM tomography and stereoscopy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Clermont1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">[21]</xref>. To examine the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α here, we sought to inhibit/deplete cPLA<sub>2</sub>α by a variety of approaches, while monitoring the presence/formation of Golgi tubules. HeLa cells were first exposed to siRNAs directed against cPLA<sub>2</sub>α. This resulted in a decrease in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α levels, as evaluated by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2A and 2B</xref>), western blotting (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activity assays under basal and elevated Ca<sup>2+</sup> conditions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2D</xref>). In these cells, growth was partially inhibited (50%–70%) in the last 24 h of exposure to the siRNAs; however, cell viability did not appear to be affected. In these cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells, the Golgi ribbon was disassembled into numerous fragments that remained perinuclear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, asterisks, 2F), as has been previously described upon application of PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo2">[29]</xref>. EM showed that this was due to a suppression of the longitudinal tubular elements (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2G–2I</xref>) of the non-compact zones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rambourg1">[1]</xref>, which resulted in the breakdown of the Golgi ribbon into separate stacks (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2H</xref>). We then investigated whether this cPLA<sub>2</sub>α deficit also affects vertical intercisternal connections, which are presumably more relevant to <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> transport, using EM tomography (which is required to fully reconstruct these tubular structures <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">[21]</xref>). This showed that tubules connecting different cisternae were present within individual Golgi stacks in these cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g003">Figure 3A and 3B</xref>, arrows; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s008">Video S</xref>2; see also below), as has been previously reported for other cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>, and that these tubules were almost completely suppressed by RNA interference (RNAi) of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g003">Figure 3C and 3D</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s009">Video S3</xref>). Other tools that specifically inhibit cPLA<sub>2</sub>α had similar effects: both microinjection of an ab against the catalytic domain of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α (see below) and treatment with the selective inhibitors of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α catalytic activity pyrrophenone and pyrrolidine (not shown) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ono1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mariggio1">[46]</xref> induced a significant fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon corresponding to a reduction in the tubular structures at the EM level (not shown). Of note, the tubules in the non-compact zones and the vertical intercisternal continuities always responded in the same way to a cPLA<sub>2</sub>α deficit, suggesting that they both depend on the activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α. Instead, other intracellular tubular structures (such as those of endosomal origin, for example) were not affected by cPLA<sub>2</sub>α depletion (not shown).</p>

<p>We also examined the effects of enhancing the levels of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α by its overexpression. Remarkably, this treatment caused an overall increase in the Golgi tubular elements that was sometimes accompanied by a partial loss of the stack structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2J</xref>), further supporting the concept that PLA<sub>2</sub>α promotes Golgi tubulation.</p>
<p>A further point was whether the tubulating effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α arise from the formation of lysolipids, which can create positive membrane curvature directly <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref>, or whether they are mediated by the formation of arachidonic-acid (AA) metabolites, perhaps via their signalling function. To test the latter possibility, we used chemical inhibitors to block the main metabolic enzymes of AA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Needleman1">[47]</xref>, the cyclooxygenases (using 50 µm indomethacin and 5 µm ibuprofen for 30 min) and the lipoxygenases (using 10 µm ketokenazol for 30 min). These agents had no influence on Golgi tubule formation (unpublished data), consistent with previously reported observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo1">[28]</xref>. Moreover, the addition of AA to cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells did not counteract the “anti-tubular” effects of the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α deficit. Altogether, these data suggest that cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is required to support tubulation and that its effects are mediated via the formation of lysolipids <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Rigoni1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo1">[28]</xref>.</p>
<p>We thus turned to investigate whether disassembly of intercisternal connections affects transport of cargo proteins across the Golgi complex. To test this, we first suppressed intercisternal connections by silencing cPLA<sub>2</sub>α, and then monitored the effects of this treatment on intra-Golgi transport using the VSVG-synchronized transport assay. We thus infected cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-depleted cells with VSV and accumulated VSVG in the ER at 40°C, and then we released the traffic block at 32°C. VSVG reached the Golgi complex apparently normally, but then it accumulated at the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi pole (also inducing a moderate swelling of the <italic>cis</italic> cisternae) and did not proceed through the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g004">Figure 4A–4E</xref>). Compatible results were obtained using biochemical transport assays (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g004">Figure 4F and 4G</xref>). Rescuing the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activity in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells by microinjection of recombinant cPLA<sub>2</sub>α resulted in the reactivation of VSVG trafficking (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g004">Figure 4H</xref>). Further along this line, an arrest of VSVG in the Golgi complex was seen also when the cells were transfected with a dominant-negative cPLA<sub>2</sub>α mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Atsumi1">[48]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g004">Figure 4I</xref>), and when cPLA<sub>2</sub>α was acutely inhibited by the microinjection of antibodies against the catalytic portion of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g005">Figure 5</xref>) or by specific inhibitors (not shown). Notably, these inhibitory effects were marked but not complete (up to 60%–80%; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g004">Figure 4</xref>), possibly explaining the lack of visible toxicity (at least within our experimental time frame).</p>

<p>(A–E) Control (A, B, D) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated HeLa cells (A, C, E) were infected with VSV and kept at 40°C for 3 h to accumulate VSVG within the ER. The cells were fixed directly at the end of the block (A) or after a 60-min (A) or 45-min (B–E) temperature shift to 32°C. (A) The cells were labelled with an anti-VSVG ab, showing that after accumulation within the ER, VSVG was efficiently exported to the plasma membrane in control cells and blocked in the Golgi complex in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells. (B–E) The cells were triple labelled with anti-VSVG, anti-cPLA<sub>2</sub>α, and anti-TGN46 antibodies (B, C) or prepared for immuno-EM using the nanogold protocol (D, E). In control cells, VSVG showed good colocalization with TGN46 in the Golgi area (B, inset); this colocalization was poor in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells (C, inset). In control cells, EM showed little VSVG in the <italic>cis</italic> portion of the stack (7.8%), with most (61%) within <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi compartments (D, arrows), post-Golgi carriers (D, filled arrowhead), and at the plasma membrane (D, empty arrowhead). In cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells, most of the VSVG (62%) remained within the swollen <italic>cis</italic> portion of the stack (E, arrows). (F, G) Control and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated HeLa cells infected with VSV were metabolically labelled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine and chased at 32°C. At the indicated times, the cells were solubilized and digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo-H), which cleaves sugar chains built on the proteins early in the secretory pathway (i.e., before their processing by the medial Golgi enzyme mannosidase-II, which convert sugars into an Endo-H resistant form). The cell lysates were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels scanned (F). The percentages of the Endo-H-resistant form of VSVG with respect to the total amounts of VSVG were quantified (G) using a FUJIFILM imager. The data indicate that VSVG processing to its Endo-H resistant form (which occurs in the medial Golgi) was reduced when cPLA<sub>2</sub>α was silenced. (H) cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells were infected with VSV, microinjected with recombinant cPLA<sub>2</sub>α during the 40°C block, and fixed 45 min after the block release at 32°C. The cells were then stained with anti-VSVG and anti-cPLA<sub>2</sub>α antibodies and observed under the confocal microscope. VSVG was delivered to the plasma membrane after cPLA<sub>2</sub>α microinjection (arrows) but remained in the Golgi in noninjected cells (asterisks). (I) HeLa cells were transfected with VSVG-GFP and the dominant-negative cPLA<sub>2</sub>α(1–522) isoform, subjected to a 40°C block, and fixed 45 min after the temperature shift to 32°C. Confocal images reveal VSVG-GFP blocked in the Golgi complex in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α(1–522)-expressing cells (asterisks).

<p>A possible concern here is that these experiments were carried out using a synchronization protocol that involves the sudden arrival of a large cargo load at the Golgi complex, raising the possibility that cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-dependent connections might have a role only under conditions of Golgi overload. We therefore examined whether the inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α would cause similar effects during more “physiological” non-synchronized trafficking. To this end, we infected cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells with VSV and kept them at 32°C, to allow VSVG to continuously exit the ER. As was seen during the 40–32°C synchronized pulse, VSVG reached the Golgi complex but did not traverse it (see below), indicating that the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α in intra-Golgi trafficking is not limited to conditions of cargo overload.</p>
<p>The transport of other cargo proteins was also examined using cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing. Ablation of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α in HFs resulted in a strong delay of PC-I transport at the level of the Golgi complex (unpublished data). The use of cyclooxygenase and lipooxygenase inhibitors had no effects on trafficking, and AA addition did not reverse the transport block in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells, again in parallel with the above effects on Golgi tubules. Thus, the induction of a cPLA<sub>2</sub>α deficit and the attendant disassembly of intercisternal connections appear to be associated with the inhibition of intra-Golgi trafficking of different classes of cargo proteins.</p>
<p>A further question is which type of connection is required for trafficking. Our data indicate that the inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α disrupts the “vertical” (<italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic>) and “longitudinal” (inter-stack) tubular connections equally (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figures 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g003">3</xref>). Thus, although it may appear logical to assume that the vertical connections are those relevant for transport, a role for the longitudinal connections cannot be formally excluded by the above data. To resolve this issue, we used a Golgi system that contains vertical, but lacks horizontal, connections, and tested whether transport through such a system is sensitive to the ablation of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α. A Golgi complex with only vertical connections can be generated by nocodazol (NZ) treatment, which results in the fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon into isolated (non-horizontally connected) stacks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>. Any transport-relevant role of longitudinal connections can be excluded in this system. Control and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-deficient cells were subjected to 3 h of 30 µM NZ treatment and processed for EM tomography. As expected, vertical connections were revealed in stacks of control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g006">Figure 6A</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s010">Video S4</xref>), while in silenced cells, these connections were almost absent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g006">Figure 6B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s011">Video S5</xref>). To test the efficiency of transport under these conditions, the cells were infected with VSVG and exposed to NZ during the 40°C block, and then shifted to 32°C to activate transport. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g006">Figure 6C</xref> shows that in control cells, VSVG moved to the plasma membrane first through GM130-positive and then through TGN46-positive compartments of the Golgi stacks, as has been previously reported <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>. In contrast, in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells, VSVG was retained in the Golgi stacks, where it showed strong overlap with the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker (GM130) even 60 min after release from the ER (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Thus, the disruption of vertical intercisternal bridges by cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing inhibited the progression of cargo across NZ-induced isolated stacks, which are devoid of horizontal connections. This provides evidence that it is the intercisternal connections of the vertical type that are required for intra-Golgi transport (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>The Catalytic Activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α Is Required to Support Intra-Golgi Transport</title>
<p>Our experiments with specific cPLA<sub>2</sub> chemical inhibitors (see above) taken together with already published observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref> suggest that the changes in lipid geometry during Golgi tubulation require PLA<sub>2</sub> catalytic activity.

<p>We first tested whether cPLA<sub>2</sub>α maintains its ability to bind to the Golgi complex in the presence of chemical inhibitors that suppress intra-Golgi transport. VSV-infected HeLa cells were treated with pyrrolidine, and the localization of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α was monitored during a VSVG traffic pulse. cPLA<sub>2</sub>α translocated to the Golgi complex to the same extent in control and inhibitor-treated cells, but only the latter showed VSVG retention at the Golgi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7A and 7B</xref>). Second, we examined the effects of two cPLA<sub>2</sub>α mutants, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>(1–522)</sup> and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>S228C</sup>, which lack PLA<sub>2</sub> catalytic activity and yet show normal binding to membranes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Atsumi1">[48]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Huang1">[51]</xref>. cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>(1–522)</sup> is a deletion mutant that lacks an amino acid (Asp549) essential for enzyme activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Pickard1">[52]</xref>.

The cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>S228C</sup> mutant contains a single point mutation in the active site, again resulting in a complete loss of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α enzymatic activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Huang1">[51]</xref>.</p>

<title>The catalytic activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is required to support intra-Golgi transport.</title>
<p>(A, B) HeLa cells were co-transfected with cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP and VSVG-Cherry and exposed to the 40°C block to accumulate VSVG-Cherry within the ER. Pyrrolidine (1 µM; Pyr) was added to the cells (B) 15 min before block release. Then cells were shifted to 32°C in the absence (A) or in the presence (B) of pyrrolidine for 45 min, fixed, and investigated under confocal microscopy. In control cells, VSVG-Cherry was detected at the cell surface (A) and its delivery to the PM was inhibited in pyrrolidine-treated cells (B) ,while cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP recruitment to the Golgi membranes was not affected by inhibitor treatment (compare A and B). (C–G) Control (C) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced (D–G) mouse MC3T3 cells were transfected with VSVG-Cherry alone (C, D) or in combination with the following human cPLA<sub>2</sub>α constructs: cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP (E), cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>(1–522)</sup> (F), cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>S228C</sup> (G). The cells were subjected to 40°C block, then shifted to 32°C (to activate VSVG-Cherry exit from the ER) for 45 min, fixed, and stained with an anti-cPLA<sub>2</sub>α ab. Confocal microscopy revealed efficient delivery of VSVG-Cherry to the PM in control cells (C), while in silenced cells, most of the VSVG-Cherry remained within the fragmented Golgi complex (D). Transfection of wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-GFP rescued VSVG-Cherry delivery to the cell surface in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells, while expression of the catalytically inactive mutants cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>(1–522)</sup> (F) or cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>S228C</sup> (G) did not reactivate VSVG-Cherry transport. (H) PCCL3 cells were loaded with [<sup>3</sup>H]-AA (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Part of the loaded cells was infected with VSV. Then infected and noninfected (control) cells were exposed to the 40°C block, washed, and shifted to 32°C. Fresh medium was added to the cells for 3 min time intervals and then collected. The [<sup>3</sup>H]-AA released into the medium over each 3 min-long interval was measured (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Quantification of the AA release (mean±SD; <italic>n</italic> = 6 experiments) revealed increase of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity (with the peak at 15 min) in VSV infected cells as compared to control. (I–L) HeLa cells were loaded with bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and fixed directly (I) or 15 min after incubation with either 5 µM ionomycin (J) or 1 µM pyrrolidine (K). The fluorescent signal indicating PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was detected by confocal microscopy both in the perinuclear region and the periphery of control cells (I). This signal increased after ionomycin treatment (J), but decreased after pyrrolidine addition (K), as also revealed by quantification (L) of the mean fluorescence per cell (mean±SD; <italic>n</italic> = 20 cells). (M, O) HeLa cells were infected with VSV, kept at 40°C for 3 h, and loaded with bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC at the end of 40°C block. The cells were then fixed directly at the end of the 40°C incubation (M) or at different time intervals after temperature shift to 32°C (N, O). The cells were then stained with antibodies against VSVG and GM130 (Golgi marker). Confocal microscopy revealed only moderate PLA<sub>2</sub> activity overlapping with the Golgi when VSVG resided within the ER (M) while activation of VSVG transport through the Golgi (15 min after release from the ER) induced an increase in the BODIPY signal in the Golgi area (N). Quantification of the mean BODIPY fluorescence per cell (mean±SD; <italic>n</italic> = 20 cells) indicates an increase in PLA<sub>2</sub> activity in cells actively transporting VSVG, as compared to uninfected (control) cells (O).

<p>Each mutant was transfected into cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells and compared to wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub>α for its ability to rescue the transport block induced by cPLA<sub>2</sub>α ablation and to translocate to the Golgi complex. For the transport experiments, mouse cells were transfected with VSVG carrying a red fluorescent tag (VSVG-Cherry) and subjected to the transport-synchronization protocol. VSVG-Cherry was efficiently delivered to the surface in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7C</xref>) but not in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells, as expected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7D</xref>). The cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells were then transfected with either the mutants or the wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub>α. While the latter efficiently rescued VSVG-Cherry transport to the cell surface (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7E</xref>), as expected, neither cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>(1–522)</sup> nor cPLA<sub>2</sub>α<sup>S228C</sup> modified the transport block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7F and 7G</xref>). However, both cPLA<sub>2</sub>α mutants translocated to the Golgi complex as efficiently as wild-type cPLA<sub>2</sub>α (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7F and 7G</xref>). Therefore, these collective results indicate that the catalytic activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α, rather than the ability of this enzyme to translocate to Golgi membranes, is required to support transport across the Golgi complex.</p>
<p>Finally, we sought to directly monitor the increase in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activation that based on the above data should occur during cargo trafficking through the Golgi complex. First, we used a classical PLA<sub>2</sub> activity assay based on the release of [<sup>3</sup>H]-AA from AA-prelabelled cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ghosh1">[53]</xref>. A potential problem here is that during cargo trafficking, only a fraction of the total cellular cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is bound to the Golgi complex (which represents, in turn, less than 5% of the cellular membranes). Thus, the increase in AA release over basal values might be very small. To overcome these problems, we used two approaches.</p>
<p>For the first, in addition to HeLa cells, we used a cell line that has been previously characterized in our laboratory to be an efficient AA releaser (PCCL3 cells) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mariggio1">[46]</xref>. Both cell types were loaded with [<sup>3</sup>H]-AA, infected with VSV, and subjected to a 40–32°C transport synchronization protocol. When they were shifted from 40°C to the permissive temperature of 32°C, the VSVG expressing PCCL3 cells showed a modest but statistically significant increase in AA release over that seen in control cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7H</xref>). This increase coincided in time with VSVG transit through the Golgi complex. HeLa cells showed a trend in the same direction, which, however, was not statistically significant. To overcome this difficulty with HeLa cells, we used here a second approach based on the fluorogenic phosphatidylcholine analogue (bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC) as a sensor of local changes in PLA<sub>2</sub> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Farber1">[54]</xref>. The hydrolysis of this lipid by PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes results in generation of fluorescent products by fluorescence dequenching <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Farber1">[54]</xref>. After loading the bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC, HeLa cells at steady-state showed a diffuse (ER-like) fluorescent signal in the cell periphery (indicating ongoing PLA<sub>2</sub> activity), and a clearer signal in the perinuclear (Golgi) area (as assessed by confocal microscopy, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7I</xref>). In control experiments, the application of the calcium ionophore ionomycin, which strongly stimulates cPLA<sub>2</sub>α <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Evans1">[31]</xref>, markedly increased this signal both at the cell periphery and in the perinuclear region, while the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α inhibitor pyrrolidine reduced overall BODIPY fluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7J–7L</xref>), indicating that the probe functions as expected under our conditions. Then, the cells were exposed to the 40–32°C VSVG synchronized traffic pulse. During the 40°C block (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7M</xref>) the cells did not show any significant concentrating of fluorescence signal in the Golgi area (consistent with the lack of transport through the Golgi and of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α recruitment). When the traffic block was released, the fluorescence signal increased selectively in the Golgi area, to nearly 2-fold the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g007">Figure 7N and 7O</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, taken together, the AA release and the microscopy data suggest that the catalytic activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α increases during the passage of cargo through the Golgi complex and that this activity is required for transport across the Golgi stack.</p>
</sec><sec id="s2d">
<title>Suppression of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α Activity Does Not Inhibit Golgi Vesicle Formation</title>
<p>A series of control experiments was then carried out. In the first, we asked whether the inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α activity might have an effect on the Golgi COPI vesicles. We thus inhibited/depleted cells of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α and examined the features of the Golgi vesicles as well as on the dynamics of the COPI machinery in these cells. cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing affects neither the number nor the morphology of Golgi vesicles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2H and 2I</xref>). We also blocked vesicle fusion with their target membranes and monitored the kinetics of vesicle accumulation as an indicator of the rate of vesicle formation. This was achieved via inhibition of αSNAP (one of the main membrane fusion factors) by incubating permeabilized cells with an L294A αSNAP mutant that blocks fusion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Barnard1">[55]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Kweon1">[56]</xref>. L294A αSNAP induced an accumulation of Golgi vesicles, as expected. This accumulation was the same in the absence and presence of the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α inhibitor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s001">Figure S1A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s001">S1E</xref>). Also, the machinery responsible for COPI vesicle formation was not affected by the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α inhibitor, as judged by the COPI and ARF1 dynamics of association with Golgi membranes in live cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s001">Figure S1F</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s001">S1K</xref>). Finally, we looked at the effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing on a known COPI-vesicle-dependent trafficking step: the recycling of the KDEL receptor (KDELR) from the Golgi complex to the ER. For this, we used a well-characterized assay based on a KDELR-VSVG chimera <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Cole1">[57]</xref>. This assay indicated that the KDELR recycles from the Golgi complex to the ER equally well in control and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells (see below, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">S2D</xref>), again indicating that the COPI machinery is not inhibited by a cPLA<sub>2</sub>α deficit.</p>
<p>Thus, treatments that block cPLA<sub>2</sub>α suppress the formation of intercisternal tubules while having no apparent inhibitory effects on Golgi-associated COPI vesicles (which presumably rely mostly on coat proteins for their curvature; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Antonny1">[23]</xref>).</p>
</sec><sec id="s2e">
<title>Specificity of the Effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α Inhibition on Different Trafficking Steps</title>
<p>We also examined the specificity of the effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α on several transport steps. Since cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is recruited selectively to the Golgi complex upon activation of transport and its inactivation selectively suppresses Golgi tubule formation, its effects on trafficking should be restricted to the Golgi complex. In contrast, some relatively nonspecific inhibitors of many PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms used previously, such as ONO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Banga1">[58]</xref>, have been reported to block transport at multiple segments of the exocytic and endocytic transport pathways that rely on tubular transport intermediates (reviewed in Brown et al. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref>). To address this apparent discrepancy, we compared the effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α RNAi and of pyrrophenone with those reported for ONO <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo1">[28]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo2">[29]</xref>.</p>
<p>First, we examined the effects of silencing cPLA<sub>2</sub>α on several transport steps. These included retrograde transport of the KDELR from the Golgi complex to the ER (as above; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">Figure S2A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">S2D</xref>) plus endocytosis and recycling of transferrin to the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">Figure S2E and S2F</xref>), and endocytosis of wheat-germ agglutinin lectin uptake and its transport to the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi network (TGN) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">Figure S2G and S2H</xref>). None of these steps was affected by cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing. We also examined the TGN-to-plasma-membrane transport of VSVG after a 20°C transport block (at this temperature, VSVG is arrested and accumulates both in the TGN and in the medial-<italic>trans</italic> Golgi cisternae <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Polishchuk2">[4]</xref>). When the 20°C block was released in inhibitor-treated cells, a large fraction of VSVG reached the plasma membrane normally (presumably from the TGN), while the remaining fraction (presumably residing in the medial-<italic>trans</italic> cisternae) remained trapped in the Golgi complex (not shown), consistent with an effect of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing on intra-Golgi trafficking (see above) and with a lack of effect on TGN-to-plasma-membrane transport. Also, transport from the ER to the Golgi was not affected by cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing, as shown above (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Furthermore, the labelling of different proteins that reside in the endocytic compartments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">Figure S2I</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">S2L</xref>) or at the ER/Golgi interface (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">Figure S2M</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s002">S2P</xref>) showed no significant changes after this specific cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing. Thus, these data confirm the selectivity of the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α role in intra-Golgi trafficking.</p>
<p>We then compared the above effects with those of ONO, a relatively nonspecific drug that inhibits several PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref>. ONO inhibited the transport of VSVG (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s003">Figure S3A</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s003">S3F, S3K</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s003">S3L</xref>) and PC-I (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s003">Figure S3G</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s003">S3J</xref>). Moreover, ONO induced the structural changes expected of PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibition; namely, fragmentation of the Golgi ribbon (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s004">Figure S4A and S4B</xref>) and suppression of Golgi-associated tubular elements (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s004">Figure S4C</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s004">S4E</xref>), including intercisternal connections (as revealed by EM tomography) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s004">Figure S4F and S4G</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s012">Videos S6</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s013">S7</xref>). These effects were reversible, as ONO wash-out resulted in a rapid reappearance of bridges connecting cisternae within the stack (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s004">Figure S4H</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s004">S4K</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s014">Video S8</xref>), which coincided with reactivation of transport through the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s003">Figure S3M</xref>–<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s003">S3O</xref>). These effects mimic those due to cPLA<sub>2</sub>α inhibition; however, in addition to these, ONO had effects that were not seen in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-silenced cells, including the suppression of tubular structures in transferrin-containing early endosomes (not shown). Moreover, ONO has been shown by others to suppress the recycling of transferrin from the endosomes to the plasma-membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo3">[59]</xref>, as well as retrograde transport from the Golgi complex back to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo4">[60]</xref>. It is possible that as an inhibitor of many PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms, ONO has generalized effects on different membrane tubules because these depend on activities of different PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref>, while cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is Golgi specific (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Discussion</xref>).</p>

<title>Other PLA<sub>2</sub> Enzymes Support Trafficking in Cells Derived from cPLA<sub>2</sub>α Knock-Out (KO) Mice</title>
<p>An apparent difficulty in this study is that cPLA<sub>2</sub>α KO mice show reduced fertility but, surprisingly, no other major phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bonventre1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Nagase1">[62]</xref>. We examined whether cells obtained from these mice show transport abnormalities. To test this, immortalized lung fibroblasts (IMLFs) from cPLA<sub>2</sub>α KO mice (IMLFs<sup>−/−</sup>) or control mice (IMLFs<sup>+/+</sup>) were infected with VSV and subjected to the 40–32°C transport synchronization protocol (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s005">Figure S5</xref>). No significant differences in VSVG transport were detected between IMLFs<sup>+/+</sup> and IMLFs<sup>−/−</sup> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s005">Figure S5A, S5C, S5E, S5G</xref>), except that while intra-Golgi transport in IMLFs from control mice showed the expected inhibition in the presence of the specific cPLA<sub>2</sub>α inhibitor pyrrophenone, the IMLFs from KO mice were insensitive (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s005">Figure S5B, S5D, S5F</xref>, and S5H). This suggests that the latter cells had developed an adaptive mechanism to compensate for the loss of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α (and, incidentally, confirms the specificity of pyrrophenone). We considered the possibility that this mechanism might be based on other PLA<sub>2</sub>s. To verify this, we used siRNAs to screen for the roles of all of the cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> proteins from Groups IV, VI, VII, and VIII of the PLA<sub>2</sub> superfamily <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Schaloske1">[30]</xref> in VSVG transport in these cPLA<sub>2</sub>α KO cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8</xref>). The efficiency of siRNA delivery was checked with fluorescent siGLO. Among these siRNAs, only those silencing the Ca<sup>2+</sup>-independent Group VIIIA (GVIIIA)-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibited VSVG transport, resulting in accumulation of cargo within the Golgi complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8L and 8P</xref>). Strikingly, this PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform has been detected by others at the Golgi membranes and appears to be important for maintenance of the tubular elements of the Golgi complex (W. Brown, personal communication). We also characterized the effects of the GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> ablation in IMLFs<sup>−/−</sup> and saw clear similarities with the effects of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing in “normal” cells. The Golgi remained perinuclear, but the ribbon underwent fragmentation (i.e., it exhibited numerous breaks; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8P</xref>), presumably due to the loss of the tubular elements connecting cisternae. VSVG reached the Golgi complex normally, but to a large extent remained trapped in the Golgi complex, where it showed substantial overlap with the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi marker GM130 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8P</xref>) (i.e., it remained in the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi) and showed a marked delay of protein progression across the stack. It is thus likely that GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> is responsible for compensating for the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α deficit in KO cells (or animals) and for supporting transport through the Golgi complex in these cells.</p>

<title>GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibits transport of VSVG in immortalized murine lung fibroblasts from cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-KO mice.</title>
<p>(A–P) IMLFs from cPLA<sub>2</sub>α KO mice (IMLFs<sup>−/−</sup>) were incubated with siRNAs specific for the different cytosolic PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes, and control siRNAs, for 72 h (A–P; as indicated). The cells were then infected with VSV, kept at 40°C for 3 h to accumulate VSVG in the ER, and incubated in fresh medium at 32°C for 60 min before fixing. The fixed cells were either stained with only an anti-VSVG ab (A–O) or double labelled for VSVG and GM130 (P). VSVG was efficiently exported to the plasma membrane in cells incubated with either control (O) or most of the PLA<sub>2</sub>-isoform-specific siRNAs (A–K, M–O). However, RNAi of GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> induced accumulation of VSVG within the Golgi complex of IMLFs (L). Notably, VSVG always overlapped strongly with GM130 (see inset in P) in cells incubated with GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub>-specific siRNAs, suggesting that VSVG is trapped within the <italic>cis</italic>-Golgi compartment. (R) IMLF<sup>−/−</sup> and control lung fibroblasts from mice expressing cPLA<sub>2</sub>α (IMLFs<sup>+/+</sup>) were incubated with siRNAs specific for either cPLA<sub>2</sub>α or GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> and control siRNAs for 72 h. The cells were then infected with VSV, subjected to the 40°C block with its further release for 60 min and fixed. VSVG was detected at the surface of IMLFs<sup>−/−</sup> and IMLFs<sup>+/+</sup> using an ab against its ectodomain. Afterwards, the cells were permeabilized and incubated again with an anti-VSVG ab to reveal the total pool of VSVG within the cell. Then fluorescense intensities of surface and total VSVG were evaluated, expressed as a ratio, and normalized to the control.

<title>VSVG transport efficiency in HeLa cells after depletion of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α and/or GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub>.</title>
<p>HeLa cells were incubated with control siRNAs or siRNAs specific for cPLA<sub>2</sub>α, GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub>, or both for 72 h. (A) Cells exposed to these siRNAs were infected with VSV and kept for 6 h at 32°C to allow continuous synthesis and transport of VSVG through the secretory pathway (“steady-state” conditions). Then the cells were fixed and VSVG at the cell surface was stained with an ab against its ectodomain. Afterwards, the cells were permeabilized and incubated again with an anti-VSVG ab to reveal the total pool of VSVG within the cell. Scale bar, 10 µm. (B) Cells were treated as in A or subjected to the 40°C block and then shifted to the permissive temperature of 32°C for 60 min (“traffic wave” conditions), fixed, and labelled for surface and total VSVG as described above. Then the fluorescence intensities of surface and total VSVG were evaluated, expressed as a ratio, and normalized to the control. This quantification reveals that under both “steady-state” and “traffic-wave” conditions, cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing inhibits VSVG transport much more strongly than GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> depletion (see also images in panel A). RNAi of both PLA<sub>2</sub> enzymes, in turn, shows a slightly stronger inhibitory effect on VSVG transport over cPLA<sub>2</sub>α silencing alone. (C) Cells incubated with different siRNAs (as described above) were subjected to western blotting with antibodies against either cPLA<sub>2</sub>α or GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> or GAPDH, as indicated.</p>

<p>Notably, these experiments were carried out under conditions of both synchronized (high load) and non-synchronized (low load) trafficking with similar results. Also notably, the traffic inhibition was marked (up to 80%), but not complete, even in double KD cells. This could be due either to incomplete silencing or to some further compensatory effects, or also to the presence of redundant transport mechanisms. As a consequence, silenced cells can survive, although their rate of growth was significantly decreased (by 60%–80%) in the last 24 h with the siRNAs, probably reflecting this inhibition of their secretory trafficking.</p>
<p>Altogether, these observations indicate that cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is the main regulator of transport across the Golgi complex under different conditions of cargo load. GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> has a minor role in intra-Golgi transport when cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is normally expressed, but appears to be able to compensate for the lack of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α to support trafficking in cPLA<sub>2</sub>α KO mice.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has become clear in recent years that cells have at their disposal a vast repertoire of protein-based and lipid-based mechanisms for the bending of their membranes. The former, which have been more extensively characterized, include coat proteins such as clathrin, COPI and COPII complexes, as well as BAR proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Antonny1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-McMahon1">[50]</xref>, while the lipids include substrates and products of phospholipases, acyltransferases, phospholipid transfer proteins, and flippases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-McMahon1">[50]</xref>. The main finding in this study is that in the Golgi complex, a specific PLA<sub>2</sub> isoform, namely Group IV cPLA<sub>2</sub>α, is required for the formation of the intercisternal tubules that appear to be involved in intra-Golgi trafficking.</p>
<p>The simplest explanation for the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α in Golgi tubulation is that this enzyme can induce the rapid accumulation of wedge-like lysolipids at the cisternal rims, resulting in a local increase in spontaneous positive membrane curvature, and hence in tubulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g010">Figure 10</xref>). In addition to curvature, the generation of an intercisternal tubular continuity presumably requires the assembly of the fusion machinery at the tip of the budding tubule, for its connecting with a neighbouring cisterna. This, in turn, is likely to involve the formation of an ARF/COPI coat to recruit these fusion proteins into this bud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Cosson1">[63]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Schindler1">[64]</xref>. Therefore, a simple model that fits our observations is that the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-generated lysolipids help to create and stabilize the curvature of the necks of COPI buds. This might prevent the fission of such buds into vesicles, allowing these buds to dock and fuse with the next cisternae, creating an intercisternal continuity. It is also possible that the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-generated lysolipids favour the elongation of buds into tubules, as suggested by the observation that overexpression of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α induces tubulation of the stack structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g002">Figure 2J</xref>). Notably, for these events to occur, diffusion of the lysolipids away from their site of synthesis should be limited by a diffusion barrier at the Golgi rims (perhaps similar to the molecular fences described at the plasma membrane <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ritchie1">[65]</xref>). This fence-like role could involve the COPI coat that resides at the rims of the cisternae. Future studies will elucidate these further components of the tubulation machinery. As noted, the inhibition of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α and the attendant abrogation of the tubules are associated with the arrest of transit through the Golgi complex, indicating that the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-dependent intra-Golgi tubules are involved in trafficking. Interestingly, a similar association between intra-Golgi tubules and traffic has been reported for the effects of dicumarol. This drug is an activator of the fission-inducing protein CtBP1/BARS, and it suppresses horizontal Golgi tubules (and thus, presumably, also the vertical intercisternal tubules, which, however, were not directly examined) and inhibits intra-Golgi trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov3">[66]</xref>. Thus, suppressing the tubules appears to result in the arrest of trafficking independently of the molecular mechanisms that underlie tubule disruption.</p>

<p>How do cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-dependent tubules support intra-Golgi trafficking, and which are the tubules—longitudinal or vertical—that are involved in intra-Golgi transport? The simplest hypothesis is that Golgi tubules allow the intercisternal diffusion of molecules crucial for trafficking. Both vertical and longitudinal tubular elements are cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-dependent. The former are much less abundant; however, since traffic requires movement along the <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> (i.e., vertical) axis, they must be functionally crucial (as also supported by investigations in NZ-treated cells). Moreover, while relatively infrequent and difficult to detect <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-ViveroSalmeron1">[22]</xref>, vertical tubules have the potential to be a very efficient means of intra-Golgi transit due to the great speed of diffusion over short distances (microns in the Golgi complex). Thus, very few vertical tubules per stack can be sufficient to achieve rapid diffusion between the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> compartments of the Golgi complex (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s006">Figure S6</xref>). This may be the case even when the connections are fewer than those required for complete intra-stack connectivity. For instance, in the Golgi ribbon, where stacks are connected to each other by horizontal membrane bridges, gaps in one stack might be compensated for by connections in neighbouring stacks (in this sense, also horizontal tubules may contribute to <italic>cis</italic>-<italic>trans</italic> diffusion; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Connections might be transient; here, again, very few connections need to be present in a stack at any given time to support intra-Golgi diffusion if they rapidly open and close between cisternae (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1000194.s006">Figure S6</xref>). Given the above, the question arises as to the role of intercisternal diffusion in intra-Golgi trafficking of cargo proteins that cross the Golgi by cisternal maturation/progression, such as PC-I and VSVG <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mironov2">[35]</xref>. The simplest hypothesis is that these tubules allow retrograde movement of Golgi membranes and resident proteins (e.g., enzymes), which is required for maturation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Marsh2">[21]</xref>. According to this scheme (also discussed elsewhere <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Trucco1">[18]</xref>), during cisternal progression, the Golgi enzymes diffuse through the intercisternal continuities and explore the Golgi space, where they partition according to their physico-chemical properties into those cisternae that have their most favourable composition. This partitioning is driven by a physico-chemical gradient that is maintained across the stack at all times, possibly by the input of compositionally different intermediate compartment membrane into the <italic>cis</italic> cisternae and of endosomal membrane into the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi. Thus, the arrival of intermediate compartment membranes at the <italic>cis</italic> pole (accompanied by consumption at the <italic>trans</italic>) promotes both enzyme backflow and cisternal progression (above), resulting in the synchronization of these two events and the maintenance of Golgi polarity. Clearly, this model requires more work to fully test it experimentally, but at this stage, it provides a logical explanation of the observations. At the same time, it should be noted that while our data point to a crucial role for tubules, complementary transport mechanisms cannot be excluded. For instance, if Golgi tubules indeed arise from the stabilization of COPI vesicles, as proposed above, it is possible that trafficking might switch between vesicular <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Malsam1">[67]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Tu1">[68]</xref> and connection-mediated modes, with one or the other mechanism prevailing, depending on the cell type and the functional state.</p>
<p>How “general” is the requirement for cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-dependent tubules in trafficking? Our findings show that the role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α, is very specific for intra-Golgi tubular structures and trafficking. However, other (non-Golgi) tubulation-dependent transport steps have been reported to be blocked by PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitors. For instance, ONO (a rather nonspecific inhibitor of many PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms) has been shown by us and others to also suppress non-Golgi tubules and to block non-Golgi transport steps that appear to be dependent on tubular intermediates, including endosome-to-plasma-membrane recycling of transferrin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo3">[59]</xref> and retrograde transport from the Golgi complex to the ER <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo4">[60]</xref>. It is thus possible that these transport steps <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo3">[59]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo4">[60]</xref> are regulated by other PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms that are located in the different organelles. For instance, cPLA<sub>2</sub>β and cPLA<sub>2</sub>ε have been reported to be located to the early <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ghosh2">[69]</xref> and late <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ohto1">[70]</xref> endocytic compartments, respectively, and may be involved in the regulation of specific steps of endocytosis that are carried out via tubular carriers and that require PLA<sub>2</sub> activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-deFigueiredo3">[59]</xref>. If this is the case, then the PLA<sub>2</sub> family in general (through different PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms), rather than cPLA<sub>2</sub>α itself, could underlie a membrane-bending mechanism based on the induction of spontaneous membrane curvature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref> that is involved in tubulation and trafficking at the different levels of cellular membranes in mammals <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Brown1">[27]</xref>. A further observation that is most probably related to these considerations is that mice knocked out for cPLA<sub>2</sub>α have reduced fertility, but do not show any other major phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Bonventre1">[61]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Nagase1">[62]</xref>, and that secretory transport and Golgi morphology in IMLFs obtained from KO mice <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Ghosh3">[71]</xref> are normal. This appears to be because cPLA<sub>2</sub>α in KO cells is functionally replaced by GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1000194-g008">Figure 8</xref>). GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> also partially localizes at the Golgi complex, where it appears to control tubulation processes (W. Brown, personal communication). Whether the mechanisms of action of this enzyme in trafficking are similar to those of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α is unclear at this time. At the mechanistic level, the properties of GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> are not well defined in vivo. Although GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> has been shown to have specificity in vitro towards PAF-like lipids, its endogenous substrates remain unknown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Arai1">[72]</xref>. Thus, the precise metabolic reactions by which GVIIIA-PLA<sub>2</sub> supports tubulation remain to be determined.</p>
<p>In conclusion, the activity of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α appears to be an important mechanism for the formation of Golgi tubules in mammalian cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Zimmerberg1">[24]</xref>. For other tubulation events (in other organelles or cell types), as noted, this role of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α might be taken on by other PLA<sub>2</sub> isoforms or even other phospholipases (yeast). Nevertheless, the identification of cPLA<sub>2</sub>α as a player in Golgi tubulation is a key finding, in that it reveals that generation of lysolipids is an important event in the formation of cellular tubules, and it should open the way towards the unravelling of further components of the tubulation machinery. It is now important to elucidate the mode of action of the intercisternal tubular connections and to define their underlying molecular machinery as well as the relationships of these tubules with other key players in intra-Golgi trafficking <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Mellman2">[73]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1000194-Short1">[74]</xref>.</p>

<p>Visualization of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity in HeLa cells was performed using 1,2-bis-(4,4-difluoro-5,7- dimethyl-4-bora-3a, 4a-diaza-<italic>s</italic>indacene-3-undecanoyl)-<italic>sn</italic>-glycero-3-phosphocholine, which is known also as bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC. Liposomes containing bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC were prepared according to the manufacture instructions and incubated with VSV-infected HeLa cells 1 h prior to the release of the 40°C block. The cells were fixed at the end of the 40°C block or at different time intervals after the temperature shift to 32°C; they were then immunolabelled for VSVG and GM130 and examined under confocal microscopy. The intensity of the fluorescent signals derived from bis-BODIPY FL C<sub>11</sub>-PC hydrolysis was quantified in the Golgi area using the LSM 3.2 software.</p>

<p><bold>Inhibition of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity does not affect the dynamics of Golgi-associated vesicles and the ARF/COP machinery.</bold> (A–E) Control (A, C) and ONO-treated (B, D) HeLa cells were permeabilised with streptolysin O and incubated with rat brain cytosol containing 5 µM ONO (B, D) and the L294A αSNAP mutant (C, D). The permeabilized cells were then fixed and prepared for EM. L294A αSNAP induced the accumulation of vesicles near the stacks in both control (C, arrowheads) and ONO-treated (D, arrowheads) cells. Some stacks were greatly vesiculated (C, D, arrows). (E) Quantification of the round profiles associated with the Golgi stacks in samples treated as indicated in A–D. The PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor ONO did not induce an increase in the number of Golgi-associated vesicles and did not affect the accumulation of Golgi vesicles in cells treated with the L294A αSNAP mutant. (F–H) HeLa cells were transfected with an Arf1-GFP construct and observed under confocal microscopy, and Arf1-GFP was bleached within a small area of the Golgi (outlined by boxes in G, H). The quantification of the GFP signal (F) and the time-lapse images in the absence (G) and the presence (H) of 5 µM ONO reveal a recovery of the fluorescent signal within the bleached areas at the same rate in both control and ONO-treated cells, indicating that the PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor ONO did not affect Arf1 turnover at the Golgi complex. (I–K) HeLa cells were incubated either with 5 µM ONO for 30 min (I) or with 10 µg/ml BFA for 15 min (J); alternatively, they were first treated with 5 µM ONO for 30 min, and then 10 µg/ml BFA was added for an additional 15 min (K). The cells were then fixed and stained for galactosyltransferase (GalT) and β-COP. Alone, the PLA<sub>2</sub> inhibitor ONO did not affect β-COP association with the Golgi complex (I) and did not prevent BFA-induced displacement of β-COP from the Golgi membranes (compare J and K). Interestingly, BFA treatment did not cause disassembly of the Golgi complex in ONO-treated cells, although β-COP was detached from the Golgi membranes (K). Scale bar: 300 nm (A, C), 350 nm (B, D), 9.8 µm (G, H), 11 µm (I–K).</p>

<p><bold>Membrane transport in cPLA<sub>2</sub>-siRNAs-treated cells.</bold> (A–D) Control (A, C) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated (B, D) HeLa cells were transfected with the VSVG-KDELR construct, and incubated at 32°C to allow transport of VSVG-KDELR from the ER to the Golgi complex. The cells were then fixed directly (A, B) or 90 min after an incubation at 40°C (C, D), which trapped the VSVG-KDELR in the ER that had been transported retrogradely from the Golgi complex. Confocal microscopy suggests that VSVG-KDELR was delivered effectively from the Golgi complex to the ER in both control (C) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated (D) cells. (E, F) Control (E) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated (F) HeLa cells were kept for 1 h at 4°C with 50 µg/ml transferrin-Cy3, then washed and fixed after a 10 min incubation at 37°C. Confocal images indicate that transferrin uptake is not affected by the cPLA<sub>2</sub> siRNAs. (G, H) Control (G) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated (H) HeLa cells were incubated for 30 min at 4°C with 100 µg/ml fluorescent wheat-germ agglutinin (WGA). The cells were then washed and incubated at 37°C for 1 h, and fixed and labelled with an anti-TGN46 ab. In both control and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells, WGA was internalized and delivered to the Golgi complex, indicating that the endopathway from the plasma membrane to the endosomes, and from the endosomes to the TGN, are not affected in the cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells. (I–P) Control (I, K, M, O) and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated HeLa cells (J, L, N, P) were fixed and labelled with anti-mannose-6-phosphate receptor (M6PR) (I, J), anti-EEA1 (K, L), anti-Sec31 (M, N), or anti-β-COP (O, P) antibodies. The patterns of each of these markers were similar in the control and cPLA<sub>2</sub>α-siRNAs-treated cells. Scale bar: 6 µm (A–D), 20 µm (E, F), 60 µm (G–P).</p>

<p><bold>Inhibition of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity affects transport through the Golgi complex.</bold> (A–F) HFs (A–D) and NRK cells stably expressing sialyltransferase-HRP (ST-HRP) (E, F) were infected with VSV (A–F), and kept at 40°C for 3 h to accumulate VSVG in the ER, without (A, C, E) and with (B, D, F) 5 µM ONO for the final 15 min of the temperature block. The cells were then fixed directly (A, B) or incubated without (C, E) and with (D, F) 5 µM ONO at 32°C for 45 min before fixing. The fixed cells were double labelled with anti-VSVG and anti-giantin antibodies (A–D), or prepared for immuno-EM using nanogold and the HRP protocol (E, F). After accumulation within the ER (A, B), VSVG was efficiently exported to the plasma membrane in control cells (C) and blocked in the Golgi area in ONO-treated cells (D). EM revealed VSVG in the <italic>trans</italic>-Golgi compartment (E, arrows) labelled with ST-HRP, while in ONO-treated cells most of the VSVG remained within the <italic>cis</italic> portion of the stack (F, arrows), which was negative for ST-HRP. (G–J) HFs were kept at 40°C for 3 h in ascorbate-free medium to accumulate PC-I in the ER (G, H), and treated without and with 5 µM ONO for the last 15 min of the temperature block (I, J). The cells were then incubated without (I) and with (J) 5 µM ONO at 37°C for 45 min in medium with ascorbic acid (to allow PC-I folding and exit from the ER), fixed and double labelled with anti-PC-I and anti-giantin antibodies. While in the control cells PC-I was efficiently exported towards the plasma membrane within transport carriers (I, arrows), ONO treatment induced accumulation of PC-I in the Golgi area (J). (K, L) HFs infected with VSV were metabolically labelled with [<sup>35</sup>S]-methionine and then chased at 32°C in the absence and presence of 5 µM ONO. At the indicated times, the cells were solubilized and digested with endoglycosidase H (Endo-H), which cleaves sugar chains built on the proteins early in the secretory pathway (i.e., before their processing by medial Golgi enzyme mannosidase-II, which convert sugars into endo-H resistant forms). The cell lysates were then separated by SDS-PAGE, and the gels scanned (K). The percentages of the Endo-H resistant form of VSVG with respect to the total amounts of VSVG were quantified (L) using a FUJIFILM imager. The data indicate that VSVG processing to its Endo-H resistant form (which occurs in the medial Golgi) was reduced when PLA<sub>2</sub> activity was inhibited. (M–O) HFs were infected with VSV, and kept at 40°C for 3 h to accumulate VSVG in the ER. The cells were then incubated in the presence of 5 µM ONO at 32°C for 45 min to allow VSVG exit from the ER. Then the cells were fixed immediately (M) or incubated for an additional 15 min (N) or 45 min (O) in fresh ONO-free medium to allow the recovery of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity. Immunofluorescent labelling of these ONO-treated cells (M) reveals accumulation of VSVG within isolated Golgi stacks labelled with an anti-giantin ab. Shortly after ONO wash-out (N), partial reconnection of the Golgi stacks into a ribbon (N, arrow) coincided with the reactivation of transport and the appearance of VSVG at the cell surface (N, arrowheads); cells still with disconnected Golgi stacks (N, asterisk) did not show VSVG at the plasma membrane. Complete recovery of PLA<sub>2</sub> activity resulted in the reassembly of the Golgi stacks into a highly connected structure and the exit of the cargo to the plasma membrane (O). Scale bar: 8.2 µm (A–D, N, O), 300 nm (E, F), 9.8 µm (G–J), 4 µm (M).</p>

<p><bold>Schematic illustration of how tubular elements can connect cisternae across the Golgi stack.</bold> (A) The scheme shows a portion of a Golgi ribbon, where neighbouring stacks are connected to each other by horizontal membranes bridges (outlined in blue). Lack of vertical connections between some cisternae within one stack can be compensated for by the presence of these connections (outlined in red; 1, 2, 3) in neighbouring stacks. These three vertical connections are sufficient to provide membrane continuum between the <italic>cis</italic> and <italic>trans</italic> compartments across all three of the stacks. (B) This scheme illustrates that only a very few transient connections need to be present in a stack at any given time to support intra-Golgi transport. At Time Point 1, only a single vertical connection (outlined by solid line) is present within the stack and would provide exchange of material between the 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> cisternae. This connection disappears (outlined by dashed line) at Time Point 2; however, the generation of new connections (outlined by solid line) would allow further transport between the 1<sup>st</sup> and 2<sup>nd</sup> and 3<sup>rd</sup> and 4<sup>th</sup> cisternae. Then the cycle can be repeated.</p>
