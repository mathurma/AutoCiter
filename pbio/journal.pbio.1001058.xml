      <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001058-g001"/>The eye is not a camera, and the retina
                is not a piece of film. Indeed, the retina might be better likened to a computer
                running Photoshop, given the extent of image processing that it performs before
                passing visual information along to the brain. A central aspect of that processing
                is called center-surround inhibition, in which illumination stimulates the firing of
                a small number of retinal cells, accompanied by inhibition of surrounding cells.
                This phenomenon increases spatial contrast and sharpens perception of edges.</p>
      <p>The mechanism of center-surround inhibition is complex, but one key part is played by
                interactions between photoreceptor cells and horizontal cells.
                Photoreceptors—the rods and cones that absorb light to begin the visual
                process—form synapses with horizontal cells, which, as their name implies,
                spread out horizontally across the retinal surface. Each horizontal cell receives
                input from dozens of photoreceptor cells, integrating and processing their input
                before passing it further along the visual chain.</p>
      <p>While photoreceptor cells activate horizontal cells, horizontal cells also
                subsequently influence photoreceptor cells, inhibiting their activation, an inverse
                influence called a negative feedback loop. But in this issue of <italic>PLoS
                    Biology</italic>, Skyler Jackman, Richard Kramer, and colleagues show that the
                two are also linked by a positive feedback loop, which may help offset the loss of
                signal strength inherent in negative feedback, helping to maintain strong signal
                output without degrading spatial contrast.</p>
      <p>The authors began by isolating whole retinas from the anole lizard. Unlike most other
                sensory cells, photoreceptors continually release neurotransmitter in the
                    <italic>un</italic>stimulated condition, that is, in the dark. The
                neurotransmitter glutamate is released from small sacs called synaptic vesicles that
                fuse with photoreceptor membrane. After their contents are released, bits of the
                membrane pinch off to generate new vesicles that gradually refill with glutamate for
                another round of release. The authors tapped into this recycling process to stain
                the vesicles with a dye as they were forming, allowing them later to monitor the
                rate of exocytosis of the labeled vesicles, and thus, the degree of stimulation of
                the photoreceptor.</p>
      <p>Because the negative feedback effect of horizontal cells activated by glutamate is to
                inhibit photoreceptor exocytosis, the authors expected that addition of exogenous
                glutamate into the synapse would reduce the rate of exocytosis. Instead, they found
                the opposite—an increase in glutamate release with addition of glutamate, the
                essence of a positive feedback loop.</p>
      <p>Through a series of experiments that blocked or stimulated different receptors, they
                established that the effect was mediated by a certain kind of receptor, called an
                ionotropic glutamate receptor. Since such receptors are found on the surface of the
                horizontal cells, but not on photoreceptor cells, and since ablating horizontal
                cells eliminated the effect, the authors concluded that positive feedback originated
                in these horizontal-cell receptors. Activation of the receptor allows calcium ions
                to flow into the horizontal cells, and when the authors released calcium directly
                into the horizontal cells, the photoreceptors were stimulated even in absence of
                excess glutamate, clinching the case. Further experiments will be needed to identify
                the messenger released by the horizontal cell that stimulates the photoreceptor
                cell. More experiments will also be needed to confirm these results in rods, since
                the anole lizard's retina contains only cones.</p>
      <p>How has this positive feedback mechanism remained hidden in plain sight through four
                decades or research on the retina? One reason, the authors suggest, is that it is
                only robustly observed in whole retina preparations, while retinal slices have been
                used for the majority of work elucidating retinal function.</p>
      <p>The authors propose that the function of the positive feedback loop is to offset the
                effect of negative feedback, which reduces overall output from a given visual
                stimulus. By tightly controlling the spatial spread of the positive stimulatory
                signal, they suggest that the system can maintain high signal strength without
                losing the sharp contrast enhancement of the center-surround system.</p>
