<abstract>
<p>In recent years there has been a strong development of computational approaches to mechanistically understand organ growth regulation in plants. In this study, simulation methods were used to explore which regulatory mechanisms can lead to realistic output at the cell and whole organ scale and which other possibilities must be discarded as they result in cellular patterns and kinematic characteristics that are not consistent with experimental observations for the <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> primary root. To aid in this analysis, a ‘Uniform Longitudinal Strain Rule’ (ULSR) was formulated as a necessary condition for stable, unidirectional, symplastic growth. Our simulations indicate that symplastic structures are robust to differences in longitudinal strain rates along the growth axis only if these differences are small and short-lived. Whereas simple cell-autonomous regulatory rules based on counters and timers can produce stable growth, it was found that steady developmental zones and smooth transitions in cell lengths are not feasible. By introducing spatial cues into growth regulation, those inadequacies could be avoided and experimental data could be faithfully reproduced. Nevertheless, a root growth model based on previous polar auxin-transport mechanisms violates the proposed ULSR due to the presence of lateral gradients. Models with layer-specific regulation or layer-driven growth offer potential solutions. Alternatively, a model representing the known cross-talk between auxin, as the cell proliferation promoting factor, and cytokinin, as the cell differentiation promoting factor, predicts the effect of hormone-perturbations on meristem size. By down-regulating PIN-mediated transport through the transcription factor SHY2, cytokinin effectively flattens the lateral auxin gradient, at the basal boundary of the division zone, (thereby imposing the ULSR) to signal the exit of proliferation and start of elongation. This model exploration underlines the value of generating virtual root growth kinematics to dissect and understand the mechanisms controlling this biological system.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The growth of a plant root is driven by cell division and cell expansion occurring in spatially distinct developmental zones. Although these zones are in principle stable, depending on the conditions, their size and properties can be modulated. This has been meticulously described by kinematic studies, which have led to the proposal of mechanisms underpinning those observations. At the same time, much knowledge of the identities and interactions of molecules involved in these mechanisms has accumulated, in particular from the model species <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. Here we attempt to resolve the longstanding question whether observed growth patterns can be explained by autonomous decision-making at the level of individual cells or if the aid of some external signal is required. We then ask, building on the accumulated molecular information, which minimal models can provide for stable growth while keeping sufficient flexibility to regulate growth. Therefore, we constructed computational models for different growth mechanisms operating in a virtual two-dimensional <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root and compared their behaviour with biological experiments. The simulations provide strong indications that spatial signals are required for realistic and flexible root growth, likely orchestrated by the plant hormones auxin and cytokinin.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Regulation of plant growth and development has been the subject of intensive research for over a century and this will likely continue, given the increasing need for crop production to sustain a growing world population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Food1">[1]</xref>. By virtue of new experimental approaches <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> has surpassed classical crops like wheat, tobacco and maize as the main model system to study the underlying molecular processes, thereby considerably advancing the field <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Petricka1">[2]</xref>. The principal processes that determine the growth of plant organs, including the primary root, are cell division and cell growth. Detailed analyses of these processes at high spatial and temporal resolution can be obtained by means of kinematic analyses providing a link with whole organ growth measurements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Fiorani1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Nelissen1">[4]</xref>. Under consistent growth conditions, typically around six days after germination the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedling root has established a steady root growth rate. At the distal end of the root a stable zone of cell proliferation (division or proliferation zone: DZ or PZ, respectively) precedes a delineated zone of accelerated growth (elongation zone, EZ). Cells in the elongation zone grow anisotropically reaching 20-fold length increases in as little as six hours, by massive vacuolar expansion, before reaching their final length (in the mature zone, MZ), where root hairs in specific epidermal cell files (trichoblasts) indicate a final differentiation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Verbelen1">[6]</xref>. This relatively simple outline of the growing root apex originates from a more complex underlying organisation. Arranged concentrically around the longitudinal axis, the root apex contains well-defined cell layers originating from stem cell-like initials organized in a tiered arrangement around a zone with low mitotic activity (the quiescent centre, QC; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Dolan1">[7]</xref>). These initials give rise to 6 distinct cell layers in the proximal direction: stele, pericycle, endodermis and cortex (from initials proximal to the QC), epidermis and lateral root cap cells (from initials lateral to the QC), and one in the distal direction: columella cells (from initials distal to the QC). How the underlying tissue structure is established and maintained remains the subject of extensive investigation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Paciorek1">[8]</xref>.</p>
<p>As ample evidence demonstrates, plant hormones play a central role in growth and development and they enable plants to respond to changing circumstances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-UbedaToms1">[9]</xref>. The wealth of molecular knowledge has inspired various attempts to capture aspects of those complex phenomena in mathematical models (reviewed in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-DeVos1">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Daetwyler1">[11]</xref>). Some modelling studies have focused on root growth. The landmark study of Grieneisen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref> used experimental findings on PIN auxin-exporter distributions to reproduce realistic auxin patterns in the root apex that govern cell division and growth. Laskowski and coworkers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Laskowski1">[13]</xref> extended this model to account for lateral root initiation based on auxin maxima induced by root bending. Swarup <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Swarup1">[14]</xref> and Band <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Band1">[15]</xref> used modelling approaches to link asymmetric auxin redistribution at the root tip to the gravitropic response. Mironova <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Mironova1">[16]</xref> presented the so called ‘reflected flow’ mechanism as an alternative to the ‘reverse fountain’ mechanism <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref> to explain auxin self-organisation, especially during the very early stages of root development. Cruz-Ramírez <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-CruzRamrez1">[17]</xref> proposed models that integrate radial patterns of the transcription factors SHR and SCR with longitudinal information from an auxin gradient to control asymmetric cell divisions required for differentiation within the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root. With a recent spatial model of the root tip Santuari <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Santuari1">[18]</xref> implicate differential endocytosis in explaining how the auxin gradient is interpreted throughout the meristem. Band <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Band2">[19]</xref> have modelled root growth as a single file of cells with growth-driven dilution of gibberellins providing a mechanism for growth arrest toward the end of the elongation zone.</p>
<p>Although some of those models comprise cell growth and division, these processes are typically implemented in an arbitrary and artificial way since their relationship with hormone action has not been sufficiently elucidated. Moreover, plant cells are connected mechanically through their cell walls, which by their stiffness counteract the hydrostatic turgor pressure driving cell growth. The collective framework of growing cell walls (apoplast), imposes major constraints on organ growth, preventing neighbouring cells to become separated (precluding for instance ‘cell sliding’). This type of growth, designated ‘symplastic’, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Erickson1">[20]</xref>, has only recently been represented in a vertex-based computational model of root growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Fozard1">[21]</xref>. By creating mechanical stresses, in principle the apoplast operates as an integrative function in coordinating organ growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Uyttewaal1">[22]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Hamant1">[24]</xref>. In this study we explore the prowess of previously proposed mechanisms for regulation and coordination of growth and division in a symplastic framework by building and testing computational models within the simulation platform VirtualLeaf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Merks1">[25]</xref>. The simulation results are discussed in relation to classical kinematic studies of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>

<p>Kinematic growth analyses aim to infer properties of cell growth and division from microscopic time series of the growing root, yielding detailed profiles of cell expansion (extension) and cell division (partitioning) along the principal axis of growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Fiorani1">[3]</xref>. Among others Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Green1">[26]</xref> developed and advocated this method. Interestingly, Green also derived how proposed elemental growth models would be manifested in a kinematic framework. Based on our current concepts of growth regulation we have extended this analysis that relates changes in cell size along the root axis to relative rates of cell division and expansion. To this end we used the vertex-based plant modelling software VirtualLeaf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Merks1">[25]</xref> to directly simulate a selection of distinct growth models (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). These models evolve a two-dimensional cellular grid that represents an axial bisection of the growing root apex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g001">Figure 1A and 1B</xref>). Cells are defined as polygons and cell wall segments correspond to the edges acting as linear springs. Cells and cell walls are endowed with biochemical properties represented by reaction and transport equations and logical rules. Specifying regulatory mechanisms ( = input) amounts to specifying rules that minimally determine (i) cellular growth rates (via changing target areas), (ii) cell division rates and orientation (here strictly horizontal), (iii) the transition at the border of the QC and the proximal meristem, (iv) the transition between division and elongation zone (DZ and EZ, respectively), and (v) the transition to mature (differentiated) cells. By modifying those rules and analysing the resulting virtual phenotypes in terms of microscopic and kinematic characteristics we then delineate the requirements for cell growth and division needed to produce a realistic and stably growing root. We have opted here to look at proposed elementary mechanisms and gradually increase the degree of realism compared to real data.</p>

<p>(A) Schematic representation of the ‘ULSR’. Growth of the root apex is simplified as occurring strictly vertically. Arrows indicate that local strain rates are the same at each position along the vertical axis. In our modelling framework one horizontal axis can intersect cells with various average positions, sizes and strain rates thereby inevitably challenging the ULSR.

Cells in inner files are narrower and therefore longitudinal strain will be higher. This leads to growth irregularity with faster growth for central files creating an imbalance in the observed strain rates and distortion of the originally horizontal cell walls across the diverse layers. (B) Starting state of cell grid. (C) Cell grid depicted at simulation time 108 h.</p>

<p>Cell division in plants is spatially confined to meristematic zones, which has inspired discussions on whether its regulation takes place at the supra-cellular (‘organismal’) level instead of the level of individual cells (‘cellular’) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Jacobs1">[27]</xref>. Although as often the truth probably lies somewhere in between <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Silk1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-DeVeylder1">[30]</xref>, we here classify regulatory mechanisms as cell-autonomous or non-cell-autonomous <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Tsukaya1">[31]</xref>. In the first case cells behave as pre-programmed automata and there is no role for spatial signalling. In the second case regulation relies on spatial cues that are a function of the organisation of the symplast and that feed back into the cellular decision centres. Here we will define and evaluate the outcome of simulations of models corresponding to those two classes of mechanisms.</p>

<title>Regulatory mechanisms must conform to the ‘Uniform Longitudinal Strain Rule’</title>
<p>A consequence of the symplastic growth of the root is that at a given distance from the tip all cells have the same relative expansion rate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Ivanov1">[32]</xref>. As stated by Ivanov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Ivanov2">[33]</xref>, any observed difference in cell lengths between tissues must therefore reflect differences in cell proliferation (see also <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Green1">[26]</xref>). Inversely, any form of growth regulation that results in different elongation rates for cells at the same distance from the tip would disrupt symplastic growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g001">Figure 1A</xref>). For instance, suppose all cells at the same (vertical) position in a downward growing root have the same absolute (areal) expansion rate, irrespective of their size (<italic>Model 1</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>). With inner cell files narrower than outer cell files (similar to the real root) this fixed size increment results in consistently larger relative elongation rates for the inner tissue layers leading to tissue distortion and unbalanced distribution of mechanical stresses (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g001">Figure 1B and C</xref>). Note that the same situation would occur when adjacent files contain cells of similar width, but different lengths growing at the same absolute rates. Hence, non-uniform relative strain rates at some position along the principal growth axis eventually lead to malformations.</p>

Various categories w.r.t. developmental decisions are presented. Column (3) specifies the transition between division and elongation zone (DZ and EZ, respectively); column (4) specifies the transition to mature (differentiated) cells (mature zone or MZ) based on timing since the release from the QC or a spatial signal at a fixed distance from the root apex; column (5) specifies whether division rate is determined via a timer or sizer mechanism; and column (6) how cellular growth rates are defined. Developmental events can be determined to happen after a fixed duration (‘Timer’), a fixed number of divisions (‘Counter’), a fixed cell size (‘Sizer’), and a fixed distance from the root apex (‘Ruler’). For Models 10–12 more complicated regulatory mechanisms are specified. In Model 4 extra random noise was added to the timer (‘+ noise’). For Model 5 cell division is dependent on a timer mechanism, with a different cell cycle time for inner and outer layers (‘Timer (variant)’). Model 6 uses a uniform size (area) criterion for cell division, irrespectively of cell geometry (‘Sizer (uniform)’). For Model 7 the size criterion is adapted to the difference in the width between inner and outer layers, thereby acting effectively as a length criterion. In the other (non-cell autonomous) cases the cell division sizer differs between layers. It is usually assumed that DZ and EZ have a characteristic elongation rate. More details of the models can be found in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">Table S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s016">Text S1</xref> and in the corresponding figures.</p></fn></table-wrap-foot></table-wrap>
<p>Disruption can be manifested in different forms ranging from small local cell or tissue deformations up to changes of whole organ growth. In fact, ‘disruption’ may be an overly negative term as it could be argued that a carefully-coordinated breach of that principle, as for instance in the root gravitropic response, can be beneficial to the plant. Furthermore, the stated necessary condition might be too stringent since small and short-lived random perturbations are likely to yield no significant distortions since they can cancel each other out to some extend as demonstrated in the next section. The apoplast, by its ability to transmit mechanical stress, may effectively function as a buffer to those small and random perturbations. Nevertheless, it seems evident that systematic differences in strain rates will eventually result in geometrical changes to the organ structure. In order to evaluate whether growth mechanisms allow for stable root growth we therefore reformulate the previously mentioned findings of Ivanov <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Ivanov2">[33]</xref> and Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Green1">[26]</xref>:</p>
<p><bold><italic>If in a uni-directionally growing root at least two points at the same axial position (with respect to the growth direction) have a persistently different longitudinal strain rate (relative elongation rate) then the symplastic structure will be distorted.</italic></bold></p>
<p>‘Persistent’ should here be interpreted as present during a minimum time interval sufficient to produce an arbitrary distortion based on that local strain rate difference. From here on, we will refer to this formulation as the ‘Uniform Longitudinal Strain Rule’ (in short ULSR) to emphasise its application over a finite time interval. Although root growth of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> seedling is in general not steady <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster1">[5]</xref> in some conditions during development this is approximately the case <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster3">[34]</xref>. Here we will investigate also how steady growth can be attained and maintained. Like embryonic roots we will therefore start the models from a minimal set of precursor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Subsequently the models will evolve to a situation where a larger population of cells occupies the meristem, elongation and mature part of the roots. In this process the growth of the root will accelerate initially, but then ideally converges to a state where a constant size of the meristem and elongation zone is obtained and the root growth rate becomes constant. For a uni-directionally growing root the following definition is proposed.</p>
<p><bold><italic>The growing root is in a steady state if all points at each position along the growth axis have a constant strain rate.</italic></bold></p>

<title>Cell-autonomous regulation does not produce realistic root kinematics</title>
<p>We start off by considering strictly cell-autonomous regulation of cell growth and division as this appears to be the most elementary form of regulation. Cell-autonomous regulation implies here that essential developmental transitions are only governed by endogenous cellular programs independent of any external signals (excluding their direct physical connection in the symplast). Whereas we know this is unlikely the case, some plant growth studies point towards regulation based on cells acting as autonomous, pre-programmed units. Typically, cell behaviour is proposed to be a function of the number of events or the time passed with respect to some reference point (a defined cellular event). These types of regulation are called counters and timers, respectively. A counter keeping track of the number of cell divisions of a cell before exiting the proliferative phase has been repeatedly proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster3">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Temple1">[36]</xref>. Timers have been used in various growth models for instance on vertebrate segmentation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Hester1">[37]</xref> or the cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Qu1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Li1">[39]</xref>. It has indeed been found that in wild type roots under diverse treatments, cells spend about the same time traversing elongation zones of very different sizes (even during accelerated growth) suggesting that cells enter the EZ with a pre-programmed duration for expansion activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster1">[5]</xref>. In his seminal study Green <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Green1">[26]</xref> includes a meristem doubling model in which the meristem consists of a number of cells that undergo one cell cycle after which the proximal half of them enters the non-dividing state.</p>
<p>To test whether cell-autonomous regulation can produce realistic root apex structures we constructed a set of models in which cells in contact with the columella/QC maintain their capacity to divide. Upon release from the QC, these cells are allowed to divide another two or three times, based on cells keeping track of the number of divisions or the time passed since release from the columella/QC (<italic>Models 2–7</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g004">4</xref>). The loss of proliferative capacity is then followed by a fixed time interval of accelerated growth. In <italic>Model 2</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>) the exit from the proliferative stage is determined by a timer, with cell division synchronous among cells at the same longitudinal position. Starting from a simple grid, after a transient phase, a roughly linear increase in length is achieved in accordance with the first of the proposed criteria (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). The synchronized cell division results in regular stepwise increases in cell numbers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). All cells in one file derive from one cell (clones) occurring in groups (of increasing multiples of 2) with the same developmental state (<italic>i.e.</italic> number of divisions and time since QC release). Consequently, discrete sets of developmentally synchronous cells with similar size and growth rate arise (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g003">Figures 3C and 3D</xref>) leading to sharp developmental transitions. The use of a counter instead of a timer to decide when cells exit proliferation as in <italic>Model 3</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>), produces essentially the same outcome (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s002">Figure S1</xref>). Similarly to what Green described with his meristem doubling model, the size of the proliferation zone periodically varies (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g003">Figures 3C</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s003">S2</xref>), growing exponentially and losing half of its size as a complete group of clonal cells exits proliferation and enters accelerated growth. Importantly, <italic>in vivo</italic> such patterns of synchronised behaviour have not been observed. Contrary to the third (ULSR), the second criterion is breached since cell length distributions along the zones are not smooth (contrary to <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster1">[5]</xref>). Indeed, some aspects of realistic root growth can be reproduced, yet, others not based on this type of model.</p>

Upon release from the QC, cells can divide for a pre-programmed time duration (A–C) or number of times (D), followed by a fixed time duration of accelerated growth. (A) Total root length versus simulation time. It takes approximately 75 hours for the first cells to start accelerating growth (indicated by ‘*’). Subsequent sets of quasi synchronously dividing cells then grow exponentially for a fixed time, yielding a roughly linear area increase. (B) Total cell number versus simulation time. The cell number is built up exponentially till 12 (columns)×2<sup>3</sup> = 96 ‘clones’ are formed. These then undergo accelerated growth. One cell cycle later the next pool of 96 cells is ready to do the same and cell numbers increase by constant steps. (C) Detailed snapshots (at 99 hours, with diamond shaped markers, and 108 hours, with circular markers) of approximate cell length along the main growth axis. Subpopulations with narrow length distributions can be seen corresponding to dividing, accelerating and mature cells. The accelerating cell population occupies an increasing area until adding to the mature zone. The ‘polyloc method’ was used for curve fitting (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). (D) Simulation output of <italic>Model 2</italic> at 99 h (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">Table S1</xref>).

Areal strain rates (‘AS’ as defined in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>) are mapped on the cellular grid, showing the elongation zone as a distinct region of relatively uniform accelerated growth.</p>

<title>Cell-autonomous regulation: Robustness to perturbations.</title>
<p>(A) Simulation output (time: 87 h) from a model as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g003">Figure 3</xref>, yet with maximally ±25% noise added to cell cycle time (except first division ±10%, <italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">Table S1</xref> – <italic>Model 4</italic>; see also Figures S3A and S3C), which demonstrates that the symplast can act as a stabilizing framework that dissipates ‘noisy’ mechanical perturbations through its structure. Colouring is according to growth potential (defined in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section) as a measure for ‘turgor pressure’. (B) Timer-based developmental transitions can amplify tissue distortion. Simulation output of timer mechanism with layer-specific cell cycle time (<italic>Model 5</italic> at simulation time 90 h). Upon release from the ‘QC’ cells can divide 3 times. For the outer 6 cell files CCT = 900 min, the inner 6 CCT = 1080 min. Afterwards, cells undergo accelerated growth until 4440 min after ‘QC’-release. Therefore the inner cells lag behind if their release started more or less synchronous as is the case here (maximally ±10% noise). Synchronicity is an important factor determining stable patterning in itself. Counters are sensitive as they multiply and therefore consistently amplify differences in CCT. Cells in the centre are lagging behind in terms of growth. As simulation time passes the irregularities eventually result in severely distorted patterns. Colouring is according to growth potential (defined in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref> section) as a measure for ‘turgor pressure’. (C) Simulation of <italic>Model 6</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">Table S1</xref>) at simulation time 42 h, with a sizer-based cell cycle. One sizer, imposing division at a defined absolute cell size, is used despite differences in width of cells at similar positions along the main growth axis. Outer cell files have wider cells which reach the critical size before those of inner files. Therefore they undergo a much earlier exit from proliferation starting accelerated growth earlier, resulting in cell shape/tissue distortion. Cells in the centre are therefore lagging behind in terms of growth rate. Cell-autonomous regulatory systems appear inherently sensitive to this effect. Colouring is according to growth potential, GP or ‘turgor pressure’ (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>).</p>

<p>Simulating perfectly synchronized cell divisions produces highly regular cellular grids dissimilar to root micrographs (compare <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s002">Figure S1</xref> with anatomical sections in for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Dolan1">[7]</xref>). After adding random uniform noise (within +/−25% of reference) to each individual cell cycle time a more naturally looking outcome results (<italic>Model 4</italic>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), with a smoother cell number increase in time (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s004">Figure S3A</xref>). Importantly, in a spatial context the cell length distributions remain discontinuous, yet smeared out more (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s004">Figure S3C</xref>). Logically with the partial loss of synchronicity, cells at the same position along the growth axis will not necessarily grow at the same relative rate since their number of divisions or the time since release from the QC varies. Hence, the proposed ULSR is violated <italic>sensu stricto</italic>. We have found, however, through our simulations that, to some extent, the symplast acts as a stabilising framework in that local, random mechanical perturbations are dissipated through its structure (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, with colouring as a function of the ratio actual area/target area, with red colours representing an outgoing or cell-expanding potential: for details see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). However, if even more cell cycle time noise is added or if perturbations are systematic, then growth defects eventually arise. For instance in <italic>Model 5</italic> and <italic>Model 6</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>) a systematically shorter cell cycle time of the outer cell layers is propagated over multiple generations. Through timer or counter based rules the cells in the outer layers undergo the fast acceleration phase much earlier, leading to tissue structure defects (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g004">Figure 4B and 4C</xref>). Cell-autonomous regulation is prone to this since a local defect is easily clonally amplified, especially if occurring at an early stage in development, without external signals to constrain the effect within spatial bounds.</p>
<p>Likely, robust regulation also includes well-coordinated cell division and cell growth, leading to a stable cell size distribution over time. Contrary to a simple pre-programmed cell cycle timer, which does not respond to fluctuations in growth rate, a size-based cell division mechanism (‘sizer’) might provide this extra stability. Size-based control mechanisms are well-established in (plant) cell cycle modelling (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-CsikszNagy1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Roeder1">[41]</xref>. If cell division is implemented to happen at an absolute cell size (or length rather as in <italic>Model 7</italic>) cell sizes (or lengths) are kept in strict bounds in the DZ, yet synchronicity of cell division is reduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s004">Figure S3B</xref>).</p>
<p>We conclude that despite a quasi-steady growth, in the absence of spatial cues stable developmental zones and smooth gradients in cell lengths are not feasible based on the investigated types of strict cell-autonomous regulation. It makes sense that to have cells of the same generation behave according to a smooth positional gradient requires a spatial signal, even in the presence of noise.</p>

<title>Non-cell-autonomous regulation provides a solid basis for realistic root kinematics</title>
<p><italic>Model 8</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>) was constructed to test whether including spatial signals (non-cell-autonomous regulation) can improve resemblance with experimental data. Counter and timer-based rules for exit of proliferation, start of accelerated growth and maturation were replaced by a fully independent spatial signal that marks these transitions at fixed positions from the QC (like a ‘ruler’). Simulations with this concept model lead to growth, which to a good approximation can be described as steady and linear (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g005">Figure 5</xref>; Video S1). The spatial boundaries directly limit the total mass production occurring within those predefined zones. Importantly, the simulated data of (epidermal) cell lengths along the root apex are similar to what we obtained experimentally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g002">Figure 2</xref>), and the fitted cell length distributions are similar to what was reported in previous kinematics studies as well <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster1">[5]</xref>. The strain rates are either low (in the DZ) or high (in the EZ) changing rather abruptly going from DZ to EZ for a single simulated root (Figures S4A). Using averaged strain rates from multiple simulations (with different random seeds for mechanical equilibration) shows that the strain rate curves become more smooth and bell-shaped (although still skewed) as was observed in various studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Silk2">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Walter1">[43]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s005">Figure S4B</xref>).

<p>From a biochemical point of view the most likely spatial signal to act as a ‘ruler’ would be a phytohormone or combination of phytohormones undergoing long-distance transport through the root tissue resulting in a morphogenetic gradient. Auxin is arguably the most prominent root morphogen. It has been demonstrated that a stable auxin gradient can be formed which could act as the primary signal determining growth and cell division <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref>. In the simulations reported with that model the growing root tip is regularly truncated providing an auxin source at a constant distance from the root tip. Via <italic>Model 9</italic>, which is a vertex-based variant of the latter model (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Table 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>) we investigated whether auxin patterns effectively reach a steady state with a source at a fixed position that becomes displaced further and further from the root tip due to growth. We specifically explored how spatially regulated growth and division (as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g005">Figure 5</xref>) affect the auxin gradient (not conversely). It followed that an important factor is the definition of the auxin source: as a (constant) net import from the upper plant parts (and) or as some form of local production. In the first variant of <italic>Model 9</italic> (in the presence of first order auxin degradation) only the total auxin level of the root slowly converges to a steady state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s006">Figure S5A</xref>), whereas the concentration is steadily diluted (after an initial increase) by the growing root (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s006">Figure S5B and S5C</xref>). If we define developmental transitions with a stable spatial signal, therefore this type of auxin source in principle does not support steady root growth. Rather, it might be suitable to produce temporary responses. A different behaviour emerges with variants of <italic>Model 9</italic> that instead use local (root-based) auxin production: either with cellular production proportional to size or with a constant production rate per cell. In both cases the total auxin level (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s006">Figure S5D and S5G</xref>) increases proportionally to the area increase (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s006">Figure S5E and S5H</xref>), and the auxin concentration over the total root slowly (especially for the area-based production mode) converges to a steady state (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s006">Figure S5F and S5I</xref>). Production modes can be combined as well, yet this does not change the picture with typically one mode being (or becoming) dominant (results not shown). In accordance with previous work, the two-dimensional shape of the auxin gradient depends on whether a-polar (diffusive or AUX/LAX importer-mediated) or polarized (PIN-mediated) transport is dominant, with in the first case a gradual auxin concentration increase towards the lower (distal) root combined with a smooth auxin peak near the ‘QC’ cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s007">Figure S6</xref>). If PIN-transport is dominant a much more pronounced local auxin maximum occurs at the central cell lines just proximal to the ‘QC’ cells. The dominance of diffusive versus a-polar transport is determined in this model by the relative values of the diffusion and PIN transport kinetic constants rather than their absolute values (see for instance the similarity of Figures S6A and S6E, and Figures S6B and S6F). With the model variant based on constant auxin import that sharp peak shifts in time, connected to the growing root apex. However, it eventually disappears by growth dilution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). Local production modes again show the shifting of the sharp peak, however, in those cases the sharp peak slowly but gradually becomes stable (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g006">Figure 6B and 6C</xref>). We conclude that typical auxin-based models can produce stable gradients if auxin production scales with the growing root. Importantly, unless auxin transport is completely a-polar, there is always an additional horizontal (transversal) concentration gradient besides the longitudinal gradient (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g006">Figures 6D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s007">S6</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s008">S7</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s009">S8</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s010">S9</xref>).

Cell division was based on a sizer mechanism with noise added to have a more irregular, natural, tissue shape (up to a fixed distance of 240 µm from the tip). To not bias the analysis, growth and division did not depend on auxin. Four simulations based on differences in kinetic parameter values as well as some subtle differences in the differential equations were set up to represent different types of auxin sources in the model (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s016">Text S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s006">Figure S5</xref>).

<p>Having obtained a steady and stable spatial auxin gradient, the question remains how it is interpreted by the cells as they move through it. In <italic>Model 10</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>) cell growth and division are directly determined by the local auxin concentration, <italic>e.g.</italic> according to specific step functions (division above a minimum size and above an auxin threshold, slow growth above the same auxin threshold, fast growth above a lower threshold). In this case no steady state was obtained with severely distorted root growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Because of the radial gradient, cells at the same position along the growth axis are instructed to consistently produce different strain rates thereby violating the ULSR. With auxin concentration determining cell division, cell size distributions are not arranged in parallel along the longitudinal axis but follow the peaks and valleys in the auxin landscape (to some extent this has been observed, (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beeckman1">[46]</xref>). When tuning the auxin transport parameters to a more dominant diffusion regime the transversal gradient remains present still precluding stable growth, although the distortions of the cellular grid are less pronounced. Some tissue locations (for instance the vascular layers near the QC) have a much lower tendency to grow (blue colours) compared to others (red coloured outer layers near the QC) and inhibit and distort growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g007">Figure 7B</xref>). Alternative scenarios based on spatial or temporal derivatives of the auxin concentration pattern (as proposed for instance for <italic>Drosophila</italic> organ development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Wartlick1">[47]</xref>) do not provide more regularly spaced developmental cues (results not shown). We conclude that in itself a strictly auxin-based growth model is unlikely to produce stable and realistic root growth. Whereas a simple diffusion-based auxin transport mechanism (<italic>e.g.</italic> with a source near the ‘QC’) could resolve this issue, this spatial complexity resulting from polar auxin transport is important for other purposes, like auxin's role in regulating formative divisions around the ‘QC’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-CruzRamrez1">[17]</xref>. In the following we investigate two opposing theories proposed to circumvent this differential growth problem in response to a lateral (radial) auxin gradient.</p>

<p>It has been recently highlighted that hormones seem to regulate root growth in a layer (/tissue)-specific way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-UbedaToms1">[9]</xref>. Whereas short-range (paracrine) signals have been put forward as a hypothetical solution to transmit developmental signals transversally through the layers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-UbedaToms1">[9]</xref> we have tested whether it is sufficient for cell layers to ‘communicate’ through their mechanical connections. <italic>Model 11</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>) represents this concept of ‘layer (/tissue)-driven growth’ by selecting one arbitrary cell file (represented by 2 cell columns) in which the cells undergo turgor-driven growth. The other cell files are forced to passively follow (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g008">Figure 8</xref>, see legend and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s001">Dataset S1</xref> for implementation). Simulations show that one cell file can effectively drive steady growth of the whole organ, yielding smooth cell length distributions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g008">Figures 8B and 8C</xref>). Strictly, a conflict exists with the ULSR since one cell file is consistently growing faster. Nevertheless, if the cells in the other layers can respond rapidly (adjusting their target areas or ‘turgor pressures’) then the difference in strain rate apparently remains sufficiently low to cause much overall tissue distortion. This rapid response requires transversal communication between the layers. Biologically, signal transduction could potentially be mediated by the mechanical connections between the layers or otherwise a secondary chemical signal would have to be transmitted. Irrespectively, we conclude a layer-driven mechanism can solve the problem of layer-specific differences in the instructive hormone (here auxin) gradient.</p>

<p>A different solution to reconcile the central role of auxin in root growth with the ULSR may consist of introducing regulatory cross-talk into the models. In other words to complement or modulate the auxin signalling other spatially non-uniform signals, like transcription factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-CruzRamrez1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Vernoux1">[48]</xref> or other hormones <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Aloni1">[49]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Nawy1">[52]</xref> are implicated. Based on proposed regulatory interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Moubayidin1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Moubayidin2">[54]</xref>, we have implemented a model (<italic>Model 12</italic>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003910-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">S1</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s016">Text S1</xref>) centred around the cross-talk between auxin as the cell proliferation promoting factor and cytokinin as the cell differentiation promoting factor (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g009">Figure 9A</xref>). Auxin transport was described as both diffusive and PIN-mediated, with local production and an external source as in the previously discussed models. Cytokinin transport was described as strictly diffusion-based, also with local and external sources, the local production rate being repressed by auxin. This led to a shallow gradient, the concentration decreasing towards the tip (as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Muraro1">[55]</xref>). In this simplified model cytokinin up-regulates the transcription factor SHY2 which is typically strongly expressed at the so called transition zone between DZ and EZ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Moubayidin2">[54]</xref>. Increasing SHY2 leads to repression of PIN transporter levels and a resulting auxin signal drop that reduces the meristem size. Accordingly a local auxin response minimum has been observed before <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Santuari1">[18]</xref>. Auxin on the other hand has been proposed to counteract this effect by mediating SHY2 degradation, in part through gibberellin (GA) repressing ARR1 via the DELLA family protein RGA. In our simulation model we did not include any ARRs as variables. In accordance with others (see for instance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Liu1">[56]</xref>) auxin was assumed to directly inhibit cellular cytokinin production. GA was only included as a variable that determines where the EZ ends due to simple growth dilution (in accordance with <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Band2">[19]</xref>). The exit from proliferation and start of accelerated growth was determined by crossing a SHY2 concentration threshold (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s016">Text S1</xref>). Interestingly, because of its inhibition of PIN expression, the steep increase in the SHY2 concentration coincides with a dip in the auxin concentration as well as the transition from a strongly polarized to a predominantly a-polar transport regime (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g009">Figures 9B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s011">S10A</xref>) leading in general to much more linear spatial gradients in accordance with the ULSR (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g009">Figures 9C–E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s012">S11</xref>). Since the first two proposed criteria for realistic growth were fulfilled too (Figures S10B,C), this mechanism in principle allows for the required regular and stable zonation of the growing root apex, and can therefore potentially reconcile multiple roles for auxin in patterning along different directions. Furthermore, with <italic>Model 12</italic> we could qualitatively predict how adding external auxin and cytokinin affects the meristem size (increasing and decreasing in size, respectively) as demonstrated experimentally by Beemster and Baskin (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster3">[34]</xref>; <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g009">Figure 9C–E</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We have constructed and simulated different models that represent steady symplastic growth of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root tip. We compared diverse regulatory mechanisms and found out which of them can adequately reproduce crucial properties of primary root growth, according to three well-defined criteria (steady-state, realistic cell length distribution, and ULSR) that allow rigorous comparison with experimental observations of <italic>in vivo</italic> growing roots of <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>. A necessary condition for stable unidirectional symplastic growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Ivanov2">[33]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Green1">[26]</xref> was re-interpreted and re-formulated as a strain (rate) rule (‘ULSR’) for those mechanisms to conform to. It is mainly this third criterion that warrants the use of our sophisticated vertex-based simulations rather than the more simple approach of modelling a single cell file such as in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Band2">[19]</xref>, which could potentially produce kinematic output such as steady state length growth and cell length profiles. As soon as differences in strain rates or complex transport phenomena occur, the use of a two-dimensional tissue representation becomes necessary. Our simulations do suggest that symplastic structures are resilient to differences in strain rates as long as they are small and short-lived. How far or fast perturbations are precisely transmitted through plant tissue and to which extend this affects organ growth are intriguing questions that go beyond the scope of this study. A more accurate representation of cell wall mechanical properties (such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Fozard1">[21]</xref>) and of tissue and organ structure (possibly in 3D) would then be desirable and would further enhance kinematic and microscopic resemblance with real root tissues.</p>
<p>Considering the complexity of molecular interactions implicated in growth regulation of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root apex and considering the presence of many gaps in our understanding, we have opted rather to define rules for cell growth and division inspired by previous studies and enriched them with molecular interactions whenever useful. Whether regulation takes place at the supra-cellular (‘organismal’) level versus at the level of individual cells (‘cellular’) forms the subject of a long standing discussion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Jacobs1">[27]</xref>. This distinction is probably overly polarized as indicated by experimental observations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster2">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Tsukaya1">[31]</xref>. In fact, signals that vary on the cellular, tissue- and organ-scale are known to affect pattern formation considerably. We have kept this conceptual distinction nevertheless and classified the proposed regulatory mechanisms as cell-autonomous (based on local pre-programmed rules) or non-cell-autonomous (affected by external, spatial signals).</p>
<p>Cell-autonomous mechanisms like timers, counters and sizers are readily implemented with the logical expressions of a computer program. In a biological context such mechanisms typically require more complex designs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Tyson1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Stricker1">[59]</xref>. Various sizer and timer based cell cycle models have been reported, making it reasonable representations of cell behaviour <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Qu1">[38]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-CsikszNagy1">[40]</xref>. Given the conserved nature of the eukaryotic cell cycle machinery these types of mechanisms are likely operating in the plant cell cycle <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Roeder1">[41]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Harashima1">[60]</xref>. Timers and counters operating at different spatial and/or temporal scales are even more obscure. For instance, a developmental counter that determines the exit of proliferation would have to keep track of the number of cell divisions a cell has undergone. The epigenetic state of a plant cell can reflect this history <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-vanLeeuwen1">[61]</xref>. In the context of plant development, telomere shortening could play such a role <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Counter1">[62]</xref>. After cells exit the DZ, DNA duplication cycles are expected to continue through the process of endoreduplication. The number of DNA copies could therefore serve as a direct developmental marker to the plant cell.</p>
<p>We have shown that stable growth is possible based strictly on counter and timer mechanisms. However, the absence of spatial cues precludes realistic primary root growth. Indeed, such strictly cell-autonomous mechanisms will logically lead to groups of (nearly) synchronously growing cells. Cell packages derived from each division of the initial cells will behave in a similar way irrespective of their position along the growth axis and produce growth zones changing periodically in size (when such a package leaves the DZ and enters the EZ). Even taking into account the inherent noise in cell behaviour, fixed developmental zones and smooth transitions in cell lengths are not feasible based on this type of regulation. On the other hand it cannot be excluded that some indirect mechanisms exist by which cells can circumvent the need for a spatial signal by deriving spatial information in an autonomous way. An example of this hypothesis could be the gravity-sensing columella cells that can extract spatial information through statholits in the root gravitropic response as modelled in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Band1">[15]</xref>.</p>
<p>Considering the inherent limitations of strictly cell-autonomous mechanisms and given the extensive evidence on the importance of phytohormones, it seems unlikely that those mechanisms are the main determinants of developmental zonation in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root. We have demonstrated that spatial signals (for instance stemming from a biochemical gradient) can be a direct and (based on the visual and kinematic comparison) effective manner of instructing morphogenesis. This has been shown for various other life forms like Arthropoda and Vertebrata <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Jaeger1">[63]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Wartlick1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Hester1">[37]</xref>. Our simulations regarding the effectiveness of auxin as the primary signal controlling root growth show that based on local auxin production a stable auxin pattern can be produced, however this potentially a slow process. A constant production per cell seems the most effective to this end. A faster breakdown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref> or efflux rate might aid in faster convergence. In any case, with an external auxin source such a pattern gradually fades out through growth dilution. Polar transport results in a lateral (radial) concentration gradient which conflicts with the ‘ULSR’. In fact our model does not even capture the extra volumetric dilution of auxin from the inner to the outer layers in three dimensions. Similar patterns were obtained by other studies like Grieneisen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref> and Santuari <italic>et al.</italic> (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Santuari1">[18]</xref>; their model did also not include the apoplastic compartment) and supported by various reporter studies (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Sabatini1">[64]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Brunoud1">[45]</xref>). Although Grieneisen <italic>et al.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref> have simulated stable (2D) growth of the root tip, the lateral gradients were not recognized as problematic probably due to the fact that relative movement of cells (cell sliding) is possible with their (cellular Potts instead of vertex-based) framework. We have proposed various strategies to circumvent the ULSR conflict. It has been pointed out that several hormones are exerting their regulatory effect on the root in a cell-layer specific way <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-UbedaToms1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Swarup1">[14]</xref>. This provides a way out of the ‘ULSR’ conundrum if accompanied by rapid transversal transmission to the other tissue layers. Candidate molecules to act as secondary transported signal are only just surfacing. On the other hand, even layer-driven growth by direct mechanical transduction was successful in producing a realistic root phenotype according to the three defined criteria. The role of auxin must by all means be understood in the complex context of various downstream response factors (with variations in levels, localisation, <italic>etc.</italic> (<italic>e.g.</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Vernoux1">[48]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Santuari1">[18]</xref>) and also of other hormones that interfere via their respective signalling pathway components. We constructed a model based on the antagonistic role of auxin and cytokinin in root development, with the SHY2 transcription factor as a central regulator of meristem size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-DelloIoio1">[65]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Muraro2">[67]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Moubayidin1">[53]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Moubayidin2">[54]</xref> and gibberellin (GA) dilution determining cell maturation. Simulations with this model were in accordance with the ULSR and reproduced visual and kinematic observations as well as the expected increase and decrease of meristem size upon addition of auxin and cytokinin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster3">[34]</xref>. By down-regulating PIN-mediated transport through the transcription factor SHY2, cytokinin effectively flattens the lateral auxin gradient, at the basal end of the division zone (‘transition zone’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Verbelen1">[6]</xref>), thereby signalling the exit of proliferation and start of differentiation without conflicting the ULSR. GA dilution has been proposed before as part of a more intricate mechanism (including cell compartments and DELLA proteins, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Band2">[19]</xref>) determining the exit of the elongation phase in a single cell row of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root. We have used growth dilution of GA in a simplified form with a GA production term proportional to (initial) cell width to account for layer-specific differences in GA concentration. Cell elongation is defined to stop as soon as the GA concentration drops below a specific GA minimum, which depends on reaching a certain cell size (and accordingly length). This could account for the similarity in cell lengths at the end of the EZ which has been observed under different conditions in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster3">[34]</xref>.</p>
<p>Various definitions exist for the term ‘robustness’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Kitano1">[68]</xref>. We define it here in a broad sense as a property that allows a system to maintain its functions in the context of internal and external perturbations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Kitano2">[69]</xref>. ‘Function’ pertains to maintaining stable growth upon internal changes or changing growth conditions (external). Some of our simulations showed that, in the absence of feedback from spatial cues, and driven by cell proliferation, cellular defects (for instance leading to differences in cell cycle time) can propagate. In contrast to cell-autonomous regulation a more dictatorial or hierarchical form of regulation (in this case via organ-scale spatial signals), is more robust to local perturbations. A possible trade-off of such a dictatorial system might be its sensitivity to mutations in the controlling network itself <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-QuintonTulloch1">[70]</xref> as supported by experimental studies on PIN mutants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Friml1">[71]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Blilou1">[72]</xref>. At the same time, such a high sensitivity to modulations in the control system may be beneficial for plants, being sedentary and therefore requiring a great deal of developmental plasticity. This trade-off also applies to the degree of dependence of cell growth and division. In theory, a completely independent regulation of these processes allows for a much wider morphological space to be accessible. Evidently, reaching stable balanced growth would become far more challenging. As the mechanistic coupling of growth and division is still poorly characterized <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Gonzalez1">[73]</xref>, we opted here to couple those processes to various degrees in an artificial way, for instance as synchronized counters and timers, or concurring spatial transitions. Integrating an explicit model of the cell cycle in our models would undoubtedly further progress our understanding of how the coordination of those processes affects root morphogenesis.</p>
<p>Starting from a simple grid and by stepwise evaluation of regulatory mechanisms for cell division and expansion, we have obtained a model that produces realistic root growth according to well-defined criteria. In that respect spatial regulation appears to be essential, presumably with auxin as the central signal that is modulated by feedback interaction with cytokinin. This represents an important step towards predicting the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> root phenotype under various conditions using vertex-based modelling. As indicated above, more advanced representations of cell wall mechanics, cell cycle regulation, <italic>etc.</italic> would benefit this model, and are currently being developed.</p>

<title>Methods</title>
<p>A vertex-based modelling approach based on the modelling software VirtualLeaf <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Merks1">[25]</xref> was used to represent a growing root apex that consists of nodes (vertices) connected by edges. Cells are polygons and cell wall segments correspond to the edges. Mechanically the edges are acting as linear springs which are opposing the tendency of cells to increase their area by virtue of their target areas. This is mathematically expressed as terms in a generalized energy function (or ‘Hamiltonian’), which was slightly modified to represent balanced linear growth (in the sense that small cells contribute equally to the energy function as larger cells, if they have identical relative growth rates).</p>
<p>Original Hamiltonian:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003910.e014"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003910.e014" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(1)</label></disp-formula>Where indices <italic>i</italic> and <italic>j</italic> sum over all cells and polygon edges, respectively, <italic>λ<sub>A</sub></italic> is a parameter setting the cells' resistance to compression or expansion, and <italic>λ<sub>M</sub></italic> is a spring constant. <italic>A<sub>T</sub></italic> is the cell's target area, <italic>L<sub>T</sub></italic> the wall element target length.</p>
<p>In the new Hamiltonian the first term is replaced by:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003910.e015"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003910.e015" xlink:type="simple"/><label>(2)</label></disp-formula>The cell mechanics algorithm in VirtualLeaf randomly displaces all nodes to steer the system towards a global energy minimum. During this Metropolis Monte Carlo simulation any node displacement that leads to an energy decrease (or a small energy increase corresponding to a high Boltzmann probability) is accepted <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Merks1">[25]</xref>. Added example input xml files contain the mechanical and numerical integration settings for simulation and illustrate the data structure used to describe the state of the cellular grid (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s001">Dataset S1</xref>). Besides the mechanical framework cells and cell walls are endowed with biochemical properties represented by reaction and transport equations and logical rules that determine when and how cell division occurs and how the cellular surface energy terms change. Our approach is to alter the structure of those equations and rules rather than just change parameter values to compare the output of the model versions.</p>
<p>The cellular organisation of the root tip was inspired by an earlier study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref> and always starts from a regular grid of rectangular cells, sometimes with narrower inner cell layers roughly in accordance to root anatomical characteristics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Dolan1">[7]</xref>. The upper cell row always consisted of fixed nodes to enforce downward growth. Across all simulations the three lowest cell rows are not driven to grow in size (via their fixed target areas) and are meant to represent the complex of columella cells together with the quiescent centre (QC). Although this part of the root apex (root cap) has its own detailed developmental characteristics, we strictly focus here on the proximal/basal side of the QC while excluding the distal meristem as part of the growth process. The formative asymmetric divisions of the stem cells surrounding the QC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Scheres1">[74]</xref> were neither included.</p>
<p>The models in principle describe growth in two dimensions but it was assumed that transversal expansion is severely constrained, which is in correspondence with experimental data indicating little or no tangential expansion (&lt;1% h<sup>−1</sup>: <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Baskin1">[75]</xref>).</p>
<p>Cell walls behave as elastic springs with vertically oriented walls contributing less to the energy function (typically scaled down 5 or 10 times). This is sufficient to allow fluent elongation of cells along the root axis while keeping cell shape adequately constrained as required by turgor pressure acting on the cell walls. The output repertoire is limited both by our <italic>a priori</italic> model assumptions and by computational limits compared to what can be observed <italic>in vitro</italic> or <italic>in vivo</italic>. Briefly, lateral root formation and tropic responses such as gravitropism, coiling, waving, skewing are not produced. Model simulations do allow assessment of root growth rate and size, as well as detailed kinematics (the latter is in principle even more flexible than in a classical experimental setting where sampling has temporal and spatial limitations. It is also possible to assess deformation of overall organ shape to some degree (given the strong horizontal constraints) but especially defects in internal tissue organisation. At the cellular level the resolution of the simulations is sufficient to observe cell shape deformations.</p>
<p>The experimental data for comparison of simulated cell length distributions with the real <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> primary root (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g002">Figure 2</xref>) were obtained by kinematic analysis of one typical seedling grown in the same conditions as described in Beemster and Baskin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Beemster1">[5]</xref>. Curve fitting was in general obtained by smoothing and interpolation at an interval of 5 to 25 µm using the kernel smoothing function ‘locpoly’ of the KernSmooth package <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Wand1">[76]</xref> for the R statistical package (R foundation for Statistical Computing).</p>
<p><xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s014">Table S1</xref> presents a detailed overview of the models described in this paper. Except for <italic>Model 9</italic> and <italic>Model 12</italic> (<italic>cf.</italic> <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g006">Figure 6</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g009">9</xref>), all models started off with 2 divisions of the cells in the row above the ‘QC’ (fourth row from below <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003910-g001">Figure 1B</xref>) to reduce the initial size of the cells and in some cases to introduce some asymmetry (noise) in that cell row. For cells to enter a new developmental phase requires the definition of a relative starting point in time. We have modelled this by associating a clock to each cell which is reset to zero as long as the daughter cells after cell division remain in contact with the non-growing cap structure. This results in cells in contact to the QC (hypothetically sensed by paracrine signalling for instance) remaining part of the stem cell niche ( = capable of self-renewal, ‘stemness’ <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-vandenBerg1">[77]</xref>) and dividing at a pre-set frequency. Upon loss of contact with the QC-cap structure, the cells assume the identity of a typical meristematic (DZ) cell until eventually losing the potential for division after for instance a fixed time or number of divisions.</p>
<p>Cell-autonomous timer, counter, and sizer mechanisms were implemented similarly to the exemplary fragments of VirtualLeaf (pseudo-)code in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003910.s016">Text S1</xref>.

<p><bold>Model overview.</bold> Overview of the models used in this study. Various categories w.r.t. developmental decisions are presented. Column (3) specifies the transition between division and elongation zone (DZ and EZ, respectively) with in parentheses the number of division or time since release form the QC; column (4) specifies the transition to mature (differentiated) cells based on timing since the release from the QC or a spatial signal at a fixed distance from the root apex; column (5) specifies whether division rate is determined via a timer or sizer mechanism; and column (6) how cellular growth rates are defined. Developmental events can be determined to happen after a fixed duration (‘Timer’), a fixed number of divisions (‘Counter’), a fixed cell size (‘Sizer’), and a fixed distance from the root apex (‘Positional’, <italic>i.e.</italic> a ruler). For Models 10–12 more complicated regulatory mechanisms are specified. In Model 4 extra random noise was added to the timer (+/− max. 25%). For Model 5 cell division is dependent on a timer mechanism, with a different cell cycle time for inner and outer layers. Model 6 uses a uniform size (area) criterion for cell division, irrespectively of geometry. For Model 7 the size criterion is adapted to the difference in the width between inner and outer layers, thereby acting effectively as a length criterion. In the other (non-cell autonomous) cases the cell division sizers differs between layers. It is usually assumed that DZ and EZ have a characteristic elongation rate (expressed as a constant addition to the target area or a fraction of the current cell area). Layer-specific differences are indicated (by column numbers) if necessary. All models are identical in that the columella/QC cells (lower 3 cell rows) cannot divide. For timer and counter based models the contact with the QC cells is important to keep them dividing. As soon as they lose contact the respective counter or timer starts to increase. For non-cell-autonomous models a morphogen threshold determines if cells keep dividing. For each model cell division occurs through the insertion of a new horizontal wall dividing the cell in half. For models using hormone transport parameter values were used in accordance with known modelling studies such as <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Grieneisen1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-CruzRamrez1">[17]</xref>, and Wabnik <italic>et al.</italic>, 2010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003910-Wabnik1">[79]</xref>.

Figures S11 and S12 illustrate parameter dependent behaviour and sensitivity. The model behaviour is robust to hormone transport parameters changes and even larger changes can in principle be accommodated based on the balance between a-polar and polar auxin transport and stable negative feedback regulation of auxin and cytokinin.</p>
