<abstract>
<p>Fibronectin (FN) exists in two forms—plasma FN (pFN) and cellular FN (cFN). Although the role of FN in embryonic blood vessel development is well established, its function and the contribution of individual isoforms in early postnatal vascular development are poorly understood. Here, we employed a tamoxifen-dependent cFN inducible knockout (cFN iKO) mouse model to study the consequences of postnatal cFN deletion in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the major cell type in the vascular wall. Deletion of cFN influences collagen deposition but does not affect life span. Unexpectedly, pFN translocated to the aortic wall in the cFN iKO and in control mice, possibly rescuing the loss of cFN. Postnatal pFN deletion did not show a histological aortic phenotype. Double knockout (dKO) mice lacking both, cFN in SMCs and pFN, resulted in postnatal lethality. These data demonstrate a safeguard role of pFN in vascular stability and the dispensability of the individual FN isoforms in postnatal vascular development. Complete absence of FNs in the dKOs resulted in a disorganized tunica media of the aortic wall. Matrix analysis revealed common and differential roles of the FN isoforms in guiding the assembly/deposition of elastogenic extracellular matrix (ECM) proteins in the aortic wall. In addition, we determined with two cell culture models that that the two FN isoforms acted similarly in supporting matrix formation with a greater contribution from cFN. Together, these data show that pFN exerts a critical role in safeguarding vascular organization and health, and that the two FN isoforms function in an overlapping as well as distinct manner to maintain postnatal vascular matrix integrity.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Fibronectin is a protein that exists in vertebrates in two distinct forms: one present in the blood and the other in blood vessel walls. In mammals, fibronectin is important for the development of blood vessels before birth, but whether it is continuously required for blood vessel homeostasis from birth to adulthood is unknown. We present important results from three genetically modified mouse models, which show that at least one form of fibronectin is required for the proper function and integrity of blood vessels during this period. We show that fibronectin can be transferred from the blood into the vessel wall, where it can rescue the integrity of blood vessels in the absence of the vessel form. This represents an important biological mechanism to maintain the health of blood vessels. Our data also highlight the importance of both fibronectin forms in producing and organizing the microenvironment of cells, with a higher contribution from the fibronectin form residing in the blood vessel walls. Together, our findings show that fibronectin from the blood acts as a safeguard to maintain the health of blood vessels, and both fibronectin forms play crucial roles in development and support of the blood vessel microenvironment.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Fibronectin (FN) is an abundant and ubiquitously expressed protein in the extracellular matrix (ECM) of various connective tissues as well as in blood of vertebrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref002">2</xref>]. Even though coded by a single gene [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref003">3</xref>], it exists in multiple isoforms as a result of alternate splicing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref004">4</xref>]. Each monomer of FN consists of three types of repeating units, FNI, FNII, and FNIII domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref005">5</xref>]. Alternative splicing occurs within the central array of FNIII repeats, leading to either inclusion or exclusion of the FNIII extra domain-A (EDA) and extra domain-B (EDB) domains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). Another region of alternative splicing occurs towards the C-terminus of this array, the V region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref006">6</xref>]. FNs occur in two principal forms, the soluble plasma FN (pFN) circulating in the blood and the cellular FN (cFN), which polymerizes into insoluble fibers in the ECM of tissues, including blood vessels [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref007">7</xref>]. pFN is synthesized exclusively in the liver by hepatocytes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref009">9</xref>] and shows a relatively simple splicing pattern lacking the EDA and EDB domains, although forms with and without the V region exist [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref010">10</xref>]. The soluble pFN circulates in blood at a high concentration of about 0.6 mg/mL in mice and about 0.3 mg/mL in humans [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref012">12</xref>]. The cFN consists of a much larger and more heterogeneous group of isoforms, with either EDA, EDB, or both domains present [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref013">13</xref>].</p>

<p>FN is broadly expressed in embryos and in adult tissue. It generally regulates a wide spectrum of cellular and matrix related functions that play crucial roles during development, including cell adhesion, migration, growth, differentiation, and tissue repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref014">14</xref>]. The pivotal role of FN as a master organizer of ECM assembly is well documented by cell culture studies. The list of ECM proteins that depend on FN for incorporation into the ECM is growing and includes collagen I and III [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref019">19</xref>], fibrillin-1 (FBN-1) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref021">21</xref>], fibulin (FBLN)-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref022">22</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref023">23</xref>], Latent TGF-β Binding Protein (LTBP)-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref024">24</xref>], LTBP-4 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref026">26</xref>], fibrinogen [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref027">27</xref>], thrombospondin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref016">16</xref>], and tenascin-C [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref028">28</xref>]. FN is not only required for the initiation of these ECM assemblies but also for the stabilization of some of them [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref024">24</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref029">29</xref>]. However, whether this holds true in vivo is not established.</p>
<p>The functional relevance of FN in critical physiological and pathological developmental processes is validated by severe defects in mice globally lacking the FN gene (<italic>Fn</italic>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref030">30</xref>], including vascular, mesodermal, and neural tube defects leading to death around embryonic day 9.5. Deletion of both EDA and EDB exons (present only in cFN) from <italic>Fn</italic> in mice also results in embryonic lethality with incomplete penetrance, displaying multiple embryonic cardiovascular defects [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref031">31</xref>]. Although pFN knockout (KO) mice have a normal life expectancy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref032">32</xref>], it is a critical player in various pathologies. pFN supports neuronal survival and reduces infarct size following cerebral ischemia [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref032">32</xref>]. It is also important in thrombosis, regulating thrombus stability and growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref033">33</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref034">34</xref>]. pFN worsens the course of atherosclerosis but promotes the formation of protective fibrous cap, which prevents plaque rupture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref035">35</xref>]. In humans, dysregulation of FN levels have been identified in various pathologies with cardiovascular manifestations, including atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref036">36</xref>], myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref037">37</xref>], Sturge-Weber Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref038">38</xref>], and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref039">39</xref>]. Altered circulating pFN levels have been reported in patients with coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref041">41</xref>] and ischemic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref042">42</xref>]. These studies highlight the importance of FN during embryonic vascular development and in postnatal diseases associated with the cardiovascular system.</p>
<p>The aim of this study was to elucidate the role of FN isoforms during postnatal vascular development, with a focus on the elastic fiber-rich tunica media. To specifically delete cFN in smooth muscle cells (SMCs), the most prevalent cells in the tunica media, we employed tamoxifen-dependent Cre recombinase under a smooth muscle specific promoter.

<p>It is well documented that FN is crucial in the development of blood vessels during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref044">44</xref>]. The vascular wall further undergoes extensive development during the early postnatal period, including an expansion in total wall volume and wall thickness accompanied by a doubling of SMC number and an increase in matrix volume [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref045">45</xref>]. The role of FNs during this phase is not known, and thus we addressed it in this study with a focus on cellular and matrix integrity of the aortic vascular media.</p>

<title>Efficacy and specificity of the inducible cellular FN deletion in the aortic media</title>
<p>We have generated a conditional cFN inducible KO (cFN iKO) mouse model that allows postnatal, tamoxifen-inducible deletion of cFN in SMC, the major cell type in the aortic media. Mice containing <italic>Fn</italic> flanked by loxP sites (<italic>Fn(fl/fl)</italic>) were crossed with an established transgenic mouse line (<italic>Sma-Cre-ER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic>), in which the expression of the tamoxifen-dependent Cre-ER<sup>T2</sup> recombinase is under the control of the mouse smooth muscle α-actin (<italic>α-SMA</italic>) promoter. After several breeding rounds, the cFN iKO genotype (<italic>Fn(fl/fl); Sma-Cre-ER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic>) was produced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; top panel) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref032">32</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref046">46</xref>]. The deletion of <italic>Fn</italic>, induced by intragastric tamoxifen injection (every day from P1–P3), was confirmed at P8 by a <italic>Fn</italic>-specific reverse transcriptase polymerase chain reaction (RT-PCR) of RNA isolated from the aortic media of the cFN iKO compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g001">Fig 1B</xref>; bottom panel). To further validate the efficiency and specificity of Cre recombinase expression in the <italic>Sma-Cre-ER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> mice following early postnatal tamoxifen injection (P1–P3), a Reporter-Cre mouse strain (<italic>R26(fl/fl); Sma-Cre-ER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic>) was generated (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g001">Fig 1C</xref>; top panel). In this mouse, the <italic>lacZ</italic> reporter gene coding for β-galactosidase is only transcribed in cells and tissues where Cre recombinase is expressed. Intense β-galactosidase staining of the aortic media harvested from tamoxifen-induced Reporter-Cre mice, but not of the tamoxifen-induced Cre negative Reporter-Control (<italic>R26(fl/fl)</italic>) mice, confirmed an efficient and specific expression of the Cre recombinase in the tunica media, identified by α-SMA staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g001">Fig 1C</xref>; middle and bottom panel).</p>

<title>Postnatal deletion of cellular FN in aortic media leads to a mild phenotype</title>
<p>Unexpectedly, tamoxifen-injected cFN iKO mice demonstrated a normal life span in the absence of any gross phenotype. To evaluate aortic tissue integrity of these mice, we performed histological analyses of the aortic wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2A–2H</xref>). FN guides assembly of several ECM proteins in cell culture models, but whether FN plays a similar role in vivo and what the contributions of the individual FN isoforms are have not been determined. Therefore, one major focus of this study was to analyze the contributions of FN to ECM assembly in the postnatal mouse aorta. FN acts as a scaffold for the assembly of collagen in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref019">19</xref>]. However, deleting <italic>Fn</italic> in the tunica media of the cFN iKO mice led to an unexpected increase of collagen deposition at 3 months of age as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2A–2C</xref>). Collagen deposition reverted back to control levels at 8 months of age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2E–2G</xref>). Despite the fact that cFN was deleted only in the tunica media, we observed differences in the adventitial collagen organization based on Masson’s trichrome staining and quantification of picrosirius red staining. Up to 3 months of age, the tamoxifen-treated cFN iKO showed a loose collagen deposition in the adventitia (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2B</xref>; triangles and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), whereas at 8 months, the pattern reverted to a denser collagen matrix as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2F</xref>; triangles and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2H</xref>). FN also promotes the assembly of fibrillin-1-containing microfibrils in cell culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref021">21</xref>]. Immunostaining of aortic sections for fibrillin-1 showed no changes in the aorta of cFN iKO as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s001">S1A and S1B Fig</xref>). Next, we investigated if postnatal deletion of cFN affects the formation of elastic lamellae in the aortic wall. The elastic lamellae were relatively normal, although they appeared to have more disruptions than the control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s001">S1C and S1D Fig</xref>). However, quantification of breaks and forks normalized to the area did not show statistically significant differences (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s001">S1E and S1F Fig</xref>). Overall, postnatal deletion of cFN in medial SMCs led only to minor changes in the matrix organization that did not affect the overall health of the mice.</p>

<title>Specific uptake of pFN in the vessel wall</title>
<p>Because FN is crucial for vascular development during embryogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref030">30</xref>], a much stronger phenotype was expected for the deletion of FN in the aortic wall during early postnatal development. To exclude the possibility that these minor phenotypes in cFN iKO mice were potentially a consequence of incomplete deletion of cFN in the aortic media layer, we immunostained aortic sections using a cFN-specific antibody that recognizes the alternatively spliced EDA domain, which is absent in pFN. This analysis clearly demonstrated that the EDA-containing cFN levels were very low, as expected, from an effective <italic>Fn</italic> deletion (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g001">Fig 1B</xref> bottom panel) for the cFN iKO, as compared to the controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2I–2K</xref>). However, staining with an anti-mouse FN antiserum that recognizes total FN (pFN and cFN) surprisingly revealed the presence of FN in the aortic media of the tamoxifen-induced cFN iKO, similar to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g002">Fig 2L–2N</xref>). These data led to the hypothesis that pFN from blood can transfer to the aortic wall, which in turn rescues a potential severe phenotype upon cFN deletion in the cFN iKO mice.</p>
<p>To test this hypothesis, exogenous pFN labeled with a fluorophore (Oyster-680), was injected intraperitoneally daily from P8 to P10 into tamoxifen-treated (P1–P3) control and cFN iKO mice, and mice were sacrificed and analyzed at P11. A strong fluorescent red signal in the ascending as well as in the descending aorta of both the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g003">Fig 3A and 3C</xref>) and cFN iKO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g003">Fig 3B and 3D</xref>) demonstrated an efficient transfer of Oyster-680–labeled pFN into the vessel wall. Within the vessel wall, the Oyster-680–labeled pFN localized to the elastic fibers (merged images in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g003">Fig 3A–3D</xref>), which were visualized label-free by detection of the elastin autofluorescence. To test if the transfer of intraperitoneally injected pFN to the vessel wall is specific for pFN, an Oyster-680–labeled 250 kDa polysaccharide dextran (similar molecular mass as a pFN monomer) was injected in an identical regimen as used for the fluorophore-labeled pFN. Contrary to the findings with injected pFN, no labeled dextran was observed in the aortic media of ascending and descending aortae of control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g003">Fig 3E and 3G</xref>) and cFN iKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g003">Fig 3F and 3H</xref>) mice. As an additional control to exclude the possibility of vascular leakiness, injected Oyster-680 alone did also not transfer into the vessel wall (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g003">Fig 3I–3L</xref>), despite a much smaller molecular mass (approximately 2 kDa) compared to pFN. These results clearly show that pFN efficiently translocates to the aortic wall in the absence of vascular leakiness.</p>

<title>Double knockout of cFN in SMC and pFN causes postnatal lethality</title>
<p>To further study the role of pFN and its functional interaction with cFN in the vasculature, we produced double knockout (dKO) mice deficient in pFN and cFN with the <italic>Fn(fl/fl); Sma-Cre-ER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/+; Alb-Cre/+</italic> genotype (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). These mice lack pFN from P3 onwards and are additionally inducible by tamoxifen to delete cFN in α-SMA expressing tissues. When both pFN and cFN are deleted in the tamoxifen-injected dKO (P1–P3 tamoxifen injection), the mice die postnatally between P3 and P20 (median age of death, P11.5). The Mendelian ratio was significantly reduced from the expected 25% to 4.23% by P30 (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.2004812.t001">Table 1</xref>). Necropsy of dead dKO mice showed hemorrhages in the thoracic cavity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g004">Fig 4D</xref>), indicating a severe phenotype in the vasculature due to combined loss of pFN and cFN in SMCs. Absence of any phenotypes in non–tamoxifen-injected <italic>Fn(fl/fl); Sma-Cre-ER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/+; Alb-Cre/+</italic> mice eliminated the possibility of Cre toxicity. These mice had a normal life span and were used as breeders to maintain the mouse colony. Tamoxifen-injected Cre-negative <italic>Fn(fl/fl)</italic> mice also survived normally, demonstrating the absence of tamoxifen side effects. All other analyses throughout this study were performed on mice dissected immediately after cardiac perfusion to optimally preserve the tissue structure. Immunostaining on dissected dKO aortic wall tissues using a FN antibody that recognizes both isoforms showed a complete absence of pFN and cFN in the media layer, as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g004">Fig 4E</xref>; triangles). Similarly, immunostaining with an EDA-specific antibody confirmed an effective deletion of cFN in the dKO (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g004">Fig 4F</xref>; triangles). These results validated that both pFN and cFN are normally present in the aortic wall. The postnatal lethality observed in the dKO suggested that at least one of the two FN isoforms is required for maintaining vessel wall integrity and function.</p>

<title>FN isoforms are important for maintaining cellular and matrix integrity of the vasculature</title>
<p>We further investigated the dKO mice for the consequences of complete FN deficiency on aortic wall development in the early postnatal period. We choose P8 for this analysis, because most dKO mice survive until this time point (median age of death, P11.5). To determine cell integrity, we stained aortic cross sections from all four tamoxifen-injected mouse strains with hematoxylin and eosin. SMCs in the aortic walls from dKO mice appeared to be disorganized, as compared to circumferentially aligned cells in the control aortic sections (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g005">Fig 5A</xref>; triangles). Frequently, but not always, we observed thinning of the aortic wall in the dKOs, as compared to the other strains analyzed. For a more detailed analysis, we performed transmission electron microscopy on aortic sections. The tunica media of dKO mice appeared disorganized, with curled and irregular elastic lamellae (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g005">Fig 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s003">S3 Fig</xref>; yellow triangles) and irregular shaped cell nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g005">Fig 5B</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s003">S3 Fig</xref>; red triangles) compared to control and single KO mice.</p>

<p>The affected elastic lamellae in the dKO led us to further investigate the consequences of <italic>Fn</italic> deletion on matrix integrity of the vascular wall, with a focus on ECM proteins important for elastogenesis. We analyzed FBN-1 in the vessel walls of the KO mice, because it constitutes the backbone of microfibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref050">50</xref>], which serve as a scaffold for elastin deposition and it is dependent on FN in cell culture studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref021">21</xref>]. Immunostaining clearly showed a reduction of FBN-1 in both the single KOs (cFN iKO and the pFN KO) and the dKO, as compared to the control, demonstrating that both pFN and cFN contribute to the deposition/assembly of FBN-1 in vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). Quantitative analysis revealed that the levels of deposited/assembled FBN-1 are lowest in the dKO and that cFN supports more FBN-1 deposition/assembly than pFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). pFN and cFN were similarly important for the deposition/assembly of FBLN-4, albeit it was reduced to the same level in all strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6B and 6E</xref>). For LTBP-4, which is also known to be dependent on FN for its assembly and is important in elastogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref025">25</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref051">51</xref>], cFN was important for its deposition/assembly but not pFN (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6C and 6E</xref>). To determine if loss of FN affects tropoelastin deposition, either directly or indirectly by affecting other ECM proteins, sections were immunostained with a tropoelastin antibody and mature elastic lamellae were visualized by autofluorescence in aortic sections of all mouse strains analyzed. Even though the mature elastic lamellae appeared relatively normal at this magnification (whereas electron microscopy shows disorganized elastic lamellae in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g005">Fig 5B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), immunostaining with tropoelastin antibody was much reduced in sections from cFN iKO and dKO mice, compared to the control and the pFN KO mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6D and 6E</xref>). Altogether, these data suggest a role of cFN in new tropoelastin deposition and in elastin assembly in vivo. To analyze if this tropoelastin reduction affects the total elastin deposited in the aorta, we biochemically determined the elastin content and cross-links after NaOH extraction of P8 aortae. Surprisingly, the elastin per total protein was significantly reduced in dKO mice, whereas no significant changes occurred in the cFN iKO and pFN KO mice, as compared to the control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). The cross-links desmosine (Des) and isodesmosine (Isodes) per total elastin content and their ratio were not altered between the mouse strains (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). mRNA expression analysis of the analyzed ECM components using quantitative polymerase chain reaction (qPCR) demonstrated elevated <italic>Fbn1</italic> mRNA levels in pFN KO aortae, which might represent a mechanism of the tissue to rescue reduced FBN-1 deposition/assembly (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). mRNA expression of <italic>Fbln4</italic>, <italic>Ltbp4</italic>, and <italic>Eln</italic> was not altered, demonstrating that FN isoforms exclusively impact the deposition/assembly of these proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). In summary, these data show that the complete loss of FN impacts early postnatal vascular development by affecting both cellular and matrix integrity of the vessel wall. The results also demonstrate for the first time that FN is important for the deposition of various elastogenic proteins in vivo and its isoforms have both common and distinct roles in the organization of elastogenic proteins in the aortic media.</p>

<title>Similar roles of FN isoforms in ECM assembly</title>
<p>The in vivo data indicated a functional relationship between pFN and cFN in matrix organization. To further study how the two isoforms interact with each other and contribute to its own assembly and deposition of other ECM proteins, a cellular model was developed. vSMCs from <italic>Fn(fl/fl); Sma-Cre-ER</italic><sup><italic>T2</italic></sup><italic>/+</italic> mouse aortae were treated with 4-hydroxytamoxifen (4-OH Tamox) for 3 days to induce cFN deletion.

RT-PCR showed an effective deletion of <italic>Fn</italic> upon treatment with 4-OH Tamox as compared to the EtOH-treated control (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7A</xref>). Immunoblotting of the serum-free conditioned medium collected from these cells using specific FN antibodies showed an effective reduction of cFN in 4-OH Tamox-treated cells, compared to the EtOH-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Indirect immunofluorescence of SMCs cultivated in FN-depleted medium additionally demonstrated the absence of a FN network in 4-OH Tamox-treated cells versus a fully developed network in the EtOH-treated cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). This result was further confirmed by the absence of FN in deoxycholate (DOC)-soluble and -insoluble fractions extracted from 4-OH Tamox-treated cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s005">S5 Fig</xref>). Deletion of <italic>Fn</italic> prevented the assembly of FBN-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7D</xref>) and of FBLN-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7E</xref>). This experimental model was then expanded by combining it with plasma obtained from control and pFN KO mice to test the functional relationship between pFN and cFN in matrix organization. The cells were tested under the following conditions: (1) cFN+/pFN+; (2) cFN+/pFN−; (3) cFN−/pFN+; and (4) cFN−/pFN− (for details, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec012">Materials and methods</xref>). Indirect immunofluorescence under these conditions and fiber length quantification showed that either cFN or pFN alone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7F</xref>; arrowheads) can form fibers, corroborating the functional in vivo data that showed that either one of the individual FN isoforms is sufficient for maintaining the vascular integrity. FN assembly is also enhanced in the presence of both isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7F</xref>; arrows and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s007">S1 Table</xref>), suggesting that the two isoforms can assemble together to form matrix fibers. Similarly, each of the two FN isoforms supported the formation of FBN-1 fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7G</xref>; arrowheads) as well as the deposition of FBLN-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7H</xref>; arrowheads). cFN contributed more than pFN in supporting FBN-1 fibers but equally in FBLN-4 deposition, corresponding with the in vivo data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6A, 6B and 6E</xref>). The results for LTBP-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7I</xref>; arrowheads) also correlated with the in vivo role of cFN in promoting LTBP-4 assembly and showed very little contribution of pFN. However, it is important to note that because of the selected sources of FN isoforms (mouse plasma for pFN and SMCs for cFN) to closely mimic the in vivo situation, the actual amounts of individual isoforms could be different. This could contribute to the differences observed between the cFN-containing condition (cFN+/pFN−) and the condition with pFN only (cFN−/pFN+). Tropoelastin and elastic fibers could not be detected in this cell system. For all proteins tested, the presence of both pFN and cFN mediated longer total fiber lengths and more junctions compared to the presence of only one FN isoform, suggesting the two isoforms of FN can contribute together in self-assembly and in guiding the assembly/deposition of other matrix proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g007">Fig 7</xref>, right panel; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s007">S1 Table</xref>).</p>

<title>Distinct roles of FN isoforms in ECM assembly</title>
<p>To analyze if there are actually differences between pFN and cFN in fiber formation and to guide the assembly of other ECM proteins, another cell model was developed that could assess the effects of equal amounts of purified cFN and pFN, unlike the SMC cell culture model, in which cFN was produced by the cells and pFN was present in the mouse plasma added.</p>

The absence of any FN fibers in this cell system was validated by indirect immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8A</xref>; Tris-buffered saline [TBS] control). An equal amount (25 μg/mL) of soluble purified pFN or cFN was added into the medium and the quality and quantity of fibers were analyzed. The fibers formed were clearly different between the two FN isoforms (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). cFN formed more mature and elongated fibers (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8A</xref>; arrows), whereas pFN formed fewer fibers and the fibers were shorter in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8A</xref>; arrowheads). Similar consequences were observed for both FN isoforms in guiding FBN-1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8B</xref>) and FBLN-4 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). For LTBP-4, cFN supported assembly/deposition, but pFN could barely support any fiber formation, corresponding well with the in vivo data (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8D</xref>).

These results demonstrate that pFN and cFN assemble differently and translate these differences onto dependent downstream ECM formation and deposition.

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>FN is a critical player in vascular biology, with essential roles in embryonic development, in various cardiovascular diseases, and in pathologies in which vascular development is a key process, such as in tumor progression. However, virtually nothing is known about the role of FN and its isoforms during physiological postnatal vascular development. Here, we report that deficiency of both hepatocyte-derived pFN and SMC-derived cFN arrests early postnatal aortic development, whereas either one FN isoform is sufficient to support vascular maturation at this developmental stage. We have identified a novel function of pFN in which it represents a safeguard in maintaining blood vessel wall integrity by translocating into the vessel wall. This is also the first report to show, in vivo, the role of FN as a “master organizer” for ECM assembly and to establish that both pFN and cFN have critical functions in vascular wall protein assembly/deposition.</p>
<p>From the initial global KO, it became clear that FN has a critical role in the development and homeostasis of the major blood vessels, as the mice die during embryogenesis around E9.5 with a variety of phenotypes, including defects in blood vessel development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref030">30</xref>]. Deletion of both alternatively spliced EDA and EDB exons (present only in cFN) from the <italic>Fn</italic> gene led to embryonic lethality by E10.5, displaying also multiple cardiovascular defects, including vascular hemorrhage, failure of remodeling embryonic and yolk sac vasculature, and defective placental angiogenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref031">31</xref>]. While cFN is essential for cardiovascular development during embryogenesis, we established from our study that postnatal conditional deletion of cFN in SMCs induced at P1–P3 only results in minor aortic phenotypes not affecting the life span of the mice, as pFN is able to rescue the functions. Similarly, postnatal deletion of pFN around P3 in our study did not result in any obvious aortic phenotype, because SMC-derived cFN is sufficient to maintain the vascular integrity. Therefore, both SMC-derived cFN and pFN are individually dispensable for the postnatal development and homeostasis of the thoracic aorta. However, the deletion of both FNs around P3 resulted in the death of most (&gt;80%) dKO mice until P30. These data demonstrate that at least one of the FNs is required for the continued postnatal development and stability of the thoracic aorta and that pFN can compensate for the loss of SMC-derived cFN. However, Murphy and colleagues reported that when FN was deleted globally (absence of both cFN and pFN) in adult mice, no vascular phenotype was observed, except when the mice were challenged by disturbed blood flow in the carotid arteries, resulting in enlargement of the aorta and hemorrhage [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref052">52</xref>]. The dependency on at least one—SMC-derived cFN or pFN—during early postnatal aortic development is likely due to the requirement of deposition of new ECM as the aorta grows and matures within the first 4 postnatal weeks [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref053">53</xref>]. It is known that new elastin deposition during this phase occurs at the fenestrations in the elastic lamellae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref054">54</xref>]. As the dKO mice die during this expansion phase, it is possible that FNs support a role in the deposition of new elastin at these fenestrations. This assumption is further supported by (i) ultrastructural tissue analysis, which showed irregular elastic lamellae, and (ii) biochemical data that showed reduced newly deposited elastin at P8 in the dKO mice. Taken together, these ECM deficiencies in the aortic media of the dKO mice are likely the cause for the postnatal lethality of these mice.</p>
<p>cFN iKO mice showed similar matrix defects in the tunica media compared to dKO mice at P8 when analyzed by immunofluorescence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g006">Fig 6</xref>). However, at later time points (8 months) no deficiencies in matrix components were observed in the cFN iKO, as compared to control mice (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004812.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). This indicates that it takes likely somewhat longer than P8 (5 days after tamoxifen injection) for pFN to fully rescue the functions of the deleted SMC-derived cFN, so that the cFN iKO mice develop and survive normally. Our cell culture data also support this hypothesis, as pFN can take over the functions of cFN, but only partially, when analyzed at the same time point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004812.g008">Fig 8</xref>).</p>
<p>It was shown in cell culture studies that pFN and cFN have similar but not identical cellular and biochemical functions. For example, the FN isoforms were equally effective in promoting cell spreading and mediating cell attachment to collagen and gelatin substrates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref055">55</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref056">56</xref>]. On the other hand, EDA/EDB containing cFN incorporated more efficiently into existing fibers compared to pFN [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref057">57</xref>]. We have identified qualitative and quantitative differences in the FN and FN-dependent fiber systems between the two FN isoforms. cFN formed and supported extended fibers, while pFN formed and guided shorter fibers. This is potentially the result of differential cross-linking of the two isoforms by transglutaminases, where cFN forms a very high molecular weight complex but does not form the intermediate multimers observed in pFN cross-linking [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref058">58</xref>]. In addition, different transglutaminases act on the two FN isoforms [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref059">59</xref>].</p>
<p>Our in vivo and cell culture data also provide new insights into the functional relationship of pFN and cFN, in which the two isoforms interact to self-assemble and support the deposition of elastogenic ECM proteins. We and others have previously shown in cell culture that the assembly of fibrillins are strictly dependent on FN fibers [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref021">21</xref>]. It is thought that small units of fibrillin-containing microfibrils are transferred to FN fibers for further elongation and maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref060">60</xref>]. Here, we demonstrate in cell culture and in vivo that both pFN and cFN support the assembly of FBN-1 and/or the deposition of microfibrils onto the elastic laminae, with greater contribution from cFN. We also identified a FN dependency for FBLN-4 assembly/deposition in cell culture and in vivo, which extends the list of FN-depending ECM fiber systems. It is currently not known, however, whether FBLN-4 interacts directly with FN or through other mediators, potentially including FBN-1. Two other critical elastogenic proteins, LTBP-4 and tropoelastin, showed a differential pattern, both requiring cFN for their assembly/deposition in vivo (and in cell culture for LTBP-4), whereas pFN was not required. The common aspect for both proteins is that their assembly is hierarchically dependent on the presence of FBN-1 and microfibrils [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref061">61</xref>] and thus only indirectly on the presence of FN fibers. One interpretation of these data is that cFN has additional functional or stabilizing consequences (not shared by pFN) on microfibrils that enable them to promote LTBP-4 and tropoelastin assembly. The data for FBN-1 and LTBP-4 are in contrast to what was found in tumors in which nearly complete FN deletion did not affect the assembly/deposition of these proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref062">62</xref>]. However, in that study, FN deletion was induced much later (5–6 weeks) than in our study, followed by tumor analysis at 12–13 weeks. It is possible that the dependency of FBN-1 and LTBP-4 on FN is primarily required in the early postnatal phase when blood vessels still undergo intensive remodeling and growth, or, alternatively, it is possible that this dependency is tissue specific (aorta versus tumor).</p>
<p>The concept of translocation of pFN from blood into tissues is known for several organs, including liver, spleen, brain, and bone [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref063">63</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref065">65</xref>]. Here, we provide novel data showing the function of the translocated pFN in the vascular wall of the aorta. Translocation and accumulation of pFN in the tunica media are not required for normal postnatal development and homeostasis of the aorta, evidenced by the absence of a phenotype in the pFN KO. However, in the absence of SMC-derived cFN in the tunica media, the translocated pFN is able to completely rescue a fetal phenotype (obvious in the dKO), leading to the concept of a critical safeguard function of pFN in maintaining vascular stability and health. This may help explain vascular manifestations in a variety of disorders associated with defective cFN expression, including atherosclerosis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref036">36</xref>], myocardial infarction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref037">37</xref>], Sturge-Weber Syndrome [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref038">38</xref>], and Ehlers-Danlos syndrome Type X [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref039">39</xref>] or altered circulating pFN levels, such as coronary heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref040">40</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref041">41</xref>] and ischemic heart disease [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref042">42</xref>].</p>
<p>For the translocation of pFN to the vascular wall, we have excluded a passive diffusion through a potentially leaky endothelial cell layer, as both 250 kDa dextran and the 2 kDa fluorophore do not enter the tunica media. Transcytosis, the transport of molecules across cells through coupled endocytosis and exocytosis transport pathways, is a hallmark of endothelial cells that is frequently mediated through caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref066">66</xref>]. Active transcytosis of albumin through endothelial cells, for example, has been shown to be dependent on caveolae [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref068">68</xref>]. While it is not known whether FN uses this pathway, FN can be turned over through integrin β1-mediated (e.g., α5β1) endocytosis regulated by caveolin-1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref069">69</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref070">70</xref>]. Thus, it is possible that pFN transcytosis follows a similar transport mechanism.</p>
<p>In summary, this study illuminates the critical role of FN isoforms in postnatal vascular development. It reveals a novel function of pFN, in which it transfers to the vessel walls to safeguard the role of cFN. The two isoforms play important differential and similar functions in maintaining the integrity and matrix stability of the vasculature.</p>

<p>For histological and immunohistological staining procedures, mice were humanely killed by an anesthetic overdose using a ketamine/xylazine/acepromazine cocktail. Mice were then cardiac-perfused with 10% neutral-buffered formalin, and aortae were harvested. After an overnight incubation in 10% neutral buffered formalin, the tissues were dehydrated through an increasing EtOH gradient and embedded in paraffin. Four micrometer sections were deparaffinized in CitriSolv (Decon Labs) and rehydrated with decreasing EtOH concentrations in H<sub>2</sub>O. The sections were stained with Hematoxylin and Eosin (general histology and cell orientation), Masson’s trichrome stain (collagen), picrosirius red (collagen), or Hart’s elastin stain using standard procedures. For immunostaining, the sections were treated for antigen retrieval with 10 mM citric acid, 0.05% Tween 20 (pH 6) at 98 °C, followed by treatment with bacterial type XXIV proteinase (10 μg/mL; Sigma #P8038). The sections were then incubated with primary antibody (monoclonal anti-human SMA Clone 1A4 [Dako #M0851] at a 1:100 dilution and polyclonal anti-mouse fibrillin-1 C-terminal half [generated in the lab] at 1:3,000).

<title>pFN and dextran translocation experiments</title>
<p>pFN and dextran translocation experiments were performed with litters injected with tamoxifen (P1–P3) to generate cFN iKOs and controls (<italic>Fn(fl/fl)</italic>). Human pFN (Millipore #FC010) or 250 kDa amino dextran (Fina Biosolutions #AD 250 × 100) were covalently coupled to the water-soluble activated fluorophore Oyster-680 N-hydroxysuccinimide ester (Boca Scientific) in 100 mM NaHCO<sub>3</sub>, 500 mM NaCl, pH 8.4. Oyster-680 emits light at 693 nm, which does not overlap with the known autofluorescence of elastic lamellae in the aorta. Unbound fluorophore was removed by dialysis against the coupling buffer, and the degree of labeling was calculated to be 3–4 molecules Oyster-680 per molecule of pFN or dextran. The labeled pFN or dextran was injected in mice intraperitoneally from P8 to P10 (0.13 mg per mouse per day) using an established protocol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref074">74</xref>]. TBS-deactivated Oyster-680 alone used at the same molar concentration served as control.

Cells were treated with 1 μM of activated 4-OH Tamox for 3 days to induce the deletion of <italic>Fn</italic> (deleted region as described above). EtOH, the solvent for 4-OH Tamox, was used as a control at a final concentration of 0.02% (same concentration as used for the 4-OH Tamox treatment). For experiments, cells were grown in medium containing fetal bovine serum depleted of pFN by gelatin sepharose chromatography [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref021">21</xref>]. Deletion of cFN was analyzed by RT-PCR from mRNA isolated from cells using RNeasy mRNA extraction kit (Qiagen). RT-PCR was performed as described above. Deletion was also analyzed at protein level by western blotting with 15 μL of conditioned medium (obtained after 24 hours) using 1:500 diluted anti FN antibody (Millipore #AB2033). Indirect immunofluorescence was performed after 7 days with 70% methanol/30% acetone fixed and permeabilized cells. Goat serum diluted in phosphate buffered saline (1:10) was used for blocking. Primary antibodies were prepared in blocking buffer and included polyclonal rabbit anti-mouse FN (Millipore #AB2033–1:500 diluted), anti-mouse FBN-1 (1:500 diluted), and anti-human FBLN-4 (1:500 diluted).

<p>Experiments were designed to mimic the three KO mouse models and the control in cell culture as follows: 4-OH Tamox and EtOH-treated cells were cultured in the presence of 10% mouse plasma prepared from either wild-type or pFN KO mice. The combinations used were: (1) cFN+/pFN+, EtOH-treated cells (cFN present) were grown in medium containing mouse plasma from control mice (pFN present); (2) cFN+/pFN−, EtOH-treated cells (cFN present) were grown in medium containing mouse plasma from pFN KO mice (pFN absent); (3) cFN−/pFN+, 4-OH Tamox-treated cells (cFN absent) were grown in medium containing mouse plasma from control mice (pFN present); and (4) cFN−/pFN−, 4-OH Tamox treated cells (cFN absent) were grown in medium containing mouse plasma from pFN KO mice (pFN absent). After 5 days, cells were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde and immunofluorescence was performed as described above, additionally with primary LTBP-4 antibody (1:500 diluted) and secondary Cy5 AffiniPure Goat anti-Rabbit IgG (H+L) antibody (Jackson Laboratories, 1:200 diluted). No LTBP-4 fibers were observed in this setup. However, when, instead of using mouse plasma, 40 μg/mL of purified soluble pFN was added to the system, LTBP-4 fibers formed. This could be due to factors present in the mouse plasma, which might affect LTBP-4 assembly.</p>
<p>Mouse embryonic fibroblasts differentiated from <italic>Fn</italic> null mouse embryonic stem cells were prepared as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004812.ref078">78</xref>].
