<abstract>
<p>Many infectious diseases are not maintained in a state of equilibrium but exhibit significant fluctuations in prevalence over time. For pathogens that consist of multiple antigenic types or strains, such as influenza, malaria or dengue, these fluctuations often take on the form of regular or irregular epidemic outbreaks in addition to oscillatory prevalence levels of the constituent strains. To explain the observed temporal dynamics and structuring in pathogen populations, epidemiological multi-strain models have commonly evoked strong immune interactions between strains as the predominant driver. Here, with specific reference to dengue, we show how spatially explicit, multi-strain systems can exhibit all of the described epidemiological dynamics even in the absence of immune competition. Instead, amplification of natural stochastic differences in disease transmission, can give rise to persistent oscillations comprising semi-regular epidemic outbreaks and sequential dominance of dengue's four serotypes. Not only can this mechanism explain observed differences in serotype and disease distributions between neighbouring geographical areas, it also has important implications for inferring the nature and epidemiological consequences of immune mediated competition in multi-strain pathogen systems.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>The population dynamics of multi-strain pathogens are often characterized by persistent and irregular fluctuations in disease incidence and strain prevalence levels over time. Previous theoretical approaches have often evoked strong immunological interactions between individual strains, such as cross-immunity, in order to explain these complex epidemiologies; however, spatial segregation between hosts and stochastic heterogeneities in transmission success are rarely considered in these studies. Here, with specific reference to dengue, we show that the stochasticities underlying disease transmission within a spatially explicit, agent-based model can give rise to multi-annual epidemic outbreaks and fluctuating pathogen population structures - even in the absence of immune competition. In contrast to previous modeling studies, which have resulted in ambiguous predictions about the exact nature and strength of interactions between dengue's four serotypes, our results present a parsimonious, demographic mechanism, that highlights the importance of spatial ecology for understanding and interpreting the epidemiological dynamics of dengue and other multi-strain pathogen systems.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Mathematical models based upon the various derivatives of the classic susceptible-infected-recovered (<italic>SIR</italic>) framework have greatly improved our understanding of the transmission and population dynamics of many important pathogens <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Anderson1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Levin1">[2]</xref>. Common to this class of models is their propensity to exhibit damped oscillations around an approaching equilibrium where the rate of new infections equals the loss from the infectious pool due to recovery. In reality, however, many infectious diseases will not remain in this state of equilibrium but instead exhibit persistent oscillations, ranging from seasonal increases in incidence rates to multi-annual epidemic outbreaks. Measles and influenza are just two examples of pathogens for which incidence levels can vary by orders of magnitude within a single year <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Grenfell1">[3]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Viboud1">[4]</xref>. External forces are often incorporated into models to reflect a seasonal increase or decrease in the number of infectious contacts or vector densities, for example, which move the system's dynamics away from its natural equilibrium into a regime characterised by periodic or chaotic oscillations, akin to those observed in nature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Earn1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Bauch1">[6]</xref>.</p>
<p>For antigenically diverse pathogens, periods of high or low infection rates or the timing by which one dominant antigenic strain is replaced by another strain, are often out of sync with those dictated by the external forces, however. Theoretical studies have therefore concentrated on biological or pathogen-intrinsic factors instead. Immunological interactions between the constituent strains in the form of cross-immunity or cross-enhancement have been repeatedly highlighted as some of the most important determinants of the epidemiological dynamics of multi-strain pathogens. Under this scenario, enhanced competition for susceptible hosts can offer a temporary selective advantage to a particular strain or subset of strains, causing their amplification and subsequent decline. This process of immune-mediated selection has been proposed to underlie the population biology of a variety of important pathogens, including the influenza virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Ferguson1">[7]</xref>, <italic>Plasmodium falciparum</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Gupta1">[8]</xref>, <italic>Vibrio cholerae</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Koelle1">[9]</xref>, dengue virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Ferguson2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Recker1">[12]</xref>, respiratory syncytial virus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-White1">[13]</xref> and rotavirus <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Pitzer1">[14]</xref>.</p>
<p>Whereas many deterministic multi-strain models rely on the presence of immune interactions to destabilize the system, existing natural variabilities or stochasticities in the interactions between the relevant players have also been shown sufficient to generate regular or chaotic oscillations in single-strain and ecological predator-prey systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Bartlett1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Simonis1">[19]</xref>. Furthermore, demographic stochasticities have been found to play an important role when relaxing the assumption of homogeneous mixing and when taking spatial ecological aspects into consideration. In this scenario, spatial heterogeneities due to host-population structure or local ecological variations can create short-lived spatial refuges <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Lynch1">[20]</xref> and significantly affect pathogen persistence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Keeling1">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Read1">[23]</xref>.</p>
<p>The consideration of spatio-temporal variations is of particular importance for vector-borne pathogens, where the underlying drivers of the observed epidemiologies may be confounded by substantial heterogeneities in host and vector densities through space and time, as in the case of the dengue virus (DENV). DENV's population comprises four antigenically related viral groups, or serotypes (DENV1-4), that are the cause of clinically indistinguishable illnesses in humans. Different immunological interactions in the form of antibody-dependent enhancement (ADE) or temporary and/or partial cross-immunity have been independently proposed as the driving forces behind the virus' complex epidemiology that comprises multi-annual epidemic outbreaks and sequential replacement of dominant serotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Ferguson2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Recker1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Cummings1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Aguiar1">[27]</xref>. Although these differential equation models qualitatively capture dengue's epidemiological dynamics, they do not consider the natural variability in disease transmission across time and space and thus cannot account for observed differences in incidence and serotype distribution within endemic regions (see e.g. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Veeraseatakul1">[28]</xref>). Meta-population and agent-based models allow a more explicit description and investigation of demographic and spatial, ecological stochasticities <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Levins1">[29]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Hanski1">[31]</xref>, and thus provide a natural alternative to study these host-pathogen systems.</p>
<p>Here, using dengue as a case study, we show that heterogeneities and stochasticities underlying host-vector contacts can give rise to persistent oscillations in multi-strain pathogen systems, even in the absence of immune competition between antigenic types. We demonstrate that viral persistence is significantly enhanced through the temporal generation of susceptibility pockets within the population, leading to highly heterogeneous distributions in disease and serotype prevalence that can explain observed geographic differences in dengue endemic regions. Complimentary to immune interaction, host demographic factors and vector ecologies thus emerge as important drivers of dengue's epidemiological dynamics.</p>

<title>Results</title>
<p>To examine the effects of spatial structuring and stochasticities in disease transmission on the qualitative dynamics of a multi-strain pathogen system, and understand how this might help explain some of the observed epidemiological features of dengue, we first extended a previously analysed single-strain model with homogeneous mixing <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Alonso1">[18]</xref> to incorporate multiple strains; for this part we used the original parameter set for direct comparison between this extended and the original model (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). We then developed this model into a dengue-specific framework by including mosquito vectors, seasonality and spatial population structuring, together with dengue-relevant parameter values (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003308-t001">Table 1</xref>). Unless stated otherwise, we analysed the dynamical behaviour of these models in the absence of immunological strain interactions except for the prevention of superinfection. The epidemiological frameworks of both models are detailed in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section.</p>

<title>Non-spatial dynamics</title>
<p>Using a stochastic, agent-based framework we first analysed the dynamics of a host-pathogen system comprising 4 co-circulating antigenic types under the assumption of homogeneous mixing within the population. Contrasting the predictions of deterministic multi-strain models, in which the dynamics inevitably converge towards a stable equilibrium in the absence of strong immune competition, the system exhibited sustained oscillations in the total number of infections and out-of-phase oscillations in strain prevalence, as illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g001">Figure 1A</xref>. In agreement with previously studied stochastic single-strain systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Verdasca1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Alonso1">[18]</xref>, these dynamics are driven by the amplification of stochastic effects at the individual level, which keep each strain in a transient regime rather than approaching the expected deterministic equilibrium. At the same time, short-term stochastic differences in each strain's transmission success accumulate in time and start to generate significant asymmetries in the immunity profile within the host population, which then leads to the desynchronisation between strains.</p>

<p>(<bold><italic>A</italic></bold>) The simulated time series of an agent-based, multi-strain model of a directly transmitted pathogen show irregular oscillations in total (black lines, top graphs) and strain-specific (coloured lines, bottom graphs) even in the absence of immunological interactions or asymmetries between pathogen strains. (<bold><italic>B</italic></bold>) Changing the system to describe a vector-transmitted pathogen, including intrinsic and extrinsic incubation periods, results in an overall increase in mean incidence and decrease in the risk of stochastic extinction.

<p>This extreme case of minimal strain interaction more resembles a system of four co-circulating but unrelated pathogens. Not surprisingly, therefore, we found that the periods of oscillations in total incidence and strain prevalence were essentially the same, determined by the parameters relating to pathogen transmission and host demography (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003308.s001">Figure S1A</xref> in electronic supplementary material). In the case of dengue, however, differences between the inter-epidemic period and average cycle length in strain prevalence have been well documented <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Nisalak1">[32]</xref>. We therefore extended the model to incorporate mosquito vectors and used dengue-relevant epidemiological parameters values (see <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003308-t001">Table 1</xref>) to investigate the effect of stochastic amplifications on the virus's epidemiological dynamics and inter-epidemic periods. The resulting qualitative dynamics in terms of persistent oscillations in incidence and serotype prevalence appeared invariant to the addition of mosquito vectors but showed a significant increase in average disease prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). This increase was mainly caused by a reduction in the risk of stochastic extinction due to the inclusion of viral incubation periods as well as the increase in the basic reproductive number from <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the directly transmission model to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in the vector model. Importantly, also, we started to observe a divergence between the epidemic and serotype periodicities (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003308.s001">figure S1B</xref> in electronic supplementary material) and also found epidemic peaks more likely to be comprised of multiple serotypes.</p>
<p>Further including seasonality through annual variations in mosquito densities (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) resulted in dengue-like epidemiological behaviour with a distinct seasonal signature, strong multi-annual periodicities in incidence and fluctuating distribution in serotype prevalence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). This behaviour was further accompanied by a considerable increase in peak incidence levels and more pronounced epidemic troughs, which could partly be explained by an increase in the average <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> but also by the strong synchronizing effect of vector seasonality on serotype dynamics.</p>

<p>We hypothesized that the occurrence of large epidemic outbreaks (as seen in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) was partly facilitated by our assumption of homogeneous mixing, which facilitates rapid disease transmission throughout the whole population. We thus restructured our model into a meta-population formulation by subdividing the human and mosquito populations into sets of spatially arranged communities (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>) and examined the effect of spatial segregation between hosts on the epidemiological dynamics of this multi-strain system. Within this set-up we assumed that individuals get infected predominantly by mosquitoes of their own and surrounding communities and with a small probability, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e008" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, by mosquitoes from distant communities through (temporal) human movements, or visits, to these communities. We argued that because of the limited flight range of <italic>Aedes</italic> mosquitoes, human movement is more important for long-distance transmission <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Adams2">[33]</xref> and therefore assumed <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e009" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be independent of geographic distance, contrasting continuous and distance-dependent dispersal kernels often employed in spatial ecological models (but also see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Adams2">[33]</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Blasius1">[34]</xref> for alternative realisations).</p>
<p>With the addition of this spatial component the system exhibited more defined seasonal dynamics as well as a lower variability in the epidemic behaviour (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g002">Figure 2A</xref>), with the overall temporal dynamics closely resembling epidemiological time series from dengue endemic regions with the characteristic multi-annual cycles in epidemic outbreaks and sequential serotype dominance (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g002">Figure 2B</xref> showing data from Puerto Rico, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003308.s002">Figure S2</xref> showing data from Thailand, Mexico and Vietnam).

<title>The effects of population structure and host mobility</title>

To further address the effects of spatial structuring and host mobility on our simulated epidemiologies, we quantified key epidemiological properties, such as mean prevalence (averaged over humans and vectors), extinction risk and serological age-profiles in the population, in response to changes in these parameters.</p>
<p>Increasing spatial structuring, and thereby decreasing the size of each sub-population, reduced the variability in total annual outbreak size and local serotype co-circulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), here defined as the percent time where multiple serotypes are present in a given patch. Although the overall force of infection was not affected by the increase in population structure, as evidenced by the constant average ages of primary or secondary infections (right panel, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g004">Figure 4A</xref>), total infection prevalence increased as a result of a reduction in the risk of serotype extinction. This indicates that spatial segregation between hosts greatly reduces the propensity for large-scale, population-encompassing outbreaks by restricting a pathogen's access to the susceptible pool, which is also in agreement with previous studies in the context of disease transmission through complex or/and heterogeneous networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Verdasca1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Keeling2">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Favier1">[39]</xref>.</p>

<title>The effect of host mobility on spatial synchrony</title>
<p>We next analysed the degree of epidemic synchrony, or coherence, between communities under variations in host mobility.

This is further illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g005">Figure 5A</xref> for two different values of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, showing a transition to a less variable but a more patchy distribution of susceptibility to DENV1 with an increasing rate of long-distance transmission events. When disease transmission was predominantly local (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>), as expected, we observed that spatial synchrony was dependent on spatial distance (blue line in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g005">Figure 5B</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1003308.s003">Figure S3</xref>).

<title>The effects of serotype immune interactions</title>
<p>Although dengue-characteristic dynamics could be obtained even in the absence of immune interaction between the virus's four serotypes, temporary (serotype-transcending) cross-immunity and ADE have previously been proposed as important drivers of dengue epidemiology, and we therefore analysed their effects within this spatial setting. As demonstrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g003">Figures 3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g004">4</xref> (right panels), the time required for an individual to acquire a secondary, heterologous infection (HEP) was on average in the order of 4–5 years. While this is in general agreement with a previous study from Thailand <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Gibbons1">[45]</xref>, and might also explain the peak in older children in the age-profiles of dengue haemorrhagic fever (DHF) in endemic regions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Nisalak1">[32]</xref>, it is much higher than the reported 3–9 months period of serotype-transcending immunity following a primary infection <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Sabin1">[46]</xref>. Consequently, and contrary to previous predictions based on continuous and homogeneous mixing models, the inclusion of temporary cross-immunity did not have a significant effect on the simulated, qualitative epidemiologies within our stochastic and spatially explicit framework. When quantifying key epidemiological characteristics under changes to the duration of temporary immunity, we found that only once this period increased beyond 12 months there was a small, negative effect on infection prevalence and epidemic variability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g006">Figure 6A</xref>). On the other hand, even short periods of transcending immunity had a significant effect on both serotype extinction risk and periodicity, suggesting its regulatory role on how the different viruses can explore the susceptibility (spatial) landscapes.</p>

Due to higher susceptibility and co-circulation this also leads to a drop in the age of primary and particularly secondary infection. The oscillatory behavior in serotype prevalence is maintained given the parameter variations, with periods between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>8 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>12 years in (<italic>A</italic>) and between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>6 and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>9 years in (<italic>B</italic>).

<p>In contrast to temporary cross-immunity, immune enhancement through the process of ADE had a more noticeable and anticipatory effect. That is, increasing the probability of transmission through the enhancement of secondary, heterologous infections led to an increase in disease prevalence along with an increase in epidemic variability, serotype co-circulation and viral extinction risk (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g006">Figure 6B</xref>), which is broadly in line with previous studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Ferguson2">[10]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Recker1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Cummings1">[24]</xref>. The increase in prevalence did not significantly affect the average age at which individuals experience their first infection, however, whereas the age of secondary infection showed a more dramatic reduction. In fact, due to the combined effect of elevated serotype co-circulation and an increase in the susceptibility to secondary infections through ADE, even moderate levels of enhancement caused the HEP to go below the average time at which individuals experience their first infection. Hence, in the presence of population structure, ADE, and especially its proposed susceptibility enhancing manifestation, may induce a signature in the epidemiological age-profiles of the population that is characterised by a longer period for first infection than the time required for heterologous exposure, which has indeed been observed in studies of clinical infections in dengue endemic areas <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Nisalak1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Gibbons1">[45]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Thai2">[47]</xref>.</p>

To quantify the effects of changes to viral transmission, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> in general, we analysed the model behaviour, in the absence of immune interactions, under variations in key parameters related to dengue's basic reproductive number, whose derivation within this framework can be found in the <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> section.</p>
<p>Specifically, we investigated the effects of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> through variations in the probability of transmission per mosquito bite, using both symmetric and asymmetric transmission probabilities, viral incubation periods (both intrinsic and extrinsic) and mosquito vector density.

<p>Understanding the evolutionary forces that shape the spatio-temporal patterns of pathogen populations is essential for disease control and public health planning. Important new insights into the population dynamics of host-pathogen systems have been gained by the application of deterministic mathematical models to the study of many important infectious diseases <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Anderson1">[1]</xref>. Nevertheless, stochastic and discrete events significantly influence the real world counterpart of such systems and their explicit incorporation can provide alternative frameworks in which to examine major determinants of the observed epidemiologies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Verdasca1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Favier1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Bolker1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Buckee1">[53]</xref>. In this context, demographic stochasticity has been suggested to be an important driver for population oscillations in single-strain epidemiological systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Earn1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Bauch1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Verdasca1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Alonso1">[18]</xref>. Here we advanced upon previous findings by studying the dynamical behavior of dengue's four antigenic types within a stochastic and spatially explicit framework.</p>
<p>Dengue's epidemiological dynamics have been the focus of extensive theoretical research that often concentrated on the immunological interactions between its four serotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Ferguson2">[10]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Recker1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Cummings1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Nagao1">[26]</xref>. Protective and infection-enhancing effects of cross-reacting antibodies have been well documented both <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Sabin1">[46]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Halstead1">[54]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Dejnirattisai1">[55]</xref>. Less clear, however, is their contributing effect to disease transmission and general epidemiology. For example, although a short period of 3 to 9 months of serotype-transcending immunity following a primary infection has been demonstrated by direct experiment, the average time between consecutive, heterologous infections is often found to be an order of magnitude higher <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Gibbons1">[45]</xref>. Equally, despite the reported increase in within-host viral replication through antibody-dependent enhancement of secondary, heterologous infections and observed correlations between disease severity and previous exposure, it is currently not known if and how much this increase in viral load contributes to total dengue transmission, especially when taking into consideration that severe, clinical cases may constitute only a small fraction of all dengue infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Nisalak1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Gibbons1">[45]</xref>, and that viraemia appears to peak earlier but also clears faster during secondary, heterologous infections <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Tricou1">[56]</xref>.</p>
<p>In contrast to previous model predictions, our results could not ascertain a decisive role of either temporary cross-immunity or ADE in driving the complex epidemiological dynamics of dengue. That is, while our findings do not question the pathological or clinical significance of immune interactions <italic>per se</italic>, they suggest that the strength of within-host serotype interactions, and therefore the consequences of acquired immunity, are unlikely to be the sole drivers of the complex epidemiological dynamics of dengue. Crucially, the results herein presented further suggest that such cross-immunological reactions, at least within biological reasonable ranges, would not cause significant spatio-temporal signatures that could allow the inference of their presence to be unambiguously resolved from studying epidemiological time series alone. More detailed data, for example from human infectivity studies that relate infection history with clinical outcome and infection/transmission probabilities, are essential to close the gap in our understanding of the full transmission potential of dengue. Furthermore, to better understand the importance of host demographic factors and spatial ecology highlighted in this work, a phylodynamics approach could be considered in which the spatio-temporal evolution of dengue genotypes is simulated and compared to available data from different settings across the endemicity spectrum.</p>
<p>Dengue's recent molecular evolution is characterized by strong intra-serotype purifying selection with no clear trend for continuous antigenic change. As DENV has evolved to replicate efficiently in both the vertebrate and arthropod hosts, it is thought to express a compromise genome in which most structural mutations are expected to be deleterious and selectively removed from the population <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Weaver1">[57]</xref>. On the other hand, strong ecological bottlenecks and inter-serotype competition can severely hamper the emergence of viral mutants even if they express advantageous phenotypes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Loureno1">[58]</xref>. The cyclical replacement of dengue's four serotypes is therefore not expected to be driven by the same inter-strain selective forces that have (reportedly) shaped the phylodynamics of antigenically rapidly evolving pathogens, such as influenza A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Minayev1">[59]</xref>, for example. It instead argues for a critical role of demographic and ecological stochasticities underlying both dengue's epidemiology and molecular evolution.</p>
<p>The strong impact of host population structures and mobility highlighted in this work also corroborates the hypothesis that DENV's (re-)emergence and world-wide success is mainly due to current demographic and ecological trends rather than viral adaptation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Favier1">[39]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Weaver1">[57]</xref>. To understand dengue's epidemiology in the long-term, it is therefore crucial to establish how these meta-population disease dynamics correlate with evolutionary constraints and respective selective signatures. Importantly, the discrete nature of our framework and its meta-population formulation readily allow to explore more realistic population structures, including heterogeneities in (host and vector) population sizes and/or connectivity between sub-populations, for example by means of complex network structures, and to simulate viral evolution in time and space within these frameworks. Our model thus presents itself as a good starting point for a more thorough investigation of DENV's phylodynamics <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Grenfell3">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>Accounting for community-specific vector control and drug intervention policies is equally possible within this meta-population formulation and constitutes another important extension for future studies on the control of vector-borne diseases. For example, candidate vaccines against dengue that are in advanced stages of clinical trials might require a prime-boost protocol running over a period of up to 12 months, which has been indicated as a potential concern due to the risk of severe disease during the time when antibody-levels are at sub-neutralizing titers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Schmitz1">[61]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Group1">[62]</xref>. By reproducing the spatial heterogeneity in disease prevalence and serotype distribution we found the timing between consecutive, heterologous infections to be highly variable in space. Our observations thus reassert that spatially explicit epidemiological frameworks, as the one presented here, are essential for assessing the risks and efficacies of vaccine introduction strategies against dengue <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Group1">[62]</xref>.</p>
<p>In summary, the results presented here have highlighted the importance of considering spatial segregation between individual hosts and vectors and stochasticities in disease transmission for understanding the epidemiology of dengue and other related pathogens. Previous theoretical studies have demonstrated that immune interactions can significantly influence the population dynamics of multi-strain pathogen systems. The inclusion of host and vector ecologies adds to this understanding and provides complimentary hypotheses about the underlying causes for the oscillatory nature in incidence and serotype distributions that commonly characterize their complex epidemiologies.</p>

<title>Individual-based models</title>
<p>To study the stochastic dynamics of a multi-strain pathogen we used an individual-based model, realised as a discrete-time, random process with finite state-space (Markov chain), is which a state refers to the host's epidemiological profile, such as infection status and immune history. Demographic, biological and ecological stochasticities were derived from the probabilistic nature of state transitions, e.g. in the probability that the bite of an infectious mosquito leads to an infection. The size of the host population was kept constant with deaths being replaced by newborns. We assumed an age-dependent risk of mortality for both humans and mosquitoes, described by the continuous Weibull distribution:<disp-formula id="pcbi.1003308.e035"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e035" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e036" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is the host age, and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e037" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e038" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> are the shape and scale parameters, respectively.</p>

<title>Dengue model</title>
<p>To model the population dynamics of dengue and its four serotypes (DENV1-4) we extended the initial model (see above) and added mosquito vectors to the system together with the virus's intrinsic (human host) and extrinsic (mosquito host) incubation periods, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively. Only the susceptible, exposed and infectious states of the epidemiologically relevant adult life-stage of the mosquito were considered. To account for seasonal variation in vector densities, we assumed an annually driven mosquito birth rate, with the maximum number of vectors per human determined by <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as previously used in <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1003308-Loureno1">[58]</xref>. Mosquitoes had a per-day biting rate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and, throughout the study, we assumed equal transmission probabilities in human-to-vector and vector-to-human transmission, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, respectively (the effects of asymmetries in transmission probabilities can be found in supplementary material). To study the effect of immunological interactions between serotypes, we considered (i) temporary, serotype-transcending immunity, where individuals are fully protected against further challenge for a period <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> months after recovery, and (ii) antibody-dependent enhancement through an increase in susceptibility and infectivity of heterologous, secondary infections, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. However, in the majority of our analyses, we did not consider immune interactions beyond the prevention of super-infections. For both the human and mosquito hosts we assumed age-dependent mortality rates (see above) with average life expectancies of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e059" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> years and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1003308.e060" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> days for humans and mosquitoes, respectively.

The extinction risk is defined as the percent of time individual serotypes remain bellow a critical threshold of 10 infected hosts (human or mosquito), and serotype co-circulation is defined as the percent time where multiple serotypes are present in a given patch (meta-population average). For ease of comparison, epidemiological variables (except age) are normalised to the case of lowest parameter value, with ratios above 1 representing an increase and below 1 a decrease. Dashed lines mark the parameter set of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1003308-g002">Figure 2</xref> in the main text. Shown are the means and deviations for 25 stochastic simulations. Other parameter values as in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1003308-t001">Table 1</xref> in the main text.</p>
