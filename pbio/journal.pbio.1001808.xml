<p>Endothelial-cell–derived Sema3A promotes axonal outgrowth and plasticity and thereby regulates neurohormone release in the adult rodent brain in response to the ovarian cycle.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) guides the development of the nervous and vascular systems, but its role in the mature brain remains to be explored. Here we report that the expression of the 65 kDa isoform of Sema3A, the ligand of Nrp1, by adult vascular endothelial cells, is regulated during the ovarian cycle and promotes axonal sprouting in hypothalamic neurons secreting gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH), the neuropeptide controlling reproduction. Both the inhibition of Sema3A/Nrp1 signaling and the conditional deletion of Nrp1 in GnRH neurons counteract Sema3A-induced axonal sprouting. Furthermore, the localized intracerebral infusion of Nrp1- or Sema3A-neutralizing antibodies <italic>in vivo</italic> disrupts the ovarian cycle. Finally, the selective neutralization of endothelial-cell Sema3A signaling in adult <italic>Sema3a</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice by the intravenous injection of the recombinant TAT-Cre protein alters the amplitude of the preovulatory luteinizing hormone surge, likely by perturbing GnRH release into the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal system. Our results identify a previously unknown function for 65 kDa Sema3A-Nrp1 signaling in the induction of axonal growth, and raise the possibility that endothelial cells actively participate in synaptic plasticity in specific functional domains of the adult central nervous system, thus controlling key physiological functions such as reproduction.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>In the developing embryo, endothelial cells release chemotropic signals such as Semaphorin 3A (Sema3A) that, upon activation of its receptor Neuropilin-1 (Nrp1), regulate neuronal migration and axon guidance. However, whether endothelial cells in the adult brain retain the ability to secrete molecules that influence neuronal function is unknown. Here we show in the adult brain of rodents that vascular endothelial cells release Sema3A and that the amount released is regulated by the ovulatory cycle. Sema3A, in turn, promotes the outgrowth of axons of hypothalamic neurons that express Neuropilin-1 towards the endothelial wall of portal blood vessels. These neurons release there the neuropeptide that controls reproduction: gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH). Notably, this endothelial-cell-mediated sprouting of GnRH axons regulates neuropeptide release at a key stage of the estrous cycle, the proestrus, when the surge of GnRH triggers ovulation. Thus, by promoting GnRH axonal growth in the adult brain, Sema3A/Neuropilin-1 plays a pivotal role in orchestrating the central control of reproduction. Our results suggest a model in which vascular endothelial cells are dynamic signaling components that relay peripheral information to the brain to control key physiological functions, including species survival.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Blood vessels and axons employ similar mechanisms and follow common guidance cues to grow and navigate tissues during embryonic development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Carmeliet1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Larrivee1">[2]</xref>. Blood vessels influence the trajectories taken by axons to reach their appropriate end organs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Makita1">[3]</xref>. In the adult brain, they communicate with neurons and glia in order to meet physiological demands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Iadecola1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Haydon1">[5]</xref>. Endothelial cells are well positioned to sense peripheral inputs and ideally suited to convey signals that could influence neuronal structure and synaptic plasticity. However, whether they are capable of influencing axonal plasticity in the mature central nervous system remains to be elucidated. Recent evidence suggests that the semaphorins, members of a family of secreted guidance molecules, continue to be expressed in the postnatal brain and may have important implications for neuronal plasticity and nervous system physiology <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Pasterkamp1">[6]</xref>. Of these, Sema3A, which exerts both repulsive and attractive effects on growing axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Luo1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Castellani1">[9]</xref>, is also expressed in endothelial cells during vascular development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Serini1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Valdembri1">[11]</xref>. Interestingly, Sema3A acts as a guidance factor during the migration of a particular population of neuroendocrine neurons that secrete the fertility-regulating neuropeptide gonadotropin-releasing hormone (GnRH) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Cariboni1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Hanchate1">[13]</xref>, and that moreover retain a high degree of plasticity in the mature brain <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Prevot1">[14]</xref>. In particular, GnRH neurons, which project to the hypothalamic median eminence (ME) and release their neurohormone into a specialized capillary network for delivery to the anterior pituitary (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1A</xref>), are known to undergo extensive axonal growth towards the vascular wall during critical time windows in adulthood, such as at the onset of the preovulatory surge, when massive GnRH release has to occur to trigger ovulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Prevot1">[14]</xref>, and are thus an ideal system in which to analyze endothelial-axonal interactions during adult nervous system homeostasis.</p>

<title>Sema3A expression in ME vascular endothelial cells during the ovarian cycle.</title>
<p>(A) Schematic diagram illustrating the anatomy of the hypothalamic-pituitary-gonadal axis in a sagittal view. In rodents, GnRH cell bodies (green circles) are diffusely distributed in the preoptic region and send neuroendocrine axons (green fibers) towards the ME of the hypothalamus, where they release the neurohormone into pituitary portal blood vessels (red arrow) for delivery to the anterior pituitary. At the adenohypophysis, GnRH elicits the secretion of the gonadotropins luteinizing hormone (LH) and follicle-stimulating hormone (FSH), which stimulate gametogenesis and gonadal-steroid secretion and thus support reproductive function. cc, corpus calosum; ac, anterior comissure; oc, optic chiasma; 3V, third ventricle. (B) Representative dark-field photomicrographs of a coronal section of an adult female rat ME, showing Sema3A mRNA localized using a radioactive probe (bright dots indicating silver grains, top panel). Note the presence of Sema3A mRNA in the capillary zone of the ME (white arrow) and in intrainfundibular capillary loops (arrowhead) containing PV1-immunoreactive fenestrated endothelial cells (right panel, green immunofluorescence), and its relative paucity in the parenchyma. Sema3A mRNA expression is also seen in various nuclei of the mediobasal hypothalamus (MBH) that lie adjacent to the ME but do not contain PV1-immunoreactive blood vessels. V3, third ventricle. Scale bar, 100 µm. (C) PV1-positive cell (PV1-pos) isolation by FACS (schematic diagram and dot plot, top) and real-time PCR analysis of PV1, Sema3A, estrogen receptor alpha (ERα), and ERβ transcripts. (D) Representative immunofluorescence images showing the localization of Sema3A immunoreactivity (green) in coronal sections of the ME of adult female mice. Fenestrated vascular endothelial cells are labeled by the monoclonal antibody MECA32, which binds to mouse PV1 (red). Note that Sema3A immunoreactivity is localized in portal blood capillaries of the external zone of the ME (inset) as well as some intrainfundibular capillary loops present in the nervous parenchyma (arrowhead); Sema3A immunolabelling is of very high intensity at the level of the capillary zone, but is also seen in the adjacent nervous parenchyma, progressively vanishing at deeper levels of the tissue.

Black arrowheads at the periphery of the pictures indicate the planes of the individual images that make up the photomontage; each panel is composed of an assembly of four images captured sequentially for each fluorophore using the MosaiX module of the AxioVision 4.6 system (Zeiss, Germany) and a Zeiss 20× objective (N.A. 0.8).

(G) Western blot (top) and quantitative analysis (bottom, relative to actin) of Sema3A protein levels showing a difference in 65 kDa Sema3A expression between the afternoon of diestrus (Di16h) and proestrus (Pro16h), whereas the protein levels of 125 and 95 kDa Sema3A remain unchanged.

<p>In this study, we examined whether this periodic sprouting of GnRH axon terminals in the ME of the adult hypothalamus was regulated by endothelial cells, through the release of Sema3A and the activation of its cognate receptor, neuropilin-1 (Nrp1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-He1">[15]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Tamagnone1">[17]</xref>. We report that endothelial cells of the ME do indeed release the 65 kDa isoform of Sema3A (p65-Sema3A) at key stages of the ovarian cycle, that Nrp1 is expressed in GnRH axons, and that Sema3A-Nrp1 signaling is required for the extension of GnRH axon terminals towards the vascular plexus on the day of the preovulatory surge. We also demonstrate that the selective inhibition of Sema3A expression in endothelial cells of the ME and the transient local manipulation of Sema3A signaling <italic>in vivo</italic> alter the preovulatory release of GnRH, suggesting that the endothelium-to-neuron communication mediated by 65 kDa Sema3A-Nrp1 signaling is of functional relevance in the adult brain. Our results thus indicate a hitherto unidentified role for brain vascular endothelial cells in mediating the cyclic plasticity of GnRH axons in the adult hypothalamus and, consequently, in reproductive physiology.</p>

<title>Sema3A Is Expressed by the Endothelial Cells of Portal Blood Vessels in the ME of the Adult Hypothalamus</title>
<p>Sema3A is mainly known as a developmental signal regulating axon guidance. In order to assess the potential role of Sema3A as a guidance cue for hypothalamic GnRH neurons controlling the ovarian cycle, we first investigated its expression in the ME of adult animals. In situ hybridization of adult female rat brain sections revealed that the mRNA for Sema3A was selectively expressed in endothelial cells of the vascular compartment of the ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). Only a weak hybridization signal was seen in the ependymal layer and in the internal and external axon layers. Brain sections hybridized with the sense probe (negative control) did not exhibit any detectable labeling in the ME (unpublished data). Further analysis by cell sorting, using an affinity-purified antibody to plasmalemmal vesicle-associated protein 1 (PV1) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Ciofi1">[18]</xref>, a component of the fenestral diaphragms <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Stan1">[19]</xref>, selectively expressed by endothelial cells of the ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1B,C</xref>; PV1 mRNA expression in fluorescent versus nonfluorescent cells, t<sub>(6)</sub> = 4.080, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007, <italic>n</italic> = 4) revealed that Sema3A expression was restricted to PV1-positive cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001808.s001">Figure S1</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1C</xref>; t<sub>(6)</sub> = 2.636, <italic>p</italic> = 0.039, <italic>n</italic> = 4), unlike β3-tubulin, DARPP-32, and thyroid-stimulating hormone (TSH), markers for neurons, tanycytes, and endocrine cells, respectively, which were expressed only by non-PV1-positive cells and not found in the same fraction as Sema3A (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001808.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Immunofluorescence analysis in adult female mice using a Sema3A-specific antibody <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Hanchate1">[13]</xref> revealed bright Sema3A immunoreactivity in the capillary zone of the ME that extended into the nervous tissue, where it progressively vanished (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1D</xref>). Together, these findings indicate that Sema3A is expressed <italic>in vivo</italic> in the ME of the mature brain, and is localized in vascular endothelial cells of the pituitary portal system, onto which GnRH neurons abut.</p>

<p>To further investigate the site of origin of Sema3A in portal blood vessels and to determine whether fenestrated endothelial cells from the rat ME can release Sema3A, we used a sequential panning method for their purification, as described previously <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Mi1">[20]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-DeSeranno1">[21]</xref>.

We confirmed Sema3A mRNA expression in purified ME endothelial cells by RT-PCR expression analysis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Next, we used immunoblotting to analyze the conditioned medium of purified ME endothelial cells and compared it with total protein extracts from ME explants, revealing several bands corresponding to the different known isoforms (the secreted 65 kDa and 95 kDa forms, and the 125 kDa precursor; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1F</xref>) of Sema3A <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Adams1">[22]</xref>. Notably, the conditioned medium of purified ME endothelial cells only contained a smear at 125 kDa and a discrete band for p65-Sema3A (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1F</xref>), which appears to be the furin cleavage product of the 95 kDa isoform (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001808.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). This confirms that fenestrated endothelial cells of the ME express Sema3A and release its 65 kDa isoform into the extracellular space.</p>

<title>p65-Sema3A Release in the ME Is Regulated by the Ovarian Cycle</title>
<p>To determine whether Sema3A expression in the ME varies during the ovarian cycle, we performed Western blotting experiments during the onset of the preovulatory surge at proestrus (when GnRH nerve terminals are close to portal plexus vessels) and during diestrus (when GnRH nerve terminals are distant from the endothelial wall) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Prevot2">[23]</xref>. Remarkably, we found that p65-Sema3A expression was significantly increased on the day of proestrus as compared to diestrus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1G</xref>; p65-Sema3A, Di16h versus Pro16h; <italic>n</italic> = 5 independent experiments, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, <italic>t</italic> test). This regulation appeared to be selective for p65-Sema3A, as the expression of other Sema3A isoforms did not change significantly during the ovarian cycle (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1G</xref>; p95-Sema3A, 0.226±0.0449 arbitrary units at Di16h versus 0.133±0.0411 arbitrary units at Pro16h, <italic>n</italic> = 5, t<sub>(8)</sub> = 1.522, <italic>p</italic> = 0.167; p125-Sema3A, 0.427±0.0455 arbitrary units at Di16h versus 0.379±0.0519 arbitrary units at Pro16h, <italic>n</italic> = 5, t<sub>(8)</sub> = 0.698, <italic>p</italic> = 0.505). These data indicate that the levels of p65-Sema3A in the ME are maximal on the day of proestrus, when circulating levels of estradiol are also high and are known to exert their positive feedback effect on the hypothalamo-pituitary-gonadal axis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Christian1">[24]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Herbison1">[25]</xref>. To determine whether these changes are sex-steroid-dependent, we ovariectomized (OVX) adult cycling female rats and subsequently treated them with subcutaneous injections of sesame oil, alone or containing 17β-estradiol 3-benzoate (E<sub>2</sub>), progesterone (P), or E<sub>2</sub>+P. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1H</xref>, estradiol induced a significant increase in p65-Sema3A expression in the ME of OVX rats when compared with the other treatment groups, whereas progesterone inhibited this increase (<italic>n</italic> = 5 rats per treatment, <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05, one-way ANOVA). Interestingly, additional RT-PCR analyses revealed that PV1-positive endothelial cells expressed mRNA for the estrogen receptor ERα (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g001">Figure 1C</xref>) and that this expression was particularly enriched in the ME of adult female rats (PV1-positive versus PV1-negative cells, t<sub>(6)</sub> = 2.793, <italic>p</italic> = 0.031, <italic>n</italic> = 4).</p>
<p>Altogether, these results provide direct evidence that the release of p65-Sema3A by fenestrated endothelial cells of the ME is strictly regulated during the ovarian cycle, being maximal during proestrus, under the action of circulating estradiol.</p>

<title>GnRH Neurons Express the Sema3A Receptor Nrp1</title>
<p>We next investigated whether adult GnRH neurons express Nrp1, the obligate receptor of Sema3A, by performing double <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization experiments using <sup>33</sup>P-labeled Nrp1 and Dig-UTP-labeled GnRH antisense cRNA probes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). High levels of Nrp1 mRNA were observed in cells of the diagonal band of Broca (DBB) and in several nuclei of the rostral and medial preoptic regions—for example, the anteroventral periventricular nucleus, the median preoptic nucleus, and the medial preoptic nucleus (unpublished data). The distribution of neurons expressing GnRH mRNA was similar to that described in previous <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-PorkkaHeiskanen1">[26]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Shivers1">[28]</xref>—that is, the highest density was seen in the rostral preoptic region, followed in decreasing order by the medial preoptic area and the DBB. Nrp1 mRNA was expressed at detectable levels in 38.2±2.5% of GnRH neurons in diestrus (<italic>n</italic> = 4 animals, more than 200 GnRH neurons were considered per animal) and in 50.0±1.5% of GnRH neurons in proestrus (<italic>n</italic> = 4 animals, t<sub>(6)</sub> = 4.039, <italic>p</italic> = 0.007) with no preferential anatomical distribution. Nrp1 mRNA was also expressed in the ME, the projection field of GnRH neurons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g002">Figure 2B</xref>). However, the hybridization signal was not seen in the neural layers, which contain various types of glial cells associated with neuroendocrine axons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Prevot1">[14]</xref>, but instead was detected in the capillary zone (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, inset).</p>

<p>To determine whether Nrp1 protein was present in GnRH axon terminals abutting onto the vascular plexus, we performed double immunolabeling studies with antibodies to Nrp1 and GnRH in the ME of the adult brain. Strong Nrp1 immunoreactivity was seen in the external zone of the ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g002">Figure 2C</xref>) at every anteroposterior level examined. Nrp1 labeling was distributed in the same regions as the majority of GnRH axon terminals, and consistent with Nrp1 mRNA expression by GnRH neuronal cell bodies, GnRH-containing fibers were also found to contain Nrp1 protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, arrows). However, many Nrp1-positive axon-like fibers did not contain GnRH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g002">Figure 2C</xref>), suggesting that additional neuroendocrine systems express this receptor. In agreement with <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization data, endothelial cells of the pituitary portal blood vessels were also found to express Nrp1 immunoreactivity (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001808.s003">Figure S3</xref>).</p>
<p>Thus, the spatial and temporal pattern of expression of Sema3A in the ME together with that of its receptor, Nrp1, in GnRH neurons is consistent with a functional role for Sema3A signaling in promoting GnRH axonal growth towards the vascular plexus at proestrous, when a massive release of the neurohormone into the pituitary portal circulation is required to trigger the preovulatory surge of gonadotropins.</p>

<title>Sema3A Promotes GnRH Axonal Growth Towards the Endothelial Wall of Portal Blood Vessels</title>
<p>In order to assess whether Sema3A can promote the outgrowth of GnRH axons <italic>in situ</italic>, we analyzed hypothalamic explants containing the ME, maintained <italic>ex vivo</italic> in artificial cerebrospinal fluid. Explants obtained from either diestrous or preovulatory proestrous rats were exposed to 1 µg/ml Sema3A for 30 min, then fixed and processed for electron microscopy. Using 15 nm gold-particle labeling, we revealed a striking transformation of GnRH nerve terminals as a function of the presence or absence of Sema3A in diestrous rats. Indeed, the distance between GnRH nerve terminals (green) and the pericapillary space of pituitary portal blood vessels (p.s., pink) appeared to be significantly shorter in Sema3A-treated explants versus controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Quantitative morphometric analysis showed that while the total number of GnRH nerve terminals at a distance of 10 µm or less from the parenchymatous basal lamina (which delineates the pericapillary space) did not vary significantly among treatments (<italic>n</italic> = 4 animals per condition; more than 100 GnRH-immunoreactive axon terminals were considered per explant, one-way ANOVA, F<sub>(2,11)</sub> = 0.224, <italic>p</italic> = 0.803), their distribution was markedly changed (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3B</xref>). In fact, the fraction of GnRH nerve terminals found at a distance of less than 1 µm from the pericapillary space increased by 400% in diestrous ME explants exposed to 1 µg/ml Sema3A for 30 min when compared to controls (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel; <italic>n</italic> = 4 hypothalamic explants per condition; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.001, one-way ANOVA). Importantly, Sema3A-mediated effects on GnRH axonal growth in diestrous explants were abolished upon pretreatment with an Nrp1-neutralizing antibody (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, left panel; <italic>n</italic> = 4 hypothalamic explants per condition; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA). In contrast, in ME explants obtained from animals in proestrus, when Sema3A is heavily released, GnRH axons naturally extend up to the pericapillary space. In this context, exogenous Sema3A treatment did not further affect the elongation of GnRH nerve terminals towards the pericapillary space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel; <italic>n</italic> = 4 hypothalamic explants per condition; <italic>p</italic>&gt;0.05, one-way ANOVA). However, exposing proestrous ME explants to neutralizing antibodies to either the Nrp1 or Sema3A caused GnRH nerve endings to retract from the pericapillary space (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3B</xref>, right panel; <italic>n</italic> = 4 hypothalamic explants per condition; <italic>p</italic>&lt;0.01, one-way ANOVA), suggesting that GnRH axon extension towards the endothelial wall at the transition between diestrus and proestrus is attributable to Nrp1 activation by Sema3A.</p>

<p>To further explore the role of Sema3A on neurite outgrowth in mature GnRH-expressing neurons, we took advantage of the GnV-3 cell line, one of eleven clones of GnRH-expressing cells obtained by the conditional immortalization of cultured adult rat hypothalamic cells. GnV-3 cells grow in culture in the presence of doxycycline, but stop proliferating and undergo differentiation upon drug removal, exhibiting many of the features of mature adult GnRH neurons, including neurite growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Mansuy1">[32]</xref>. Rat ME explants were cultured in proximity to aggregates of GnV-3 neuronal cells.

To test whether Nrp1 was involved in GnRH neurite growth in response to factors released by the ME, Nrp1-neutralizing antibodies were added to the medium.

Remarkably, Sema3A-FL and p65-Sema3A were equally effective at promoting neurite elongation in GnV-3 cells, whereas the Nrp1 antibody stunted this Sema3A-dependent outgrowth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g005">Figure 5D</xref>). Altogether these findings suggest that p65-Sema3A, which is highly expressed in the ME during proestrus, unlike the relatively scarce 95 kDa or 125 kDa forms, acts on GnRH neuroendocrine axons through Nrp1 to promote their elongation.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The reproductive cycle of mammals is critically regulated by hypothalamic GnRH neurons <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Herbison1">[25]</xref>, which periodically extend their axons in the ME towards the pericapillary space, into which they release the GnRH neuroendocrine signal during a specific time window <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Prevot2">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-King1">[40]</xref>. The potential role of vascular endothelial cells in controlling this cyclic growth of axon terminals has not been investigated. Our <italic>in vivo</italic> and <italic>in vitro</italic> findings collectively indicate that Sema3A is a vascular factor promoting GnRH axonal growth in the adult brain and playing a pivotal role in orchestrating the central control of reproduction. We propose that Sema3A released by fenestrated endothelial cells of the hypothalamo-hypophyseal portal blood vessels cyclically induces GnRH neurons to extend their terminals towards the pericapillary space, this directionality being controlled by the glial scaffold along which GnRH axonal fibers travel within the ME (see for review <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Prevot1">[14]</xref>). In turn, this mechanism regulates neuropeptide release at key stages of the ovarian cycle, such as at proestrus, when the preovulatory surge of GnRH occurs.</p>
<p>Our ultrastructural analyses in <italic>GnRH::cre</italic>; <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice, which do not exhibit any defect in GnRH axonal targeting when compared to <italic>Nrp1</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3D,E</xref>), as well as the effect of locally restricted Sema3A infusion on GnRH axonal growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g003">Figure 3B</xref>), strongly indicate that the effects of Sema3A on axonal plasticity within the ME depend on direct Sema3A-Nrp1 signaling in postdevelopmental GnRH terminals. The functional consequence of endothelial Sema3A secretion on GnRH axonal plasticity has, in addition, been demonstrated by the selective invalidation of Sema3A expression in the ME of adult <italic>Sema3a</italic><sup>loxP/loxP</sup> mice by the intravenous injection of the recombinant TAT-Cre protein. Indeed, this approach, which further circumvents any putative developmental effect that might occur with the use of classic promoter-driven Cre expression technology, confirms that the endothelial-Sema3A-promoted elongation of GnRH axons modulates the amplitude of the preovulatory GnRH/LH surge on the day of proestrus.</p>
<p>The molecular pathways that underlie this cyclic Sema3A-Nrp1-mediated GnRH axonal sprouting are unknown, although they appear to be intrinsic to GnRH neurons since Sema3A promotes GnRH neurite outgrowth both in tissue explants and in isolated cell cultures. A recent study has intriguingly suggested that Sema3A could promote axonal growth by inducing protein kinase G activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Shelly1">[41]</xref>. Notably, Sema3A receptors are broadly expressed in the axon terminals of other neuroendocrine systems and this signal has been proposed to serve as a coordinator of structural and functional synaptic plasticity in various neuronal circuits <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Pasterkamp1">[6]</xref>. In our study, only about 50% of the Nrp1 expressed in the median emincence was neutralized by antibody infusion. It would be of interest to investigate the effects of more complete Nrp1 invalidation in adult animals, as well as the potential role of endothelial Sema3A in the growth of hypothalamic neuronal projections controlling other anterior pituitary functions, such as the growth-, stress-, and thyroid-hormone axes.</p>
<p>An intriguing finding of this study is that endothelial cells of the ME appear to selectively release the 65 kDa isoform of Sema3A. Interestingly, we show that estradiol mimics ovarian-cycle effects on p65-Sema3A production in ovariectomized rats and that, in agreement with a previous <italic>in vitro</italic> study <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-deSeranno1">[42]</xref>, endothelial cells of the ME express the estrogen receptor ERα. The mechanisms underlying these changes in protein levels within the ME are unknown but likely involve changes in <italic>Sema3a</italic> transcription, rather than its translation or posttranslational processing such as furin cleavage. In line with this idea, analysis of the <italic>Sema3a</italic> gene using the ALGEN PROMO 3.0 software (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://alggen.lsi.upc.es/cgi-bin/promo_v3/promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3" xlink:type="simple">http://alggen.lsi.upc.es/cgi-bin/promo_v3/promo/promoinit.cgi?dirDB=TF_8.3</ext-link>) predicts the presence of a putative estrogen-receptor-binding element at 100 bp upstream of the transcription initiation site; further experiments will be required to determine whether this presumptive binding site is actually functional. Even though the biological activity of p65-Sema3A has been validated in heterologous systems mimicking growth-cone collapse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Antipenko1">[43]</xref> and in co-culture systems using sympathetic ganglion explants <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Adams1">[22]</xref>, this isoform was originally described as a proteolytic by-product of p95-Sema3A, with reduced functional activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Adams1">[22]</xref>. Similarly, it has been reported recently that the anti-angiogenic activity of the 61 kDa proteolytic fragment of Sema3B is dramatically reduced compared to the full-length 83 kDa isoform <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Varshavsky1">[44]</xref>. In contrast, here we demonstrate that 65 kDa and 95 kDa Sema3A isoforms are equally effective at promoting GnRH neurite elongation ex vivo (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001808-g005">Figure 5C,D</xref>), indicating that the proteolytic cleavage of Sema3A does not interfere with its axonal-growth-promoting activity. In conjunction with the fact that the expression of the 65 kDa isoform of Sema3A, unlike the 125 kDa precursor and the best known 95 kDa secreted isoform, is subject to cyclic changes, being maximal on the day of proestrus, these results uncover for the first time a physiological role for p65-Sema3A in the adult brain.</p>
<p>In conclusion, we show that in the ME of the hypothalamus, p65-Sema3A is an endothelial-cell-derived protein that acts on Nrp1 receptors in GnRH neuroendocrine processes, which have previously been seen to express axonal markers such as GAP-43 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Prevot3">[27]</xref>, to promote their growth towards the target vascular wall during a time window of the reproductive cycle that is critical to ovulation. Because ovarian-cycle-regulated GnRH axonal elongation in the adult brain is likely to depend on the coordinated action of many extracellular factors, endothelial p65-Sema3A may work in concert or in competition with other secreted molecules including VEGF, nitric oxide, TGF-β1, and BDNF, which are particularly enriched in the capillary zone of the ME <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-DeSeranno1">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Langlet1">[36]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Bouret1">[45]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Givalois1">[46]</xref> and may influence axonal plasticity by modulating the endothelial expression of or responsiveness to semaphorins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Song1">[8]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Erskine1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Kettunen1">[49]</xref>. These findings have implications for the possible roles of p65-Sema3A in adult brain function. Finally, our results raise the intriguing possibility that vascular semaphorins may play important and unexpected roles in the adult neural plasticity underlying several other key physiological processes such as learning, stress, and the control of energy homeostasis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Sahay1">[50]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Gao1">[53]</xref>.</p>

One µg of Trizol (Life Technologies, Grand Island, NY)-extracted RNA was reverse transcribed to cDNA in a final volume of 10 µl containing 200 U of SuperScript II reverse transcriptase (Invitrogen), 20 U of RNase inhibitor (Promega, Madison, WI), and 0.5 µg of oligo-dT primer. After a 1 h incubation at 42°C, the reaction was stopped by heating at 94°C for 5 min. PCR was performed by using 1 µl of each reverse transcription reaction and Hotstart Taq DNA polymerase (Qiagen, France) in a volume of 50 µl. The thermocycling conditions were 15 min at 95°C for enzyme activation, followed by 35 cycles at 94°C for 1 min, annealing at 53°C for 1 min, 72°C for 1 min, followed by a final extension period of 10 min at 72°C. A 364 bp DNA fragment (sense <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-TCATCCTGAGGACAACAT-3′</named-content>, antisense <named-content content-type="gene" xlink:type="simple">5′-GCATATCTGACCTATTCT-3′</named-content>) corresponding to nucleotides 444–807 (NM017310) was amplified. PCR with the substitution of cDNA with RNA served as a control.

<title>In situ hybridization</title>
<p>Single-label <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization for Sema3A or for Nrp1 was performed as we have previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Bouret1">[45]</xref>. Briefly, after proteinase K digestion (10 µg/ml at 37°C; Boehringer Mannheim, Indianapolis, IN) and acetylation (0.0025% acetic acid at room temperature) for 30 min, the sections were dehydrated through an ascending ethanol series and dried under vacuum for 4 h. The <sup>33</sup>P-labeled cRNA probes were heated at 65°C for 5 min with 500 µg/ml yeast tRNA (Sigma, Saint Quentin Fallavier, France) and 50 µM dithiothreitol (DTT) (Euromedex) in DEPC (Sigma)-treated water and then diluted to an activity of 5×10<sup>6</sup> cpm/µl with hybridization buffer containing 50% formamide (Boehringer Mannheim), 0.25 M sodium chloride, 1× Denhardt's solution (Sigma), and 10% dextran sulfate (Pharmacia). Eighty µl of this hybridization solution were pipetted onto the sections, which were covered with a glass coverslip and sealed with DPX (Electron Microscopy Sciences) before incubation for 20 h at 58°C. Then, the slides were washed four times (5 min each) in 4× Saline Sodium Citrate (SSC) before digestion with RNase (20 µg/ml for 30 min at 37°C; Sigma) and rinsed at room temperature in decreasing concentrations of SSC (2×, 1×, 0.5× for 10 min each) containing 1 mM DTT, to final stringency in 0.1× SSC at 65°C for 30 min. After dehydration in an ascending ethanol series, the sections were vacuum-dried, dipped in NTB-2 liquid emulsion (Kodak), dried, and stored in the dark. Emulsion-coated slides were developed after 1 mo for Sema3A or after 14 d for Nrp1 with Kodak D-19 developer. The sections were then counterstained with thionine, dehydrated, cleared in xylenes, and mounted with DPX.</p>
<p>For double-label <italic>in situ</italic> hybridization, prehybridization, hybridization, and posthybridization procedures were similar to those described above, with the exception that the sections were not dehydrated after the last 0.1× SSC rinse, but were further processed for the localization of digoxigenin-labeled hybrids. Briefly, after rinsing in 2× SSC, sections were blocked overnight with 2× SSC buffer containing 0.3% Triton X-100 and 2% normal goat serum, then washed in buffer 1 (100 mM Tris-HCl and 150 mM NaCl, pH 7.4), and incubated for 5 h with alkaline-phosphatase-conjugated anti-digoxigenin (Roche) diluted 1∶1,000 with buffer 1 containing 1% normal goat serum. After rinsing in buffer 1 and in buffer 2 (100 mM Tris-HCl, 50 mM MgCl2, and 100 mM NaCl, pH 9.5), sections were incubated in nitro blue tetrazolium (NBT)+5-bromo-4-chloro-3-indolyl phosphate (BCIP) chromogen solution (Sigma) for 12 h, and the reaction stopped with buffer 3 (10 mM Tris-HCl, 1 mM EDTA, pH 8).

<title>Quantitative analysis</title>
<p>Nrp1 mRNA was quantified in GnRH neurons as follows. GnRH mRNA-expressing cells were observed under brightfield illumination, and Nrp1 mRNA-expressing cells were observed under darkfield illumination. Thus, each digoxigenin-labeled GnRH neuron was examined for the presence of silver grains, indicating Nrp1, using alternate bright- and darkfield observations. About 200 GnRH cells were studied per animal. The total number of GnRH mRNA-expressing cells and the number of GnRH cells coexpressing Nrp1 mRNA were counted per section. From these data, the proportion of GnRH neurons expressing Nrp1 mRNA per animal was calculated and averaged.</p>

<p>MEs were obtained from cycling diestrous and proestrous rats killed at 16 h. After dissection, each fragment was placed in a microcentrifuge tube, snap frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80°C. Protein extracts of a set of two MEs were prepared by trituration of the fragments through 22 and 26 gauge needles in succession in 200 µl of lysis buffer (25 mM Tris, pH 7.4, β-glycerophosphate, 1.5 mM EGTA, 0.5 mM EDTA, 1 mM sodium pyrophosphate, 1 mM sodium orthovanadate, 10 µg/ml leupeptin and pepstatin A, 10 µg/ml apoprotinin, 100 µg/ml PMSF, and 1% Triton X-100) for straight analysis, or in 750 µl for immunoprecipitation. After 30 min of gentle rocking at 4°C, the tissue lysates were cleared by centrifugation at 14,000 rpm for 15 min. For straight analysis, the protein content of supernatants was determined using BCA protein assays (Pierce Chemical, Rockford, IL), and equal amounts of proteins were mixed with SB4X to obtain a final volume of 50 microliters in 1× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). For immunoprecipitation, 60 µl of protein A-sepharose (1∶1 slurry in lysis buffer, P3391; Sigma) were added to the supernatants in order to remove endogenous IgGs (preclearing).

Ultrathin immunolabeled sections were examined with a Zeiss transmission electron microscope 902 (Leo, Rueil-Malmaison, France), and images were acquired using a Gatan Orius SC1000 CCD camera (Gatan France, Grandchamp, France). Morphometric analysis was performed by an investigator blind to hypothalamic explant treatment on digitalized images taken at an original magnification of 12,000× from 10–15 ultrathin sections per animal, with a space of 25 sections between them, to avoid taking the same GnRH nerve terminal into consideration twice (the diameter of a GnRH nerve terminal rarely exceeds 2 µm). All GnRH-immunoreactive nerve terminals located at less than 10 µm from the parenchymatous basal lamina (i.e., the pial surface of the brain) were taken into consideration—that is, more than 100 distinct axon terminals per animals (i.e., almost all GnRH nerve terminals abutting onto the pituitary portal blood vessels in the aforementioned 20-µm-thick region of the ME).

Cells were grown in Proliferation medium consisting of Neurobasal A medium with B27 supplement (20 µl/ml, Invitrogen-Gibco), PSN (1×, Invitrogen), Glutamax I (Invitrogen), doxycycline hydrochloride (0.5 µg/ml, Sigma), FBS (10 µl/ml, Biological Industries), and βFGF (5 ng/ml, Invitrogen). Doxycycline promotes the proliferation of these conditionally immortalized cells. To induce the differentiation of GnV-3 cells, the culture medium was replaced by differentiation medium (containing Neurobasal A, B27 supplement, PSN, Glutamax I, and βFGF).</p>

<title>In Vitro Cell Transfection</title>
<p>COS-7 cells were transiently transfected using the fast-forward protocol. Briefly, a 58 cm<sup>2</sup> subconfluent dish was split into four dishes in OptiMEM medium (Invitrogen) about 1 h before high-efficiency liposome transfection (Lipofectamine 2000, Invitrogen). Each dish was transfected with 2–4 µg of DNA construct (full-length human Semaphorin 3A-myc cDNA plasmid, 65 kDa truncated human Semaphorin 3A-myc cDNA plasmid, and empty vector for control). The latter construct was generated by site-directed mutagenesis using a QuickChange II XL site-directed mutagenesis kit (Agilent Technologies) to introduce a Stop codon after the conserved Arginine residue 555, corresponding to the furin cleavage site.</p>

<title>Cell Aggregates</title>
<p>Three-dimensional matrix assays were performed by co-culturing GnV-3 cell aggregates with ME explants dissected from adult female rats as described above. In another set of experiments, GnV-3 cell aggregates were co-cultured with COS-7 cells transfected either with full-length Sema3A (Sema3A-FL) or 65 kDa Sema3A, or with the control vector, as previously described <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Giacobini1">[60]</xref>.</p>
<p>For the aggregates, cells were collected by trypsinization, resuspended in 5 µl of growth-factor-free Matrigel (BD Biosciences, San Jose, CA) (10<sup>6</sup> cells/ml for both GnV-3 and COS-7), and placed on the lid of a culture dish. As cell aggregates were formed in the droplets, they were plated onto Millicell inserts coated with growth-factor free Matrigel (Millipore) and maintained in culture for 72 h. Cultures were grown for 2–3 d in Neurobasal medium containing B27 and gentamycin before staining. To test whether Sema3A acts on GnRH-1 processes in an Nrp1-dependent fashion, a rat-Nrp1-neutralizing antibody (1 µg/ml, R&amp;D Systems, AF566) was added to the growth medium of the co-cultures. The following day, the cultures were fixed with 4% paraformaldehyde in 0.01 M phosphate buffer, pH 7.4, and permeabilized with 0.3% Triton X-100 (Sigma) for 1 h at room temperature. Finally, they were stained with Alexa 568–X phalloidin (Molecular Probes, Eugene, OR) for 45 min at 37°C before image analysis. Quantification of GnV3 fiber growth was performed on digitized photomicrographs using the NeuronJ plugin of ImageJ software (National Institutes of Health).</p>

<title>Intracerebral Infusion of Nrp1- or Sema3A-Neutralizing Antibodies</title>
<p>To determine the importance of Nrp1 in the central control of reproductive function, <italic>in vivo</italic> experiments were performed to neutralize Nrp1 receptor-ligand interactions within the ME. Anti- Nrp1 or -Sema3A IgGs (R&amp;D Systems) were chronically infused into the ME (bregma −3.6 mm, 9.5 mm depth from the skull surface) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001808-Paxinos1">[61]</xref> through a stereotaxically implanted infusion cannula (Plastics One, Roanoke, VA) connected to subcutaneously implanted osmotic minipumps (model 1007D; Alzet, Palo Alto, CA). The pump had a flow rate of 0.5 µl/h and a capacity of 100 µl, resulting in a delivery period of 7 d. Each pump was loaded with sterile DPBS (Invitrogen) containing the Nrp1-neutralizing antibody (0.25 µg/µl final) or no antibody. After connection to the infusion device and overnight priming in 0.9% NaCl at 37°C, the assembly was implanted into cycling 190–200 g female rats with regular estrous cycles. Estrous cycles were monitored before and after surgery.</p>
<p>Following infusion for 7 d, animals were killed to assess the implantation site of the cannula and check for exhaustion of the infused solution. MEs from Nrp1 and PBS-infused animals were collected, snap frozen in dry ice, and stored at −80°C. To determine whether the infused Nrp1 antibodies actually targeted the ME and bound endogenous Nrp1, protein extracts from MEs were prepared and subjected to immunoprecipitation using Nrp1 antibodies as described above. The sepharose beads from the preclearing step allowed IgGs to be collected from the MEs. The beads were then separated by centrifugation, washed twice with ice-cold lysis buffer, and boiled for 5 min in 50 µl of 2× NuPAGE LDS sample buffer (Invitrogen). After centrifugation, the supernatants were analyzed by Western blotting for Nrp1. Anti-Sema3A-treated animals and their PBS-treated controls were perfused transcardially with fixative and processed for immunohistochemistry as described above. AlexaFluor 488–conjugated anti-mouse antibodies (1∶400) were used to detect the binding of the intracranially infused Sema3A antibodies <italic>in situ</italic>; vascular endothelial cells were visualized using TRITC-conjugated <italic>Bandeiraea simplicifolia</italic> lectin.</p>
