        <article-title>Neural Basis of Solving Verbal Problems with Insight</article-title>
      </related-article><abstract>
        <p>People sometimes solve problems with a unique process called insight, accompanied by an “Aha!” experience. It has long been unclear whether different cognitive and neural processes lead to insight versus noninsight solutions, or if solutions differ only in subsequent subjective feeling. Recent behavioral studies indicate distinct patterns of performance and suggest differential hemispheric involvement for insight and noninsight solutions. Subjects solved verbal problems, and after each correct solution indicated whether they solved with or without insight. We observed two objective neural correlates of insight. Functional magnetic resonance imaging (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 1</xref>) revealed increased activity in the right hemisphere anterior superior temporal gyrus for insight relative to noninsight solutions. The same region was active during initial solving efforts. Scalp electroencephalogram recordings (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 2</xref>) revealed a sudden burst of high-frequency (gamma-band) neural activity in the same area beginning 0.3 s prior to insight solutions. This right anterior temporal area is associated with making connections across distantly related information during comprehension. Although all problem solving relies on a largely shared cortical network, the sudden flash of insight occurs when solvers engage distinct neural and cognitive processes that allow them to see connections that previously eluded them.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>According to legend, Archimedes shouted “Eureka!” (“I have found it!”) when he suddenly discovered that water displacement could be used to calculate density. Since then, “Eureka!,” or “Aha!,” has often been used to express the feeling one gets when solving a problem with <italic>insight</italic>. Insight is pervasive in human (and possibly animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Epstein1">Epstein et al. 1984</xref>]) cognition, occurring in perception, memory retrieval, language comprehension, problem solving, and various forms of practical, artistic, and scientific creativity (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Davidson1">Sternberg and Davidson 1995</xref>). The Archimedes legend has persisted over two millennia in part because it illustrates some of the key ways in which insight solutions differ from solutions achieved through more straightforward problem solving. We examine the neural bases of these different problem-solving methods.</p>
      <p>Although many processes are shared by most types of problem solving, insight solutions appear to differ from noninsight solutions in several important ways. The clearest defining characteristic of insight problem solving is the subjective “Aha!” or “Eureka!” experience that follows insight solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Schooler2">Schooler et al. 1993</xref>). This subjective experience can lead to a strong emotional response—according to legend, Archimedes ran home from the baths shouting “Eureka!” without donning his clothes first. In addition, problem solving with insight is characterized by the following features. (1) Solvers first come to an impasse, no longer progressing toward a solution (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Duncker1">Duncker 1945</xref>). Archimedes, for example, was stymied by King Hiero's challenge to determine whether his new crown was pure gold without damaging the crown. (2) Solvers usually cannot report the processing that enables them to reinterpret the problem and overcome the impasse (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Maier1">Maier 1931</xref>). Insight often occurs when people are not even aware they are thinking of the problem, as reportedly happened to Archimedes while in the baths. (3) Solvers experience their solutions as arising suddenly (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Metcalfe2">Metcalfe and Wiebe 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Smith1">Smith and Kounios 1996</xref>) and immediately recognize the correctness of the solution (or solution path). (4) Performance on insight problems is associated with creative thinking and other cognitive abilities different from those associated with performance on noninsight problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Schooler1">Schooler and Melcher 1997</xref>). Some researchers have argued that all these characteristics of insight solutions are essentially epiphenomenal, that insight and noninsight solutions vary only in emotional intensity, and that they are attained with precisely the same cognitive (hence neural) mechanisms (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Weisberg2">Weisberg and Alba 1981</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Weisberg1">Weisberg 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Perkins1">Perkins 2000</xref>).</p>
      <p>Persistent questions about insight concern whether unconscious processing precedes reinterpretation and solution, whether distinct cognitive and neural mechanisms beyond a common problem-solving network are involved in insight, and whether the apparent suddenness of insight solutions reflects truly sudden changes in cognitive processing and neural activity.</p>
      <p>Recent work suggests that people are thinking—at an unconscious level—about the solution prior to solving problems with insight. Specifically, while working on a verbal problem they have yet to solve, people presented with a potential solution word read the actual solution word faster than they read an unrelated word (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman2">Bowden and Beeman 1998</xref>). This “solution priming” effect is greater—and in fact people make solution decisions about presented words more quickly—when words are presented to the left visual hemifield, which projects directly to the right hemisphere (RH), than when words are presented to the right visual hemifield, which projects to the left hemisphere (LH). This suggests that RH semantic processing is more likely than LH semantic processing to produce lexical or semantic information that leads to the solution. These RH advantages occur only when solvers experience insight—the “Aha!” or “Eureka!” feeling that comes with insight solutions (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bowden2">Bowden and Jung-Beeman 2003a</xref>). Moreover, when subjects try to solve classic insight problems, they benefit more from hints presented to the left visual field (i.e., the RH) than from hints presented to the right visual field (i.e., the LH) (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Fiore1">Fiore and Schooler 1998</xref>).</p>
      <p>Problem solving is a complex behavior that requires a network of cortical areas for all types of solving strategies and solutions, so solving problems with and without insight likely invokes many shared cognitive processes and neural mechanisms. One critical cognitive process distinguishing insight solutions from noninsight solutions is that solving with insight requires solvers to recognize distant or novel semantic (or associative) relations; hence, insight-specific neural activity should reflect that process. The most likely area to contribute to this component of insight problem solving is the anterior superior temporal gyrus (aSTG) of the RH. Language comprehension studies demonstrate that the RH is particularly important for recognizing distant semantic relations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Chiarello1">Chiarello et al. 1990</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman2">Beeman 1998</xref>), and bilateral aSTG is involved in semantic integration. For example, sentences and complex discourse increase neural activity in aSTG bilaterally (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Mazoyer1">Mazoyer et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Stowe1">Stowe et al. 1999</xref>), and discourse that places particular demands on recognizing or computing distant semantic relations specifically increases neural activity in RH temporal areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-St1">St. George et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Mason1">Mason and Just 2004</xref>), especially aSTG (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Meyer1">Meyer et al. 2000</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Kircher1">Kircher et al. 2001</xref>). If this prediction of RH aSTG involvement is confirmed, it will help constrain neurocognitive theories of insight. Other cortical areas, such as prefrontal cortex and the anterior cingulate (AC) may also be differentially involved in producing insight and noninsight solutions.</p>
      <p>We used functional magnetic resonance imaging (FMRI) in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 1</xref> and electroencephalogram (EEG) measurement in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 2</xref> to test the empirically and theoretically derived hypothesis that solving problems with insight requires engagement of (or increased emphasis on) distinct neural mechanisms, particularly in the RH anterior temporal lobe. Event-related experimental designs compared neural activity when people solved verbal problems with insight to neural activity when they solved problems (from the same problem set) without insight.</p>
      <p>As in earlier behavioral work, we used a set of compound remote associate problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bowden3">Bowden and Jung-Beeman 2003b</xref>) adapted from a test of creative cognition (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Mednick1">Mednick 1962</xref>). <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the sequence for each trial. Subjects saw three problem words <italic>(pine, crab, sauce)</italic> and attempted to produce a single solution word <italic>(apple)</italic> that can form a familiar compound word or phrase with each of the three problem words <italic>(pineapple, crab apple, applesauce)</italic>. We relied on solvers' reports to sort solutions into insight solutions and noninsight solutions, avoiding the complication that presumed insight problems can sometimes be solved without insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Davidson1">Davidson 1995</xref>) and circumventing the use of different types of problems requiring different cognitive operations. Thus, we made use of the most important defining characteristic of insight problems: the subjective conscious experience—the “Aha!” A similar technique revealed distinct behavioral characteristics when people recognized solutions with insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bowden2">Bowden and Jung-Beeman 2003a</xref>). Note that this is a very “tight” comparison. In both conditions problems are solved using a network of processes common to both insight and noninsight solutions. If insight ratings reflect some distinct cognitive processes, this contrast will reveal the distinct underlying brain activity. In other words, within the cortical network for problem solving, different components will be engaged or emphasized for insight versus noninsight solutions. FMRI (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 1</xref>) should reveal neuroanatomical locations of processes that are unique to insight solutions, and EEG (<xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 2</xref>) should reveal the time course (e.g., whether insight really is sudden) and frequency characteristics of neurophysiological differences.</p>

          <p>(A) The “Compound” prompt was presented for 0.5 s, then persisted for a variable amount of additional time (0–2 s) until a cue from the scanner indicated the beginning of a new whole brain acquisition. (B) A three-word problem appeared in the center of the screen and persisted until subjects indicated with a bimanual button press that they had solved the problem, or until the 30-s time limit elapsed. Thus, event timing and condition were completely dependent on subjects' responses. (C) Following the button press or time limit, subjects were prompted to verbalize the solution (or press the buttons and say “Don't know” if the time limit expired prior to solution) then (D) prompted to indicate (with a bimanual button press) whether they felt insight, as described prior to the experiment. (E) Next, subjects performed 9 s of an unrelated filler task (three line-matching trials, 3 s each), allowing BOLD signal to return to baseline (in areas not involved in line matching).</p>

        <title>Experiment 1</title>
        <p>Subjects solved 59% of the problems presented, and pressed buttons indicating “insight” for 56% (s.d. = 18.2) of their solutions, “no insight” for 41% (s.d. = 18.9) of their solutions, and “other” for 2% of their solutions. We marked a point about 2 s (rounded to the nearest whole second) prior to each solution button press as the solution event, and examined a time window 4–9 s after this event (i.e., 2–7 s after the button press) to isolate the corresponding hemodynamic response. Solving problems and responding to them required a strict sequence of events (reading of words, solving effort, solving, button press, verbalizing the solution, insight decision), but this sequence was identical whether subjects indicated solving with or without insight, so differences in FMRI signal resulted from the degree to which distinct cognitive processes and neural systems led to insight or noninsight solutions.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g002">Figure 2</xref> illustrates the most robust insight effect: as predicted, insight solutions were associated with greater neural activity in the RH aSTG than noninsight solutions. The active area was slightly anterior to primary auditory cortex, posterior to temporal pole, and along the medial aspect of the aSTG, extending down the lateral edge of the descending ramus of the Sylvian fissure to midway through the middle temporal gyrus (MTG). (This site is also close to the superior temporal sulcus, which has been implicated in language). Across all 13 subjects, the peak signal difference at a single voxel within the RH aSTG was 0.25% across the 6-s window, and 0.30% at a single time to repetition (TR), i.e., the time needed to repeat the image of the whole brain. Overall signal in this region was robust, reaching 96.8% of the brainwide average (after removing voxels in other brain areas with signal below a standard criterion). Within the cluster of voxels identified across the group, 12 subjects showed from 0.03% to 0.35% greater signal for insight than for noninsight solutions; one subject showed 0.02% greater signal for the noninsight solutions. It is not likely that RH aSTG is involved only in output or in emotional response following insight solutions, because neural activity in this area also increased when subjects first encountered each problem (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g003">Figure 3</xref>). Thus, RH aSTG is involved in processing the problem words both initially and at solution. (Of course, event-related FMRI signal occurred in many other cortical regions at problem onset, especially visual cortex). There was no insight effect in response windows immediately preceding or following the defined response window. All indications point to a striking transient event in the RH aSTG near the time when subjects solve problems with insight.</p>

            <p>(A) Voxels in right temporal lobe showing baseline-to-peak event-related FMRI signal when subjects first encounter problems, overlaid on the averaged normalized structural image of all subjects. The cluster is in RH aSTG, with a volume of 469 mm<sup>3</sup>, with peak <italic>t</italic> value of 4.37 at 41, −6, −12 in Talairach space, clearly overlapping with the cluster showing an insight effect at solution.</p>
            <p>(B) Group average signal change following problem onset (time = 0), for the cluster defined by signal at the problem onset (green line) and the cluster (illustrated in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g002">Figure 2</xref>A) showing the insight effect at solution (white line).

        <p>The involvement of the RH rather than the LH for this verbal task is not due to greater difficulty in producing insight solutions: subjects produced insight solutions at least as quickly (mean solution time = 10.25 s, s.d. = 3.58 s) as they produced noninsight solutions (mean = 11.28 s, s.d. = 4.13 s) (<italic>t</italic> &lt; 1.0, <italic>p</italic> &gt; 0.3). More importantly, the hemodynamic responses to both insight and noninsight solutions in the homologous area of the LH are about equivalent to the response to noninsight solutions in the RH aSTG—it is the strong response to insight solutions in the RH aSTG that stands out. There is no insight effect anywhere within temporal cortex of the LH. At statistical thresholds below significant levels (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.1 uncorrected), there are as many voxels in LH temporal cortex showing a noninsight effect as showing an insight effect.</p>
        <p>Several other cortical areas showing insight effects that did not meet significance criteria are listed in <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020097-t001">Table 1</xref> (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>). Some of these effects were in frontal cortex, which is notable because various frontal areas have been implicated in problem solving and reasoning. Patients with prefrontal damage have particular difficulty integrating relations in reasoning tasks (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Waltz1">Waltz et al. 1999</xref>), and when healthy subjects perform the same task, neural activity increases in rostrolateral prefrontal cortext (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Christoff1">Christoff et al. 2001</xref>). Some problem solving increases activity in dorsolateral prefrontal cortex (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Prabhakaran1">Prabhakaran et al. 1997</xref>), perhaps because of working memory demands. Solving of poorly structured problems seems particularly impaired following damage to the prefrontal cortex of the RH (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Goel2">Goel and Grafman 2000</xref>). Moreover, the inferior frontal gyrus (IFG) is highly active when people engage in directed semantic retrieval (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Wagner1">Wagner et al. 2001</xref>) or when they select particular semantic concepts over competing ones (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Thompson-Schill1">Thompson-Schill et al. 1997</xref>), e.g., to generate a response (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Frith1">Frith et al. 1991</xref>). Usually in these circumstances the IFG activity is stronger in the LH, even when people are reasoning about spatial problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Goel3">Goel et al. 1998</xref>), but the IFG responds particularly strongly in the RH when subjects select more distant semantic relations because of task demands (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Seger1">Seger et al. 2000</xref>) or comprehension goals (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Robertson1">Robertson et al. 2000</xref>). Because of its putative importance for problem solving, semantic retrieval, and semantic selection, IFG was an a priori region of interest. One question we had hoped to answer was whether the semantic selection of insight solutions would preferentially evoke activity in RH or LH IFG, but the insight effects in both areas were too small (in area and in reliability) to test this question. When a more lenient statistical threshold was adopted, small clusters of signal were observed in both RH and LH IFG (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020097-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>A). Indeed, within the small region surpassing this weak statistical threshold, signal change in the RH IFG region was moderately strong (peak = 0.21% across the whole window). However, as is often the case, FMRI signal in this region was low (about 72% of the brainwide average) and variability was high, decreasing our confidence in the effect.</p>

        <p>After RH aSTG, the second largest area showing an insight effect in FMRI signal was the medial frontal gyrus in the LH (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio-0020097-t001">Table 1</xref>; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="sg001">Figure S1</xref>B). Although this area was 85% as large (453 mm<sup>3</sup> at <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.005 threshold) as RH aSTG, the event-related signal within it was weak and the insight–noninsight difference (peak difference = 0.15%) was relatively small. (The insight effect may be attributable as much to a negative response for noninsight solutions as to a positive response for insight solutions.)</p>
        <p>There also was an insight effect in small clusters in or near bilateral amygdala or parahippocampal gyrus. Again, regional signal was low (83% of the brainwide average), and the signal difference was small (peak = 0.16%). However, an amygdalar response may be expected, given the emotional sensation of the insight experience (Parsons and Osherson, 2001). Hippocampal or parahippocampal involvement is also plausible, if memory interacts with insight solutions differently from how it interacts with noninsight solutions. For instance, insight problems may encourage distinct memory encoding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Wills1">Wills et al. 2000</xref>) or may require distinct retrieval. Finally, a small cluster in the LH posterior cingulate (PC) also showed an insight effect. There was strong, sustained FMRI signal for both solution types in this region; on the fringe of this responding region, FMRI signal began earlier following insight than noninsight solutions. The lateness of the FMRI signal across LH PC suggests that this effect began later in the response sequence, rather than during solution generation. Finally, as in most FMRI studies, signal was relatively weak in temporal pole and orbitofrontal areas due to magnetic susceptibility artifact, so we cannot rule out undetected effects in those areas.</p>
        <p>Several cortical areas showed strong solution-related FMRI signal, but approximately equally for insight and noninsight solutions. Some of these areas (e.g., motor cortex) relate to the response sequence rather than solution processes; other areas probably reflect component processes of a problem-solving network common to both insight and noninsight solving, such as retrieving potential solutions. Two areas that may be of interest for future studies are AC and posterior middle/superior temporal gyrus. Both these areas, in the RH only, showed strong, negative solution-related signal, approximately equal in the two solution types. AC is an area that might be predicted to be involved in reorienting attention as solvers overcome impasses, given its role in performance monitoring and cognitive control (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-MacDonald1">MacDonald et al. 2000</xref>). RH posterior MTG is active when subjects “get” jokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Goel1">Goel and Dolan 2001</xref>) and when they attempt to solve problems with deductive reasoning (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Parsons1">Parsons and Osherson 2001</xref>). However, in our experiment, only the RH aSTG showed a robust insight effect.</p>

        <title>Experiment 2</title>
        <p>A separate group of subjects participated in fundamentally the same paradigm while we continuously recorded EEGs from the scalp. We then compared time-frequency analyses of the EEGs associated with insight solutions versus noninsight solutions. EEG provides temporal resolution greatly superior to that of FMRI and thus can better elucidate the time course and suddenness of the insight effect. Furthermore, complex EEG oscillations can be parsed into constituent frequency components, some of which have been linked to particular types of neural and cognitive processes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Ward1">Ward 2003</xref>).</p>
        <p>The high temporal resolution of EEG allows us to address one of the fundamental questions raised earlier: does insight really occur suddenly, as subjective experience suggests? For problems typically solved without insight, solvers report gradually increasing closeness to solution. In contrast, for problems typically solved with insight, solvers report little or no progress until shortly before they actually solve the problem (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Metcalfe1">Metcalfe 1986</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Metcalfe2">Metcalfe and Wiebe 1987</xref>). Similarly, quantitative analyses of the distributions of response times and accuracies during anagram solving (a task frequently eliciting the experience of insight) reveal that a solution becomes available in a discrete transition from a state of little or no information about the correct response directly to the final state of high accuracy. This contrasts with various language and memory tasks not associated with insight, which yield partial outputs before processing has been completed (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Kounios1">Kounios and Smith 1995</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Smith1">Smith and Kounios 1996</xref>).</p>
        <p>We predicted that a sudden change in neural activity associated with insight solutions would produce an EEG correlate. Specifically, we predicted that high-frequency EEG oscillations in the gamma band (i.e., greater than 30 Hz) would reflect this sudden activity, because prior research has associated gamma-band activity with the activation of perceptual, lexical, and semantic representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Tallon-Baudry1">Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Pulvermuller1">Pulvermüller 2001</xref>). Gamma-band electrical activity correlates with the blood oxygenation level–dependent (BOLD) response apparent in FMRI signal; lower-frequency EEG components do not seem to have direct correlates in FMRI signal (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Foucher1">Foucher et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Laufs1">Laufs et al. 2003</xref>). Consequently, based on the language literature discussed earlier and on our FMRI results, we predicted a discrete insight-related increase in gamma-band activity at electrodes over the anterior temporal lobe of the RH.</p>
        <p>Participants solved 46% (s.d. = 8.2) of the problems correctly within the time limit. Of correctly solved problems, subjects reported more insight solutions (56%, s.d. = 8.4) than noninsight solutions (42%, s.d. = 9.0), (<italic>t</italic>[18] = 3.47, <italic>p</italic>=0.003); there was no difference in mean response times (insight solutions = 9.94 s, s.d. = 2.60; noninsight solutions=9.25 s, s.d. = 3.06; t &lt; 1.0).</p>
        <p>There was a burst of gamma-band activity associated with correct insight solutions (but not noninsight solutions) beginning approximately 0.3 s before the button-press solution response at anterior right temporal electrodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g004">Figure 4</xref>), with no significant difference between insight and noninsight solutions over homologous LH sites. A repeated-measures analysis of variance (ANOVA) performed on log-transformed gamma-band (39 Hz) EEG power at left and right temporal electrode sites (T7 and T8, respectively) for insight and noninsight trials using two time windows (−1.52 to −0.36 s and −0.30 to −0.02 s, measured with respect to the solution response) yielded significant insight × time window (<italic>F</italic>[1,18] = 6.68, <italic>p</italic> = 0.019) and insight × time window × Hemisphere (<italic>F</italic>[1,18] = 8.11, <italic>p</italic> = 0.011) interactions. The overall interaction occurred because there was an insight × hemisphere interaction from −0.30 to −0.02 s (<italic>F</italic>[1,18] = 4.61, <italic>p</italic> = 0.046) but no effect in the −1.52 to −0.36 s time window. Within the −0.30 to −0.02 s interval for these two electrodes, there was a significant insight effect at the right temporal (T8) site (<italic>t</italic>[18] = 3.48, <italic>p</italic> = 0.003), but not at the homologous left temporal (T7) site or any other LH temporal electrode. Laplacian mapping of this effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) is remarkably consistent with the FMRI signal in RH aSTG observed in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 1</xref>. (EEG does not have the spatial resolution of FMRI. However, we used the Laplacian transform [i.e., second spatial derivative] to localize observed activity. The Laplacian derivation acts as a high-pass spatial filter that reduces the contribution from activity in distant areas of the brain to the signal at a given electrode, and therefore reflects relatively focal and proximal brain activity. Given our FMRI results and the demonstrated correspondence between high-frequency EEG activity and FMRI signal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Foucher1">Foucher et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Laufs1">Laufs et al. 2003</xref>], we are confident in the localization of this effect.)</p>

The maps are thresholded to show foci of current density at the upper and lower 20% of the scale. Note the prominent effect of insight (effect for insight greater than effect for noninsight, in red) at the right superior temporal electrode (T8) and surrounding electrodes present from −0.30 to −0.02 s (measured with respect to the solution response) that is not present in the earlier epoch (−1.52 to −0.36 s). The blue area over left inferior parietal cortex (electrode P7) indicates that noninsight gamma power is nonsignificantly greater than insight power (<italic>F</italic>[1,19] &lt; 1) over this region.</p>

        <p>The gamma burst in the right temporal area cannot be attributed to motor processes involved in making the response because (A) motor activity associated with the bimanual button press would have caused a bilateral gamma burst, not a unilateral one; (B) the location of the gamma burst as determined by Laplacian mapping (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g004">Figure 4</xref>B) is not consistent with hand-related motor cortex activity; and (C) both insight and noninsight solutions required button presses.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Complex problem solving requires a complex cortical network to encode the problem information, search memory for relevant information, evaluate this information, apply operators, and so forth. The FMRI and EEG results reported here conclusively demonstrate that solving verbal problems with insight requires at least one additional component to this cortical network, involving RH aSTG, that is less important to solving without insight. The insight effect in RH aSTG accords with the literature on integrating distant or novel semantic relations during language comprehension. When people comprehend (read or listen to) sentences or stories, neural activity increases in aSTG or temporal pole bilaterally more than when comprehending single words (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Mazoyer1">Mazoyer et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bottini1">Bottini et al. 1994</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Stowe1">Stowe et al. 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Humphries1">Humphries et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Meyer1">Meyer et al. 2000</xref>). Neural activity increases in predominantly RH aSTG during tasks that emphasize integration across sentences to extract themes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-St1">St. George et al. 1999</xref>) or to form more coherent memories for stories (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Mason1">Mason and Just 2004</xref>). RH aSTG is also selectively active when subjects must generate the best ending to a sentence (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Kircher1">Kircher et al. 2001</xref>) or mentally repair grammatically incorrect sentences (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Meyer1">Meyer et al. 2000</xref>), both of which likely require intense semantic integration.</p>
      <p>Like the results in language processing, the current results are predicted by the theory that the RH performs relatively coarse semantic coding (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman2">Beeman 1998</xref>; similarly, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Chiarello1">Chiarello et al. 1990</xref>). This theory contends that when people encounter words, semantic processing in several LH areas engages in relatively fine semantic coding which produces small semantic fields—i.e., this processing strongly focuses on a few concepts closely related to the input word in the given context. This is very effective for most straightforward language processing. In contrast, the homologous RH areas engage in relatively coarse semantic coding, which produces large and weak semantic fields—i.e., this processing includes many concepts, even concepts distantly related to the input words and context. This process is ineffective for rapid interpretation or selection but increases semantic overlap among multiple semantic fields (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman3">Beeman et al.</xref>1994), which is useful when drawing together parts of a story or conversation that are only distantly related (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman1">Beeman 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman3">Beeman et al. 2000</xref>). In this view, the coarseness of semantic coding is largely influenced by slight asymmetries in neural microcircuitry that produce more discrete, less redundant input fields in pyramidal neurons of the LH language cortex, and more overlapping input fields in corresponding neurons in the RH (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman2">Beeman 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Hutsler1">Hutsler and Galuske 2003</xref>).</p>
      <p>We suggest that semantic integration, generally, is important for connecting various problem elements together and connecting the problem to the solution, and that coarsely coded semantic integration, computed in RH aSTG, is especially critical to insight solutions, at least for verbal problems (or problems that can be solved with verbal or semantic information). People come to an impasse on insight problems because their retrieval efforts are misdirected by ambiguous information in the problem or by their usual method for solving similar problems. Large semantic fields allowing for more overlap among distantly related concepts (or distantly associated lexical items) may help overcome this impasse. Because this semantic processing is weak, it may remain unconscious, perhaps overshadowed by stronger processing of the misdirected information (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Schooler2">Schooler et al. 1993</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Smith2">Smith 1995</xref>), and solvers remain stuck at impasse. Eventually, solution-related information bursts into awareness “in a sudden flash.” This can happen after misdirected processing decays or is suppressed, after solution-related processing grows, or after environmental cues occur—such as the water overflowing the bathtub when Archimedes got in. Archimedes had semantic and verbal knowledge about how to compute density from weight and volume, but struggled with measuring the volume of an irregularly shaped crown without harming the crown (e.g., melting it). His observation of water displacement allowed him to connect known concepts in new ways. This is the nature of many insights, the recognition of new connections across existing knowledge.</p>
      <p>A persistent question has been whether the cognitive and neural events that lead to insight are as sudden as the subjective experience. The timing and frequency characteristics of the EEG results shed light on this question. We propose that the gamma-band insight effect in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 2</xref> reflects the sudden transition of solution-related cognitive processing from an unconscious to a conscious state. Recent research associates gamma-band oscillations with the ignition of neural cell assemblies supporting the transient feature binding necessary to activate a representation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Tallon-Baudry1">Tallon-Baudry and Bertrand 1999</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Pulvermuller1">Pulvermüller 2001</xref>)—in this case, a phonological, lexical, or semantic representation corresponding to the solution word and its associations to the problem words. According to this hypothesis, greater synchronous gamma-band activity for insight than for noninsight solutions could reflect a more integrated or unitized solution representation. Furthermore, synchronous gamma-band activity has been hypothesized to play a critical role in the accessibility to consciousness of such representations (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Engel1">Engel and Singer 2001</xref>). The timing (with respect to the solution button press) of the insight gamma-band effect closely approximates estimates derived from cognitive behavioral studies of the amount of time required to access an available solution and generate a two-alternative, forced-choice button-press response (e.g., <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Kounios2">Kounios et al. 1987</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Meyer2">Meyer et al. 1988</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Smith1">Smith and Kounios 1996</xref>). The present experiments had no response choice (i.e., always the same bimanual button press for solutions), so subjects could easily have responded 0.3 s after solving the problems. Thus, we infer that the observed gamma burst reflects the sudden conscious availability of a solution word resulting from an insight.</p>
      <p>Suddenly recognizing new connections between problem elements is a hallmark of insight, but it is only one component of a large cortical network necessary for solving problems with insight, and recognizing new connections likely contributes to other tasks, such as understanding metaphors (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bottini1">Bottini et al. 1994</xref>) and deriving a story theme (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-St1">St. George et al. 1999</xref>). Similar tasks may depend on related cortical networks. For example, appreciating semantic jokes (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Goel1">Goel and Dolan 2001</xref>) and engaging in deductive reasoning that sometimes involves insight (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Parsons1">Parsons and Osherson 2001</xref>) both increase activity in RH posterior MTG. It is striking that the insight effect observed in the RH in our experiments occurred when people solved verbal problems, which traditional views suggest should involve mostly LH processing with little or no contribution from the RH. It is possible that insight solutions to nonverbal problems would require different cortical networks. However, the observed effect cannot be due simply to verbal retrieval, which must occur for both insight and noninsight solutions; it could be due to a type of verbal retrieval specific to insight solutions, but not involved in noninsight solutions.</p>
      <p>We turn now to another result from the EEG time-frequency analysis, which was not predicted but nevertheless suggests a provocative interpretation. The gamma burst thought to reflect the transition of the insight solution from an unconscious to a conscious state was preceded by insight-specific activity in the alpha band (8–13 Hz). Specifically, there was a burst of alpha power (estimated at 9.8 Hz) associated with insight solutions detected over right posterior parietal cortex from approximately 1.4 s until approximately 0.4 s before the solution response, at which point insight alpha power decreased to the level of noninsight alpha power, or below (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g005">Figure 5</xref>). An ANOVA was performed on log-transformed alpha-band (9.8 Hz) EEG power at left and right parietal-occipital electrode sites (PO7 and PO8, respectively) for insight and noninsight trials using three time windows: −2.06 to −1.56 s, −1.31 to −0.56 s, and −0.31 to 0.06 s (measured from the solution button press). This analysis yielded a significant insight × time window interaction (<italic>F</italic>[2,36] = 4.13, <italic>p</italic> = 0.027, with the Huynh-Feldt correction). Follow-up <italic>t</italic>-tests in each time window yielded significant effects of insight in the first time window at both electrode sites (PO7: <italic>t</italic>[18] = 2.32, <italic>p</italic> = 0.033; PO8: <italic>t</italic>[18] = 2.42, <italic>p</italic> = 0.026) and in the second time window only at the RH site (PO8: <italic>t</italic>[18] = 2.17, <italic>p</italic> = 0.043), with a reversal of the direction of the effect. The third time window yielded no significant effects.</p>

This alpha burst was embedded in a slow decrease in alpha (see [A]), probably reflecting a general increase in cortical activity as effort increases during the course of problem solving.</p>

      <p>Alpha rhythms are understood to reflect idling or inhibition of cortical areas (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Pfurtscheller1">Pfurtscheller et al. 1996</xref>). Increased alpha power measured over parietal-occipital cortex indicates idling or inhibition of visual cortex. This has been attributed to gating of visual information flowing into the perceptual system in order to protect fragile or resource-intensive processes from interference from bottom-up stimulation (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Ray1">Ray and Cole 1985</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Worden1">Worden et al. 2001</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Jensen1">Jensen et al. 2002</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Cooper1">Cooper et al. 2003</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Ward1">Ward 2003</xref>). This interpretation assumes that brain areas are normally highly interactive, and that allowing one process to proceed relatively independently requires active attenuation of this interaction. For instance, when subjects attend to visual space in the hemifield projecting to one hemisphere, posterior alpha increases over the other hemisphere, which receives inputs from the unattended hemifield (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Worden1">Worden et al. 2001</xref>). Analogously, the present results suggest selective gating of visual inputs to the RH during the interval preceding the insight-related right temporal gamma burst (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g006">Figure 6</xref>). Hypothetically, this allows weaker processing about more distant associations between the problem words and potential solutions to gain strength, by attenuating bottom-up activation or other neural activity not related to solution that would decrease the signal-to-noise ratio for the actual solution.</p>

      <p>This interpretation of the early insight-specific alpha effect is consistent with previous behavioral research suggesting that, prior to an insight, the solution to a verbal problem can be weakly activated (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bowers1">Bowers et al. 1990</xref>), especially in the RH (Bowden and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Beeman2">Beeman 1998</xref>; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bowden2">Bowden and Jung-Beeman 2003a</xref>). Thus insight solutions may be associated with early unconscious solution-related processing, followed by a sudden transition to full awareness of the solution. We suggest that, in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s2">Experiment 2</xref>, the early posterior alpha insight effect is an indirect correlate of the former, and the right temporal gamma effect is a direct correlate of the latter.</p>
      <p>In sum, when people solve problems with insight, leading to an “Aha!” experience, their solutions are accompanied by a striking increase in neural activity in RH aSTG. Thus, within the network of cortical areas required for problem solving, different components are engaged or emphasized when solving with versus without insight. We propose that the RH aSTG facilitates integration of information across distant lexical or semantic relations, allowing solvers to see connections that had previously eluded them. In the two millennia since Archimedes shouted “Eureka!,” it has seemed common knowledge that people sometimes solve problems—whether great scientific questions or trivial puzzles—by a seemingly distinct mechanism called insight. This mechanism involves suddenly seeing a problem in a new light, often without awareness of how that new light was switched on. We have demonstrated that insight solutions are indeed associated with a discrete, distinct pattern of neural activity, supporting unique cognitive processes.</p>

          <p>Following practice, subjects attempted 124 compound remote associate problems during FMRI scanning. These problems (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bowden3">Bowden and Jung-Beeman 2003</xref>b) can be solved quickly and evoke an “Aha!” experience, producing a distinct behavioral signature (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Bowden2">Bowden and Jung-Beeman 2003</xref>a), roughly half the time they are solved. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0020097-g001">Figure 1</xref> illustrates the sequence of events for each trial. Each trial began with the task label “Compound” presented on liquid crystal diode goggles for 0.5 to 2.5 s. A gating signal from the scanner triggered the central presentation of three problem words, which persisted until subjects solved the problem or 30 s elapsed. If subjects solved the problem, they made a bimanual button press, after which the word “Solution?” prompted them to verbalize their solution. After 2 s the word “Insight?” prompted subjects to press buttons indicating whether they solved the problem with insight.</p>
          <p>Prior to the experiment subjects were told the following: “A feeling of insight is a kind of ‘Aha!' characterized by suddenness and obviousness. You may not be sure how you came up with the answer, but are relatively confident that it is correct without having to mentally check it. It is as though the answer came into mind all at once—when you first thought of the word, you simply knew it was the answer. This feeling does not have to be overwhelming, but should resemble what was just described.” The experimenter interacted with subjects until this description was clear. This subjective rating could be used differently across subjects (or even across trials), blurring condition boundaries; yet the distinct neural correlates of insight observed across the group demonstrate that there was some consistency.</p>
          <p>If subjects failed to solve problems within 30 s, the “Solution?” prompt appeared, and subjects pressed the “no” buttons and verbalized “Don't Know.” Then the “Insight?” prompt appeared, and subjects pressed the “no” buttons again. After the insight rating, subjects performed three line-matching trials (3 s each) to distract them from thinking about the problems, allowing the critical BOLD signal to return to baseline (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0020097-Binder1">Binder et al. 1999</xref>). The total time from the end of one problem to the onset of the next was 14.5–16.5 s. The condition (e.g., insight or noninsight solution) and time of events was determined by subjects' responses.</p>

          <p>One reasonable way to measure the “resolution” of the wavelet transform is to consider the dispersion of the wavelets in both time and frequency. Since the wavelets are Gaussian in both domains, the <italic>e</italic>-folding time and frequency may serve as quantitative measures of dispersion. Note that these dispersions are a function of the scale, <italic>s</italic>. For a selected frequency, 𝒻<sub><italic>c</italic></sub> = 1/λ, or from <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0020097-e003">Equation 3</xref></p>

          <p>Then substituting into <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0020097-e002">Equation 2</xref>, we find that the <italic>e</italic>-folding time is <inline-formula id="pbio-0020097-e006"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020097.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for frequency 𝒻<sub><italic>c</italic></sub>. From <xref ref-type="disp-formula" rid="pbio-0020097-e002">Equation 2</xref>, the <italic>e</italic>-folding frequency is <inline-formula id="pbio-0020097-e007"><inline-graphic mimetype="image" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pbio.0020097.e007" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. To make this concrete, we find that for a 10-Hz (alpha-band) center frequency, the <italic>e</italic>-folding time is 0.12 s and the <italic>e</italic>-folding frequency is 2.6 Hz. For a 40-Hz ( gamma-band) center frequency, the <italic>e</italic>-folding time is 0.03 s and the <italic>e</italic>-folding frequency is 10.5 Hz. Note that these <italic>e</italic>-folding parameters imply that wavelet scaling preserves the joint time-frequency resolution (equal areas in time-frequency space), with higher temporal resolution but broader frequency resolution as the wavelet scale decreases.

          <p>Segments corresponding to trials for which individual subjects produced the correct response were isolated and averaged separately according to whether or not the subject reported the experience of insight. Planned statistical tests (repeated-measure ANOVAs) were performed in order to detect insight-related effects on frontal midline theta (5–8 Hz), posterior alpha (8–13 Hz), fronto-central beta (13–20 Hz), and left and right temporal gamma (20–50 Hz). Response-locked event-related potentials (ERPs) were also computed using the same analysis epoch. Standard ERP analyses yielded no evidence of statistically significant effects, likely because ERPs reflect phase-locked activity rather than the induced (i.e., nonphase-locked) activity examined in the wavelet analyses; due to the long response times evident in this experiment, phase locking resulting from problem presentation would not be expected.</p>
          <p>EEG effects were topographically mapped by employing spline-based Laplacian mapping with an FMRI-derived realistic head model and digitized electrode positions. Localization of EEG/ERP signals is a form of probabilistic modelling rather than direct neuroimaging. In contrast to other techniques, source estimation by Laplacian mapping indicates the presence of superficial foci of neuroelectric activity with minimal assumptions.</p>
