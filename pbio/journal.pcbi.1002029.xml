        <p>Duplications of genes encoding highly connected and essential proteins are selected against in several species but not in human, where duplicated genes encode highly connected proteins. To understand when and how gene duplicability changed in evolution, we compare gene and network properties in four species (<italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, yeast, fly, and human) that are representative of the increase in evolutionary complexity, defined as progressive growth in the number of genes, cells, and cell types. We find that the origin and conservation of a gene significantly correlates with the properties of the encoded protein in the protein-protein interaction network. All four species preserve a core of singleton and central hubs that originated early in evolution, are highly conserved, and accomplish basic biological functions. Another group of hubs appeared in metazoans and duplicated in vertebrates, mostly through vertebrate-specific whole genome duplication. Such recent and duplicated hubs are frequently targets of microRNAs and show tissue-selective expression, suggesting that these are alternative mechanisms to control their dosage. Our study shows how networks modified during evolution and contributes to explaining the occurrence of somatic genetic diseases, such as cancer, in terms of network perturbations.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Gene copy number is often tightly controlled because it directly affects the gene dosage. In several species, including yeast, worm, and fly, genes that have a single gene copy (singleton genes) encode proteins with several connections in the protein interaction network (hubs) as well as essential proteins. Surprisingly, in mouse and human essential proteins and hubs are encoded by genes with more than one copy in the genome (duplicated genes). Here we show that these two distinct groups of hubs were acquired at different times during the evolution of protein interaction network and contribute in different ways to the cell life. Singleton hubs are ancestral genes that are conserved from prokaryotes to vertebrates and accomplish basic functions that deal with the cell survival. Duplicated hubs were acquired mostly within metazoans and duplicated through vertebrate-specific whole genome duplication. These genes are involved in processes that are crucial for the organization of multicellularity. Although duplicated, also recent hubs are subject to gene dosage control through microRNAs and tissue-selective expression. The clarification of how the protein interaction network evolves enables us to understand the adaptation to the progressive increase in complexity and to better characterize the genes involved in diseases such as cancer.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Gene duplicability defines the propensity to retain multiple copies of a gene and varies among species and gene categories. In yeast, singleton genes, <italic>i.e.</italic> single copy genes whose duplication is selected against, preferentially encode members of protein complexes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Papp1">[1]</xref>, highly connected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Hughes1">[2]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Prachumwat1">[3]</xref> and essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Papp1">[1]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Yang1">[4]</xref> proteins. Similar relationships are maintained also in multicellular species such as worm and fly, where singleton genes encode highly connected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Hughes1">[2]</xref> and essential <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Makino1">[5]</xref> proteins. The strict retention of one single copy of these particular gene categories is a consequence of the fragility towards dosage modifications. Their duplication is deleterious because it interferes with essential cellular functions and with the fine-tuned equilibrium between formation and disruption of protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Veitia1">[6]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Veitia2">[7]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent studies showed that the duplicability of mammalian hubs and essential proteins is different from that of other species. Human hubs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Liang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Rambaldi1">[9]</xref> and mouse essential proteins that are involved in development <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Makino1">[5]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Liang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Liao1">[10]</xref> are preferentially encoded by duplicated genes, while other categories of essential mouse genes can be both singletons and duplicated <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Makino1">[5]</xref>. These differences between human, mouse and the other species suggest that gene duplicability underwent modifications during evolution, which are likely related with the extensive acquisition of novel genes in vertebrates. Through massive gene duplication followed by diversification of paralogs, vertebrates accommodated the expansion of gene families that are involved in regulation, signal transduction, protein transport, and protein modification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Vogel1">[11]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Prachumwat2">[12]</xref>. In this context, it has been proposed that a higher connectivity may favor the functional diversification of paralogs, for example through tissue specialization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Liang1">[8]</xref>. However, a thorough analysis of which types of genes undergo modification of their duplicability during evolution and how this influences the network properties of the encoded proteins is still missing.</p>
      <p>The comparison of gene and network properties between species is the most straightforward approach to verify whether the modification of gene duplicability is indeed related to the expansion of the vertebrate gene repertoire. Despite the fact that current representations of protein interactomes are still incomplete <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Gandhi1">[13]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Hart1">[14]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Venkatesan1">[15]</xref> and may include a high fraction of false positives <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Yu1">[16]</xref>, the recent completion of interaction screenings in several species finally allows comparative network analyses. For example, the comparison of human, fly, worm, and yeast networks showed that they maintain a similar structure despite the difference in size <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Beltrao1">[17]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Hahn1">[18]</xref>. In addition, regardless of their connectivity, proteins that occupy central positions in the interactomes of <italic>Saccharomyces cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic> and <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic> are also essential and slow-evolving <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Hahn1">[18]</xref>. These studies demonstrate that the comparison of protein and gene properties in different species can be used to infer general evolutionary trends.</p>
      <p>To unravel when the differences between duplicability and network properties arose during evolution, we undertake a comparative analysis of genes and networks in four species, <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, yeast, fly, and human. These species display different levels of complexity, defined as the number of genes, cells, and cell types <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Vogel1">[11]</xref>, and also high quality genomic and interaction data. We compare connectivity and centrality of all proteins with origin, conservation and duplicability of the corresponding genes. We identify a core of singleton hubs whose properties are maintained constant from prokaryotes to human, and another group of duplicated hubs that have emerged during the evolution of vertebrates. Our analysis provides evidence of how the hubs properties modified during evolution and helps in interpreting the occurrence of somatic genetic diseases that are typical of multicellularity, such as cancer, in terms of network perturbations. In particular, we find that cancer genes are representatives of the two groups of human hubs: one that originated early in evolution and is composed of singleton genes, and the other that appeared later and is enriched in duplicated genes. Functionally, these two groups correspond to <italic>caretakers</italic> and <italic>gatekeepers</italic>, suggesting that these two different ways to initiate tumorigenesis emerged at different times during evolution.</p>

        <p>The purpose of our analysis is to compare gene origin, conservation, and duplicability with connectivity and centrality of the encoded proteins in <italic>E. coli</italic>, <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic>, <italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, and <italic>Homo sapiens</italic>. To this aim, we identify a reliable set of unique genes in each species (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002029-t001">Table 1</xref>), and develop a four-step procedure to determine origin, conservation, and duplicability of these genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g001">Figure 1</xref>). First, we retrieve all clusters of orthologs with different inclusiveness that are associated with each gene (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) using the EggNOG database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Jensen1">[19]</xref>. Second, we associate all 373 species present in EggNOG to seven internal nodes of the tree of life that represent major transitions in evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). These nodes include the last universal common ancestor (LUCA), which defines the ancestral organism before the split between prokaryotes and eukaryotes, eukaryotes, opisthokonts, metazoans, vertebrates, and mammals. We also consider group-specific transitions such as primates for human, insects for fly, fungi for yeast and bacteria for <italic>E. coli</italic>. Third, we identify orthologs and paralogs of each gene in the highest possible number of internal nodes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g001">Figure 1C</xref>). Finally, we exploit the information collected in the first three steps to assign gene origin, conservation, and duplicability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g001">Figure 1D, E, F</xref>).</p>

        <p>Since we retrieve orthologs for all species stored in EggNOG, we can use this information to infer general trends on gene origin, conservation, and duplicability during evolution. We define the evolutionary origin of a gene as the deepest internal node of the tree of life where an ortholog can be found (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Overall, we observe high variability in the gene origin between species (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s005">Table S1</xref>). In accordance with previous reports <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-DomazetLoso1">[20]</xref>, about 60% of human genes have orthologs in prokaryotes and early eukaryotes and more than one fourth of human genes originated with vertebrates or later. Similar trends are confirmed in other vertebrates but not in invertebrates, which are in fact composed of a higher fraction of old genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s005">Table S1</xref>). The substantial acquisition of vertebrate-specific genes is likely related with the two events of whole genome duplications that occurred in the early vertebrate genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Dehal1">[21]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Nakatani1">[22]</xref>.</p>

            <p>(A) The percentage of genes that originated at each internal nodes of the tree of life is shown for the four species used in the analysis, and for seven additional species. The group-specific nodes correspond to primates for <italic>H. sapiens</italic>, rodents for <italic>M. musculus</italic>, birds for <italic>Gallus gallus</italic>, fishes for <italic>D. rerio</italic>, nematodes for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, insects for <italic>D. melanogaster</italic> and <italic>A. mellifera</italic>, fungi for <italic>S. cerevisiae</italic> and <italic>Schizosaccharomyces pombe</italic>, and bacteria for <italic>E. coli</italic> and <italic>Bacillus subtilis</italic>. The lack of specific genes for <italic>C. elegans</italic>, <italic>G. gallus</italic> and <italic>M. musculus</italic> is likely an artifact due to presence in EggNOG of few species for the corresponding group-specific nodes. LUCA, last universal common ancestor; euk, eukaryotes; opi, opisthokonts; met, metazoans; ver, vertebrates. (B) The percentage of genes that have the same conservation is shown for each species. Conservation is measured as the number of internal nodes where no ortholog is found since the gene appeared. In all species, conservation ranges from 0 (<italic>i.e.</italic> no missing node) to 5 (<italic>i.e.</italic> the gene originated with LUCA and has orthologs only in prokaryotes and in the group-specific cluster). Since only few genes have conservation 5, we grouped them with genes with conservation 4. (C) The percentage of singleton and duplicated genes is shown for all eleven species.</p>

        <p>To measure gene conservation, we count the internal nodes of the tree of life where the gene is lost since it appeared. With this measure of conservation, we do not estimate sequence divergence within a set of orthologous genes, but rather retention or loss of orthologs throughout evolution. Moreover, by counting the number of missing instead of retained nodes, we obtain estimates of conservation that are comparable between species and independent from the time of appearance of the gene. Indeed, zero always corresponds to maximum conservation, while conservation decreases progressively with the increase in the number of nodes where no orthologs can be found. Among eukaryotes, invertebrates show a lower fraction of highly conserved genes (conservation 0, 1, 2) and a higher fraction of poorly conserved genes (conservation 4 and 5) when compared to vertebrates and fungi (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g002">Figure 2B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s005">Table S1</xref>). Coupled with the results of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, this suggests that invertebrates retain a high fraction of ancient genes that are lost in other lineages.</p>
        <p>To identify duplicated and singleton genes, we check whether paralogs are present within the eukaryotic-specific clusters of orthologs (KOGs) for eukaryotes, and within the most inclusive clusters of orthologs (COGs) for prokaryotes. As expected <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Yang1">[4]</xref>, gene duplicability increases with the increase in organismal complexity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g002">Figure 2C</xref>, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002029-t001">Tables 1</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s005">S1</xref>). Around 65% of human genes are duplicated, and similar percentages are found in other metazoans with the exception of insects, which have less than 60% of duplicated genes, (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g001">Figure 1C</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s005">Table S1</xref>). This result, together with the high rate of DNA loss <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Petrov1">[23]</xref> and the low rate of fixed transposable elements <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Gonzalez1">[24]</xref>, confirms the compactness of the fly genome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Petrov2">[25]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We rebuild the interactomes of the four species by combining all available primary interaction data from seven public resources (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Methods</xref>). Given the poor overlap between these datasets, their integration considerably increases the total number of interactions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s006">Table S2</xref>), and the resulting networks are the most complete, to our knowledge, representations of protein interactomes (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002029-t002">Table 2</xref>). Since these resources also contain interaction data for other species, we rebuild the interactomes also for <italic>Mus musculus</italic> and <italic>C. elegans</italic> in the attempt of extending the analysis to other species. However, the resulting networks represent only around 10% and 20% of the mouse and worm proteins, respectively. Due to this high level of incompleteness, we decide not to include these species in the analysis.</p>

        <p>The networks of human, fly, yeast, and <italic>E. coli</italic> are all scale-free (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s001">Figure S1</xref>), although they differ in terms of completeness, number of interactions, and type of experimental support (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002029-t002">Tables 2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s006">S2</xref>). Because of this heterogeneity, and to minimize the impact of false positives, we identify a ‘gold set’ of interactions that are supported either by single-gene experiments or by more than one high-throughput screening. The only networks that retain a substantial fraction of information are those of human and yeast (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pcbi-1002029-t002">Table 2</xref>). We use these two gold sets to confirm the signal obtained from the analysis of the whole networks, thus excluding that it is affected by the experimental differences between species.</p>
        <p>Since the networks that we rebuild are considerably bigger than those used in previous studies, as a first analysis we check whether we observe the same relationships between duplicability and connectivity that have been reported in the literature. We verify that, overall, more connected and more central proteins are encoded by duplicated genes in human and by singleton genes in the other species, both in the whole networks and in the gold sets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s002">Figure S2</xref>). Singleton proteins are more connected than duplicated proteins also in fly, thus suggesting that the modification of the relationships between duplicability and connectivity occurred after the divergence of vertebrates.</p>

        <title>Ancient and conserved genes encode central hubs in all species</title>
        <p>In order to verify whether the time of origin of a gene affects the network properties of the encoded protein, we analyze connectivity and centrality of each protein in respect to the origin of the corresponding gene. For each species separately, we compare degree and betweenness of proteins that originated at a given evolutionary time with degree and betweenness of all proteins that originated earlier and later. In each species, we find that genes of a given age encode proteins that are significantly more connected and more central than younger proteins and less connected and less central than older proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g003">Figure 3A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s007">Table S3</xref>). This means that older proteins established more interactions and became more central during evolution. The general tendency is detectable in all four species and in the gold sets of human and yeast. The only exceptions are ancient fly genes and human genes that originated with metazoans. In fly, the unstable signal may be influenced by the high fraction of interactions detected via high-throughput experiments (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s006">Table S2</xref>), which are enriched in false positives. The higher connectivity of human proteins that originated in metazoans is instead due to the peculiar features of these genes, which will become more evident with the analysis of duplicability (see below). Since there is high variability in the number of genes that originated at each evolutionary time, we check whether this could affect the results. To this aim, we compare connectivity and centrality between random sets of 500 proteins originated at a given time and random sets of 500 younger and older proteins. After repeating the random comparison 100,000 times, we derive the distributions of the differences of mean degree and betweenness and compute the corresponding <italic>z</italic>-score. This is defined as the fraction of random comparisons with a difference &lt;0 and &gt;0 when compared with younger and older proteins, respectively. The analysis of these distributions confirms that proteins with a given origin are generally more connected and more central than younger proteins and less connected and central than older proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s003">Figure S3A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s007">Table S3</xref>).</p>

        <p>We next verify whether also the conservation of a gene has an impact on the network properties of the encoded protein. We compare degree and betweenness of proteins with a given conservation with degree and betweenness of more and less conserved proteins. By comparing both the total distribution of degree and betweenness with the Wilcoxon test (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g003">Figures 3B</xref>) and random sets composed of an equal number of genes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s003">Figure S3B</xref>), we observe that conserved proteins are connected and central, while proteins with low degree and low betweenness are also poorly conserved in all species. Although with a lower statistical support, the general trend is overall confirmed also in the gold sets of human and yeast (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s007">Table S3</xref>).</p>
        <p>Our analyses show that genes that appeared early in evolution and that are well conserved encode highly connected and central proteins. Since the same trend is found independently in all four networks, it is likely that these genes constitute a core of ancestral and conserved orthologs, which maintain identical properties throughout evolution. Indeed we find that between 44 and 51% of singleton hubs that originated early in evolution in one of the four species have orthologs that are singleton hubs also in one of the other networks (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s008">Table S4</xref>). This is a remarkable result, considering the level of incompleteness of the four interactomes and the fact that they are assembled independently from each other.</p>

        <title>Human network acquired a novel group of duplicated hubs</title>
        <p>Since we find that connectivity and centrality of a protein depend on when the corresponding gene appeared in evolution, we wonder how the gene origin affects the network properties of singleton and duplicated proteins. We compare connectivity and centrality between singleton and duplicated proteins that originated at the same evolutionary time. We find that, among ancient genes (<italic>i.e.</italic> genes originated with LUCA and in early eukaryotes), singletons encode more connected and more central proteins than duplicated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g004">Figure 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s009">Table S5</xref>).

        <p>According to our findings, all species from prokaryotes to vertebrates maintain a group of highly connected proteins, which are encoded by ancient, conserved, and singleton genes that are sensitive to dosage modification. Another group of human hubs emerged later in evolution, namely with metazoans and, to a lower extent, with vertebrates and mammals. These genes differ from ancient hubs because they can retain gene duplicates and are therefore robust towards gene duplication. Their high connectivity explains why human genes that originated in metazoans deviate from the common trend and are more connected and central than older genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s003">S3</xref>). In fly, the network properties of duplicated proteins that originated with metazoans do not differ from those of singletons. Therefore, metazoan-specific genes became central hubs at least after speciation of insects. This once again confirms that the modification in the relationships between duplicability and connectivity occurred in the ancestor of vertebrates.</p>

        <title>Ancient and recent human hubs accomplish different functions</title>
        <p>According to the results of our analysis, human hubs can be divided into two groups depending on their origin and duplicability. To test whether this distinction also results in the accomplishment of different biological processes, we compare the functions of these two groups of hubs. In absence of a consensus definition <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Vallabhajosyula1">[26]</xref>, we identify hubs as the top 25% most connected proteins of the network, This results in 2,573 human proteins with more than 12 interactions. The comparison between the two groups of hubs shows that they are indeed involved in different processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s010">Table S6</xref>). Ancient singleton hubs are enriched in basic functions that are needed for the survival of the cell, such as cellular metabolism and transcription. Duplicated hubs that appeared recently in evolution are instead involved in regulatory functions that coordinate the organization of the multicellular organism (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g004">Figure 4B</xref>). We also notice that the time of appearance of a gene affects its function more than the duplicability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g004">Figure 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s010">Table S6</xref>). Ancient and recent hubs are therefore representative subgroups of ancient and recent genes, respectively. Similar functional differences between ancient and recent genes have been reported in yeast, where ancestral genes are involved in transcription, replication, and other basic cellular processes, while genetic, transcriptional, and posttranslational regulation is associated with recently evolved genes <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Kunin1">[27]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Gene dosage of human duplicated hubs is tightly regulated</title>
        <p>To understand how duplicated hubs adapted to the dosage imbalance due to gene duplication, we check whether they are ohnologs, <italic>i.e.</italic> paralogs originated via whole genome duplication <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Wolfe1">[28]</xref>, miRNA targets, and tissue-selective genes. These are three different ways of controlling gene dosage. The duplication of the entire genome maintains the dosage balance between interactors and allows the duplication of dosage-sensitive genes in yeast <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Qian1">[29]</xref> and in vertebrates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Makino2">[30]</xref>. Similarly, miRNAs play a pervasive role in the post-transcriptional regulation of gene expression in higher eukaryotes, particularly in those biological processes that require a fine-tuned control of the gene dosage, such as signal transduction <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Inui1">[31]</xref>. Finally, tissue selectivity represents yet another mechanism of gene dosage control because paralogs expressed in different tissues do not interfere with each other <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Fernandez1">[32]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Semon1">[33]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We find that the fraction of duplicated hubs that are also ohnologs, miRNA targets, and tissue selective genes is significantly higher than that of singleton hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, 61.4% and 33.9%, respectively, <italic>p</italic>-value &lt;2.2×10<sup>−16</sup>, Fisher's exact test). This enrichment is mostly due to the large overlap between ohnologs and duplicated hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g005">Figure 5B</xref>). However, the same trend remains detectable when only miRNA targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g005">Figure 5C</xref>), and tissue selective genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g005">Figure 5D</xref>) are considered separately.

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>In this study we show that the evolutionary history of a gene affects its duplicability, as well as the centrality and the connectivity of the encoded protein in the corresponding interactome. These results offer novel insights into the reciprocal influences between gene and network modifications during evolution. In all species, the core of the network is composed of ancestral and singleton hubs that are highly conserved because they do not require further modifications. Genes that are progressively acquired during evolution instead encode less connected and less central proteins. This agrees with the observation that essential proteins occupy the center of the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Gandhi1">[13]</xref>, while proteins that are under positive selection and undergo structural modifications are located at the network periphery <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Kim1">[43]</xref>. The importance of the time of origin on the properties of a gene has been recently reported also in yeast where proteins that originated before the whole genome duplication are more connected and more central than younger proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Capra1">[44]</xref>. Intuitively, these results support the preferential attachment model of network evolution, in which the expansion of the network starts from an ancient core <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Barabasi1">[45]</xref> and progresses through gene duplication and divergence <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Evlampiev1">[46]</xref>. However, our analysis also reveals that significant deviations from this model occur in correspondence of massive genome reorganizations, such as the whole genome duplications that occurred in vertebrates. Owing to such events, even genes that are sensitive to dosage modifications can tolerate duplications because the dosage balance with their interactors is preserved. Therefore, together with the increase in the number of protein coding genes, vertebrates also modified their interactomes and likely both events played a role in shaping their evolution.</p>
      <p>The rapid functional divergence of paralogs through massive neo- and sub-functionalization <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Ohno1">[47]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Force1">[48]</xref> could also explain the retention of paralogous hubs owing to the quickly diversification of their function. However, sub- and neo-functionalization play a role in the diversification of paralogs also in other species such as <italic>E. coli</italic>, yeast, and fly, where only singleton hubs are retained. Therefore, the time of origin, more than the functional divergence, influences the retention of duplicated hubs.</p>
      <p>Conceptually and functionally, the two evolutionary distinct groups of ancient and recent human hubs resemble ‘date’ and ‘party’ hubs that have been described in the yeast interactome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Han1">[49]</xref>. Similarly to party hubs, ancestral and singleton human hubs are mainly involved in cellular and nucleic acid metabolism, while recent and duplicated human hubs act as regulators, mediators or adaptors, similarly to date hubs. The difference between yeast and human is again in the time of appearance of human duplicated hubs and in the fact that in yeast both groups are encoded by singleton genes. Moreover, in human the signal of high connectivity and centrality that derives from recent hubs is stronger than that from ancient hubs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g003">Figures 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s003">S3</xref>, 4 and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s009">Table S5</xref>). This is consistent with previous findings of an overall enrichment of the human network in duplicated hubs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Liang1">[8]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Rambaldi1">[9]</xref> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s002">Figure S2</xref>).</p>
      <p>There are several indications that, despite being robust towards gene duplication, recent hubs remain sensitive to gene dosage modifications. First, human duplicated hubs rapidly underwent alternative ways to control their dosage, for example through tissue-selective expression and miRNA regulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002029-g005">Figure 5</xref>). Second, ohnologs do not undergo further small-scale duplications and copy number variations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Makino2">[30]</xref>. Finally, genes that carry disease-related germline mutations are depleted in hubs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Goh1">[50]</xref> and somatic mutations of hubs are often associated with cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Rambaldi1">[9]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Jonsson1">[51]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Syed1">[52]</xref>. All together, these observations indicate that hub modifications are usually harmful, even independently from the individual gene function. This analysis also adds novel insights to our understanding of the network properties of cancer genes and to the importance of gene dosage in the development of cancer. We recently reported that cancer genes are overall enriched in singleton hubs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Rambaldi1">[9]</xref>. However, when the same analysis is repeated taking into account the gene origin, also cancer genes, like other human hubs, can be divided into two groups (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002029.s004">Figure S4</xref>). One group is composed of ancestral cancer genes that encode singleton hubs, while the other includes cancer genes that originated with metazoans and are enriched in duplicated hubs. These two groups of cancer genes broadly correspond to <italic>caretakers</italic>, <italic>i.e.</italic> genes involved in the repair of DNA and in the maintenance of genome stability, and <italic>gatekeepers</italic>, which instead appeared lately in evolution and accomplish functions related to signaling and growth <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-DomazetLoso2">[53]</xref>. Therefore, there are two ways of promoting cancer, one that deals with basic and ancestral functions, and the other that interferes with regulatory processes. In either case, tumorigenesis starts from the somatic perturbation of hubs, which represent components of the cellular network that are sensitive to modifications.</p>

        <title>Orthology and paralogy assignment</title>
        <p>We identify seven internal nodes of the tree of life that correspond to major transitions in evolution (LUCA, eukaryotes, opisthokonts, metazoans, vertebrates, mammals, and group-specific transition), and assign each of the 373 species present in EggNOG v. 1.0 to the most specific internal node, using the corresponding taxonomy ID. The four analyzed species are assigned to the corresponding group-specific transition (primates, insects, fungi, bacteria), while the remaining 369 species are taken as representatives of the other major transitions. For example, we assign human to primates, other non-primate mammalian species (<italic>i.e.</italic> mouse) to mammals, non-mammalian vertebrate species (<italic>i.e.</italic> fish) to vertebrates, and so on. The group-specific nodes for the four species do not reflect comparable evolutionary transitions, and for human we are much more specific than with the other three species. This reflects the availability of species and orthology information in EggNOG. For example, in human we are able to discriminate between genes that originated in mammals and genes that originated with primates because in EggNOG there are three primates (<italic>H. sapiens</italic>, <italic>Pan troglodytes</italic> and <italic>Macaca mulatta</italic>) and five additional mammals (<italic>Monodelphis domestica</italic>, <italic>Bos taurus</italic>, <italic>Canis familiaris</italic>, <italic>M. musculus</italic> and <italic>Rattus norvegicus</italic>). For fly, instead, the group-specific transition is insects, because only three insects have orthology information (<italic>D. melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Apis mellifera</italic> and <italic>Anopheles gambiae</italic>). It should be noted that this different resolution of the group-specific nodes does not introduce any bias in the results because the fraction of group-specific genes is very low in all species. In addition, the number of genes that originated at a certain time in evolution does not affect genes that originated earlier or later. Finally, the general trend of origin, conservation, duplicability and network properties is detectable in all species, independently on the resolution of the group-specific transitions.</p>
        <p>Once species have been assigned to internal nodes, we assign each gene to clusters of orthologs with different levels of inclusiveness and check for the presence of orthologs in the seven internal nodes. For example, for human we check for the presence of non-primate orthologs in the mammalian clusters, of non-mammalian orthologs in the vertebrate clusters, of non-vertebrate orthologs in the metazoan clusters, and so on.</p>

        <title>Evolutionary origin, conservation, and duplicability</title>
        <p>We define the origin of each gene as the most ancient internal node where an ortholog can be found. For a small number of genes in each species (120 in human, 270 in fly and 5 in yeast) we cannot assign a precise evolutionary origin, because no clusters that contain the gene include representative orthologs. These genes are excluded from further analysis. To measure conservation of a gene throughout evolution, we count the number of missing nodes, <italic>i.e.</italic> internal nodes of the tree of life where no orthologs of that gene can be found since it originated. By considering the same number of internal nodes (seven) for all species and by counting the number of lost instead of retained nodes, we gather an estimate of conservation that is comparable between species and independent from the origin of the gene. We consider a gene duplicated if there is at least one other gene of the same species (<italic>i.e.</italic> at least one paralog) within the eukaryotic-specific clusters (KOGs) for human, fly and yeast, and within the most inclusive clusters (COGs) for <italic>E. coli</italic>. If no paralogs can be detected, the gene is considered singleton. With this method, we do not date the time of gene duplication but rather gene duplicability, <italic>i.e.</italic> whether a gene underwent duplication and this duplication was retained at least once in evolution. For a total of 63 genes in human, fly, and yeast both KOG nor COG clusters are available, and we exclude these genes from further analysis.</p>

        <title>Comparison of gene and network properties</title>
        <p>We group genes according to their evolutionary origin and compare the distributions of degree and betweenness with the corresponding distributions of younger and older proteins. In a similar way, we compare the distributions of degree and betweenness of proteins with a given conservation with those of more and less conserved proteins. All comparisons are made using the Wilcoxon test. In order to eliminate possible biases due to the different number of genes that originated at each evolutionary time, we apply a randomization test. In each species independently, we extract 500 random genes with a given origin and calculate the mean degree and betweenness of the corresponding proteins. We then compute the difference between these values and the corresponding mean degree and betweenness of 500 randomly picked younger proteins and older proteins, separately. In case a group includes less than 500 genes, also the other groups will contain the same number of genes (<italic>i.e.</italic> since there are only 84 primate-specific genes, they are compared to 84 randomly selected younger or older genes). We repeat the random comparison 100,000 times and derive the distributions of the degree and betweenness differences between the proteins that originated at a certain evolutionary level and younger and older proteins. Finally, we calculate the <italic>z-</italic>score as the fraction of random comparisons with a difference &lt;0 when comparing with younger proteins, and &gt;0 when comparing with older proteins. Differences in the mean degree or betweenness &lt;0 are associated with more connected or central proteins, while differences &gt;0 to less connected or central proteins. We use a similar random test to compare degree and betweenness of proteins with a certain level of conservation with more and less conserved proteins. To visualize the results, we transform the <italic>p</italic>-values and <italic>z-</italic>scores into heatmaps. Red boxes are associated with significantly higher values of degree and betweenness, green boxes correspond to significantly lower values, and non-significant <italic>p</italic>-values are colored in black. To evaluate the effect of gene origin on duplicability, we compare degree and betweenness of duplicated and singleton proteins with the same age using the Wilcoxon test. Also in this case, we derive the heatmaps from the <italic>p</italic>-values. Red-colored boxes indicate that duplicated proteins are more connected or more central, green-colored boxes indicate that singleton proteins are more connected or more central, and black indicates no statistically significant difference between singleton and duplicated proteins.</p>

        <title>Functional analysis</title>
        <p>To perform the functional analysis we rely on the biological process branch of the gene ontology (GO) tree and compare GO terms present at levels 5 and 6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002029-Ashburner1">[65]</xref>. GO levels refer to the branching points of the tree, with level 1 corresponding to the root of the tree. Increase in levels numbers are associated with increased specificity in the functional description and to decreased number of described genes. Levels 5 and 6 represent a compromise to obtain a good resolution in functional description for a fair number of genes. We further group all terms at these two levels into 12 categories and perform three comparisons: (1) ancient singleton hubs and recent duplicated hubs; (2) genes that originated in LUCA and eukaryotes (ancient) and genes that originated in metazoans and vertebrates (recent); (3) singletons and duplicated genes. For each comparison, the functional enrichment is detected using Fisher's exact test and the resulting <italic>p</italic>-values are adjusted for the false discovery rate (FDR) using Benjamini-Hochberg method.</p>
