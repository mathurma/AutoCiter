        <p>Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) plays critical roles in regulating animal development, and in several cases, H3K27me3 is also required for the proper expression of developmentally important genes in plants. However, the extent to which H3K27me3 regulates plant genes on a genome-wide scale remains unknown. In addition, it is not clear whether the establishment and spreading of H3K27me3 occur through the same mechanisms in plants and animals. We identified regions containing H3K27me3 in the genome of the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic> using a high-density whole-genome tiling microarray. The results suggest that H3K27me3 is a major silencing mechanism in plants that regulates an unexpectedly large number of genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> (~4,400), and that the maintenance of H3K27me3 is largely independent of other epigenetic pathways, such as DNA methylation or RNA interference. Unlike in animals, where H3K27m3 occupies large genomic regions, in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> we found that H3K27m3 domains were largely restricted to the transcribed regions of single genes. Furthermore, unlike in animals systems, H3K27m3 domains were not preferentially associated with low–nucleosome density regions. The results suggest that different mechanisms may underlie the establishment and spreading of H3K27me3 in plants and animals.</p>

          <p>During plant and animal development, genes must be activated or repressed according to a strict temporal and spatial schedule. Histones, which are DNA-packaging proteins, play a key role in this process. For development to proceed normally, an amino acid residue (lysine 27) in histone H3 must undergo a chemical modification (called trimethylation). The modified histone (H3K27me3) maintains the repression of its target genes in appropriate tissues or developmental stages. H3K27me3 has been shown to regulate hundreds of genes and many developmental processes in animals, where it also appears to interact with other epigenetic pathways. However, the extent to which this histone modification regulates plant gene expression remained unknown. Does H3K27me3 interact with other epigenetic pathways in plants? Do plants and animals have similar H3K27me3 patterning and underlying mechanisms? To address these questions, we combined chromatin immunoprecipitation with whole-genome tiling microarrays (ChIP-chip) to identify H3K27me3-associated regions across the entire genome of the flowering plant <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> at high resolution (35 base pairs). The results suggest that H3K27me3 is a major and systematic gene silencing mechanism in plants that acts independently of small RNAs or DNA methylation. Furthermore, distinct features of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> H3K27me3 patterning suggest that different mechanisms may be responsible for the establishment and spread of this histone modification in plants and animals.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Trimethylation of histone H3 lysine 27 (H3K27me3) is critically important for the normal development of animals. The Polycomb-group (PcG) protein complexes PhoRC, PRC1, and PRC2 collectively establish and maintain H3K27me3 at ~400 and ~2,000 genes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, respectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b004">4</xref>]. In <italic>Drosophila</italic>, PRC1 and PRC2 are recruited to nucleosome-depleted regions of the genome called Polycomb response elements (PREs) primarily through the sequence-specific binding activity of Pho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b005">5</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b010">10</xref>]. The PRC2 complex then catalyzes the trimethylation of H3K27, whereas the PRC1 complex is required for the bidirectional spreading of H3K27me3 from PREs to the adjacent regions, presumably until an insulator is encountered. As a result, H3K27me3 forms broad domains in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals that can span up to hundreds of kilobases and cover multiple genes, maintaining them in a transcriptionally suppressed state at appropriate developmental stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b012">12</xref>]. The observation that H3K27me3 target genes are enriched for transcription factors underscores the importance of this histone modification in regulating animal development [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b012">12</xref>].</p>
      <p>Plants also contain ample amounts of H3K27me3, accounting for ~5% of the canonical histone H3.1, but trimethylation is undetectable on the histone variant H3.2 (referred to as H3.3 in <italic>Drosophila</italic>) that is predicted to be associated with actively transcribed genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b014">14</xref>]. Furthermore, <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> mutants defective in H3K27me3 exhibit severe developmental abnormalities [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b015">15</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b018">18</xref>], and the repression of several important developmental patterning genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, such as <italic>FLOWERING LOCUS C (FLC), AGAMOUS,</italic> and <italic>MEDEA,</italic> requires H3K27me3 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b024">24</xref>]. It is therefore likely that the silencing function of H3K27me3 is conserved between plants and animals and that H3K27me3 also plays essential roles in regulating normal plant development.</p>
      <p>However, several important questions regarding the patterning and function of H3K27me3 in plants remain unanswered. For example, the extent to which H3K27me3 regulates plant gene expression on a genome-wide scale is unknown. Thus far, only seven plant genes have been shown to be associated with H3K27me3, including <italic>FLC, AGAMOUS, MEDEA, SHOOT MERISTEMLESS (STM), PHERES1, FUSCA3,</italic> and <italic>AGAMOUS-LIKE 19 (AGL19)</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b019">19</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b027">27</xref>]. In addition, whereas plants have homologs of each of the PRC2 components, they do not encode components of PRC1 or PhoRC, and it is therefore not clear whether H3K27me3 is established and maintained by similar mechanisms in plants and animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b029">29</xref>]. Furthermore, the relationship between H3K27me3 and other important epigenetic pathways in plants such as DNA methylation and RNA interference (RNAi) has not been determined.</p>
      <p>To begin to address these questions, we identified regions containing H3K27me3 in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome using high-resolution whole-genome tiling microarrays. We found that H3K27me3 regulates an unexpectedly large number of genes (~4,400) in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> including numerous transcription factors. In addition, we present evidence that H3K27me3 functions independently of DNA methylation or RNAi. Furthermore, several important differences were observed between the patterning of H3K27me3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> and <italic>Drosophila,</italic> suggesting that distinct mechanisms may underlie the establishment and maintenance of H3K27me3 in plants and animals.</p>

        <title>Genome-Wide Identification of H3K27me3 Regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
        <p>We performed a genome-wide identification of regions containing H3K27me3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> using chromatin immunoprecipitation (ChIP) and high-density Affymetrix whole-genome tiling microarrays (ChIP-on-chip). Genomic DNA associated with H3K27me3 was isolated by ChIP, amplified, and hybridized to a microarray, which covered ~97% of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome at 35–base pair (bp) resolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b030">30</xref>]. As a control, nucleosomal DNA was isolated by ChIP using an antibody against the C terminus of H3 (regardless of its modifications) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b031">31</xref>]. Genomic regions associated with H3K27me3 (“H3K27me3 regions”) were identified as those yielding significantly higher hybridization signals when probed with H3K27me3 ChIP samples than with nucleosomal DNA, using a two-state hidden Markov model based on probe-level <italic>t</italic> statistics (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b032">32</xref>].</p>
        <p>The H3K27me3 regions identified in this way were highly consistent with results from previous studies. All seven known H3K27me3 target genes were found to be enriched for H3K27me3 in our dataset (listed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g001">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg001">S1</xref>). In addition, we found that many other genes previously implicated by genetic evidence to contain H3K27me3 (e.g., misregulated in Polycomb-group protein mutant backgrounds) were indeed direct H3K27me3 targets (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg001">Figure S1</xref>). For example, of the 106 genes overexpressed in an <italic>msi1</italic> mutant (component of PRC2) and therefore likely to be enriched for direct H3K27me3 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b033">33</xref>], 48 (~45.3%) were associated with H3K27me3 in our dataset, whereas the remaining 58 could represent indirect targets. In contrast, only one region (253 bp) in the 154,478-bp chloroplast genome (~0.16%) was falsely identified as containing H3K27me3. Additional verifications were obtained by real-time PCR validation of H3K27me3-positive and -negative regions identified here, using independently prepared ChIP samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg002">Figure S2</xref>). Taken together, these results indicate that our procedure was sensitive and yielded a low false discovery rate.</p>

        <p>A total of 8,979 H3K27me3 regions were identified, covering ~6.9 Mb and representing ~5.7% of the sequenced nuclear genome. Consistent with previous results from cytological studies using immunofluorescence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b016">16</xref>], we found that H3K27me3 regions were highly enriched in the euchromatic arms, resembling the distribution of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g001">Figure 1</xref>B). This is in stark contrast to the heterochromatic distribution of several other silencing marks such as DNA methylation, small interfering RNAs (siRNAs), or H3K9me2 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b016">16</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b034">34</xref>], and suggests that H3K27me3 is primarily targeted to genic regions. Indeed, 6,357 (~70.8%) of the H3K27me3 regions were found in the promoters (200-bp regions upstream of transcription start sites) or the transcribed regions of genes.</p>

        <p>H3K27m3 was found to be associated with a large number of genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. We found that 2,778 of the 14,948 expressed genes with known functions (“known genes”; ~18.6%) and 1,628 of the 10,475 expressed genes with unknown functions (“unknown genes”; ~15.6%) were H3K27me3 targets, as well as many computationally predicted but not expressed genes (“nonexpressed genes”; 249 of 1,116; ~22.3%) and pseudogenes (276 of 3,811; ~7.2%). A list of the H3K27me3 target genes is provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sd001">Dataset S1</xref>. This likely represents a conservative estimate of all of the H3K27m3 target genes, because only one developmental stage was assayed here (10-d-old seedlings), and the establishment of H3K27me3 at specific genes may take place at different stages of development in response to developmental or environmental cues [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b020">20</xref>].</p>
        <p>H3K27me3 target genes were analyzed with respect to their expression level and tissue specificity using a previously published expression dataset [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b035">35</xref>], as well as their functional classifications. Consistent with the function of H3K27me3 in transcriptional silencing, H3K27me3 target genes were expressed at significantly lower levels in young seedlings than those that did not contain H3K27me3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g002">Figure 2</xref>A). Importantly, most H3K27me3 target genes are expressed in a very tissue-specific manner (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g002">Figure 2</xref>B), as measured by Shannon entropy [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b036">36</xref>], suggesting that H3K27me3 may facilitate the repression of these genes in appropriate tissues. This finding is further supported by cluster analysis of genes based on their expression patterns. The majority of H3K27me3 target genes were expressed only in one or a few specific tissues, such as floral organs, siliques/seeds, mature leaves, or roots (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g002">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg003">S3</xref>). With regard to their functions, H3K27me3 targets were highly enriched for genes involved in transcriptional regulation, but also included many other genes with diverse functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g002">Figures 2</xref>C and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg003">S3</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that H3K27me3 is a component of a widespread gene silencing system in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> that is involved in the regulation of numerous genes and many developmental processes.</p>

        <title>H3K27me3 Is Usually Confined to Single Genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
        <p>In animal systems such as <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals, the concerted actions of the PRC1 and PRC2 complexes are responsible for the bidirectional spreading of H3K27me3 to sometimes hundreds of kilobases from the PREs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b003">3</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b008">8</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b012">12</xref>]. Whether a similar spreading process occurs in plants remains unknown, because plants do not encode components of PRC1. Some characteristics of H3K27me3 regions (such as their length) could provide important information to address this question, as a broad distribution of H3K27me3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> comparable to that in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals might indicate similar levels or mechanisms of spreading.</p>
        <p>We found that H3K27me3 regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> were significantly shorter than those in <italic>Drosophila</italic> and mammals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g003">Figure 3</xref>A). Even when we joined adjacent H3K27me3 regions when they were separated by less than 1 kb ("maximal gap” = 1 kb; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s3">Materials and Methods</xref>), nearly half (~49.1%) of H3K27me3 regions were still shorter than 1 kb in length (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g003">Figure 3</xref>A), whereas those in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are usually ~20–50 kb long [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b001">1</xref>]. In addition, inspection of individual H3K27me3 regions revealed that, in most cases, H3K27me3 regions spanned significant portions of the target genes but rarely extended beyond them into adjacent genes (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g001">Figures 1</xref>A and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg001">S1</xref> for examples). Mapping of the position of H3K27me3 regions relative to genes showed that H3K27me3 was enriched in the transcribed region with a notable bias toward the 5' end and that the regions immediately upstream of promoters and downstream of the 3' ends of genes had lower levels of H3K27me3 relative to the genome average (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g003">Figure 3</xref>B). In addition, on a genome-wide scale, the vast majority of H3K27me3 regions (&gt;90%) that overlapped with genes were found to be limited to single genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g001">Figures 1</xref>A, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g003">3</xref>C, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg001">S1</xref>). Considering that a large number (&gt;17%) of <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genes were H3K27me3 targets, it is possible that two H3K27me3 regions covering two closely spaced target genes were sometimes inappropriately joined into a single H3K27me3 region during the analysis (because gaps were allowed). Consistent with this possibility, the distances between neighboring genes covered by the same H3K27me3 regions were shorter than the genome average (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg004">Figure S4</xref>). Furthermore, we reasoned that if two genes were indeed controlled by H3K27me3 in the same region, they may have similar expression patterns. However, although a few exceptions were observed, the overall correlation level between the expression patterns of neighboring genes covered by the same H3K27me3 regions was similar to randomly paired H3K27m3 target genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g003">Figure 3</xref>D). Taken together, these results suggest that in most cases, H3K27me3 is significantly enriched in and limited to single genes, indicating that long-range spreading of H3K27me3 similar to that seen in <italic>Drosophila</italic> may not take place in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. However, one interpretation of the relatively broad distribution of H3K27me3 within individual target genes is that limited spreading from an initiation site might also occur in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Among other possibilities, it is interesting to consider that the H3K27me3 methyltransferase(s) might interact with the transcription apparatus, or that insulator-like sites (DNA sequences or epigenetic marks) might border most H3K27m3 target genes.</p>

        <title>H3K27me3 Regions Are Not Preferentially Associated with Low Nucleosome Density Regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic></title>
        <p>The Polycomb-group protein complexes in <italic>Drosophila</italic> are recruited to PREs primarily through the sequence-specific binding activity of Pho [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b005">5</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b006">6</xref>], a factor which also appears to be lacking in plants. Recent genomic and biochemical studies have shown that the <italic>Drosophila</italic> PRE regions are depleted of nucleosomes, perhaps to facilitate (or as a result of) the binding of Pho and to accommodate the assembly of the multi-protein complexes PRC1, PCR2, and PhoRC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b007">7</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b010">10</xref>]. To determine whether low nucleosome density (LND) regions of significant length are also associated with H3K27me3 in <italic>Arabidopsis,</italic> we amplified input genomic DNA samples that were not subjected to ChIP, hybridized them to the microarrays, and compared the results to those from hybridization using nucleosomal DNA. LND regions were identified as those yielding significantly higher hybridization signals when probed with input genomic DNA than nucleosomal DNA.</p>
        <p>A total of 10,104 LND regions were identified, accounting for 4,854,913 bp or ~4.1% of the genome (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g004">Figure 4</xref>A for examples). Independent experimental validations were performed using a micrococcal nuclease (MNase) sensitivity assay for 17 randomly selected LND regions; all 17 regions were found to be hypersensitive to MNase digestion (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg005">Figure S5</xref>). The most common length of LND regions corresponded to the length predicted to be occupied by approximately two nucleosomes with a median of ~410 bp, and most LND regions (~83.6%) were smaller than the length predicted for four nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg006">Figure S6</xref>).

        <p>However, several lines of evidence suggest that H3K27me3 and LND regions are not preferentially associated. First, only ~6.3% of the H3K27me3 regions were located within 180 bp on either side of a LND region. In contrast, ~12.9% of randomly chosen control regions (with similar length and chromosomal distribution as the H3K27me3 regions) were found to be located within 180 bp of a LND region. Second, LND regions were highly enriched in the promoters and 5′ ends and slightly enriched at the 3′ ends, but were depleted in other regions of expressed genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). Specifically, although only ~4.1% and ~5.1% of the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome consists of LND regions and promoters, respectively, ~42.6% of LND regions were located in promoters, and ~15.4% of promoters contained LND regions. This promoter localization of LND regions is in contrast to H3K27m3 regions, which are enriched in the body of genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g003">Figure 3</xref>B), but is similar to that observed in animals and fungi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b041">41</xref>], indicating that this feature of chromatin organization is conserved in all three eukaryotic kingdoms. Interestingly, the distribution of LND regions is highly similar to the distribution of transcription factor binding sites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g004">Figure 4</xref>C). This suggests that many LND regions identified here may be functionally significant, perhaps to facilitate (or are caused by) the binding of transcription factors. We hereafter refer to promoters with LND regions as “low nucleosome density promoters (LND promoters),” and LND promoter–containing genes are listed in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sd002">Dataset S2</xref>. Importantly, the fraction of LND promoter genes that were H3K27me3 targets (350 of 4,785) was significantly lower than genome average. That is, in the majority of cases, genes do not simultaneously contain LND regions in their promoters and H3K27me3. In fact, LND promoter genes were among the most highly expressed genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>, had very low levels of tissue specificity, and were enriched in catalytic enzymes involved in a variety of physiological processes, whereas nonexpressed genes or pseudogenes usually do not have LND promoters (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g004">Figures 4</xref>D, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g004">4</xref>E, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg007">S7</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg008">S8</xref>). Taken together, these results suggest that LND regions in the <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genome mark the promoters and 5′ ends of highly transcribed genes and that H3K27m3 regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> do not colocalize with LND regions of significant length.</p>

        <title>H3K27me3 Acts Independently of DNA Methylation and RNAi</title>
        <p>DNA methylation and siRNA-mediated silencing pathways represent two major epigenetic silencing mechanisms in plants and in many animal systems. Several recent studies have described potential functional relationships between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation or RNAi [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b042">42</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b044">44</xref>], and we therefore compared the H3K27m3 regions defined here to <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> genomic regions containing DNA methylation or associated with high levels of small RNAs. A deep sequencing study of endogenous siRNAs in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> showed that siRNAs are generally depleted in the transcribed regions of genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b034">34</xref>]. Consistent with this finding, and also with the genic distribution of H3K27me3 reported here, we found that only ~1.7% of H3K27me3 regions overlapped with siRNA clusters, a fraction lower than randomly selected control regions (~4.6%) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g005">Figure 5</xref>A). Moreover, the fraction of microRNA target genes that also contained H3K27me3 was found to be very similar to the genome average (23 of 143, ~16.1%). Thus, it is unlikely that the maintenance of H3K27m3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> requires a persistent targeting mechanism involving siRNAs or microRNAs.</p>

        <p>In contrast to the depletion of siRNAs in genic regions, results from recent genome-wide analyses of DNA methylation revealed that genic regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> contain ample DNA methylation; the transcribed regions of roughly one third of expressed genes are DNA methylated in the CG sequence context (“body-methylated genes”) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b030">30</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b046">46</xref>]. It was of particular interest to determine the relationship between H3K27me3 and DNA methylation, because H3K27me3 has been suggested to directly target DNA methylation in mammalian cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b044">44</xref>], but two previously described <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> H3K27me3 targets <italic>(FLC</italic> and <italic>AGAMOUS)</italic> do not appear to be controlled directly by DNA methylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b047">47</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b048">48</xref>]. We found that on a genome-wide scale, H3K27me3 regions were significant-ly hypomethylated; only 871 of the 8,979 H3K27me3 regions (~9.7%) contained DNA methylation (~9.1% and ~11.1% for genic and intergenic H3H27me3 regions, respectively), compared with ~20.8% for randomly selected control regions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g005">Figure 5</xref>B). The relatively low level of DNA methylation in H3K27m3 regions was not due to a lower CG content, because H3K27me3 regions instead showed higher CG contents than either the genome average or randomly selected control regions (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg009">Figure S9</xref>). In addition, we found that the fraction of body-DNA methylated genes (those with methylation in the transcribed regions but not the promoters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b030">30</xref>]) associated with H3K27me3 was significantly lower than the genome average, whereas genes without DNA methylation were much more likely than average to be H3K27me3 targets (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-0050129-g005">Figure 5</xref>C). A detailed analysis revealed that the inverse correlation of H3K27me3 target genes and body-DNA methylated genes was not simply due to the fact that H3K27me3 target genes were generally expressed at low levels, whereas body-methylated genes were generally expressed at high levels, because we observed this relationship at many different gene expression levels (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg010">Figure S10</xref>). Collectively, these results suggest that the patterning and function of H3K27me3 in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are largely independent of DNA methylation.</p>

The entire dataset is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050129" xlink:type="simple">http://rd.plos.org/pbio.0050129</ext-link> along with annotations of DNA methylation, gene expression, siRNAs, motif analysis, and related information. The results presented here are consistent with and expand previous findings at individual loci, and suggest that H3K27me3 is a major silencing system that likely acts independently of siRNA-mediated silencing pathways or DNA methylation. At the single developmental stage that we analyzed, 10-d-old seedlings, H3K27me3 targets included ~4,400 or ~17% of expressed genes in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic>. Like in animals, H3K27me3 target genes are enriched for transcription factors, indicating that this histone modification likely plays a widespread role in regulating plant development. Unlike in animals, however, H3K27me3 regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> are shorter, enriched in transcribed regions, and appear to be confined to their target genes. In addition, H3K27me3 regions in <italic>Arabidopsis</italic> do not colocalize with nucleosome-depleted regions of significant length. Collectively, these results suggest that although the silencing function of H3K27me3 is conserved, fundamental differences between plants and animals may exist in the mechanisms by which H3K27me3 is established or maintained.</p>

Plants were grown under 16 h of light on 1/2 X Murashige and Skoog media, and 1.0–1.5g of whole seedling tissue was harvested and fixed after 10–14 d. Rabbit polyclonal antibodies α-H3K27me3 (rabbit 6523 bleed 5, generous gift of T. Jenuwein) and α-H3 (Abcam number ab1791; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.abcam.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.abcam.com</ext-link>) antibodies (2 μg in 100 μl) were incubated for 3–5 h at 4 °C with 25 μl of magnetic protein A beads (Invitrogen number 100.01; <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.invitrogen.com" xlink:type="simple">http://www.invitrogen.com</ext-link>). The IP was performed as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b023">23</xref>], and DNA was resuspended in 50–75 μl H<sub>2</sub>O. Input DNA and ChIP samples were amplified, labeled, and hybridized to microarrays as described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio-0050129-b030">30</xref>]. Four biological replicates were performed for each set of experiments. LND regions were defined as those giving higher signal when probed with the input DNA samples than with nucleosome DNA samples. Whereas LND regions are most likely relatively devoid of nucleosomes (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio-0050129-sg005">Figure S5</xref>), it is also possible that some regions of the chromatin were detected as LND regions because they were less accessible to the H3 antibody utilized.

          <p>To exclude the potential bias introduced by gene expression level in this analysis, all expressed genes with known (top) or unknown (bottom) functions were divided into ten bins according to their expression level (bin 1 has the lowest expression level and bin 10, the highest); each bin has an equal number of genes. The percentage of genes that are H3K27me3 targets was then determined for genes that are DNA methylated in their promoters (“promoter-methylated;” red) or transcribed regions (“body-methylated;” orange) and genes that do not contain DNA methylation (“unmethylated;” blue). For all three classes, higher expression levels are correlated with lower likelihoods of being H3K27me3 targets. However, within each bin, unmethylated genes are always more likely to be H3K27me3 targets than promoter-methylated or body-methylated genes.</p>
