<p>CDON is a novel Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) dependence receptor and targeting the SHH-CDON interaction could represent an alternative therapeutic strategy for patients suffering from tumors that express high SHH levels.</p>
</sec></abstract>
<abstract>
<p>The Hedgehog signaling is a determinant pathway for tumor progression. However, while inhibition of the Hedgehog canonical pathway—Patched–Smoothened–Gli—has proved efficient in human tumors with activating mutations in this pathway, recent clinical data have failed to show any benefit in other cancers, even though Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) expression is detected in these cancers. Cell-adhesion molecule-related/down-regulated by Oncogenes (CDON), a positive regulator of skeletal muscle development, was recently identified as a receptor for SHH. We show here that CDON behaves as a SHH dependence receptor: it actively triggers apoptosis in the absence of SHH. The pro-apoptotic activity of unbound CDON requires a proteolytic cleavage in its intracellular domain, allowing the recruitment and activation of caspase-9. We show that by inducing apoptosis in settings of SHH limitation, CDON expression constrains tumor progression, and as such, decreased CDON expression observed in a large fraction of human colorectal cancer is associated in mice with intestinal tumor progression. Reciprocally, we propose that the SHH expression, detected in human cancers and previously considered as a mechanism for activation of the canonical pathway in an autocrine or paracrine manner, actually provides a selective tumor growth advantage by blocking CDON-induced apoptosis. In support of this notion, we present the preclinical demonstration that interference with the SHH–CDON interaction triggers a CDON-dependent apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor growth inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>. The latter observation qualifies CDON as a relevant alternative target for anticancer therapy in SHH-expressing tumors.</p>

<abstract abstract-type="summary"><title>Author Summary</title>
<p>Abnormal activity of the Hedgehog signaling pathway has been linked with tumor progression; deregulation of this pathway can occur in cancers either by mutations in key effectors of the so-called canonical signaling pathway or by aberrant expression of Hedgehog itself. While inhibition of the canonical signaling pathway has proved efficient for treating some cases of human tumors in which the Hedgehog pathway was shown to be overactive, recent clinical data have shown this approach is not often successful. We have identified a new role for the Hedgehog ligand that we propose can explain why inhibiting the canonical signaling pathway generically doesn't always produce the desired therapeutic effect. We show that Hedgehog expression provides a selective growth advantage for tumours. It does so by binding to a novel dependence receptor called Cell adhesion molecule-related, down-regulated by oncogenes (CDON). This type of receptor depends on the presence of its ligand, in the absence of which it induces apoptosis. We show that interfering with the Hedgehog–CDON interaction triggers CDON-dependent apoptosis <italic>in vitro</italic>, and tumor growth inhibition <italic>in vivo</italic>. Development of a candidate drug interfering with Hedgehog–CDON interaction could be of potential benefit to the large number of patients suffering from cancers with high SHH levels, but not currently responding to therapies aimed at antagonizing the Hedgehog signaling pathway.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Sonic Hedgehog (SHH) is a key secreted morphogen with multiple known functions, both during embryonic development and throughout adulthood. Canonical SHH signaling is mediated mainly via its interaction with the receptor Patched 1 (Ptc). Binding of SHH to Ptc relieves its suppressive effect on Smoothened (Smo), an orphan seven-transmembrane receptor that initiates a signaling pathway leading to the activation of the glioma-associated (Gli) family of transcription factors. SHH and its downstream signaling are known to regulate many developmental processes including ventrodorsal patterning of the neural tube, establishment of limb polarity, and development of the foregut and axio-cranial skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Jessell1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Ingham1">[2]</xref>. In adults, SHH signaling is mainly quiescent, being physiologically reactivated only during specific processes such as tissue maintenance and repair. However, SHH signaling appears to be crucial during tumor progression <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Dahmane1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Thayer1">[6]</xref>. Abnormal induction of SHH signaling through different means—e.g., down-regulation or mutation of SHH receptor(s) or effectors, autocrine, or paracrine expression of SHH—has been associated with many different types of human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Xie1">[7]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Yauch1">[10]</xref>. As a consequence, SHH and its downstream signaling effectors are considered as potentially important targets for anticancer strategies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Scales1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Tremblay1">[12]</xref>.</p>
<p>CDON (or CDO) and Brother of CDON (BOC), two homologous members of the Neural Cell Adhesion Molecule (N-CAM) family (see graphic representations in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1A</xref>), were recently described as receptors for SHH, and hypothetical co-receptors of Ptc, that positively regulate the SHH signaling pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Tenzen1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Allen1">[17]</xref>. CDON resembles in many aspects DCC (Deleted in Colorectal Cancer), the prototypical netrin-1 dependence receptor. Dependence receptors share the property of creating a cellular state of dependence upon their ligands by inducing apoptosis when unbound by their respective ligands <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mehlen1">[18]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Goldschneider1">[20]</xref>. Such a dependence effect is thought to be crucial to eliminate tumor cells that would otherwise develop in settings of ligand unavailability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mehlen2">[21]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Castets1">[23]</xref>. These dependence receptors now include more than 17 different transmembrane receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mehlen4">[24]</xref>, and Ptc was recently described as a dependence receptor that triggers apoptosis via the recruitment of a caspase-activating complex called the dependosome <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Thibert1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mille1">[26]</xref>. We investigated here whether CDON may, similarly to Ptc, behave as a SHH dependence receptor, and as such display a role in regulating cell survival.</p>

<title>CDON Induces Apoptosis in the Absence of SHH</title>
<p>To determine whether CDON and/or BOC (see graphic representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1A</xref>) are dependence receptors, HEK293T and NIH-3T3 cells were transiently transfected with expression constructs for both receptors. Expression of CDON and BOC could be detected at the plasma membrane (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1B</xref> and not shown). While, as observed for Ptc, CDON expression was associated with increased cell death as measured by a trypan blue exclusion assay (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1C</xref> and not shown), no significant effect was observed with BOC expression (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1B</xref>). CDON-induced cell death was, at least in part, apoptotic, since it was associated with a specific increase in caspase-3 activity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) and DNA-fragmentation as measured by TUNEL (Terminal deoxynucleotidyl transferase–mediated deoxyUridine triphosphate Nick End Labeling) staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1E</xref>). Moreover, such a pro-apoptotic effect was caspase-dependent since the addition of the general caspase inhibitor z-VAD-fmk inhibited CDON-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1CD</xref>).</p>
<p>We therefore investigated whether, as expected for a dependence receptor, addition of the ligand could prevent CDON-induced cell death. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1CD</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1C</xref>, cell death associated with CDON expression was inhibited in a dose-dependent manner by addition of exogenous recombinant SHH. Treatment with recombinant netrin-1, the ligand of the dependence receptor DCC, had no significant incidence on CDON-associated-cell death (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), while the addition of SHH had no effect on DCC-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1D</xref>). Not only SHH but also desert hedgehog inhibited CDON-induced cell death (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1E</xref>). Moreover, deletion of the third fibronectin domain of CDON, which mediates its interaction with SHH, turned CDON into a constitutive pro-apoptotic mutant, unresponsive to SHH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g001">Figure 1F</xref>). Altogether, these data demonstrate that CDON behaves as a SHH dependence receptor <italic>in vitro</italic>. Preliminary data support the view that SHH and CDON pro-apoptotic activity are also important <italic>in vivo</italic> during the development of the first branchial arch <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-DelloyeBourgeois1">[27]</xref>.</p>

<title>CDON Triggers Apoptosis Via a Caspase-9–Dependent Mechanism</title>
<p>One common feature of most dependence receptors identified to date is the cleavage of their intracellular domain by caspases, a preliminary step required for their pro-apoptotic activity. We thus investigated whether CDON shares this property <italic>in vitro</italic>. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, the CDON intracellular domain (CDON-IC, amino acids 985 to 1250) was cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> when incubated with purified active caspase-3, suggesting the existence of at least one cleavage site in CDON-IC. To determine the putative caspase cleavage site, aspartic acid residues in CDON intracellular domain were successively mutated. While the Asp<sup>1178</sup> to Asn mutation (CDON-IC D1178N) had no effect on CDON-IC cleavage, mutation of Asp<sup>1153</sup> to Asn (CDON-IC D1153N) strongly inhibited cleavage by caspase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2A</xref>, left panel). However, the Asp<sup>1153</sup> to Asn mutation revealed the presence of a secondary caspase cleavage site in CDON-IC, since the incubation of the CDON-IC–D1153N with active caspase-3 was associated with the presence of another faint band that indicated an additional cleavage fragment. We therefore mutated different Asp residues in CDON-IC–D1153N and assessed cleavage by caspase-3. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2A</xref> (right panel), the Asp<sup>1153</sup>/Asp<sup>1164</sup> to Asn double mutation almost completely suppressed caspase-3 cleavage, indicating that CDON was cleaved <italic>in vitro</italic> by caspase at Asp<sup>1153</sup> and Asp<sup>1164</sup>, with Asp<sup>1153</sup> being the main cleavage site (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2A</xref>). Even though, similarly to many other dependence receptors, we failed to detect caspase cleavage of CDON in cell culture, full-length CDON and its putative cleavage fragment were detected from E12.5 mouse embryos extracts and the incubation of these extracts with z-VAD-fmk decreased the presence of the cleavage fragment, hence supporting the view that CDON is cleaved by caspase <italic>in vivo</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1F</xref>).</p>

<title>CDON triggers apoptosis through CDON proteolytic cleavage and recruitment and activation of caspase-9.</title>
<p>(A) <italic>In vitro</italic>–translated CDON intracellular domain (CDON-IC) wild-type (wt) or mutated on one (left panel) or two (right panel) aspartic acid residues were incubated in the absence or in the presence of recombinant purified active caspase-3. Autoradiographs show the cleavage by caspase-3 of CDON-IC wt, whereas CDON-IC–D1153N was weakly cleaved and CDON-IC–D1153N–D1164N was almost completely resistant to cleavage. The band appearing in the CDON D1164N–D1153N probably represents a cryptic site. (B) Schematic representation of CDON and its different mutant constructs. CDON-main (D1153) and secondary (D1178) caspase cleavage sites are shown. (C–D) Apoptotic cell death induction as measured by caspase-3 activity (C) was quantified in HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type (CDON) full-length or mutated full-length CDON expression plasmids and by TUNEL (D) staining was quantified in HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type (CDON) full-length or mutated full-length CDON expression plasmids. Quantifications of TUNEL positive cells (orange) and nuclei (Hoechst in blue) are shown. (E) Apoptotic cell death induction as measured by caspase-3 activity was quantified in HEK293T cells transfected with constructs encoding full-length CDON or the CDON hypothetical fragments resulting from its cleavage by caspase at D1153 (CDON1–1153 and CDON 1154–1250). (F) HEK293T cells were transfected with constructs encoding CDON and/or caspase-9 and cell lysates were subjected to immunoprecipitation with a CDON-specific antibody. CDON and caspase-9 proteins were detected by Western blot in immunoprecipitated and input fractions. (G) Caspase-9 activity was quantified in HEK293T cells transfected with wild-type (CDON) full-length or mutated full-length CDON (D1153N) expression plasmids. For (C–F) and (G), data are means of at least three independent assays. Error bars indicate s.d.</p>

<p>To evaluate the functional relevance of CDON-IC cleavage, the full-length CDON D1153N and CDON D1178N (noncaspase cleavage site mutation used as a control) mutants were transiently expressed in HEK293T and NIH3T3 cells, and cell death was assessed by measuring caspase-3 activity and DNA fragmentation (TUNEL staining). Whereas wild-type CDON and CDON D1178N both triggered apoptotic cell death, CDON D1153N mutant and the CDON D1153N/D1164N double mutant failed to induce any increase in caspase-3 activity or DNA fragmentation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2B–D</xref> and unpublished data). Thus, the cleavage of CDON's intracellular domain at Asp<sup>1153</sup> is a prerequisite for its pro-apoptotic activity.</p>
<p>In an attempt to identify the region of CDON implicated in cell death induction, the pro-apoptotic activity of the CDON fragment potentially released by the caspase cleavage (CDON1154–1250) or the remaining membrane-bound CDON truncated at Asp<sup>1153</sup> (CDON1–1153) was assessed upon expression in HEK293T (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2E</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s002">Figure S2A</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2E</xref>, the expression of the CDON1–1153 fragment triggered an increase in caspase-3 activation similar to that of full-length CDON, whereas the CDON1154–1250 fragment had no effect. Moreover, while SHH addition in the medium suppressed CDON-induced apoptosis, it had no effect on CDON1–1153–induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s002">Figure S2B</xref>). Together these results support the view that, in the absence of SHH, CDON is cleaved by caspase at Asp<sup>1153</sup>, leading to the exposure of a pro-apoptotic domain located in the N-terminal intracellular region (residues 985 to 1153).</p>
<p>Recent data have suggested that, once cleaved by an active caspase, at least some dependence receptors recruit a caspase-activating complex named the dependosome, which includes the apical caspase-9 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mille1">[26]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Forcet1">[28]</xref>. We thus investigated whether CDON could recruit and activate caspase-9. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2F</xref>, in the absence of SHH, CDON efficiently pulled down caspase-9 when co-expressed in HEK293T cells. Similar interaction of CDON with caspase-9 can be detected with endogenous proteins (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). CDON-induced apoptosis is dependent on caspase-9 but not on caspase-8, since a caspase-9 dominant negative mutant efficiently blocked CDON-induced apoptosis, while a caspase-8 dominant negative mutant did not (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s002">Figure S2D</xref>). Moreover, we show that CDON triggered caspase-9 activation, which was blocked upon SHH treatment, whereas CDON mutated at its caspase cleavage site did not have such an effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g002">Figure 2G</xref>). Together, these data support a model in which, in the absence of SHH, CDON is initially cleaved by a first set of active caspases (or other proteases), leading to the exposure of a pro-apoptotic domain that recruits and activates caspase-9, probably through a caspase-activating complex that remains to be identified.</p>
<p>Because CDON has been shown to participate in the Ptc–Smo–Gli canonical pathway when engaged by SHH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Tenzen1">[13]</xref>, and because Ptc has been shown to trigger apoptosis through caspase-9 in the absence of SHH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mille1">[26]</xref>, we investigated possible cross-talks between CDON-induced apoptosis and Ptc-mediated signalings. We first analyzed whether enforced expression of CDON alters the gene transcription response triggered by the Smo–Gli pathway. Neither CDON expression nor the expression of various CDON mutants presented above triggered transactivation of a Gli-1 reporter gene, or affected Gli-1 reporter gene activation mediated by Gli-1 activation (induced through transfection of Gli-1 itself or through treatment with the Smo agonist SAG) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s003">Figure S3A</xref>). Reciprocally, apoptosis induced by enforced CDON expression was affected neither by activation of the Smo–Gli-1 pathway (induced through transfection of Gli-1 or through treatment with SAG, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s003">Figure S3B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s001">Figure S1C</xref>) nor by inhibition of this pathway through treatment with the Smo antagonist cyclopamine (not shown). We next investigated whether Ptc pro-apoptotic activity is implicated in CDON-mediated apoptosis. As also observed for other dependence receptors—e.g., DCC, UNC5H, or TrkC—the intracellular domain of Ptc mutated at its caspase cleavage site (Ptc-7IC–D1392N, here called Ptc-DN) functions as a dominant negative for the pro-apoptotic activity of endogenous Ptc <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Thibert1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-TauszigDelamasure1">[29]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Furne1">[30]</xref>. Ptc-DN, while efficiently blocking Ptc-induced apoptosis, did not affect CDON-induced apoptosis in HEK293T cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s003">Figure S3C</xref>). Similar effect was seen <italic>in vivo</italic> during branchial arch formation as Ptc-DN failed to block CDON-mediated neural crest cell apoptosis observed upon SHH titration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-DelloyeBourgeois1">[27]</xref>. Reversely, Ptc-induced apoptosis was not inhibited by CDON-IC–D1153N/D1164N, while this construct efficiently blocked CDON-induced apoptosis (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s003">Figure S3D</xref>). Similar results were obtained through silencing by siRNA approach as CDON-induced apoptosis was not affected by Ptc silencing and reversely Ptc-induced apoptosis was not inhibited by CDON silencing (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s003">Figure S3E</xref>). Thus, the death signal induced by unbound CDON is independent of Ptc pro-apoptotic activity and does not involve the canonical Ptc–Smo–Gli pathway, but is dependent on caspase-9 recruitment and activation.</p>

<title>CDON Expression Is a Constraint for Tumor Progression</title>
<p>It has been suggested that the pro-apoptotic activity of unbound dependence receptors is a mechanism for eliminating tumor cells that would otherwise proliferate in an environment with limited ligand availability or migrate to tissues devoid of ligand during metastatic dissemination <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mehlen2">[21]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mehlen3">[22]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Mehlen4">[24]</xref>. As such, dependence receptors behave as tumor suppressors. Along this line, genetically engineered mouse bearing a caspase mutant site in DCC developed spontaneously colorectal cancer <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Castets1">[23]</xref>. In agreement with this view, dependence receptor expression is often reduced or completely lost in various human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Bernet1">[31]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Grady1">[32]</xref>.</p>
<p>To assess whether CDON expression is generally affected in human cancers, we then analyzed CDON expression in a panel of human tumors and their corresponding normal tissues by Q-RT-PCR. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g003">Figure 3AB</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s004">Figure S4A</xref>, CDON expression was decreased in a large fraction of colorectal and lung cancers and in a sizeable fraction of kidney and breast cancers. Similar reduction of CDON expression was observed by dot blot array analysis in breast, ovarian, uterine, and thyroid cancers (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s004">Figure S4B</xref>). In addition, laser capture microdissection on colorectal tumors versus normal adjacent tissues followed by Q-RT-PCR was performed on six colon cancer samples and showed in most cases a massive decrease of CDON expression in tumor cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). Consistent with a specific decreased expression in tumor cells, CDON immunohistochemistry in a panel of 45 human colon adenocarcinomas showed a marked decrease of CDON expression in epithelial tumor cells as compared to adjacent normal tissue (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g003">Figure 3DE</xref>). Interestingly, in this panel of colorectal adenocarcinomas, CDON expression is inversely correlated with tumor grade according to the TNM classification (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g003">Figure 3E</xref>, χ<sup>2</sup> test: <italic>p</italic> = 4.3<sup>E-5</sup>).

<p>We thus analyzed whether the decreased expression of CDON seen in a fraction of human colorectal cancers has a causal implication in tumor progression. To do so, we investigated the possibility that CDON inactivation in mice may affect tumour progression by analyzing the effect of the CDON mutation on adenocarcinoma (ADK) formation in an APC<sup>+/1638N</sup> genetic background (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g004">Figure 4A</xref>). APC is a well-known tumour suppressor gene in human colorectal cancer, and APC mutations in mice are associated with neoplasm formation. We chose the APC<sup>+/1638N</sup> mutant mice, which were shown to develop tumours in the intestinal tract at a moderate level <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Fodde1">[33]</xref>. Consistent with previous reports, the number of adenocarcinomatous lesions per CDON<sup>+/+</sup>APC<sup>+/1638N</sup> control mice was 0.72 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g004">Figure 4B–F</xref>).

<p>We next investigated whether CDON loss, as expected according to the pro-apoptotic activity of CDON, may enhance tumour cell survival at the transition from adenoma to adenocarcinoma. We therefore assessed whether apoptosis is quantitatively different in low-grade tumors of CDON<sup>−/−</sup>APC<sup>+/1638N</sup> versus CDON<sup>+/+</sup>APC<sup>+/1638N</sup> control mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g004">Figures 4G and S4C</xref>, we observed a marked decrease in apoptosis rate in high-grade adenomas from CDON<sup>−/−</sup>APC<sup>+/1638N</sup> mice compared to that in size-matched CDON<sup>+/+</sup>APC<sup>+/1638N</sup> controls. Thus together with the loss of expression of CDON in a fraction of human cancers and with the fact that high-throughput sequencing consortia have reported the presence of a large number of sprayed missense mutations in the coding sequence of CDON in human cancers (see <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/gene/overview?ln=CDONN" xlink:type="simple">http://cancer.sanger.ac.uk/cosmic/gene/overview?ln=CDONN</ext-link>), these data argue that CDON is <italic>a bona fide</italic> tumor suppressor probably thanks to its dependence receptor function.</p>

<title>Targeting SHH Inhibits Tumor Growth Via CDON-Induced Apoptosis</title>
<p>The therapeutic relevance of CDON as a negative regulator of tumor growth is obviously minimal in the fraction of cancers with down-regulation of CDON. However, according to the mode of action of dependence receptors, it could be speculated that, rather than a loss of CDON expression, some tumors may have selected for up-regulation of SHH, which should similarly be associated with a constitutive inactivation of CDON-induced cell death. In agreement with this hypothesis, autocrine or paracrine expression of SHH has been extensively described in different human cancers <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Watkins1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Thayer1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Yauch1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Scales1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Clement1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Tian1">[37]</xref>. The general view is that this autocrine or paracrine SHH expression is a mechanism that constitutively activates Ptc-Smo signaling either in tumor cells or more generally in stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Yauch1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Scales1">[11]</xref>. According to the newly identified pro-apoptotic function of CDON in settings of SHH limitation, we thus investigated whether in SHH-expressing tumors, SHH does not (solely) activate the canonical signaling in stromal cells but also (or rather) blocks CDON-mediated tumor cell death.</p>
<p>We first analyzed whether, as described by others (for reviews see <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Barakat1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Varnat1">[39]</xref>), SHH is up-regulated in a sizeable fraction of human cancers. We analyzed the level of SHH mRNA by Q-RT-PCR in colon, lung, and kidney tumors as compared to normal adjacent tissues. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figure 5AB</xref>, SHH was up-regulated in a large fraction of colon and kidney cancers and in a sizeable fraction of lung cancers. According to the dependence receptor paradigm, most of SHH-expressing tumors showed expression of CDON (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s004">Figure S4D</xref>). We then screened, by Q-RT-PCR, a panel of 59 human tumor cell lines for expression of both SHH and CDON. Of the cell lines tested, 31% showed significant expression of both CDON and SHH (not shown). The A549 and H522 cell lines were selected for their significant expression of CDON mRNA and protein (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s004">Figure S4E</xref>F). These cell lines both express a secreted form of SHH that could be quantified by ELISA (respectively, 10.0±2.4 pg and 4.0±1.6 pg per mL of culture medium), thus arguing for a secreted/autocrine expression of SHH (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figure 5CD</xref>). To investigate the role of this SHH production in regulating CDON-induced apoptosis, SHH expression was reduced by an RNA interference-based strategy. Transfection of both A549 and H522 cell lines with SHH and/or CDON respective siRNAs was associated with a specific and significant decrease in each targeted mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s004">Figure S4F</xref>) and protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figure 5DE</xref>). SHH siRNA transfection induced an increase in apoptosis monitored by an increase in caspase-3 activity and by an increase in TUNEL staining (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s004">S4G</xref>). However, co-transfection of a CDON siRNA abrogated SHH siRNA-induced cell death in both cell lines (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figures 5F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s004">S4F</xref>). Similar effects were observed with another SHH siRNA and another CDON siRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s005">Figure S5A</xref>B). A dominant negative mutant of Ptc (Ptc-DN) failed to inhibit SHH siRNA-mediated caspase-3 activity in A549 cells (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s005">Figure S5C</xref>). In addition, SHH siRNA transfection in A549 cells was associated with caspase-9 activation, which was inhibited when CDON siRNA was co-transfected (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figure 5G</xref>). Thus together these data support the view that in SHH/CDON-expressing tumor cells, SHH constitutively inhibits CDON-induced apoptosis.</p>

<p>To assess whether this CDON-mediated cell death upon SHH interference observed <italic>in vitro</italic> could be translated <italic>in vivo</italic>, the A549 cell line was engrafted in <italic>nude</italic> mice. Animals with established tumors were treated twice a week by i.p. injection of either scrambled siRNA or SHH siRNA, alone or in combination with CDON siRNA for 28 d. Such siRNA i.p. injection allowed the detection of the siRNA within the tumor (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s005">Figure S5D</xref>) and was shown to affect the target gene (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s005">Figure S5E</xref> and <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Compagno1">[40]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-BouzasRodriguez1">[43]</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figures 5HI</xref>, treatment with SHH siRNA was associated with tumor growth inhibition as compared to scrambled siRNA-treated mice. As noted <italic>in vitro</italic>, injection of CDON siRNA impaired the SHH siRNA antitumor effect, hence demonstrating that, in this model, the antitumor effect associated with SHH inhibition required CDON. While apoptosis as measured by caspase-3 activity or TUNEL was significantly increased in tumors from SHH siRNA-treated mice, no significant change was observed in terms of cell proliferation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figures 5J and S5G</xref>). As expected, the increase of apoptosis was not observed in tumors from CDON/SHH siRNA-treated mice (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g005">Figures 5J and S5G</xref>). Moreover, histological analysis of tumors at the end of the treatment revealed a large central area devoid of proliferating tumor cells specifically in SHH siRNA-treated mice but not in SHH/CDON siRNA-treated animals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s005">Figure S5H</xref>). Taken together, these data support the view that SHH expression in SHH-high cancer cells is a survival selective advantage that prevents CDON-induced apoptosis.</p>
<p>The prevalent hedgehog-related therapeutic strategy assessed so far is the inhibition of the Smo/Gli-1 canonical pathway, which is believed to be activated in some cancers because of Ptc/Smo mutation(s). Smo antagonists such as cyclopamine have shown interesting tumor cell death effects <italic>in vitro</italic> and tumor growth inhibition activity in animal models <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Scales1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Tremblay1">[12]</xref>. Of interest, CDON expression was shown to be down-regulated by the Smo/Gli-1 canonical pathway <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Tenzen1">[13]</xref>. We thus investigated whether tumor cell death observed upon Smo antagonists may be somehow related to a CDON up-regulation and to a subsequent increased CDON-mediated cell death. In agreement with Tenzen and collaborators' work, while A549 cells treated with cyclopamine showed an increased level of CDON mRNA, SAG treatment was associated with a decrease in CDON mRNA level (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figures 6A and S6AB</xref>). In this setting, cyclopamine treatment was associated with A549 cell death, which was concomitant with CDON expression increase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figures 6B and S6B</xref>). However, this death effect was fully blocked when cells were transfected with CDON siRNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Similar results were observed in H522 and MiaPaca-2 cells (not shown). Thus, tumor cell death induced by cyclopamine is, at least in part, due to the up-regulation of CDON expression. We then assessed whether part of the tumor growth inhibition effect of smo-inhibitors such as cyclopamine or GDC-0449 could be explained by an increase in CDON-induced apoptosis <italic>in vivo</italic>. A549 cells were engrafted in <italic>nude</italic> mice and animals were treated by intratumoral injection of cyclopamine (or HBC vehicle) together with scramble siRNA or CDON siRNA for 2 wk. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figure 6C</xref>, while cyclopamine showed a significant tumor growth inhibitory effect, this antitumor effect was in part inhibited when CDON expression was silenced. Similar results were obtained when the Hedgehog inhibitor from Genentech was used instead of cyclopamine (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Together, these data suggest that the Smo antagonists display antitumor efficacy in part because they enhance CDON expression level and consequently CDON-induced apoptosis.</p>

<title>Early Preclinical Development of an Inhibitor of SHH/CDON Interaction</title>
<p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> data presented above suggest that interfering with SHH/CDON interaction may be an efficient anticancer strategy in SHH-expressing tumors. We thus developed a drug candidate that is able to inhibit the CDON–SHH interaction. To do so, the third fibronectin domain of CDON, which is known to interact with SHH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-McLellan1">[44]</xref>, was fused to a human IgG1 Fc fragment to create a stabilized recombinant protein (see schematic representation in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figure 6D</xref>) with adequate pharmacokinetic properties (upon single dose i.v. 20 mg/kg in mouse plasma, terminal half-life: 38 h, %Extrapolated AUC: 24.9, not shown). This Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub> recombinant protein titrates out SHH (not shown). Of interest, Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub> efficiently triggered apoptosis of A549 cells, a process blocked when an excess of recombinant SHH was added (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figure 6E</xref>). Similar pro-apoptotic effects of Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub> were obtained with the colorectal HT-29, the pancreatic PANC-1, and the breast MDA-MB436 cancer cell lines, which all express CDON and SHH mRNA (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s006">Figure S6D</xref>E and not shown).</p>
<p>The <italic>in vivo</italic> activity of Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub> was then assessed against A549, MiaPaca-2, and HT-29 cells engrafted in <italic>nude</italic> mice. As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figure 6F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001623.s006">Figure S6C</xref>F, twice a week injection of Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub> (10 mg/kg and 20 mg/kg, respectively) was associated with marked tumor growth inhibition. Moreover, in these settings, co-injection of Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub> together with a siRNA targeting CDON expression completely abrogated Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub> antitumor effect (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001623-g006">Figure 6G</xref>). Thus, targeting CDON/SHH interaction triggers tumor cell death and tumor growth inhibition by engaging CDON pro-apoptotic activity.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>The data presented here suggest that CDON displays all of the characteristics of a dependence receptor: CDON triggers apoptosis in the absence of its ligand SHH, CDON is cleaved at aspartic acid residue(s) by caspase-like protease(s), and CDON triggers caspase-9–dependent apoptosis through a domain exposed by this proteolytic cleavage. These <italic>in vitro</italic> features have been shown to be common to the vast majority of dependence receptors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Goldschneider1">[20]</xref>. In addition, we have shown that these traits confer to the pair SHH/CDON a key regulatory role in cancer progression as recently shown for the dependence receptor DCC <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Castets1">[23]</xref>. If the pro-apoptotic activity of CDON <italic>per se</italic> appears to be fully independent of the classic Hedgehog canonical pathway, CDON expression is dependent on this canonical pathway.</p>
<p>Although the specific mechanism by which CDON triggers apoptosis remains to be dissected, this effect may have important potential as a novel therapeutic anticancer strategy. SHH signaling is indeed a major focus for drug development, since SHH and its downstream signaling have been believed to be frequently deregulated in cancer. We show here that loss of CDON expression in cancers may be a selective advantage for survival in the presence of a limited concentration of SHH in the environment. Conversely, our present data and previous reports support the view that a fraction of tumors from various cancer types shows expression of SHH <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Dahmane1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Thayer1">[6]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Clement1">[34]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Tian1">[37]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Yuan1">[45]</xref>. Even though this observation has been mostly investigated assuming the view of the aberrant activation of SHH–Ptc–Smo–Gli signaling either in tumor cells or more recently in stromal cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Yauch1">[10]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Scales1">[11]</xref>, considering our results here, it is tempting to revisit this expression of SHH as a mechanism to block CDON-induced apoptosis. Along this line, it is then interesting to consider our results in the light of the recent results of the phase II clinical trials on the Smo antagonist GDC-0449 in colorectal and ovarian cancer: while GDC-0449 clearly demonstrated a benefit in basal cell carcinoma and medullobastoma in which activating mutations of the Ptc–Smo–Gli pathway were shown <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Yauch2">[46]</xref>, this drug had no effect on colorectal and ovarian cancer even though a large fraction of the patients included had tumors with SHH expression. According to our data, SHH expression in cancer may not (only) constitutively activate the Ptc–Smo–Gli canonical pathway but rather support survival by blocking CDON apoptotic activity. Moreover, even though in the cell models tested here we have failed to detect the implication of Ptc in the death observed upon silencing of SHH, we may speculate that, as Ptc was also described as a dependence receptor <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001623-Thibert1">[25]</xref>, SHH expression may also support survival by blocking Ptc-induced apoptosis in some SHH-high cancers.</p>
<p>The <italic>in vitro</italic> tumor cell death effect and the <italic>in vivo</italic> antitumor effect of SHH interference on SHH-expressing tumor cells support the view that the SHH–CDON interaction is a potential target for drug development. We propose here that a drug interfering with the interaction between SHH and its dependence receptor CDON, such as the presented Fc-CDON<sub>3FbnIII</sub>, could be of potential benefit to the large number of patients suffering from cancers with high SHH levels. Even though further preclinical and clinical testing remains to be performed, the proposed strategy is fundamentally different from the current strategies that aim at antagonizing Smo-mediated signaling.</p>

<p><bold><italic>In vitro</italic> and <italic>in vivo</italic> evaluation of CDON-induced apoptosis in SHH-expressing tumor cell lines.</bold> (A) Quantification of SHH and CDON expression by Q-RT-PCR was performed to check the efficiency and specificity of two other CDON and SHH siRNAs (respectively, siCDON.2 and siSHH.2) 24 h after transfection of A549 cells. (B) Apoptotic cell death induction as measured by caspase-3 activity was quantified in A549 cells transfected with two different SHH siRNAs (siSHH and siSHH.2) together with scramble siRNA or two different CDON siRNAs (siCDON and siCDON.2). Each SHH siRNA specificity was assessed by adding recombinant SHH (+rSHH) in the culture medium. (C) Apoptotic cell death was quantified by caspase-3 assay in A549 cells transfected with SHH siRNA alone or together with Ptc-DN construct. For (B–C), data are means of a minimum of three independent assays. Error bars indicate s.d. Statistical treatment of the data was performed using a two-sided Mann–Whitney test compared to control transfected condition (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). (D) A biotinylated SHH siRNA (siSHH-[btn]) was injected i.p. in <italic>nude</italic> mice bearing A549 xenografts. Thirty minutes after injection, tumors were harvested and siSHH-[btn] was detected within the tumor with Cy3-Streptavidine (in orange). Nuclei were stained with Hoechst (in blue). PBS intra-peritoneal injection was used as a control. (E) Quantification of CDON and SHH mRNA by Q-RT-PCR in A549 xenografts 16 h after i.p. injection of scramble (siScr.), CDON (siCDON), or SHH (siSHH) siRNAs. mRNA expression was analyzed in two different xenografts for each siRNA (.1 and .2). HPRT was used as a housekeeping gene. (F) Mean tumor mass of scr siRNA, SHH siRNA, or SHH siRNA+CDON siRNA-treated tumors on day 46, at the end of treatment. (G) Quantification of apoptosis and proliferation in tumor sections. The apoptotic ratio was calculated as the percentage of TUNEL positive cells counted in 20 random fields using TUNEL staining on paraffin-embedded tumor sections (*<italic>p</italic>&lt;0.05). The proliferation index was determined by counting the Ki67 positives cells. (H) Xenograft histology was analyzed by Hematoxylin–PhloxinB–Safran (HPS) staining on tumors harvested at the end of the treatment. Note that SHH siRNA-treated xenografts are characterized by a vast central area devoid of tumor cells (white arrows). Scale bar, 1 mm.</p>
