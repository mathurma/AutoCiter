<abstract>
<p>Interhomolog crossovers promote proper chromosome segregation during meiosis and are formed by the regulated repair of programmed double-strand breaks. This regulation requires components of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a proteinaceous structure formed between homologous chromosomes. In yeast, SC formation requires the “<italic>ZMM</italic>” genes, which encode a functionally diverse set of proteins, including the transverse filament protein, Zip1. In wild-type meiosis, Zmm proteins promote the biased resolution of recombination intermediates into crossovers that are distributed throughout the genome by interference. In contrast, noncrossovers are formed primarily through synthesis-dependent strand annealing mediated by the Sgs1 helicase. This work identifies a conserved region on the C terminus of Zip1 (called Zip1 4S), whose phosphorylation is required for the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway of crossover formation. Zip1 4S phosphorylation is promoted both by double-strand breaks (DSBs) and the meiosis-specific kinase, <italic>MEK1/MRE4</italic>, demonstrating a role for <italic>MEK1</italic> in the regulation of interhomolog crossover formation, as well as interhomolog bias. Failure to phosphorylate Zip1 4S results in meiotic prophase arrest, specifically in the absence of <italic>SGS1</italic>. This gain of function meiotic arrest phenotype is suppressed by <italic>spo11Δ</italic>, suggesting that it is due to unrepaired breaks triggering the meiotic recombination checkpoint. Epistasis experiments combining deletions of individual <italic>ZMM</italic> genes with <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> indicate that Zip1 4S phosphorylation functions prior to the other <italic>ZMM</italic>s. These results suggest that phosphorylation of Zip1 at DSBs commits those breaks to repair via the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway and provides a mechanism by which the crossover/noncrossover decision can be dynamically regulated during yeast meiosis.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>During meiosis, double-strand breaks (DSBs) are generated in a programmed fashion to promote recombination between homologs. These programmed DSBs can be repaired either as crossovers or noncrossovers. In normal budding yeast meiosis, most crossovers are formed by a functionally diverse group of “Zmm” proteins that promote pairing of the homologous chromosomes (a process known as “synapsis”), as well as the distribution of crossovers throughout the genome. One member of this group is Zip1, the transverse filament protein of the synaptonemal complex (a meiosis-specific structure formed between the homologous chromosomes). This work shows that phosphorylation of the C terminus of Zip1 is required for synapsis and the formation of interfering crossovers. In the absence of this phosphorylation, noncrossover formation is increased, indicating that Zip1 phosphorylation could provide a mechanism for regulating crossover homeostasis. Genetic experiments indicate that this Zip1 phosphorylation event functions prior to other <italic>ZMM</italic> genes and suggests two functions for Zip1, (1) recruitment to DSBs where phosphorylation promotes formation of synaptic initiation complexes containing other Zmm proteins, and (2) polymerization of Zip1 to form the synaptonemal complex. Phosphorylation is dependent upon the meiosis-specific kinase Mek1, known previously for its role in interhomolog bias. The fact that Mek1 also regulates interfering interhomolog crossover formation raises the possibility that it is the link by which interhomolog bias and crossovers are coordinated during meiosis.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>During meiosis, crossovers (COs), in combination with sister chromatid cohesion, physically connect homologous chromosomes, thereby promoting proper segregation at Meiosis I (MI). COs arise by the regulated repair of programmed double-strand breaks (DSBs), formed by the topoisomerase-like protein, Spo11 (SGD S000001014) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref001">1</xref>]. This regulation involves components of the synaptonemal complex (SC), a meiosis-specific tripartite structure formed between homologous chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref002">2</xref>].</p>
<p>SC formation begins by condensation of sister chromatids upon protein cores to form axial elements (AEs). AEs contain loops of chromatin tethered at their bases by meiosis-specific axis proteins, which in yeast include Hop1 (SGD S000001334), Red1 (SGD S000004253), and the cohesin kleisin subunit, Rec8 (SGD S000006211) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref005">5</xref>]. Hotspot sequences are brought to the axes where DSBs result in the recruitment and activation of the meiosis-specific kinase, Mek1 (SGD S000005878), via Mec1/Tel1 (SGD S000000340/ S000000184) phosphorylation of Hop1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref007">7</xref>]. Mek1 promotes interhomolog (IH) recombination by antagonizing cohesion around DSBs and inhibiting the strand exchange activity of the mitotic recombinase, Rad51 (SGD S000000897), thereby facilitating strand invasion of homologous chromosomes by the meiosis-specific Dmc1 (SGD S000000981) recombinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref008">8</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref011">11</xref>]. For many organisms such as yeast and mammals, strand invasion is critical for bringing homologs together. Synapsis is achieved when homologous AEs are held together by the insertion of transverse filament (TF) proteins in the central region to form the SC [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref002">2</xref>]. In yeast, the TF protein is Zip1 (SGD S000002693) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Synapsis requires the stabilization of strand invasion intermediates by a functionally diverse set of proteins, including Zip1, Zip2 (SGD S000003218), Zip3 (SGD S000004386), Zip4/Spo22 (SGD S000001335), Msh4 (SGD S000001891), Msh5 (SGD S000002313), Mer3 (SGD S000003220), and Spo16 (SGD S000001196), which are encoded collectively by the <italic>ZMM</italic> genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref013">13</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). The IH connections made by Zmm proteins promote down-regulation of Spo11 activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref014">14</xref>]. DSBs processed along the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway form double Holliday junctions (dHJs) that are asymmetrically resolved to produce COs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref015">15</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). <italic>ZMM</italic>-promoted COs are distributed throughout the genome by a phenomenon called genetic interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref016">16</xref>]. Sgs1 (SGD S000004802), the Bloom syndrome RecQ helicase (BLM) ortholog in yeast, works with Top3 (SGD S000004224) and Rmi1 (SGD S000005945) as a “recombination intermediate chaperone” by promoting the disassembly of strand invasion intermediates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref021">21</xref>]. In wild-type (WT) meiosis, noncrossovers (NCOs) are formed primarily by synthesis-dependent strand annealing (SDSA), in which the invading strand is extended, displaced by the action of the Sgs1-Top3-Rim1, and annealed to the other side of the break [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref022">22</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In the absence of <italic>SGS1</italic>, <italic>TOP3</italic>, or <italic>RMI1</italic>, joint molecules (JMs) are formed that are resolved in an unbiased manner to give both COs and NCOs by structure-specific endonucleases such as Mus81-Mms4 (SGD S000002794-S000000302) and Yen1 (SGD S000000843) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref018">18</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref020">20</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref021">21</xref>]. Inactivation of <italic>SGS1</italic> partially restores COs to some <italic>zmm</italic> mutants, supporting the idea that one function of the <italic>ZMM</italic>s is to protect recombination intermediates from Sgs1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref023">23</xref>].</p>

<p>In yeast, whether a DSB is repaired as a CO or NCO has been proposed to be determined at, or just after, the time of DSB formation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref024">24</xref>]. Furthermore, there is plasticity in the decision as evidenced by the existence of CO homeostasis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref025">25</xref>]. When DSBs are reduced, CO levels are maintained at the expense of NCOs. This behavior suggests that mechanisms exist for regulating the CO/NCO decision after DSBs have been made, but the molecular bases for such regulation have been elusive.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation is a dynamic modification used to regulate different steps in recombination, in addition to IH bias. For example, the highly conserved cell cycle kinases Cdc28-Clb5/6 (Cdk1) (SGD S000000364-S000006324/S000003341) and Cdc7-Dbf4 (Dbf4-dependent kinase; DDK) (SGD S000002175-S000002459) are required for DSB formation, and dHJ resolution is triggered by the polo-like kinase Cdc5 (SGD S000004603) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref028">28</xref>]. Whether Mek1 or DDK is directly involved in forming IH COs was unknown, because inactivation of these kinases prevents creation of IH recombination intermediates. In this work, phosphoproteomic analysis reveals conserved phosphorylation sites on the C terminus of Zip1 that are required for the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway of DSB repair. Phosphorylation of these sites is dependent upon <italic>MEK1</italic>, revealing a previously unknown role for this kinase in the regulation of IH recombination and suggesting a link by which IH bias and the CO/NCO decision can be coordinated.</p>

<title>Zip1 Is Phosphorylated on Its C Terminus in a Region Required for Chromosome Synapsis</title>
<p>To identify phosphorylation sites regulated by Mek1, stable isotope labeling of amino acids in cell culture (SILAC) was performed using a <italic>mek1-as ndt80Δ</italic> diploid as described in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref029">29</xref>]. <italic>mek1-as</italic> encodes a conditional version of Mek1 that can be inactivated by the purine analog 1-NA-PP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref030">30</xref>]. Diploids lacking the meiosis-specific transcription factor <italic>NDT80</italic> (SGD S000001166) arrest in meiotic prophase with fully synapsed chromosomes and unresolved dHJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref015">15</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref031">31</xref>]. A <italic>mek1-as ndt80Δ arg4 lys4</italic> diploid was grown in synthetic medium containing “heavy” or “light” versions of arginine and lysine and then transferred to Spo medium for 14 h. Mek1-as was inhibited in the heavy culture by addition of 1-NA-PP1 for 20 min, chromatin was isolated from both cultures, and equal amounts of protein were mixed and digested with trypsin. Phosphopeptides were enriched using immobilized metal affinity chromatography and analyzed by mass spectrometry (MS). Non-Mek1-dependent phosphopeptides should be present in equal amounts in both cultures giving light:heavy (L/H) peptide ratios of 1. Mek1-dependent phosphopeptides are predicted to be under-represented in the heavy culture and exhibit L/H ratios &gt; 1. This approach revealed that one phosphoprotein potentially regulated by Mek1 is the TF protein Zip1.</p>
<p>MS analysis identified 18 phosphorylation sites on Zip1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). Two of these phosphopeptides (S314 S318 and S712) exhibited L/H ratios around 1.0, indicating that equivalent amounts of Zip1 protein were present in the light and heavy cultures (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Of particular interest were three out of four adjacent serine residues in the C terminus (S815-S818, hereafter referred to as 4S) that exhibited L/H ratios &gt;3, suggesting potential regulation by Mek1. These serines are located within a 25-amino acid region required for chromosome synapsis and WT levels of recombination, suggesting that phosphorylation of Zip1 at the C terminus plays a role in these processes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1B and 1D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref012">12</xref>].</p>
<p>Although TF proteins are structurally similar, they are poorly conserved at the primary sequence level [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref002">2</xref>]. It is therefore compelling that the 4S region of Zip1 is conserved among yeast, mammals and zebrafish TF proteins (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). Furthermore, NetPhos analysis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref032">32</xref>] predicts that at least two of the residues in the conserved 4S region are phosphorylated in all five species. In contrast, no homology was observed in this region for the TF proteins from <italic>Drosophila melanogaster</italic>, <italic>Caenorhabditis elegans</italic>, or <italic>Arabidopsis thaliana</italic>.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of Zip1 4S Promotes Negative Feedback Regulation of Spo11</title>
<p>The functional significance of Zip1 4S phosphorylation was tested using <italic>ZIP1</italic> alleles in which all four serines were mutated either to alanine (<italic>zip1-4A</italic>) or aspartic acid (<italic>zip1-4D</italic>) to prevent or mimic phosphorylation, respectively. The <italic>zip1-4A</italic> diploid exhibited spore viability that is significantly reduced compared to WT (76.7% vs. 94.3%), but which is higher than the <italic>zip1Δ</italic> (45.9%) (<italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.0001) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s008">S1 Table</xref>). This decrease in spore viability is due the absence of negative charges as the <italic>zip1-4D</italic> diploid produced 96.2% viable spores. Meiotic time course analysis of steady state Zip1 protein levels revealed that 4S phosphorylation is required for Zip1 degradation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s003">S1A Fig</xref>). The increased stability of Zip1-4A protein raised the possibility that the spore viability defect was indirectly due to the persistence of Zip1-4A. If this were true, then the <italic>zip1-4A</italic> mutant phenotype should be dominant, since the Zip1-4A protein should fail to get degraded even in the presence of the WT protein. In fact, the amount of Zip1 protein persists at higher levels in the <italic>ZIP1/zip1-4A</italic> heterozygote than the WT strain, yet spore viability in the heterozygote is indistinguishable from WT (94.5% <italic>ZIP1/zip1-4A</italic> vs 94.3% <italic>ZIP1</italic>; <italic>p</italic> = 0.149) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s003">S1A Fig</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Therefore, the failure to degrade Zip1-4A is not the reason for its mutant phenotype.</p>
<p>Meiotic progression was delayed in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> and <italic>zip1Δ</italic> diploids, but not <italic>zip1-4D</italic>, providing further evidence that negative charges at these positions are important for <italic>ZIP1</italic> function (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). Physical analysis using the <italic>HIS4</italic>::<italic>LEU2</italic> hotspot on chromosome III was used to monitor DSB formation and repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref024">24</xref>]. This hotspot consists of a DSB site flanked by polymorphic XhoI restriction sites (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s004">S2A Fig</xref>).

<p>As an alternative way of assessing DSB levels, accumulation of genome-wide Spo11 oligonucleotides was assayed.

<title>Zip1-4S Phosphorylation Promotes COs and Suppresses NCOs at the <italic>HIS4-LEU2</italic> Hotspot</title>
<p>Double digestion with XhoI and NgoMIV allows detection of both CO and NCO chromosomes at the <italic>HIS4</italic>::<italic>LEU2</italic> hotspot [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref034">34</xref>] (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s004">S2A Fig</xref>). COs were reduced to a similar extent in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> and <italic>zip1Δ</italic>. In contrast, NCOs were increased, with an even higher level of NCOs in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> compared to <italic>zip1Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g002">Fig 2D and 2E</xref>). Joint molecules (JMs) indicative of single end invasion (SEI) and dHJ intermediates can be detected using two-dimensional gel electrophoresis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref024">24</xref>]. Previous work has indicated that <italic>ZIP1</italic>, as well as the other <italic>ZMM</italic> genes, promotes the transition from DSBs into SEI intermediates as well as dHJs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref013">13</xref>]. Like <italic>zip1Δ</italic>, SEIs and dHJs were delayed in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g002">Fig 2F and 2G</xref>) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s004">S2D Fig</xref>). The areas under the SEI and IH-dHJ curves appear to be greater in the <italic>zip1-4A</italic> diploid compared to WT and <italic>zip1Δ</italic>, as expected given the increased number of DSBs. It is also possible that intermediates are accumulating due to a slower rate of repair. The formation of intersister (IS) JMs is similarly delayed in both <italic>zip1-4A</italic> and <italic>zip1Δ</italic>.

<p>Map distances were reduced in the <italic>zip1-4A</italic> mutant on chromosome III, consistent with reduced crossing over measured at the <italic>HIS4</italic>::<italic>LEU2</italic> hotspot (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g004">Fig 4C</xref>). In contrast, map distances in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> were greater in three intervals on chromosome VII and one interval on chromosome VIII than either WT or <italic>zip1Δ</italic>. Notably, no CO defect was observed for <italic>zip1Δ</italic> on chromosome VII either. This differential effect on CO formation as a function of chromosome size was also observed with a mutant allele of the <italic>ZMM</italic> gene, <italic>ZIP3</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref039">39</xref>]. Large chromosomes, such as chromosome VII, sustain disproportionately higher numbers of DSBs in <italic>zmm</italic> mutants [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref014">14</xref>]. Therefore, the <italic>zip1-4A</italic> increase in COs on chromosomes VII and VIII could be a consequence of continued Spo11 activity generating new breaks, resulting in more CO opportunities. Increasing the number of DSBs should also increase the number of opportunities for gene conversion and in fact, gene conversion events are elevated for loci on all chromosomes in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g004">Fig 4D</xref>).</p>
<p>A reduction in COs may lead to increased MI non-disjunction due to a failure to physically connect homologs. For both <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and <italic>zip1-4A</italic>, the distribution of viable spores in tetrads supports the idea that spore lethality is due to MI non-disjunction. Both mutants exhibited an increase in the number of 2 viable:2 inviable spores (predicted if one or more pair of homologs have non-disjoined to the same pole) and 0 viable:4 inviable spores (predicted if two or more pairs of homologs have disjoined to opposite poles) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g004">Fig 4E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref040">40</xref>].</p>
<p>Non-disjunction can be directly demonstrated for chromosome III where the codominant <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold> (SGD S000124955) and <italic>MAT</italic>α (SGD S000029699) alleles produce a distinctive nonmating (NM) phenotype when chromosome III is disomic. Chromosome III non-disjunction (in the absence of recombination) should therefore lead to tetrads with two viable spores, both of which are NMs. Out of 63 two viable spore tetrads obtained from <italic>zip1-4D</italic>, only one contained two NM spores (1.6%, <xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002329.t001">Table 1</xref>). In contrast, the number of tetrads exhibiting chromosome III non-disjunction increased to 18.6% in <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and 14.9% in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002329.t001">Table 1</xref>). Another prediction of MI non-disjunction is that viable spores should be derived from segregation of sister chromatids for the other chromosomes. For chromosome VIII, sister versus nonsister spores can be determined using the centromere-linked marker <italic>URA3</italic> (SGD S000000747) (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002329.t001">Table 1</xref>). For the <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and <italic>zip1-4A</italic> chromosome III disomic tetrads, equal numbers of either Ura<sup>+</sup>:Ura<sup>+</sup> or Ura<sup>−</sup>:Ura<sup>−</sup> sister spores were observed, as expected given that chromosomes III and VIII independently assort (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002329.t001">Table 1</xref>).</p>

<p>Recombination was monitored in the intervals between <italic>MAT</italic> and <italic>HIS4</italic> on the disomic III chromosomes. For both <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and <italic>zip1-4A</italic>, all but one of the disomic spores contained III homologs that were non-recombinant between <italic>MAT</italic> and <italic>HIS4</italic> (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002329.t001">Table 1</xref>). Therefore, failure to phosphorylate Zip1 4S results in reduced COs and increased non-disjunction of chromosome III, similar to <italic>zip1Δ</italic>.</p>
<p>To assess whether non-disjunction is occurring on other chromosomes, the segregation of chromosome III was followed using <italic>ADE2</italic> (SGD S000005654), which was integrated adjacent to the centromere on chromosome III (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002329.t001">Table 1</xref>). In the two viable spore tetrads that were not disomic for chromosome III (i.e., both spores were maters), random spore death should result in a 2:1 ratio of nonsister spores (Ade<sup>+</sup>: Ade<sup>−</sup>) to sister spores (Ade<sup>+</sup>: Ade<sup>+</sup> or Ade<sup>−</sup>: Ade<sup>−</sup>) for chromosome III. If, however, spore death is due to non-disjunction of a chromosome(s) other than III, then tetrads containing chromosome III sister spores should be over-represented in the two viable spore asci. The <italic>zip1-4D</italic> diploid exhibited a ratio of 1.3 nonsister/sister spore tetrads, which is not significantly different from the ratio of 2 predicted for random spore death (χ<sup>2</sup>, <italic>p</italic> = 0.357). In contrast, the nonsister/sister spore ratios for <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and <italic>zip1-4A</italic> were 0.2 and 0.5, respectively (<xref ref-type="table" rid="pbio.1002329.t001">Table 1</xref>), supporting the idea that non-disjunction of chromosomes other than III also contributes to the spore lethality.</p>
<p>COs from the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway exhibit genetic interference, where a CO in one interval decreases the likelihood of COs in adjacent intervals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref016">16</xref>]. One way of measuring interference is to divide tetrads into two classes based on crossing over in a reference interval: (1) those with no detectable CO in the interval (parental ditypes [PDs]) and (2) those with at least one detectable CO (nonparental ditypes [NPDs] and tetratypes [TTs]) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref038">38</xref>]. Map distances for an adjacent test interval are then calculated for each class. If interference is acting, then the Class 2/Class 1 map distance ratio should be &lt;1. In the absence of interference, the ratio should be = 1. With one exception, <italic>zip1-4D</italic> exhibited similar levels of interference as WT for intervals on chromosome III and VII (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g004">Fig 4F</xref>). In contrast, interference was absent or weakened in the <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and <italic>zip1-4A</italic> diploids on both chromosome III and VII. These data indicate that the bulk of the COs observed in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> occur via the noninterfering CO pathway.</p>
<p><italic>MUS81</italic> encodes a subunit of a structure-specific endonuclease, which in combination with <italic>MMS4</italic>, is responsible for generating COs along the noninterfering pathway [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref035">35</xref>]. A <italic>mus81Δ</italic> diploid produced 38.7% viable spores, similar to <italic>mus81Δ zip1-4D</italic> (40.0%), while <italic>zip1Δ</italic> exhibited 48.4% (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s008">S1 Table</xref>). The number of viable spores generated by <italic>mus81Δ zip1Δ</italic> (16.1%) is not significantly different from the number expected for compound defects in two independent CO pathways (17.4%, <italic>p</italic> = 0.35, χ<sup>2</sup> test). The residual spore viability most likely arises from COs created by alternative structure-specific endonucleases such as Yen1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref021">21</xref>]. In contrast, the <italic>mus81 zip1-4A</italic> diploid exhibited 20.2% viable spores, which is significantly lower than the 29.5% predicted based on the 75% spore viability observed for <italic>zip1-4A</italic> (<italic>p</italic> = 0.004, χ<sup>2</sup> test). The observation that the <italic>mus81Δ zip1-4A</italic> spore viability is similar to that of <italic>mus81Δ zip1Δ</italic> suggests that the higher spore viability in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> is due to <italic>MUS81</italic>-dependent COs.</p>
<p>Zip1 4S phosphorylation promotes interference on both chromosome III and chromosome VII, yet a CO deficit is only observed on the smaller chromosome. This apparent paradox can be explained if Zip1 4S phosphorylation is required for <italic>ZMM</italic>-mediated COs on all chromosomes, but the loss of these COs is obscured on larger chromosomes by an increased number of DSBs allowing the formation of more COs along the alternative <italic>MUS81</italic>-dependent pathway.</p>

<title>Phosphorylation of Zip1 S816 Is Promoted by DSB Formation</title>

Equivalent amounts of Zip1 protein were present in the different samples, as shown by probing with an antibody that recognizes total Zip1.

<p>In WT cells, Zip1 S816 phosphorylation was coincident with DSB formation, indicated indirectly by phosphorylation of Hop1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g006">Fig 6B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref043">43</xref>]. Zip1 protein was degraded at later time points, as noted previously by [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref027">27</xref>]. Although a low level of phosphorylation was observed in <italic>spo11Δ</italic>, this amount was reduced approximately 15-fold compared to WT, suggesting that DSBs promote Zip1 S816 phosphorylation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g006">Fig 6B, 6D and 6E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref044">44</xref>].

<title>Phosphorylation of Zip1 S816 Is Promoted by Mek1 Kinase Activity</title>
<p>The SILAC experiment showing that Zip1 S816-S818 phosphosites are potentially regulated by Mek1 is consistent with the induction of S816 phosphorylation by DSBs, since one consequence of making DSBs is activation of the kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref006">6</xref>]. In fact, Zip1 S816 phosphorylation is reduced approximately 8-fold in a <italic>mek1-K199R</italic> diploid that encodes a catalytically inactive version of the kinase (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g006">Fig 6C, 6D and 6E</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref048">48</xref>]. Mek1 activation occurs via the Mec1 and Tel1 checkpoint kinases, which phosphorylate the AE component Hop1 in response to DSBs, resulting in Mek1 recruitment to axes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref007">7</xref>]. A 7-fold reduction in Zip1 S816 phosphorylation was observed in a <italic>mec1Δ</italic> strain, while a <italic>tel1Δ</italic> diploid appeared more like WT (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g006">Fig 6C, 6D and 6E</xref>). These results are similar to what was observed for phosphorylation of Hop1 by these kinases [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref006">6</xref>] and are consistent with Zip1 phosphorylation being promoted by activation of Mek1 via Hop1 phosphorylation. We conclude that Zip1 4S phosphorylation is induced upon DSB formation as a result of Mek1 activation and does not require the removal of Spo11 from the ends of the breaks or DSB resection.</p>

<title>Zip1 Is a Direct Substrate of DDK</title>
<p>While Mek1 kinase activity promotes Zip1 S816 phosphorylation, this site does not match the Mek1 consensus (RXXT) determined both by screening peptide libraries and examination of in vivo Mek1 targets [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref051">51</xref>], suggesting that the regulation may be indirect. In vitro assays were therefore performed to see if Zip1 is a direct target of Mek1 using an analog-sensitive version of Mek1, GST-Mek1-as, and an analog of ATP, 6-furfuryl (Fu)-ATPγS [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref030">30</xref>].

<p>The four adjacent serines containing S816 represent potential phosphorylation sites for the highly conserved, essential kinase, DDK [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref054">54</xref>]. DDK is an acid-directed kinase that prefers to phosphorylate amino acids immediately upstream of a negative charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref057">57</xref>]. This charge can be provided either by priming phosphorylation or by negatively charged amino acids. To test whether DDK can directly phosphorylate Zip1, an in vitro kinase assay was developed using an analog-sensitive version of Cdc7, Cdc7-as [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref058">58</xref>]. <italic>CDC7</italic> or <italic>cdc7-as</italic> was fused to sequences encoding FLAG epitopes and the proteins partially purified from <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> -arrested cells. When incubated with ATPγS, autophosphorylation of Cdc7, as well as <italic>trans</italic> phosphorylation of Dbf4, was detected with DDK using the semisynthetic epitope system (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). As expected, phosphorylation by DDK was unaffected by the addition of the DDK-as inhibitor, PP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref058">58</xref>]. Cdc7-as-Dbf4 (DDK-as) was also able to use ATPγS, although not as efficiently as DDK (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). Addition of PP1 to this reaction eliminated Cdc7-as autophosphorylation but not Dbf4 phosphorylation, indicating the presence of a contaminating kinase in the DDK-as preparation capable of modifying Dbf4. Specificity for DDK-as phosphorylation was achieved using the ATP analog, 6-benzyl-ATPγS (6-Bn-ATPγS) instead of ATPγS. In this situation, DDK-as, and not DDK, exhibited phosphorylation of Cdc7-as and Dbf4, and phosphorylation of both proteins was completely eliminated by the addition of PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">Fig 7B</xref>). DDK-as can therefore be used with 6-Bn-ATPγS to reveal direct targets of the kinase in vitro.</p>
<p>Unlike GST-Mek1-as, DDK-as directly phosphorylated MBP-Zip1 in vitro, and this phosphorylation was abolished by PP1 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, left). The semisynthetic epitope kinase assay detects phosphorylation anywhere on a protein and does not reveal specifically which amino acid(s) were phosphorylated. Kinase reactions were therefore performed with 6-Bn-ATP (which transfers phosphate instead of thio-phosphate), and the proteins were probed with p-S816 antibodies. Phosphorylated Zip1 S816 was observed, but not in the presence of inhibitor, confirming that Zip1 S816 is a direct target of DDK-as in vitro (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">Fig 7C</xref>, right).</p>
<p>To see whether DDK is capable of phosphorylating Zip1 S816 in vivo in mitotic cells, the Zip1 C terminus (amino acids 749–875) was fused to lexA (Unitprot P31080) (<italic>lexA-ZIP1C</italic>) and ectopically expressed in vegetative cells using the <italic>ADH1</italic> (SGD S000005446) promoter in a <italic>cdc7-as mcm5-bob1</italic> (SGD S000004264) strain. The <italic>mcm5-bob1</italic> mutation bypasses the essential function of <italic>cdc7-as</italic> in DNA replication initiation and therefore allows <italic>cdc7-as</italic> strains to grow vegetatively in the presence of PP1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref059">59</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref060">60</xref>]. In the absence of inhibitor, Zip1 p-S816 was detected with the WT <italic>lexA-ZIP1C</italic> plasmid, but not the <italic>lexA-ZIP1C-4A</italic> mutant (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">Fig 7D</xref>). Phosphorylation of S816 was reduced when DDK-as was inactivated by PP1, confirming that Zip1 S816 is an in vivo target of DDK-as. The low level of residual phosphorylation is presumably equivalent to the DSB-independent phosphorylation observed in <italic>spo11Δ</italic> meiotic experiments. The fact that DDK can phosphorylate Zip1 S816 in vegetative cells suggests that constraints on DDK phosphorylation of Zip1 are imposed specifically during meiosis.</p>
<p>Inhibiting DDK during meiosis is predicted to reduce Zip1 S816 phosphorylation because DDK is required for making DSBs, which in turn promote Zip1 S816 phosphorylation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref058">58</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g006">Fig 6</xref>). This prediction was partially borne out in that sporulating <italic>cdc7-as</italic> cells in the presence of PP1 resulted in a slight reduction in phosphorylation, but the decrease was not as great as that observed for <italic>spo11Δ</italic> (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">7E, 7F and 7G</xref>). One difference between <italic>spo11Δ</italic> and <italic>cdc7-as</italic> + PP1 strains is that <italic>spo11Δ</italic> cells are able to progress into the meiotic divisions and degrade Zip1, while <italic>cdc7-as</italic> + PP1 cells are arrested prior to <italic>NDT80</italic> induction due to the requirement of DDK for <italic>NDT80</italic> transcription [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref061">61</xref>]. Zip1 S816 phosphorylation was therefore assayed in an <italic>ndt80Δ spo11Δ</italic> diploid, which should phenocopy both the DSB and meiotic progression defects of <italic>cdc7-as</italic> + PP1. Zip1 S816 phosphorylation was increased over four fold in the <italic>ndt80Δ spo11Δ</italic> diploid compared to <italic>spo11Δ</italic>, suggesting that phosphorylation of Zip1 S816 is no longer constrained at the <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> arrest. The fact that S816 phosphorylation is slightly reduced in the absence of DDK activity suggests that some of this phosphorylation is occurring due to DDK. However, the fact that phosphorylation is still present indicates either that the DDK inhibition was incomplete, or more likely, that there is a second kinase capable of phosphorylating this site independently of DDK. Our preferred hypothesis is that during normal meiosis, Zip1 phosphorylation is regulated by Mek1 and is mediated by DDK, but we cannot rule out the possibility that a second, yet-identified kinase also plays a role in Zip1 regulation.</p>
<p>There is no negatively charged amino acid immediately downstream of the Zip1 4S sequence (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1D</xref>), suggesting that a priming negative charge is not necessary for DDK phosphorylation of recombinant Zip1. This appears to be true in vivo as well, as alanine substitutions of any one of the four serines supported WT spore viability (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g007">Fig 7H</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Various combinations of double alanine substitutions reduced spore viability significantly from WT, but only the <italic>zip1-S817A S818A</italic> double mutant was as low as the level observed for the <italic>zip1-4A</italic> diploid. Interestingly, in TF proteins from other species, the predicted phosphoserines in the region conserved with Zip1 4S flank a negatively charged amino acid equivalent to the position of Zip1 S817 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g001">Fig 1E</xref>). This is consistent with the hypothesis that a negatively charged patch created by phosphorylation in this region is a conserved requirement for TF function.</p>

<title><italic>SGS1</italic> and Zip1 4S Phosphorylation Are Both Required for Meiotic Progression</title>
<p>Zmm proteins are proposed to stabilize recombination intermediates by protecting them from the action of the Sgs1 helicase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref016">16</xref>].

The failure to sporulate is due to meiotic prophase arrest, as <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> cells do not undergo the meiotic divisions, remaining mononucleate and failing to generate MI and Meiosis II (MII) spindles measured by staining of nuclei and spindles with 4’, 6-diamidino-2-phenylindole (DAPI) and tubulin, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g008">Fig 8B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s006">S4 Fig</xref>). The <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> meiotic prophase arrest is due to the absence of Zip1 4S phosphorylation, as an <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4D</italic> strain went through the meiotic divisions more quickly and efficiently than <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g008">Fig 8B</xref>).

<p>Analysis of recombination products in the <italic>sgs1-md</italic> background revealed that the excess of NCOs observed in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> is dependent upon <italic>SGS1</italic>. Previously it has been observed that depletion of <italic>SGS1</italic> can partially suppress the CO defects of different <italic>zmm</italic> mutants to various extents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref063">63</xref>].

<title>Zip1 4S Phosphorylation Functions Upstream of Other <italic>ZMM</italic> Genes</title>
<p>The meiotic progression and sporulation defects observed for <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic>, but not <italic>sgs1-md zip1Δ</italic>, indicate that the presence of the Zip1-4A protein has a toxic gain of function phenotype in the absence of <italic>SGS1</italic>. One way to explain this phenotype would be if (1) Zip1 is recruited to a subset of DSBs where phosphorylation of Zip1 4S commits the breaks to repair by the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway of interfering CO formation; (2) the absence of Zip1 4S phosphorylation blocks the break from being repaired, and (3) Sgs1 removes Zip1-4A from the breaks, thereby allowing them to be recycled and repaired via SDSA or the alternative Mus81-Mms4/Yen1 pathway. This model posits that the <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> meiotic prophase arrest is due to unrepaired DSBs triggering the meiotic recombination checkpoint and is supported by the observation that preventing DSBs using <italic>spo11Δ</italic> restored sporulation to <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).</p>
<p>Although the <italic>ZMM</italic> genes function in the pathway for producing interfering COs, the order in which they work has yet to be elucidated. The <italic>zip1-4A</italic> inhibition of sporulation in <italic>sgs1-md</italic> strains provides an assay by which to order <italic>ZMM</italic> genes relative to Zip1 4S phosphorylation. There are two ways that a <italic>ZMM</italic> gene could function prior to Zip1 4S phosphorylation. One possibility would be that a <italic>ZMM</italic> gene is required for Zip1-4S phosphorylation. In this case, the <italic>sgs1-md zmmΔ</italic> diploid would contain unphosphorylated Zip1 4S and should therefore phenocopy <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> and fail to sporulate. This was not observed, however, as combining <italic>sgs1-md</italic> with a deletion of <italic>ZIP2</italic>, <italic>ZIP3</italic>, <italic>ZIP4</italic>, <italic>MSH5</italic>, <italic>MER3</italic>, or <italic>SPO16</italic> resulted in high levels of sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g008">Fig 8A</xref>). Consistent with this observation, Zip1 S816 phosphorylation was unaffected in <italic>sgs1-md</italic> diploids containing <italic>mer3Δ</italic>, <italic>msh5Δ</italic> or <italic>zip3Δ</italic> (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s003">S1B Fig</xref>). Another possibility is that a <italic>ZMM</italic> gene is required for Zip1 4S function (for example if it was needed to recruit Zip1 to the DSB). In this scenario, the absence of the <italic>ZMM</italic> gene should phenocopy the <italic>spo11Δ zip1-4A sgs1-md</italic> diploid and allow <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A zmmΔ</italic> diploids to sporulate. This was not observed, either, as all of the <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A zmmΔ</italic> diploids exhibited decreased sporulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g008">Fig 8A</xref>).

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>It has recently become clear that whether a meiotic DSB is repaired as a CO or NCO is due primarily to the interplay between the “anti-CO” activities of helicases and the “pro-CO” activities of the functionally diverse set of Zmm proteins [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref016">16</xref>]. Yet, how this interplay might be modulated was unclear. Our discovery that phosphorylation of serines S815–818 in the Zip1 C terminus is required for the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway of CO formation suggests a mechanism by which the CO/NCO decision can be regulated.</p>
<sec id="sec014">
<title>Phosphorylation of the Zip1 C Terminus Initiates the <italic>ZMM</italic> Pathway of Interfering COs</title>
<p>The Zip1 protein contains N and C terminal globular domains flanking coiled-coil regions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref012">12</xref>]. In the SC, TF proteins such as Zip1 form homo-oligomers in which the carboxy (C) termini are in contact with AEs, while the amino (N) termini interact within the central region [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref002">2</xref>]. While the Zip1 N terminus is unnecessary for synapsis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref012">12</xref>], phosphorylation of serines 815–818 within the C terminus is required for SC formation. Failure to phosphorylate Zip1 S815–818 produces a canonical <italic>zmm</italic> phenotype. There is a delay in the formation of SEI and dHJ recombination intermediates. COs are reduced on small chromosomes, resulting in MI non-disjunction and decreased spore viability. Although CO defects are less obvious on larger chromosomes, CO interference is weakened or absent on both small and large chromosomes, indicating that <italic>ZMM</italic>-mediated COs are affected on all chromosomes. NCOs are increased in an <italic>SGS1</italic>-dependent manner, as expected if DSBs that cannot be repaired via the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway are channeled by <italic>SGS1</italic> into pathways that generate NCOs either through SDSA or unbiased HJ resolution. In addition, the increased spore viability observed in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> relative to <italic>zip1Δ</italic> is dependent upon <italic>MUS81</italic>. Therefore, Zip1 4S phosphorylation is required to antagonize the anti-CO function of Sgs1.</p>

<title>Zip1 4S Phosphorylation Functions after DSB Formation But Prior to Other <italic>ZMM</italic> Genes</title>
<p>In yeast, it has previously been hypothesized that the CO/NCO decision is made soon after DSBs are generated [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref024">24</xref>]. In WT cells, Zip1 phosphorylation coincides with the appearance of phosphorylated Hop1, an indirect marker of DSBs. Furthermore, Zip1 phosphorylation is promoted by Mek1 kinase activity, which is activated in response to DSBs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref006">6</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref051">51</xref>] and reduced when DSBs are prevented by deletion of <italic>SPO11</italic>. We propose that Zip1 associates with DSBs (either directly or through interaction with other proteins) and that 4S phosphorylation then commits those breaks to the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). In fact, association of Zip1 and other Zmm proteins at DSBs has recently been shown to be promoted by the 9-1-1 checkpoint clamp complex that binds to the single strand DNA-double strand DNA junctions of resected ends [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref064">64</xref>].</p>

<p>Epistasis analysis indicates that Zip1 4S phosphorylation functions prior to all of the other <italic>ZMM</italic> genes. Although this finding is at odds with cytological studies showing that <italic>ZIP2</italic> and <italic>ZIP3</italic> are required for the assembly of Zip1 along the SC, it is consistent with the fact that Zip3 localization specifically to DSB sites (measured by chromatin immunoprecipitation) is dependent upon <italic>ZIP1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref002">2</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref039">39</xref>]. We propose that Zip1 has two temporally distinct functions with regard to SC formation. Its early function is to localize to DSBs where phosphorylation of the 4S region creates a patch of negative charges at the C terminus that promotes Zip1 interaction with downstream proteins, thereby committing the DSB to an interfering CO fate (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g009">Fig 9A</xref>). The resulting protein complex, which includes Zip2 and Zip3, is then necessary to nucleate Zip1 polymerization to allow synapsis.</p>
<p>Diploids lacking both <italic>SGS1</italic> and <italic>ZIP1</italic> are able to sporulate, whereas <italic>sgs1-md zip1-4A</italic> strains are not. Furthermore, the increased number of NCOs <italic>in zip1-4A</italic> is dependent upon <italic>SGS1</italic>. These results suggest that Sgs1 is able to remove Zip1-4A from DSBs, thereby allowing breaks to be repaired by alternative pathways. In <italic>sgs1-md</italic> strains, the DSBs associated with Zip1-4A cannot be repaired and trigger the meiotic recombination checkpoint (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.1002329.g009">Fig 9B</xref>). We further hypothesize that there is competition for DSBs between Sgs1 and Zip1 and this competition can be biased towards the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway by phosphorylation of Zip1. This provides a mechanism for influencing which pathway is preferred to implement CO homeostasis. For example, when DSBs are reduced, CO levels could be kept constant by increasing the fraction of DSBs containing phosphorylated Zip1.</p>

<title>The requirement for Zip1 4S Phosphorylation for Interhomolog Engagement Obscures the CO Defect for <italic>zip1-4A</italic> on Large Chromosomes</title>
<p>In addition to their effect on CO regulation, <italic>ZMM</italic>s are required for synapsis and to mediate a type of IH engagement that results in feedback inhibition of Spo11 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref014">14</xref>]. This is also true for Zip1 4S phosphorylation as <italic>zip1-4A</italic> mutants exhibit higher levels of DSBs that persist longer than WT. Interestingly, DSBs in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> are present at higher levels and for longer than <italic>zip1Δ</italic> as well. This suggests that, while <italic>zip1Δ</italic> cells eventually adapt to the lack of <italic>ZMM</italic>-mediated IH engagement and down-regulate Spo11, the presence of the Zip1-4A protein actively prevents this adaptation.</p>
<p>When IH engagement is defective, additional DSBs are introduced disproportionately onto larger chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref014">14</xref>]. We propose that some of these extra DSBs are converted into COs via the alternative <italic>MUS81</italic>-dependent pathway and that the higher number of DSBs formed in <italic>zip1-4A</italic> on larger chromosomes consequently increases the number of COs, thereby providing an explanation for the higher spore viability of <italic>zip1-4A</italic> compared to <italic>zip1Δ</italic>. These results underscore the complexity in analyzing <italic>zmm</italic> mutant phenotypes. While <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and other <italic>zmms</italic> are commonly considered to be CO-defective, both <italic>zip1Δ</italic> and <italic>zip1-4A</italic> may exhibit WT (or greater) levels of COs depending on the chromosome that is being assayed. The fact that interference is reduced on all chromosomes, large and small, indicates that the <italic>ZMM</italic> pathway is not functioning on large chromosomes either, but the <italic>ZMM</italic> CO defect is obscured by the creation of COs along the <italic>MUS81</italic>-independent pathway that do not exhibit interference [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref035">35</xref>].</p>
<p>In addition to being required for recombination and synapsis, Zip1 also functions at centromeres. Prior to DSB formation, Zip1 promotes homology-independent centromere coupling, which is then regulated by Mec1 phosphorylation of S75 in the Zip1 N terminus [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref066">66</xref>]. Both <italic>zip1-4A</italic> and <italic>zip1-4D</italic> are functional for nonhomologous centromere coupling, as might be expected given that the 4S sequence is in the C terminal globular domain (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1002329.s007">S5 Fig</xref>). After SC disassembly, Zip1 remains at centromeres and helps promote segregation of nonexchange chromosomes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref067">67</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref068">68</xref>]. While it is possible that the higher spore viability observed for <italic>zip1-4A</italic> compared to <italic>zip1Δ</italic> is due to this post-pachytene chromosome segregation function, this idea would not explain why the increased spore viability is dependent upon <italic>MUS81</italic> and therefore seems unlikely.</p>

<title>C Terminal Phosphorylation of TF Proteins May Be a Conserved Mechanism for Regulating Recombination</title>
<p>Phosphorylation of Zip1 S816 is promoted by two very different kinases: the meiosis-specific kinase, Mek1, and the highly conserved cell cycle kinase, DDK. A number of experiments indicate that DDK1 is directly phosphorylating Zip1, while the requirement for Mek1 is indirect. First, S816 is not contained within a Mek1 consensus sequence (RXXT), making it unlikely to be a direct substrate. In contrast, the sequence of consecutive serines in the Zip1 C terminus provides a good target for the addition of multiple phosphates by DDK, which normally has a preference for phosphorylating amino acids immediately upstream of a negative charge [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref028">28</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref055">55</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref057">57</xref>]. Second, DDK-as, but not Mek1-as, phosphorylates recombinant Zip1 in vitro. The use of analog-sensitive kinases with the appropriate ATP analogs ensures that the phosphorylation observed in vitro is directly due to the analog-sensitive kinase. The specificity for DDK-as is further supported by the fact that Zip1 S816 phosphorylation is abolished in vitro by the DDK-as inhibitor, PP1. Third, the bulk of S816 phosphorylation observed in vegetative cells ectopically expressing the Zip1 C terminus is dependent upon DDK-as kinase activity, confirming that this reaction occurs in vivo, as well as in vitro.</p>
<p>Phosphorylation of Zip1 S816 is complex, however, as noted by the surprising observation that <italic>ndt80Δ spo11Δ</italic>-arrested cells exhibited high levels of Zip1 S816 phosphorylation in the absence of DSBs, while phosphorylation was reduced ~15-fold in <italic>NDT80 spo11Δ</italic> diploids. Like <italic>spo11Δ ndt80Δ</italic>, inactivation of DDK-as in meiosis prevents DSBs and meiotic progression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref057">57</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref060">60</xref>]. The fact that S816 phosphorylation was not abolished but only partially reduced in these cells, even though DDK-as was inactive, indicates a second kinase can phosphorylate S816 when the cells are arrested. One possibility is that Zip1 phosphorylation simply correlates with the time that cells spend in meiotic prophase—so that mutants that cause delays in meiotic progression such as <italic>sae2Δ</italic>, <italic>dmc1Δ</italic>, and <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> allow the phosphorylated form of the protein to accumulate. An alternative explanation is that the <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> arrest creates a situation in which the WT regulation of Zip1 phosphorylation is no longer working. It may be that, given enough time, DDK and/or the second kinase can phosphorylate Zip1 everywhere along the chromosome. The discovery of unregulated Zip1 S816 phosphorylation may explain the surprising observation that in <italic>mek1Δ ndt80Δ</italic> diploids, IH JMs that are suppressed early in meiosis (as expected due to the lack of IH bias) accumulate at the <italic>ndt80Δ</italic> arrest [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref069">69</xref>]. This result also raises the question as to why Mek1 regulation of S816 was observed in the SILAC experiment in which cells were arrested using <italic>ndt80Δ</italic>. One potential explanation is that phosphopeptides identified in the SILAC experiment were derived from chromatin-associated proteins, while the western blots probed with the α-pS816 antibodies were from whole cell extracts, which do not provide any information as to location of the Zip1 that is getting phosphorylated.</p>
<p>DDK is an essential protein kinase with an evolutionarily conserved role in the initiation of replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref070">70</xref>]. Given that DDK directly phosphorylates Zip1 S816 and is responsible for the bulk of phosphorylation observed when the Zip1 C terminus is ectopically expressed in vegetative cells, a reasonable hypothesis is that DDK has a role in regulating CO formation in yeast, raising the question as to whether this role is also evolutionarily conserved. In fact, the TF proteins from mammals and zebrafish contain homology to the yeast 4S region. This conservation is especially striking because overall homology between TF proteins is low [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref002">2</xref>]. In addition, multiple residues within the 4S region are predicted to be phosphorylated in mammals and zebrafish. This, along with the fact that many of the yeast Zmm proteins have orthologs in mammals, supports the idea that this mechanism for CO regulation is conserved [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref071">71</xref>]. This mechanism may not be universal, however, as no homology was found in the TF proteins from plants, although plants appear to contain at least some <italic>ZMM</italic> genes (e.g., [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref072">72</xref>]). In addition, TF proteins from both <italic>D</italic>. <italic>melanogaster</italic> and <italic>C</italic>. <italic>elegans</italic> do not contain the 4S region.

<title><italic>MEK1</italic>-Dependent Phosphorylation of Zip1 4S Provides a Link between IH Bias and the CO/NCO Decision</title>
<p>DSBs trigger the localized activation of Mek1 on the axis. A role for Mek1 in promoting IH bias is well-established as inactivation of Mek1 results in IS repair [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref009">9</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref043">43</xref>]. This work shows that Mek1 regulates IH CO formation as well, by promoting phosphorylation of the C terminus of Zip1. Mek1 can therefore be considered a “master regulator” of meiotic recombination in that it phosphorylates substrates that both suppress IS recombination while at the same time promoting interfering CO formation.</p>
<p>The observation that Zip1 S816 is phosphorylated in vegetative cells but is induced by Mek1 and DSBs during WT meiosis suggests that Zip1 phosphorylation is constrained in meiotic cells and that Mek1 kinase activity overcomes this constraint. How Mek1 does this remains to be established. DSB formation is timed to occur after DNA replication [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref001">1</xref>]. DDK phosphorylation of Mer2 (SGD S000003782) promotes the recruitment of Spo11 to axes where DSBs occur. Recent work has shown that DDK travels with the replication fork, phosphorylating Mer2 and then moving on [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref073">73</xref>]. Since Zip1 is not phosphorylated until after DSBs have been made, it seems unlikely that replication fork-associated DDK is responsible. Therefore, one possibility is that Mek1 phosphorylation of itself or some other protein results in the recruitment of DDK (or potentially the alternative kinase) to DSBs, either by creating a “landing pad” for the kinase or by changing the chromosomal architecture to make breaks more accessible. For example, Mek1 has been proposed to antagonize Rec8-mediated cohesion locally around DSBs to release an “homology searching tentacle”, which could then attract the kinase [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref009">9</xref>]. We propose that Mek1 kinase activity is the link by which IH bias and IH CO formation are coordinated to ensure proper chromosome segregation during meiosis.</p>

Extracts for Spo11 oligo time courses were prepared as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref090">90</xref>] with the following modification: immunoprecipitations utilized 10 μl IgG Sepharose Fast Flow beads (GE) per 0.2 ml of extract. Immunoprecipitations were then performed exactly as in [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref014">14</xref>].</p>

<title>Biochemical analysis of Zip1 steady state protein levels and Zip1 S816 phosphorylation in different mutants.</title>
<p>A. Time courses were performed at 30°C. Isogenic diploids containing either <italic>zip1Δ</italic> (NH2297::pRS304), <italic>ZIP1</italic> (NH2297::p382), <italic>zip1-4A</italic> (NH2297::p382-4A), or <italic>ZIP1/zip1-4A</italic> (NH2297::p382::p382-4A) were sporulated, and protein extracts were generated for the indicated time points. Equal amounts of extract were loaded for each time point for each strain. The gels were cut in half and the top half was probed with antibodies that recognize total Zip1, while the bottom half was probed with Arp7 as a loading control. B. Zip1 S816 phosphorylation in <italic>sgs1-md</italic> diploids containing different <italic>zmm</italic> mutants. Protein extracts from time courses from the <italic>sgs1-md</italic> diploids containing either <italic>mer3Δ</italic> (NH2267::p382)), <italic>msh5Δ</italic> (NH2265::p382), or <italic>zip3Δ</italic> (NH2243::p382) were probed with either the pS816 phospho-specific antibody or the total Zip1 antibody. The Arp7 loading control was performed as described in Panel A.</p>

<title>SC formation in various <italic>zip1</italic> mutants.</title>
<p>(A) Diploids from the BR background were incubated in Spo medium, and spread chromosomes were stained with anti-Red1 antibodies to visualize AEs and anti-myc antibodies to visualize the central element protein, Ecm11-myc. Red1-positive spreads were separated into categories: 1) lacking Ecm11, 2) dotty—exhibiting Ecm11 foci, 3) partial—exhibiting stretches of SC, or 4) full—exhibiting nearly complete or complete synapsis. (B) Quantification of the classes shown in Panel A. 100 spreads (<italic>zip1-4A</italic>) and 200 spreads (<italic>ZIP1</italic>, <italic>ZIP1-4D</italic>) were counted for each time point.

<title>Nonhomologous and homologous centromere associations in various <italic>zip1</italic> mutants.</title>
<p>A. Nonhomologous centromere associations: The <italic>MAT</italic><bold>a</bold><italic>/MATα CTF19-MYC zip1Δ</italic> haploid, BR5892-8A:pB211, was transformed with either <italic>ZIP1</italic> (p382), <italic>ZIP1-4D</italic> (p382-4D), <italic>zip1-4A</italic> (p382-4A), or pRS304 (vector). Twenty hours after transfer to Spo medium at 30°C, chromosomes were spread and stained with anti-myc (9E10) and anti-Red1 antibodies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref030">30</xref>]. Spreads with substantial Red1 staining, indicating mid-prophase nuclei, were scored for the number of Ctf19 foci. Because haploids contain 16 nonhomologous chromosomes, pairing of nonhomologous centromeres should result in eight foci, as is observed for <italic>ZIP1</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref065">65</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref066">66</xref>]. In contrast, <italic>zip1Δ</italic> exhibits closer to the 16 foci expected if centromeres are unpaired. Both <italic>zip1-4D</italic> and zip1-<italic>4A</italic> appear to be fully functional for nonhomologous centromere association. B. Homologous centromere associations: Chromosomes from <italic>CTF19-myc zip Δ</italic> (NH2247) carrying various <italic>ZIP1</italic> alleles (<italic>ZIP1</italic>, <italic>zip1D</italic>, <italic>zip1-4D</italic> and <italic>zip1-4A</italic>) were spread 20 h after transfer to Spo medium and stained with anti-myc and anti-Red1 antibodies. Nuclear spreads with linear Red1 staining, indicating mid-prophase, were scored for the number of Ctf19 foci. Like <italic>zip4Δ</italic>, <italic>zip2Δ</italic> diploids exhibit ~16 foci since the chromosomes are homologously aligned and their centromeres are associated via Zip1 [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1002329.ref066">66</xref>]. The <italic>zip1Δ zip2Δ</italic> mutant forms ~24 foci, consistent with the requirement for <italic>ZIP1</italic> to hold homologous centromeres together. This number is less than the 32 foci expected if all chromosomes are unassociated, presumably due to centromere proximal axial associations. <italic>zip1-4D zip2Δ</italic>, and <italic>zip1-4A zip2Δ</italic> exhibit Ctf19 focus numbers similar <italic>to zip2Δ</italic>, indicating these alleles are functional for homologous centromere association during prophase.</p>
