      <abstract>
         <p>Cytoplasmic RNA localization is a key biological strategy for establishing polarity in a variety of organisms and cell types. However, the mechanisms that control directionality during asymmetric RNA transport are not yet clear. To gain insight into this crucial process, we have analyzed the molecular machinery directing polarized transport of RNA to the vegetal cortex in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes. Using a novel approach to measure directionality of mRNA transport in live oocytes, we observe discrete domains of unidirectional and bidirectional transport that are required for vegetal RNA transport. While kinesin-1 appears to promote bidirectional transport along a microtubule array with mixed polarity, dynein acts first to direct unidirectional transport of RNA towards the vegetal cortex. Thus, vegetal RNA transport occurs through a multistep pathway with a dynein-dependent directional cue. This provides a new framework for understanding the mechanistic basis of cell and developmental polarity.</p>

         <title>Author Summary</title>
         <p>Like traffic on highways, molecular cargos are transported within cells on tracks that are collectively referred to as cytoskeletal networks. RNA molecules are one such cargo, and in many species, the localization of RNAs in egg cells or oocytes is essential for establishing the first asymmetries that are necessary for proper embryo development. RNAs can be actively transported by molecular motors that move cargos along the cytoskeletal tracks, but how such motors are capable of directing cargos to specific destinations within the cell is not yet known. Here we show that two motors, dynein and kinesin—known to carry out transport in opposite directions—are both directly involved in RNA localization in frog oocytes. To understand how these motors can promote directional cargo transport, we developed a system to monitor RNA transport in live oocytes. We find that the motor acting first in the pathway, dynein, is responsible for unidirectional transport. Bidirectional transport, mediated by kinesin, occurs subsequently on cytoskeletal tracks of opposing polarity near the RNA's final destination. Our results suggest a new model for directional transport comprising an initial directional cue that dominates over a later nondirectional step, acting to refine the ultimate cargo distribution.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>RNA transport underlies cell and developmental polarity in many organisms. Spatial regulation of gene expression mediated by subcellular RNA localization is required for embryonic axis formation, germ cell specification, and neuronal polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Holt1">[1]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Martin1">[2]</xref>. While there are several means by which cells can achieve mRNA localization, perhaps the most common of these relies on active transport by molecular motors. In metazoans, kinesin and dynein motor proteins drive transport of RNA and other cargos to the plus- and minus-ends of microtubules, respectively <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Bullock1">[3]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Tekotte1">[5]</xref>. In most models of mRNA localization, a single type of motor is bound to the RNA cargo to mediate localization. However, this simple model fails to account for cells that possess microtubule arrays of mixed polarity, or situations where the RNA cargo is capable of binding both plus- and minus-end directed motors. These issues raise the critical question of how RNAs are targeted to the correct subcellular location when they are capable of bidirectional transport.</p>
      <p>In <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes, localization of Vg1 mRNA to the vegetal cortex during oogenesis is essential for proper germ layer patterning during embryogenesis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Medioni1">[6]</xref>. Vg1 mRNA encodes a member of the TGF-β growth factor family, and spatially restricted expression of Vg1 is critical for both endoderm and mesoderm specification <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Birsoy1">[7]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Thomsen1">[8]</xref>. Vegetal transport of Vg1 mRNA is directed by a vegetal localization element (VLE) contained within the 3′ UTR <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Mowry1">[9]</xref>. The VLE associates with both sequence-specific RNA-binding proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Lewis1">[10]</xref> and molecular motors, including kinesin-1 and kinesin-2 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Betley1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>. However, kinesin motors mediate transport only in the lower half of the vegetal cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, near the RNA's final destination, indicating that vegetal RNA transport must require additional steps and may rely on other molecular motors. Importantly, the mechanisms controlling directionality during RNA transport are poorly understood in most systems.</p>
      <p>Regulating the net direction of transport is crucial, both for RNAs and for other cargos such as vesicles and organelles. This important process is not well understood, although recent studies have suggested a range of possible mechanisms. Some models favor regulation at the level of the molecular motor, whereby control of motor number, motor activity, or both is responsible for directional transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Ally1">[13]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Muller1">[17]</xref>. Other studies have implicated microtubule modifications or asymmetries in microtubule polarity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Konishi1">[18]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Zimyanin1">[19]</xref>. Support for both classes of models has emerged from studies of RNA localization. For example, RNAs containing localization elements that direct localization to the apical cytoplasm of the <italic>Drosophila</italic> blastoderm embryo recruit more dynein motors than are recruited to nonlocalizing transcripts <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Bullock2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-AmruteNayak1">[20]</xref>. This promotes directional transport by favoring processive movement towards the minus ends of microtubules for apically localized RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Bullock2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-AmruteNayak1">[20]</xref>. By contrast, <italic>oskar</italic> RNA localization by the kinesin-1 motor relies on a slight bias in microtubule orientation within the <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocyte for directional transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Zimyanin1">[19]</xref>. Vg1 mRNA transport also depends on microtubule orientation; a subpopulation of microtubules oriented with their plus-ends towards the vegetal cortex emerges coincident with kinesin-1-dependent transport of Vg1 mRNA <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>. Although it is likely that multiple motors coordinate transport of localized RNAs on polarized microtubule networks, the mechanisms by which polarized transport can be controlled by motors of opposing directionality on a dynamic cytoskeleton remain unknown. Moreover, because most studies have relied on tracking individual mRNP particles to determine the rate and direction of transport, our understanding of how the flux of mRNA populations can promote localization to the appropriate destination is far from complete.</p>
      <p>To uncover the basis for directional RNA transport in <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocytes we have analyzed the functions of specific molecular motors in vegetal RNA transport. Through biochemical and in vivo interference experiments, we show that cytoplasmic dynein is required for an initial step in the vegetal RNA transport pathway. This is followed by a kinesin-dependent step that ultimately brings the RNA to the cortex. Using in vivo imaging approaches, we measured the rate and direction of RNA movement, revealing discrete regions of transport directionality in the oocyte cytoplasm. While transport near the vegetal cortex is bidirectional, dynein-dependent transport is strongly biased toward the vegetal pole and thus provides the initial directional cue for polarized RNA transport. Our results reveal an unexpectedly complex choreography, with multiple motors moving in several directions, to ensure delivery of RNA cargos to their precise destination.</p>

         <title>Dynein Plays an Essential Role in Vegetal RNA Localization</title>
         <p>Transport of RNA to the vegetal cortex of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte is mediated in part by kinesin motors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Betley1">[11]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, but other necessary steps in the transport pathway appear to be independent of kinesin. Specifically, kinesin motors have been shown to mediate vegetal RNA transport in the lower vegetal cytoplasm near the vegetal cortex, but not in the upper vegetal cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, leaving open the question of what machinery could mediate transport in that region. While microtubules in stage II–III oocytes are generally oriented with minus ends at the vegetal cortex, a subpopulation is present within the vegetal cytoplasm with plus-ends at the vegetal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Pfeiffer1">[21]</xref>. Thus, the vegetal cytoplasm contains microtubules of opposing polarities, with both plus- and minus-ends pointing toward the vegetal cortex. Given the mixed population of microtubules present within the vegetal cytoplasm <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, we investigated the role of cytoplasmic dynein in the vegetal RNA transport pathway. Dynein mediates transport to minus ends of microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Vallee1">[22]</xref> in conjunction with dynactin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Kardon1">[23]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Schroer1">[24]</xref>, a distinct protein complex that is required for dynein-dependent transport of vesicles, organelles, spindles, peroxisomes, and mRNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Gagnon1">[4]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Tekotte1">[5]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Vallee1">[22]</xref>. To test a potential role for dynein in vegetal RNA transport, we disrupted dynein function in vivo. We used three approaches that have previously been shown to block dynein-dependent transport by disrupting interactions between dynein and dynactin; two relied on overexpression of dynactin components <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Burkhardt1">[25]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Quintyne1">[26]</xref>, either the CC1 domain of p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1A</xref>) or dynamitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1B</xref>), and the third used microinjection of a function blocking dynein antibody (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s001">Figure S1</xref>). After disrupting dynein function, we microinjected fluorescently labeled VLE RNA to assess effects on mRNA localization. In untreated control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1C</xref>), VLE RNA undergoing localization adopts a characteristic distribution in the vegetal cytoplasm, typified by a cup of RNA on the vegetal side of the nucleus and a crescent of RNA at the vegetal cortex, with the RNA in the process of localization evident in the vegetal cytoplasm between the cup and cortex (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s002">Figure S2</xref> for a time course of vegetal RNA localization). Disruption of dynein function using all three approaches caused a strong enrichment of VLE RNA in a cup-like region on the vegetal side of the oocyte nucleus and significant loss of RNA accumulation in the lower vegetal cytoplasm and cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1A–B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s001">Figure S1B</xref>) relative to VLE RNA localization in control oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1C–D</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s001">Figure S1A</xref>). The distribution of microtubules in the vegetal cytoplasm was unaffected by dynein disruption (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s003">Figure S3</xref>), as was that of dynein itself (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s004">Figure S4</xref>), suggesting a direct effect on vegetal RNA localization. The observed loss of VLE localization after disruption of dynein function reveals a critical function for dynein in vegetal RNA localization.</p>

         <p>To address whether dynein plays a direct role in vegetal RNA transport, we tested whether dynein is specifically associated with Vg1 RNA. We first performed immunofluorescence for dynein in oocytes that were microinjected with fluorescent VLE RNA. Dynein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1E</xref>) and VLE RNA (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1E</xref>′) are colocalized at the cortex and throughout the vegetal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1E″–F</xref>). In addition, immunoprecipitation of dynein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g002">Figure 2A</xref>) using a dynein intermediate chain (DIC) antibody specifically recovered Vg1 mRNA but not a highly abundant control RNA, EF1α. Immunoprecipitation of dynein complexes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g002">Figure 2B</xref>) also recovered known components of the Vg1 mRNP <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Lewis1">[10]</xref>, including Vera and Staufen, but perhaps surprisingly, did not recover the dynactin component, p150<sup>Glued</sup> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g002">Figure 2C</xref>). Although the dynactin complex has been suggested to be required for dynein/cargo association, dynactin has also been shown to regulate dynein transport by increasing processivity and modulating interaction with microtubules <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-King1">[27]</xref>. Importantly, recruitment of cargos to dynein can be dynactin-independent, although transport still requires dynactin <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Dienstbier1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Tan1">[31]</xref>. Consistent with a dynactin-independent mode of cargo binding, disruption of dynactin by CC1 overexpression does not abolish dynein/Vg1 mRNP association (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>), yet blocks vegetal RNA transport (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1</xref>).</p>

         <p>The phenotype observed upon dynein disruption, accumulation of VLE RNA in the cup region on the vegetal side of the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1A–B</xref>), is quite distinct from that previously observed upon expression of a kinesin-1 rigor mutant <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>. This dominant negative mutant locks cargo onto microtubules at the site of kinesin binding <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Nakata1">[32]</xref> and results in accumulation of VLE RNA in the lower vegetal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g003">Figure 3A</xref>). Moreover, the dynein-disruption phenotype is also distinct from that occurring upon inhibition of kinesin-1 by overexpression of kinesin-1 heavy chain lacking its motor domain (KHCΔm), which results in no detectable vegetal localization (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s005">Figure S5</xref>). The distinct RNA distributions after either dynein or kinesin-1 disruption (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g003">Figure 3A,B</xref>) suggest that dynein and kinesin could mediate sequential steps in vegetal RNA transport. To order these motors in the RNA transport pathway, we disrupted the function of both motors simultaneously in oocytes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g003">Figure 3C</xref>). We observed that accumulation of VLE RNA in the perinuclear cup after disruption of dynein function by CC1 overexpression was unaffected by kinesin-1 rigor expression, while the kinesin-1 rigor phenotype of accumulation in the lower vegetal cytoplasm was significantly reduced (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g003">Figure 3E</xref>). The predominance of the dynein-disruption phenotype indicates that dynein functions upstream of kinesin-1 in the transport pathway. Yet how these motors, known to move in opposing directions on microtubules, might carry out transport of Vg1 RNA to the vegetal cortex is unclear, and insight into directionality is impossible to attain using standard fixed cell imaging technologies.</p>

         <p>To measure RNA transport in vivo, we used Fluorescence Recovery After Photobleaching (FRAP, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-LippincottSchwartz1">[36]</xref>). The large size of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte (∼300 µm diameter at stage II; <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Dumont1">[37]</xref>) allowed us to assess RNA mobility in multiple regions of the vegetal cytoplasm: in the cup region adjacent to the nucleus (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, Region 1), in the upper vegetal cytoplasm (Region 2), in the lower vegetal cytoplasm (Region 3), and in the animal hemisphere cytoplasm (Region 4). FRAP analysis showed that the mobility of VLE-MS2 RNA in the vegetal cytoplasm (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 86.7±6.72 s) is significantly lower than that of a nonlocalizing βG-MS2 RNA (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 16.6±1.92 s). Yet the mobility of VLE-MS2 RNA outside of the vegetal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g004">Figure 4D</xref>, Region 4) is similar (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 16.4±0.97 s) to that of βG-MS2 RNA. The calculated diffusion coefficients outside of the vegetal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g004">Figure 4E</xref>) are consistent with previously published reports of RNA diffusion rates <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Chang1">[38]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Fusco1">[39]</xref>, suggesting that VLE RNA can diffuse freely outside of the vegetal cytoplasm. The behavior of VLE RNA in the vegetal cytoplasm is dependent on microtubules, as VLE RNA mobility is similar to βG-MS2 RNA after disruption of microtubules by nocodazole treatment (t<sub>1/2</sub> = 16.2±2.13 s). Since the FRAP experiments assess the mobility of the entire population of MS2-tagged RNAs in a given region, these results indicate that the majority of VLE-MS2 RNAs in the vegetal cytoplasm are not moving rapidly at any given time. Moreover, the reduced mobility of VLE RNA in the vegetal cytoplasm is likely due to interaction of the RNA with the microtubule cytoskeleton, presumably through an interaction with molecular motors.</p>
         <p>To assess the effects of dynein disruption in live oocytes, we performed FRAP in the vegetal cytoplasm in oocytes overexpressing dynamitin and in control oocytes. We carried out FRAP in Regions 1 and 3, but not Region 2, due to enlargement of the cup region in oocytes expressing dynamitin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1B</xref>). As shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g004">Figure 4F</xref>, dynein disruption significantly slowed RNA mobility in Region 1, but had no effect on mobility in Region 3. These results suggest that dynein is required to move RNA out of the cup region towards the vegetal cortex and further indicate that RNA movement in the lower vegetal cytoplasm does not depend on dynein.</p>

         <title>Distinct Regions of Transport Directionality Are Controlled by Dynein and Kinesin-1</title>
         <p>Directionality is crucial to understanding the mechanisms controlling asymmetric RNA transport, and roles for motors that move in opposing directions on microtubules complicate this issue. We have previously described a subpopulation of microtubules, present at the vegetal pole during mid-oogenesis, which are oriented with plus ends at the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>. This subpopulation is superimposed over a microtubule network present throughout the oocyte cytoplasm, which is oriented with minus ends toward the cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Pfeiffer1">[21]</xref>. Thus, microtubules are polarized with plus ends at the nucleus and minus ends pointed toward the cortex in the upper vegetal cytoplasm, while in the lower vegetal cytoplasm the microtubule array is mixed, with microtubules oriented in both directions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>. To test whether transport directionality differs between these regions, we extended our live imaging system by incorporating a photoactivatable form of mCherry (PA-mCh-MCP), which is nonfluorescent until laser stimulation <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Subach1">[40]</xref>. Activation of the fluorophore, bound to VLE-MS2 RNA, in specific regions of the oocyte allows RNP transport directionality to be tracked in defined regions of the cytoplasm. Expressed in vivo, PA-mCh-MCP was nonfluorescent (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5A</xref>, t = 0) until after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5A</xref>′, t = 7 s). To discern any potential asymmetry in transport, we tracked RNA movement at time points after activation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5A</xref>′–A′″) by measuring the fluorescence in four collection quadrants—left (L), right (R), animal (A), and vegetal (V)—surrounding the activation point (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5A</xref>′″, white circles). After activation in Region 2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5B</xref>), fluorescence intensity increases in the vegetal collection quadrant (black line), while fluorescence in the animal quadrant (gray line) remains relatively constant. By contrast, fluorescence intensities increase in both the animal and vegetal collection quadrants after activation in Region 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5C</xref>). Control experiments show that for oocytes injected with nonlocalizing β-globin RNA (βG-MS2), fluorescence intensity decreases after activation (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s006">Figure S6A</xref>), consistent with diffusive movement. To determine whether VLE RNA movement (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5A–C</xref>) might represent active transport on microtubules, we disrupted microtubules by treatment with nocodazole in oocytes injected with VLE-MS2 RNA. In both the upper (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s006">Figure S6B</xref>) and lower (not shown) vegetal cytoplasm, fluorescence intensity decreased rapidly upon activation following microtubule disruption and was similar to results observed in the animal hemisphere cytoplasm (Region 4, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s006">Figure S6C</xref>). Thus, only diffusive movement is apparent after microtubule disruption, suggesting that RNA movement in the vegetal cytoplasm results from active transport on microtubules. To quantify transport directionality in the AV axis, we determined the ratio of intensities in the V versus A collection quadrants over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5D,E</xref>). V∶A ratios at or near 1 indicate no bias in transport directionality, while values greater than 1 represent vegetally directed transport. After activation in the upper vegetal cytoplasm (Region 2, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5D</xref>), the V/A quadrant signal intensity (blue) increases over time, indicating directional transport toward the vegetal pole; no bias in left-right transport (red) is detectable. Averaged V/A intensities after 8 min of RNA transport (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s007">Figure S7A</xref>) demonstrate significant bias in vegetal (64%) versus animal (36%) quadrant signal, again supporting directed vegetal transport in Region 2. By contrast, activation in the lower vegetal cytoplasm (Region 3) exhibits no trend in either direction over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figure 5E</xref>), and no bias between vegetal and animal transport (47% vegetal quadrant signal versus 53% animal quadrant signal; <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s007">Figure S7B</xref>), suggesting bidirectional transport in Region 3.</p>

         <p>Our photoactivation experiments suggest a directional bias to transport in the upper vegetal cytoplasm and bidirectional transport in the lower vegetal cytoplasm. However, the lack of directional bias in the lower vegetal cytoplasm could alternatively be due to no movement of the RNA in that region. To address this issue, we quantified the motile fraction of the RNA population by identifying and tracking profiles of fluorescence intensity during RNA transport at 5 µm and 15 µm from the site of photoactivation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6A,B</xref>). In agreement with the FRAP results (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g004">Figure 4</xref>), which suggested that the majority of VLE RNA was not moving rapidly in the vegetal cytoplasm, we find (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6C</xref>) that only ∼3–5% of the RNA is moving in either region of the vegetal cytoplasm during the ∼1-min time frame between t<sub>1</sub> and t<sub>2</sub> (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6B</xref>). Importantly, only vegetally directed movement is detected in the upper vegetal cytoplasm, while in the lower vegetal cytoplasm, VLE RNA is moving in both directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6C</xref>). We do not observe a significant fraction of RNA to be moving in the left or right direction in either Region 2 or 3 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6C</xref>), nor any directional bias in left/right RNA distribution in any region (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s007">Figure S7</xref>). Tracking the fluorescence intensity profiles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6B</xref>) also enabled us to determine net transport rates in specific regions of the vegetal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). In the upper vegetal cytoplasm, net RNA movement (at ∼0.3 µm/s) is observed only toward the vegetal cortex, while in the lower vegetal cytoplasm RNA movement is at similar rates in both animal and vegetal directions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">Figure 6D</xref>). Taken together, our live cell imaging results support a model for vegetal RNA transport in which kinesin-dependent transport in the lower vegetal cytoplasm is bidirectional, while dynein-dependent transport in the upper vegetal cytoplasm is strongly biased toward the vegetal cortex.</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Although molecular motors are known to play important roles in RNA transport, ordering individual steps into a coherent pathway within a single cell has been a major challenge. We have uncovered surprising complexity in the RNA transport pathway that brings RNAs critical for germ layer patterning to the vegetal cortex of the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte. Rather than a single type of motor driving RNA transport in a single direction, we find that distinct motors direct vegetal transport in defined domains of the oocyte cytoplasm. Specifically, the minus-end-directed motor dynein is responsible for RNA transport in the upper vegetal cytoplasm, while transport in the lower vegetal cytoplasm relies on plus-end directed kinesin motors. The complementary phenotypes we obtained upon dynein and kinesin-1 disruption indicate roles for these motors in distinct transport steps, and the predominance of the dynein phenotype upon simultaneous disruption of both motors (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g003">Figure 3E</xref>) demonstrates that dynein functions upstream of kinesin in the transport pathway. Although dynein does not function in transport of Vg1 mRNA in the lower vegetal cytoplasm, as evidenced by FRAP experiments showing that dynein disruption does not affect RNA mobility in that region (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g004">Figure 4F</xref>), we propose that dynein remains part of the Vg1 mRNP as dynein is colocalized with VLE RNA in the lower vegetal cytoplasm and at the oocyte cortex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1F</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s008">Figure S8</xref>). It is possible that dynein also plays an indirect role here by recruiting kinesin motors to the Vg1 RNP, or by localizing the motors themselves. Further, in light of reports that dynein can transition from motor activity to function as a stable anchor for localized RNAs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Delanoue1">[41]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Delanoue2">[42]</xref>, dynein may play a similar role in vegetal RNA localization. The molecular mechanism of the association of dynein with localized RNA is also intriguing. Dynein is able to associate with the Vg1 mRNP after disruption of the dynactin complex (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g002">Figure 2D,E</xref>), although transport of Vg1 mRNA by dynein is dependent on dynactin (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g001">Figure 1A–D</xref>). This suggests that dynactin is required in this system for motor activity but not for mRNA cargo selection, in agreement with several recent studies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Dienstbier1">[28]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Tan1">[31]</xref>. As has been proposed for transport of RNAs by dynein in the <italic>Drosophila</italic> embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Dienstbier1">[28]</xref>, RNA binding proteins could mediate a direct interaction between Vg1 mRNA and the dynein motor.</p>
      <p>Our live imaging experiments reveal distinct kinetics and directionality for RNA transport in different regions of a single cell. For the first time in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte, we have been able to measure rates of RNA transport. Although quantification of transport rates for RNP particles is available in a number of systems (for example, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Bullock2">[14]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Zimyanin1">[19]</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Fusco1">[39]</xref>), the transport rates we have determined provide new information, as it is the net transport of an RNA population that determines how quickly a localized RNA is restricted at its destination. Vg1 mRNA localization takes a surprisingly long time; injected RNA is first enriched in the perinuclear cup region within a few hours (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s002">Figure S2A</xref>), but takes more than 24 h to become fully localized to the vegetal cortex, a distance of ∼100 µm (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.1001551.s002">Figure S2C</xref>). Why does this take so long? Our results suggest two possible reasons. First, we find that while the transport rates we measure (0.2–0.3 µm/s) are consistent with rates of motor-driven transport <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Goldstein1">[43]</xref>, only a small fraction (3–5%) of Vg1 mRNA in the vegetal cytoplasm is moving at any given time, while the majority remains relatively static, in association with the cytoskeleton. Resolving this traffic jam of stalled cargo will dramatically increase the time needed to complete transport of the entire RNA population. Second, transport is bidirectional near the vegetal cortex, which indicates that not all of the RNA that transported vegetally will be immediately anchored at the vegetal cortex. As depicted in our model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g007">Figure 7</xref>), this suggests that the kinesin-dependent transport step may represent a cycle that must be repeated until all the RNA is successfully anchored at the cortex.</p>

            <p>The vegetal cytoplasm is depicted, with the vegetal cortex at the bottom. The oocyte nucleus is shown in gray and the perinuclear cup is indicated in gold. (A) The oocyte microtubules are shown in black with orientation indicated by plus and minus. The proposed arrangement of microtubules is based on the appearance of a subpopulation of microtubule plus-ends at the vegetal cortex following breakdown of the mitochondrial cloud <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, which has been proposed to contain a microtubule organizing center <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Kloc1">[52]</xref>. (B) Vg1 mRNA enriched at the perinuclear cup is first transported by the dynein molecular motor in the upper vegetal cytoplasm in an initial highly directional step toward the vegetal cortex (blue). Microtubules are shown in grey. (C) Repeated cycles of bidirectional transport dependent on kinesin molecular motors occur in the lower vegetal cytoplasm (purple), until Vg1 mRNA exits the transport cycle by becoming anchored at the vegetal cortex (red).</p>

      <p>Directionality is key to achieving polarized transport, and our proposed vegetal RNA localization pathway, in which dynein-dependent transport in the upper vegetal cytoplasm precedes kinesin-dependent transport in the lower vegetal cytoplasm, raises important questions regarding directionality given the previously described mixed microtubule polarity in the lower vegetal cytoplasm (<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g007">Figure 7A</xref>). Our experiments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g005">Figures 5</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g006">6</xref>) reveal domains of RNA transport directionality under control of distinct molecular motors. These results contrast with a recent study of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA localization in <italic>Drosophila</italic> oocytes, in which dynein-dependent deposition of <italic>oskar</italic> mRNA from the accessory nurse cells into the oocyte precedes kinesin transport to the posterior on a weakly polarized cytoskeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Zimyanin1">[19]</xref>. While we have placed dynein and kinesin in a similar order in Vg1 transport, our work demonstrates a requirement for both motors in sequential transport steps within a single cell, the oocyte. We have shown that in the <italic>Xenopus</italic> oocyte, kinesin-dependent transport in the lower vegetal cytoplasm traffics on microtubules with plus-ends both away from and toward the vegetal cortex <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Messitt1">[12]</xref>, although we cannot rule out a slight bias in transport in either direction. Most importantly, transport in the upper vegetal cytoplasm of the oocyte requires dynein and is strongly biased toward the vegetal cortex, providing a directional cue for vegetal transport. We propose (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio-1001551-g007">Figure 7</xref>) that, after motor-independent accumulation in the perinuclear cup region, unidirectional dynein-based transport funnels RNA toward the vegetal cortex. Although kinesin transports RNA on a bidirectional array of microtubules near the vegetal cortex, RNA that reaches the cortex has the potential to be captured and stably anchored. RNA that is not anchored can be transported back toward the animal hemisphere, but once it reaches the upper vegetal cytoplasm, the RNA will again be funneled toward the cortex. This keeps the RNA out of the animal hemisphere cytoplasm, where its expression is deleterious to the embryo <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.1001551-Thomsen1">[8]</xref>, and after multiple iterations should result in complete localization of the RNA at the vegetal cortex. Such a multistep pathway, relying on the sequential action of motors with opposing polarities, can serve to refine the ultimate distribution of the cargo. It is likely that this new model for the establishment of directional cargo transport may be broadly applicable to polarized transport mechanisms in other cells and systems.</p>
