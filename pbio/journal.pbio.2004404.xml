<abstract>
<p>Directional mechanoreception by hair cells is transmitted to the brain via afferent neurons to enable postural control and rheotaxis. Neuronal tuning to individual directions of mechanical flow occurs when each peripheral axon selectively synapses with multiple hair cells of identical planar polarization. How such mechanosensory labeled lines are established and maintained remains unsolved. Here, we use the zebrafish lateral line to reveal that asymmetric activity of the transcription factor Emx2 diversifies hair cell identity to instruct polarity-selective synaptogenesis. Unexpectedly, presynaptic scaffolds and coherent hair cell orientation are dispensable for synaptic selectivity, indicating that epithelial planar polarity and synaptic partner matching are separable. Moreover, regenerating axons recapitulate synapses with hair cells according to Emx2 expression but not global orientation. Our results identify a simple cellular algorithm that solves the selectivity task even in the presence of noise generated by the frequent receptor cell turnover. They also suggest that coupling connectivity patterns to cellular identity rather than polarity relaxes developmental and evolutionary constraints to innervation of organs with differing orientation.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>Mechanosensory systems are essential for maintaining posture, gaze, and body orientation during locomotion. Such stability requires a coherent representation in the brain of the location and movement of mechanical stimuli. In fishes, mechanical stimuli at a given position activate direction-sensitive receptors called hair cells that are oriented with polarized directionality. These hair cells stimulate neurons that selectively connect with them based on polarity. We have addressed how neurons target hair cells based on polarity during development of the mechanosensory lateral line system in zebrafish. We show that neurons selectively connect based on the expression pattern of the transcription factor Emx2 in hair cells. We find that the lateral line can maintain directionality after damage and regeneration. Our data suggest a cellular mechanism that controls the formation, maintenance, and regeneration of labeled lines to enable directional mechanosensation.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Two of the most highly conserved sensory-neural maps in vertebrates are those underlying postural control during locomotion and rheotaxis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref001">1</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref008">8</xref>]. These sensory-motor processes originate from the action of mechanoreceptive hair cells residing, respectively, in the inner ear and in the lateral line [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref016">16</xref>]. Mechanosensitive ion channels in hair cells open or close according to the direction of deflection of the cells’ apical hair bundle [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref004">4</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref017">17</xref>]. Consequently, the planar orientation of the hair bundles endows the sensory epithelium with directional excitability. The mammalian ear contains 3 vestibular receptive organs—the semicircular canals that detect angular shifts of head position, the sacculus that senses vertical movements, and the utricle that detects horizontal movements [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref018">18</xref>]. Utricular and saccular hair cells are divided into 2 groups of opposing hair bundle orientation, each situated across a line of polarity reversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref020">20</xref>]. Similarly, the superficial lateral line in fishes senses velocity fields in the surrounding water [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref003">3</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref006">6</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref007">7</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref013">13</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref015">15</xref>]. This system is formed by a collection of discrete mechanosensory organs called neuromasts, which are distributed across the body of the animal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref011">11</xref>]. In zebrafish, each neuromast contains 16 to 20 mechanoreceptive hair cells that occur in 2 equally numbered populations with opposite planar polarity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref021">21</xref>]. However, unlike the utricular and saccular epithelia, hair cells of both polarities intermingle in each neuromast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g001">Fig 1A and 1B</xref>).</p>

Hair cell orientation is indicated by an eccentric black dot. In panel B, blue hair cells are rcHCs and green are crHCs. Grey indicates a pair of newborn hair cells whose polarity is not yet evident.

(D) Simplified scheme of the selective innervation of rcHCs (light blue) by rcLANs (blue) and crHCs (green) by crLANs (red). Polarity-selective synaptogenesis renders LANs tuned to the direction of mechanical stimulation of HCs, and form labeled lines of mechanosensory flow from the periphery to the brain. Each cell is meant to represent the entire population of identically oriented HCs in the neuromast and identically tuned LANs.

<p>In addition to this local epithelial polarity, the global orientation of the hair cells varies according to the position of the neuromast. For example, the posterior lateral line of larval zebrafish contains neuromasts whose axis of planar polarity is oriented either parallel (horizontal neuromasts) or perpendicular (vertical neuromasts) to the anteroposterior body axis (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g001">Fig 1C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref021">21</xref>]. Horizontal neuromasts, therefore, are formed by hair cells that are activated by water flowing in the rostrocaudal direction (rcHCs) and by hair cells of caudorostral directional tuning (crHCs) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). Each branch of the lateral line in larval zebrafish contains around 60 bipolar lateralis afferent neurons (LANs) that are postsynaptic to the hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g001">Fig 1C–1E</xref>). Typically, each neuromast is innervated by the peripheral axons of 4 LANs, but each axon exclusively synapses with hair cells of identical planar polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g001">Fig 1D–1G</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref023">23</xref>]. Because the transmission content of a sensory neuron is determined by all the inputs that it receives [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref024">24</xref>], planar-polarity–selective connectivity renders each LAN tuned to a single direction of mechanical stimulation to form a labeled-line sensory pathway from the periphery to the brain (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g001">Fig 1C and 1D</xref>).</p>
<p>How planar-polarity–selective synapses are established remains unknown [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref005">5</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref025">25</xref>]. Understanding this process is important because it will reveal the basic rules that direct the development of neural circuits that enable directional mechanosensation, as well as how they are maintained despite continuous turnover of receptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref026">26</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref031">31</xref>]. Previous work has led to two models to explain polarity-selective synaptic connectivity in the lateral line. The biased-selector model suggests that synaptogenesis is inherently promiscuous and that selectivity occurs by the continuous rectification of mismatched synapses through a biased interaction between hair cells and the axonal population [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>]. By contrast, the scaffold model presents constitutive basal projections from the hair cells as short-range processes that provide instructive polarity-specific scaffolds to the axons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref033">33</xref>]. This idea is attractive in its simplicity, but it is based exclusively on phenomenological descriptions that have not been experimentally tested. Although both models are consistent with most results, they do not satisfy some observations. For example, the biased-selector model is difficult to reconcile with the invariable ratio of half of the LANs innervating every identically polarized hair cell. Conversely, the scaffold model cannot explain the loss of selectivity by solitary axons. Furthermore, two model-independent basic aspects of the selectivity mechanism remain unsolved: first, whether synaptic connectivity is defined locally in each neuromast independently of its global orientation and second, whether axons synapse with hair cells of identical polarity regardless of their local orientation (synaptic fidelity) or with hair cells of a specific orientation (synaptic partner matching). This distinction is important because the rules underlying fidelity (stochastic) and partner matching (deterministic) are likely to be mechanistically different.</p>

<p>We first confirmed previous findings that only immature hair cells produce basal projections, up to 15 hours after they are born (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref033">33</xref>]. Synaptic connections between LANs and hair cells correlate with the stable juxtaposition of presynaptic puncta containing the active-zone constituent protein Ribeye and postsynaptic neurites (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g002">Fig 2C</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref034">34</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref036">36</xref>]. Next, we assessed synapses by individualized axons marked by mosaic expression of the red fluorescent protein mCherry in single LANs, in transgenic embryos co-expressing beta1-actin-enhanced green fluorescent protein (EGFP) and ctbp2a(Ribeye)-Kusabira in every hair cell (<italic>Tg[myo6b</italic>:<italic>actb1-EGFP; pou4f3</italic>:<italic>ctbp2l-mKOFP]</italic>) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g002">Fig 2D–2G’”</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004404.s001">S1 Video</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref026">26</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref037">37</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref038">38</xref>]. In less than one-half of the hair cells that were analyzed (<italic>N</italic> = 40), basal projections and axonal terminals physically interacted (16/40), but only a small minority of these interactions resulted in stable synapses (3/16). Moreover, although Ribeye(+) puncta were readily evident in hair cells (arrows in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g002">Fig 2D–2E’”</xref>), we could never detect them in basal projections (<italic>N</italic> = 31) (arrowheads in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g002">Fig 2D–2E’”</xref>, and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2004404.s001">S1 Video</xref>). These observations suggest that apposition of presynaptic projections and postsynaptic neurites correlates poorly with synaptic stabilization but does not rule out a function of these projections in synaptic selectivity. To test this possibility, we assayed synaptogenesis by regenerating axons. To this end, we severed axons using an ultraviolet laser delivered through the imaging objective (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g002">Fig 2H–2K</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref039">39</xref>].

<title>Regenerating axons recreate synaptic partnership</title>
<p>During the course of the previous experiments, we made the surprising discovery that regenerating axons nearly always re-innervate hair cells not only of identical but also of the original planar orientation, recapitulating neuronal directional tuning (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3I</xref>, right bar). In most of these cases, when axons were cut immediately below the neuromast, they also re-innervated the original neuromast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, right bar). Thus, we hypothesized that a potential memory of previous connectivity could rely on 2 possible sources of information: a cell-autonomous molecular code, or a nonautonomous cue that may include the neuronal extracellular basal lamina that remains around preexisting hair cells. Such nonautonomous blueprint of previous connectivity is reminiscent of the neuronal extracellular matrix that directs the repair of mammalian neuromuscular junctions after nerve crush and that is found in the piscine electric organs [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref041">41</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref042">42</xref>]. To test this possibility, we cut axons and, subsequently, killed hair cells pharmacologically by incubating specimens in a solution of neomycin, which eliminates local sources of information about previous synapses. Yet this manipulation did not alter the recovery of LAN directional tuning after the concurrent regeneration of axons and hair cells (<italic>N</italic> = 8) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3K–3N</xref>). In a separate set of experiments, when axons were cut furthest from the neuromasts (near the lateralis ganglion), they often did not re-innervate the original neuromast (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3J</xref>, left bar). Nevertheless, these axons formed selective synapses with identical-oriented hair cells in new neuromasts and almost always with those whose orientation was the same as the original (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3I</xref>, left bar). Moreover, we found a remarkable correlation between horizontal and vertical neuromasts in that, when regenerating axons that originally innervated crHCs in horizontal neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3O–3Q</xref>) innervated a vertical neuromast, they always synapsed with ventrodorsal hair cells (vdHCs) (<italic>N</italic> = 4) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3O, 3O”, 3R and 3S</xref>). Conversely, rcHC-innervating LANs switched to re-innervate dorsoventral hair cells (dvHCs) in vertical neuromasts after regeneration (<italic>N</italic> = 3). Put together, these data reveal that LANs consistently recognize hair cells of identical polarity and of a specific orientation. These results are important because they suggest that hair cells of either orientation must have distinct marks that can be recognized by the axons during development and regeneration.</p>

<title>Synaptic partnership occurs independently of coherent epithelial planar polarity</title>
<p>It has been shown that planar-polarity–selective synapses occur independently of evoked activity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>]. Therefore, we hypothesized that a cell-autonomous molecular cue differentiates hair cells of either orientation in each neuromast and identifies as “same” the horizontal rcHCs and vertical dvHCs, as well as the crHCs and vdHCs. While considering this possibility, we noted a previous study in mice showing that a mutation in the transcription factor Emx2 eliminates the line of hair cell polarity reversal in the utricular and saccular maculae without affecting coherent hair cell orientation, and that Emx2 is exclusively expressed on one side of this line in wild-type animals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref043">43</xref>]. A more recent report revealed that gain- and loss-of-function of Emx2 is sufficient to instruct hair cell orientation along a conserved planar polarity axis in zebrafish neuromasts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref044">44</xref>]. These observations raise the possibility that Emx2 is part of a code underlying polarity-selective synaptogenesis. To test this hypothesis, we used a previously validated antibody to Emx2 to immunostain <italic>Tg[myo6b</italic>:<italic>actb1-EGFP]</italic> transgenic fish bearing individually labeled neurons. We first corroborated that Emx2-positive hair cells in wild-type fish were always rcHC and dvHC orientation, respectively, in horizontal and vertical neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g004">Fig 4A–4H</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref044">44</xref>].</p>

<p>We reasoned that, if planar polarity and polarity-selective synaptogenesis are functionally linked, loss of coherent hair cell orientation will either induce neurons to innervate all, none, or random numbers of hair cells or to affect synaptic stability. First, we performed immunostaining for Emx2 in Vangl2 mutants and saw that, similarly to the wild type, approximately half of the hair cells in neuromasts were Emx2(+), indicating that neither the core planar-polarity pathway nor coherent hair cell orientation determine the expression pattern of Emx2 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5C–5E</xref>). Second, we quantified hair cell innervation in Vangl2 mutants and found that, as in wild-type specimens, selective innervation correlated with Emx2 expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5F–5K</xref>) and that approximately half of the hair cell population was stably innervated by each axon (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5L–5O</xref>). Together, these data reveal that Emx2 expression correlates with synaptic partnership and, crucially, that selective synaptogenesis is separable from coherent planar polarity.</p>

<title>Synaptic partnership is determined by Emx2</title>
<p>To test the function of Emx2 in synaptic partnership, we used clustered regularly interspaced short palindromic repeats/CRISPR-associated protein 9 (CRISPR/Cas9)-mediated genome editing to mutate Emx2. Specifically, to facilitate this analysis by live imaging in zebrafish carrying multiple transgenes, we used the CRISPant approach for somatic mutagenesis [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref047">47</xref>] [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref048">48</xref>]. We first corroborated that Emx2 loss-of-function renders nearly every hair cell identically oriented, always dorsally in vertical neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5P</xref>) and rostrally in horizontal neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5Q</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref044">44</xref>]. Second, we found that in Emx2-deficient animals, individually marked axons synapsed with nearly every hair cell in neuromasts (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5L and 5R–5T</xref>) or with a small minority to none (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5L and 5U–5W</xref>). Some specimens presented partial expressivity of the Emx2 mutant phenotype, with neuromasts bearing a majority of hair cells oriented in one direction and a small minority in the opposite. Yet in these cases, individually marked axons also synapsed exclusively with hair cells of identical orientation regardless of their absolute or relative number (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g005">Fig 5L</xref>). These results reveal that loss of Emx2 homogenizes hair cell orientation without altering the ability of axons to recognize identically oriented hair cells and, importantly, that the Emx2 expression status in hair cells determines whether they will be innervated by a specific axon.</p>

<p>The piscine lateral line is a prime example of a neural system that represents in the brain the entire mechanosensory scene as vectorial signals from multiple peripheral receptors [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref002">2</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref009">9</xref>]. Therefore, it is ideally suited to unravel how neuronal tuning to mechanical-flow direction is established during development and maintained in the face of synaptic instability driven by constant receptor cell turnover. Here, we uncover a simple partner-recognition mechanism that governs the strict innervation of identically plane-polarized hair cells by afferent neurons. The underlying process is robust to environmental perturbations, enabling the maintenance of labeled lines of directional mechanosensory flow in a system that undergoes frequent and life-long renewal of receptor cells. Below, we illustrate this mechanism and discuss the supporting evidence.</p>
<sec id="sec008">
<title>Hair cell projections are dispensable for synaptic selectivity</title>
<p>Similarly to the mammalian utricular and saccular maculae, the hair cells in piscine neuromasts are divided into 2 populations with opposing planar orientation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref011">11</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref021">21</xref>]. Utricular and saccular afferent neurons do not co-innervate hair cells across the line of polarity reversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref049">49</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref051">51</xref>]. Identical observations have been made in the vestibular apparatus of amphibians [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref051">51</xref>] and birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref052">52</xref>]. Several studies have revealed that the afferent neuronal pathway of the lateral line is organized in a similar manner [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref008">8</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref033">33</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref052">52</xref>]. This is remarkable given the absence of anatomical compartmentalization of epithelial planar polarity in neuromasts. To shed light on the synaptic selectivity mechanisms, we experimentally tested the scaffold model. We show that hair cell basal projections are dispensable for polarity-selective innervation, suggesting that they act as haptotactic cues that facilitate or accelerate the innervation of nascent hair cells in a nonselective manner, possibly by increasing the cell’s surface area during the search-and-find period that precedes synaptic maturation [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref022">22</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref053">53</xref>].</p>

<sec id="sec009">
<title>Planar polarity and synaptic selectivity are separable</title>
<p>The above results raise 4 interwoven questions. What is the source of the selectivity cues? Do selectivity cues act locally in each neuromast or globally along the entire lateral line system? Does a synaptic selectivity code exist? If so, what is its identity? We investigated whether planar polarity per se represents a selectivity cue by using mutant zebrafish lacking the core planar-polarity component Vangl2, in which hair cells assume random orientations. We reasoned that if coherent planar polarity instructed selectivity, its loss would randomize or destabilize synapses. In <italic>Vangl2−/−</italic> animals, connectivity patterns are stable and nonrandom because, as in wild-type specimens, each LAN axon synapses with one-half of the hair cells. Furthermore, our analysis of de novo synaptogenesis by regenerating axons shows a remarkable robustness in the lateral line system in that axons invariably re-innervate hair cells of the same orientation as their original. This remains true even when regenerating axons target a neuromast different from the original. We also found a near-perfect correlation of synaptogenesis when regenerating axons re-innervate neuromasts of differing global orientation because LANs that innervate rcHCs in horizontal neuromasts synapse with dvHCs when switching to innervate vertical neuromasts. Together, these results demonstrate that synaptic selectivity is separable from the local and global orientation of the hair cells and that it is determined independently in each neuromast. It is tempting to extrapolate these results to mammals to explain the puzzling observation that, while the core planar-polarity proteins Frizzled6 and Prikle-like2 distribute identically in the entire epithelium of the sacculus and the utricle, neurons never co-innervate hair cells across the line of polarity reversal [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref019">19</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref051">51</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref054">54</xref>]. Therefore, it is likely that both in the mammalian inner ear and in the piscine lateral line, planar polarity per se does not determine polarity-selective synaptogenesis. Assessing hair cell innervation in the vestibular system of Vangl2 mutant mice may directly test the likelihood of such evolutionary conservation.</p>

<sec id="sec010">
<title>Emx2 governs the formation and homeostasis of synaptic partnership</title>
<p>The above results suggest the existence of a label that identifies as same caudal-oriented and ventral-oriented hair cells, as well as rostral- and dorsal-oriented cells. They also indicate that the process of planar-polarity–selective synaptogenesis can be framed as a problem of synaptic partner matching rather than of synaptic fidelity. The transcription factor Emx2 is expressed in half of the hair cells in each neuromast and correlates with their global orientation in that Emx2 is exclusively expressed in rcHCs and dvHCs. We found that Emx2 expression patterns are not affected by the loss of coherent planar polarity and that axons make strict connections according to the hair cells’ Emx2 expression status, even when they are not coherently oriented. Moreover, we show that loss of Emx2 affects hair cell innervation in a predictable manner because it enables some axons to synapse with nearly every hair cell in the neuromast while remaining selective as well as simultaneously prevents other axons from making any synapse. These findings demonstrate that Emx2 establishes an identity code for synaptic partners and represents the link between planar polarity and synaptic selectivity. It transpires that there must be differences between the neurons that innervate each hair cell polarity class because, if neurons were identical, regenerating axons should not be able to regain directional tuning by recognizing previous partners or re-innervate matching populations of hair cells when switching from horizontal to vertical neuromasts. Although we currently lack the tools to directly test this hypothesis, we believe that it is likely given some evidence from the mouse, in which a common pool of Neurogenin-1(+) neuronal progenitors produces auditory afferent neurons with segregated connectivity in the inner ear [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref055">55</xref>].</p>
<p>We wonder how a transcription factor may mediate polarity-selective synaptic connectivity. Genetic perturbation experiments indicate that Emx2 does not control local or global planar polarity because the global axis of polarization of the hair cells is not altered in the inner ear of mice and in neuromasts of zebrafish lacking Emx2. Instead, we interpret the collective data as suggesting that Emx2 instruct hair cell identity, which in turn enables cells to implement the global polarity cue in one of the two possible directions. One possibility is that Emx2-dependent expression of high-affinity complementary transmembrane proteins determines synaptic partnership between matching subpopulations of LANs and hair cells. This will enable neurons to recognize synaptic partners locally and independently of their relative of absolute number and to regain directional tuning after recovery from injury. It also explains how individual neurons synapse with hair cells of differing global orientation when they co-innervate multiple neuromasts during the expansion of the lateral line in juvenile and adult zebrafish [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref057">57</xref>]. This can occur because synaptic partnership is controlled locally by Emx2, independently of the specific orientation of the hair cells. Taken together, our data strongly support the conclusion that Emx2 establishes an identity code that governs synaptic partnership between hair cells and afferent neurons.</p>

<title>A wiring algorithm controlling synaptic partnership</title>
<p>How may the rules governing synaptic partner choice be implemented? In other words, what is the underlying wiring algorithm [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref058">58</xref>]? Our data suggest a simple structure for the interaction among synaptic partners that can explain the development of planar-polarity–selective synapses, the regeneration of neuronal directional tuning, and the long-term maintenance of labeled lines of directional mechanosensation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

Right, schematic description of interactions between cells. (B) Scheme of the constituent cells. (C) Scheme of a situation of a chronically solitary axon, which becomes nonselective because the absence of the converse synapses eliminate the repulsive signals.

Jagged arrow (purple) indicates axon damage. (E) Situation of axon damage and regeneration. Initially during regeneration, axons explore the presynaptic field and transiently interact with hair cells, but eventually the wiring algorithm is recreated following the same rules controlling selectivity during circuit development. (F) Situation of hair cell loss and regeneration. Initially during hair cell regeneration, axons explore the presynaptic field and transiently interact with hair cells, but once hair cells mature, the wiring algorithm is recreated following the same rules controlling selectivity during circuit development. (G) Situation of homogeneously oriented hair cell upon loss of Emx2 activity. The wiring algorithm becomes asymmetric, directing one axonal population to synapses with every hair cell and inhibiting the other axons from establishing any synapse. (H) Situation of misoriented hair cell upon loss of Vangl2. The wiring algorithm remains normal because it operates independently of coherent planar polarity. Therefore, synaptic selectivity for Emx2(+) and Emx2(-) hair cells occurs normally. crHC, caudorostral HC; crLAN, caudorostral LAN; HC, hair cell; LAN, lateralis afferent neuron; rcHC, rostrocaudal HC; rcLAN, rostrocaudal LAN; Vangl2, van gogh-like 2.</p>

<p>Crucially, it also unifies all previous results leading to the biased-selector and the scaffold models [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref033">33</xref>]. The components of the selectivity process are 2 subpopulations of hair cells and t2wo subpopulations of LANs (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). In hair cells, this assumption is supported by polarity-associated expression of Emx2 as well as Tmc2b [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref059">59</xref>]. Hair cells attract axons nonselectively [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>]. However, the Emx2 expression status in hair cells determines the outcome of this attraction because synapses will preferentially form when the appropriate axonal subclass contacts hair cells in an Emx2-matching manner. Once formed, stable synapses repulse incorrect partnerships (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6A</xref>). This explains the promiscuous synaptogenesis by solitary axons, which become doubly tuned because the absence of other axons prevents the formation of the converse correct synapses, eliminating the repulsive signals (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6C</xref>). A combination of attractive and repulsive signals also explains the recovery of selectivity by the reintroduction of additional axons, which reestablish synapses with the correct partners based on Emx2 expression status, regenerating the repulsive signal that eventually pushes the promiscuous solitary axon to exclusively synapse with hair cells of identical polarity (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6D</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>].</p>
<p>Previous work has shown that chronic loss of hair cell innervation does not affect epithelial planar polarity in neuromasts. This has led to the prediction that innervation does not determine Emx2 expression patterns, which we have now confirmed experimentally. This explains how regenerating axons are able to synapse with the original hair cells (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6E</xref>). It occurs because Emx2 expression in denervated hair cells does not change, thus serving as an indelible mark of previous partnership. Our model also explains the recovery of selectivity and neuronal directional tuning after hair cell death and regeneration because the system continuously self-organizes by reenacting the developmental program that assigns different identities to sibling hair cells, in turn determining the likelihood of synaptic stabilization of specific axons (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6F</xref>). Upon loss of Emx2, the entire hair cell population becomes homogeneously oriented [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref044">44</xref>]. In this case, the architecture of the wiring algorithm becomes asymmetric, directing one axonal population to synapses with every hair cell and inhibiting the other axonal population from establishing any synapse (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6G</xref>). Furthermore, because loss of mechanoreception does not affect hair cell planar polarity, hair cell activity cannot affect Emx2 expression, explaining why synaptic selectivity is normal in fish with nonfunctional hair cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref023">23</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>]. Finally, selective synaptogenesis is maintained in the absence of coherent epithelial planar polarity because Emx2 remains expressed in half of the hair cells in Vangl2 mutants (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6H</xref>), and thus the architecture of the algorithm remains intact (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g006">Fig 6A</xref>).</p>

<title>Conclusion</title>
<p>Three questions in mechanosensory biology are the current focus of intense attention. First, what is the mechanism that establishes the connectivity patterns between distinct mechanoreceptors and ascending afferent neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref060">60</xref>]? Second, how are the resulting labeled lines of directional mechanosensation maintained in the face of continuous turnover of receptor cells [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref001">1</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref032">32</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref060">60</xref>]? Third, how much has the anatomical blueprint for directional mechanosensation diverged during the 600 million years of evolution since hair cell–based mechanosensation appeared in the common ancestor of agnathans and mammals [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref050">50</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref054">54</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref061">61</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref062">62</xref>]? We found that selective connectivity between LANs and hair cells of identical orientation occurs independently of presynaptic projections and that it is separable from the coherent planar polarity and global orientation of the hair cells. We demonstrate a wiring algorithm that locally disambiguates hair cell identity, links identity to orientation, and establishes the synaptic partnership rules that generate neuronal directional tuning. Despite its simplicity, this algorithm readily solves the selectivity task even in the presence of constant noise generated by frequent death and regeneration of hair cells, and independently of scale differences between the receptive organ and the neuronal population. It also operates robustly upon evolutionary changes in epithelial polarity, or when neurons co-innervate organs with differing global orientation, which naturally occurs during the expansion of the lateral line that accompanies animal growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref056">56</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2004404.ref057">57</xref>]. The striking similarities between the zebrafish lateral line and the mammalian vestibular apparatus, including their dependence on Emx2 for hair cell orientation, suggest that the wiring mechanism that we have unveiled may be ancient and conserved across vertebrates.</p>

They were positioned using a hair loop under light from a xenon arc lamp passed through the appropriate filters to reveal green or red fluorescence. Axon severing wad done using a computer-controlled iLas-Pulse laser system (Roper Scientific SAS, Evry, France) consisting of a pulsed ultraviolet laser (355 nm; 400 ps/2.5 μJ per pulse).

To sever axons, a region of interest (ROI) was drawn over the nerve, and a train of laser pulses was repeatedly applied until all fluorescence disappeared within the ROI. After severing, the axons were observed repeatedly to evaluate the success of the cuts. Subsequently, specimens were removed from the agarose and left to recover in fresh E3 embryo medium in individual Petri dishes.

<title>Determination of synapses in a horizontal neuromast by individualized axon before severing.</title>
<p>This video is a Z-stack used to generate panel P–P’ of <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3</xref> and shows an example of the innervation of mature hair cells expressing EGFP (green) by an axon marked by mosaic expression of mCherry (red). Red dots indicate the synapsed hair cells, whose planar polarization is evident in the most apical aspect of the epithelium (beginning of the video), revealing their caudorostral orientation (as depicted in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2004404.g003">Fig 3Q</xref>). Yellow arrows indicate synaptic contacts as bulged axon endings. EGFP, enhanced green fluorescent protein.</p>
