<abstract>
<p>The costs and benefits of protein expression are balanced through evolution. Expression of un-utilized protein (that have no benefits in the current environment) incurs a quantifiable fitness costs on cellular growth rates; however, the magnitude and variability of un-utilized protein expression in natural settings is unknown, largely due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome utilization. We address this challenge using absolute and global proteomics data combined with a recently developed genome-scale model of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> that computes the environment-specific cost and utility of the proteome on a per gene basis. We show that nearly half of the proteome mass is unused in certain environments and accounting for the cost of this unused protein expression explains &gt;95% of the variance in growth rates of <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> across 16 distinct environments. Furthermore, reduction in unused protein expression is shown to be a common mechanism to increase cellular growth rates in adaptive evolution experiments. Classification of the unused protein reveals that the unused protein encodes several nutrient- and stress- preparedness functions, which may convey fitness benefits in varying environments. Thus, unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.</p>

<title>Author Summary</title>
<p>An overarching endeavor in systems biology is to characterize and understand the allocation of an organism’s proteome. Common approaches to characterize proteome allocation are based on annotations of protein functions or transcriptional regulatory targets. Here, we develop a novel approach based on model-predicted proteome utilization. This approach reveals that in many environments, a large fraction of the proteome is unused. Unused protein expression is known to incur costs on organismal fitness. We show that changes in the allocation of the proteome to used versus unused fractions can account for the variability in growth rates observed across environments and is a common mechanism to increase growth rates in laboratory evolution experiments. We compare our approach to classify the proteome based on model-predicted utilization to more traditional approaches to reveal biological functions and transcriptional regulators underlying the expression of unused protein. Expression of these functions may reflect ecological trade-offs between growth, nutrient-readiness, and stress resistance.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>The costs and benefits of protein synthesis on organismal fitness shape the evolution and regulation of proteome expression [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref001">1</xref>]. For microbes, the rate of cellular growth is an important component of organismal fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref002">2</xref>], and much of the microbial proteome is devoted to growth in certain environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref003">3</xref>].</p>
<p>Protein costs and benefits are often quantified by their effects on cellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref004">4</xref>]. Notably, the synthetic overexpression of unused protein results in a predictable linear reduction in growth rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref005">5</xref>]. Microbes will express some amount of unused protein in any given environment, which will reduce their growth rates [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref006">6</xref>]. However, the magnitude and variability of unused protein expression is unknown, largely due to the challenge in determining environment-specific proteome activity. Thus, we do not yet have a baseline understanding of the percentage of the microbial proteome that is un-utilized in a given environment or how much the un-utilized protein fraction can vary (or if it remains predominantly constant across environments).</p>
<p>Here, we combine a recently developed genome-scale model of proteome allocation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref007">7</xref>] with genome-scale absolute proteomics measurements to quantify proteome allocation across 16 distinct environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref008">8</xref>]. This approach allows us to enumerate the unused proteome, revealing that the unused protein fraction can vary greatly across environment. We subsequently quantify the cost of unused protein expression and characterize the processes and regulators underlying the change in unused protein expression across environments. In turn, we show that unused protein expression is the source of large and pervasive fitness costs that may provide the benefit of hedging against environmental change.</p>

<title>Defining the un-utilized and under-utilized ME proteome</title>
<p>We distinguish between two classes of unused protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The first class is the <italic>un-utilized</italic> protein. This is protein that, in the specified environment, is not utilized for cellular growth. For example, in glucose minimal media, the glycerol transporter is un-utilized, but it might be expressed. The second class of unused protein is the <italic>under-utilized</italic> protein. This is protein that is catalytically active, but is present in excess and is thus operating under its maximal capacity.</p>

<title>Unused protein abundances are not constant across environments.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Graphical illustration of the two classes of unused protein. The first class is protein that is expressed but completely un-utilized (i.e., 0% utilized) first step in lower pathway). The second class is protein that is under-utilized (i.e., &lt;100% but &gt;0% utilized; second step in upper pathway, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). The percent utilization indicated is based on the upper pathway having flux of 2, the lower pathway having flux of 0, and all enzymes having a maximal rate of 1 (see also <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). (<bold>B</bold>) The un-utilized proteome fractions for batch and chemostat culture on glucose minimal media. The un-utilized proteome fraction is a distribution rather than a specific value because of different potential alternative pathways and enzymes that can be used to support cellular growth (see main text). (<bold>C</bold>) The un-utilized proteome fraction across all profiled environments—8 different carbon source batch cultures (circles), 4 glucose-limited chemostat cultures (triangles), and 4 stress conditions (squares)—is plotted as a function of the growth rate measured in that condition. Error bars indicate 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles of the un-utilized proteome distributions for each condition (e.g. Fig 1B). The orange and green points and pie charts correspond to the environments in B of the same color. (<bold>D</bold>) Enzyme turnover rates tend to increase at higher growth rates. Changes in turnover rates indicate under-utilized protein. The mean relative turnover (across all proteins) is plotted with error bars indicating the 95% confidence interval for the mean (the full distribution is shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s001">S1 Fig</xref>).

<p>We use a genome-scale model of proteome allocation in <italic>Escherichia coli</italic>, termed a ME-Model [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref009">9</xref>] to quantify un- and under-utilized protein. The ME-Model formalizes the function and synthesis of all proteins that carry out metabolism and protein expression necessary for growth, which we refer to as the ME proteome. The ME proteome encompasses much of the proteome required for cellular growth and accounts for ~80% of the proteome by mass in conditions of exponential growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref007">7</xref>].</p>
<p>From ME-Model simulations we identify proteins that are needed for growth in a particular environment. By combining these simulations with quantitative proteomics data, we identify proteome-wide changes in both un- and under-utilized protein abundances (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). In a given environment, there are several different alternative pathways and enzymes can be used to support cellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref010">10</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref012">12</xref>]. Thus, the computed un-utilized proteome fraction needs to be assessed across all such alternate growth states; randomized sampling of the alternate network states accomplishes this and leads to a distribution of possible un-utilized proteome fractions rather than a single specific value (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s001">S1 Fig</xref>, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). To compute changes in under-utilized protein expression, we identify relative changes in protein catalytic activity across environments. As the ratio of model-predicted protein demands for biosynthesis and measured protein expression levels is proportional to <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover rates, changes in this ratio are proportional to <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover rates and are used to quantify under-utilized protein (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>).</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec004">
<title>Un-utilized and under-utilized ME proteome abundance varies across environments</title>
<p>We first compare the un-utilized proteome fraction during growth in glucose batch culture and chemostat culture. As the nutrient source is the same in these two environments, the set of proteins that can be utilized for growth in the ME-Model are identical; variation in the proteomics data will determine differences in the un-utilized proteome abundances. As the two distributions of un-utilized proteome abundance are non-overlapping, the un-utilized proteome fraction does vary significantly between these two environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1B</xref>).</p>
<p>When data from multiple growth conditions (8 different carbon sources in batch cultures, 4 glucose-limited chemostat cultures, and 4 stress conditions—acid, osmotic, temperature, and aerobicity; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>) are analyzed in a similar manner, a clear general trend emerges in which environmental conditions resulting in higher growth rates tend to have lower un-utilized proteome fractions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). This correlation suggests that un-utilized proteome fraction is an important source of growth rate variation.</p>
<p>Next we consider the under-utilized proteome under the same growth conditions by computing the variation in <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover (flux per protein; see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). We find that the abundance of the under-utilized proteome is not constant across environments; rather, the average enzyme turnover tends to increase in environments with higher growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1D</xref>). This trend has been observed for several individual proteins using lower throughput methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref014">14</xref>].</p>
<p>Thus, we find that the amount of both un-utilized protein and under-utilized protein is reduced with increasing cellular growth rate.</p>
</sec>
<sec id="sec005">
<title>Growth rate variation can be explained by unused proteome expression</title>
<p>Un-utilized proteome fraction and <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover are variables that are formalized in the ME-Model. As the ME-Model accurately predicts the growth effects of unused protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g002">Fig 2A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), setting these parameters to measured values can determine how they quantitatively affect growth rates.</p>

<title>Growth rate is determined by unused protein expression.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) To validate that the ME-Model accurately quantifies protein cost, we compare the predicted effect of un-utilized protein (β-Galactosidase) overexpression (red squares) to experimental measurements (blue circles). Experimental data is obtained from Scott et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref004">4</xref>] The x- and y- intercept from a linear regression (dotted line) is consistent with the phenomenological model of Scott et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref004">4</xref>] The effects of the un-utilized and under-utilized protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1</xref>) on growth rates are quantified in C and D. (<bold>B</bold>) Predicted growth rates are plotted versus measured growth rates during batch growth on 8 different carbon sources. Predicted growth rates are the computed maximal growth rates by the ME-Model, assuming the un-utilized proteome fraction and <italic>in vivo</italic> turnover rates are the same across all environments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>, this assumption is eliminated in panels B and C to assess the effects of un- and under-utilized protein on growth). (<bold>C</bold>) Predicted maximal growth rates are computed with the ME-Model with the un-utilized proteome fraction set to the values inferred from proteomics data (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition to the 8 carbon sources (circles), 4 glucose-limited chemostat cultures (triangles) and 4 stress conditions (squares) are also shown.

<p>As a baseline for comparison, we first predict maximum growth rates across different carbon sources with the ME-Model while holding the un-utilized proteome fraction and <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover rates constant across environments; this assumption allows us to assess the growth rate variation due to changes in carbon sources independent of changes in un- and under-utilized protein. Comparing predicted and measured growth rates across the 8 carbon sources shows that, in general, the predictions are poor. Some particular carbon sources are well predicted (e.g. glucose, fumarate, succinate) but the correlation between predicted and measured growth rates is low (Pearson’s r = 0.39); furthermore, the variation in growth rates across the experimental data is much larger than that across the computational data (s = 0.16 compared to s = 0.7; s is the sample standard deviation). Thus, there are significant contributors to growth rate variation other than the necessary changes in metabolic pathway and proteome usage when the primary carbon source for growth is varied.</p>
<p>We next sequentially assess the contribution of changes in un- and under-utilized protein to growth rate variation. In addition to the 8 carbon sources (circles), we can also assess the 4 carbon-limitation (triangles) and 4 environmental stress (squares) conditions that were proteomically profiled. In these additional environments, glucose is the carbon source, and other environmental changes affect proteome expression and growth. Accounting for un-utilized protein increases the correlation between predicted and measured growth rates to r = 0.82 and increases the predicted growth rate variance to s = 0.09. Finally, accounting for the variation in <italic>in vivo</italic> turnover rates increases the correlation to r = 0.98 and results in a predicted growth rate variance that is similar to the experimental variance (s = 0.15).</p>
<p>Thus, accounting for changes in the un- and under-utilized proteome explains much of the variation in growth rates across environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g002">Fig 2C and 2D</xref>).</p>

<title>Selection for faster growth rates results in a decrease in unused protein expression</title>
<p>If the expression of unused (i.e., un-utilized and under-utilized; see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1A</xref>) protein is a dominant source of variation in growth rates, one would expect that a common mechanism to increase growth rates through evolution would be to down-regulate expression of unused protein.</p>
<p>To assess this hypothesis, we estimate changes in un-utilized and under-utilized protein in <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> experimentally evolved under a growth rate selection pressure in glucose minimal media batch culture [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref015">15</xref>].

Using the same ME-Model simulations used to define un-utilized protein in glucose minimal media (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1B and 1C</xref>), we calculate changes in the un-utilized transcriptome fraction after evolution (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g003">Fig 3A</xref>). All strains except one (strain 8) increase their utilized transcriptome fraction (decreasing their un-utilized transcriptome). We next calculate changes in under-utilized protein after evolution (again, using the same ME-Model simulations as in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1D</xref>) by estimating changes in relative <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover (flux per protein). (Estimating these values with transcriptomics data assumes that, for a given protein, the translated protein per transcript is the same across the strains assessed). All strains tend to increase relative <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g003">Fig 3B</xref>; indicated by the distributions being shifted above zero).

<p>While these evolved strains tend to decrease their unused protein expression, un-utilized and under-utilized protein expression does not change uniformly across strains. Rather, across strains, the decrease in un-utilized protein expression (increase in utilized protein expression) is anti-correlated with the decrease in under-utilized protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g003">Fig 3C</xref>; increase in relative <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover). While each of these strains reaches approximately the same growth rate of ~1.0 h<sup>-1</sup> after evolution, they seem to employ different strategies to increase their growth rates. Notably, strain 8, which decreases its utilized transcriptome expression (which would tend to decrease, rather than increase growth rates), has among the highest increases in relative <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover. Strain 8 also decreases its ribosomal protein expression compared to wild-type, despite the higher translational demands of faster growth rates (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s003">S3 Fig</xref>); this suggests higher relative <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover rates of ribosomal proteins (amino acid per ribosome per second) in this strain.</p>
<p>Therefore, the observed changes in gene expression after selection for faster growth rates indicates that decreasing un-utilized and under-utilized protein expression are common mechanisms to increase growth rates.

<title>Model-driven classification of proteome segments</title>
<p>Why does <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> allocate its proteome in a way that detracts from achieving its maximal growth rate? And what regulatory processes underlie this behavior? To answer these questions, we first systematically segment the proteome by protein function. We will then be able to attribute changes in un-utilized and under-utilized protein to specific functional proteome segments. We segment the ME proteome by classifying each protein by its environment-specific utility through growth simulations with the ME-Model under all Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Sulfur sources; this results in many environment-specific growth-supporting proteomes.</p>
<p>Comparing the environment-specific growth-supporting proteomes reveals a common ‘core’ proteome that is utilized across all (minimal media) environments, as previously detailed in Yang et al. [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref019">19</xref>] (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s006">S1 Table</xref>).

<title>Definition and utilization of the ME proteome functional segments.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) The ME proteome encompasses ~80% of the proteome by mass in glucose minimal media (pie chart). ME-Model growth simulations are used to define proteome segments (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). The core proteome is composed of proteins that are used in all minimal media environments simulated. The C-, N-, P-, S-proteome segments contain proteins that are expressed under at least one alternative carbon, nitrogen, phosphorous or sulfur source environments. Abundance of these proteome segments in glucose minimal media batch culture is shown. Several global transcription factors have targets that are highly enriched (p&lt;10<sup>−15</sup>) in the segments shown. (<bold>B</bold>) In a particular environment, the utilized proteome is composed of the core proteome and some of the non-core (condition-specific) proteome. Shown is the fraction of the proteome that is utilized and in the non-core proteome. Boxplots indicate the range of potential values resulting from sampling of model enzyme activity values (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). Conditions are ordered by increasing growth rates. Other than growth on acetate, the fraction proteome that is non-core and utilized remains relatively constant. Compared to the core proteome mass fraction (which is utilized under all environments by definition), the non-core proteome comprises a relatively small proportion of the utilized proteome.</p>

<p>In addition to the core proteome, there are non-core (i.e., conditionally-utilized) proteins that we classify by element source into the C-proteome, N-proteome, P-proteome, and S-proteome (that are used for growth under alternative Carbon, Nitrogen, Phosphorous, and Sulfur sources, respectively) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s006">S1 Table</xref>). These proteome segments are largely catabolic <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1004998.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). Several of the non-core proteome segments show a large enrichment of transcriptional regulatory targets. The C-proteome is regulated by CRP, the N-proteome by NtrC, and the S-proteome by CysB (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">Fig 4A</xref>). These global transcription factors are known to respond to changes in the availability of the corresponding nutrient sources [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref022">22</xref>], supporting the model-driven definition of these proteome segments.</p>
<p>The core proteome is utilized across all environments (by definition), but in any given environment, a portion of the non-core (conditionally-utilized) proteome will also be utilized. We found that an approximately constant ~6% of the proteome is non-core and utilized across the environments profiled with proteomics (other than growth on acetate as a carbon source as an outlier). Thus, across the environments profiled with quantitative proteomics, the non-core proteome is largely un-utilized, and the core proteome constitutes the vast majority of the utilized proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). In the following sections, we detail the regulation of the core and non-core proteome segments to relate changes in these proteome segments to the observed changes in un-utilized and under-utilized protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1</xref>).</p>

<title>The core ME proteome is under-utilized</title>
<p>The core proteome abundance increases linearly with growth rate, consistent with higher biosynthetic demands at faster growth rates.

<p>While the core proteome is (defined to be) utilized under all environments examined, enzymes in the core proteome may vary in their <italic>in vivo</italic> rate of catalysis across environments (e.g., due to changes in the concentrations of substrates, products, or allosteric regulators), as observed in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1D</xref>. While the core proteome abundance increases linearly with growth rate, it is over-expressed compared to its biosynthetic demands, as evidenced by the non-zero y-intercept in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g005">Fig 5A</xref>. This overexpression of proteins in the core proteome was previously observed for ribosomal proteins, leading to the realization that translation rates are growth rate dependent: the catalytic rate of ribosomes (amino acids per second per ribosome) increases with higher growth rates, approaching its maximal catalytic rate at the <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli’s</italic> maximal growth rate [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref014">14</xref>]. A similar trend appears to be true for the core proteome more generally (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g005">Fig 5B</xref>).

<p>As previously shown, the non-core proteome (i.e., the C-, N-, P-, and S- proteome segments) is largely un-utilized. An important implication of this observation is that up-regulation of the non-core proteome segments largely results in increased expression of un-utilized protein (in the minimal media environments examined here). Across these environments profiled with proteomics (which predominantly comprise shifts and limitations in carbon sources), variation in the C-proteome abundance accounts for nearly all of the observed change in un-utilized protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Thus, up-regulation of the C-proteome under shifts in carbon sources and under carbon limitation, increases the expression of un-utilized protein.</p>
<p>The C-proteome is highly enriched in targets of the transcription factor CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">Fig 4A</xref>), and CRP is known to up-regulate its target genes under growth limitation by carbon [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref023">23</xref>]. The change in abundance of the C-proteome under the conditions examined with proteomics may therefore be largely attributed to the action of CRP. We therefore hypothesized that higher CRP activity would result in higher un-utilized protein expression. To assess this hypothesis, we utilized CRP activity and growth rate data from You et al., measured from <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> grown on 12 distinct carbon sources. The maximum unused protein fraction in each carbon source environment was calculated with the ME-Model while setting the growth rate to its measured values. Indeed, the model-predicted unused protein fraction is positively and linearly correlated with the measured CRP activity across environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g006">Fig 6B</xref>). These data and simulations further support the hypothesis that CRP activation largely results in the up-regulation of un-utilized protein in minimal media environments.</p>
<p>Thus, across these environments examined, changes in un-utilized protein can largely be attributed to the C-proteome and its regulators, including CRP. In other types of nutritional shifts (i.e., N, P, S limitations), however, the other identified proteome segments and regulators likely play a more predominant role. It may be that several of the global regulators identified as enriched in non-core proteome targets also largely result in the induction of un-utilized protein in minimal media environments.</p>

Much of the non-ME proteome mass can be classified by focusing on its most abundant proteins.

Broadly speaking, the functions that are positively correlated with growth rate are those related to growth, including cell division, replication, proteostasis, and protein translocation. The functions that are negatively correlated with growth rate are those related to stress resistance and survival, including osmotic, acid, and oxidative stresses. Thus, at higher growth rates, the growth-related functions are more highly expressed, and at lower growth rates, several stress resistance functions are more highly expressed.</p>

<title>Microbial growth rates may be largely determined by unused protein expression</title>
<p>Since the first growth rate model by Monod [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref025">25</xref>], the quantitative determinants of microbial growth rates have been under investigation. As unused protein expression has been shown to have a causal role in decreasing growth rates in synthetic protein over-expression studies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref004">4</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref005">5</xref>], microbial growth rates across different environments may largely be determined by unused protein expression as well. In support of this, we have shown that: 1) quantifying the cost of unused protein expression across several growth conditions explains the variability in growth rates across those environments (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g002">Fig 2</xref>), 2) strains selected for fast growth rates consistently decrease unused protein expression (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g003">Fig 3</xref>), and 3) the global regulator CRP predominantly regulates unused protein (across the minimal media environments examined) and the activity of the global regulator correlates with predicted unused protein expression levels (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g006">Fig 6</xref>). Thus, efforts to engineer strains for bioprocessing applications may benefit from directly eliminating highly expressed unused protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref006">6</xref>], utilizing adaptive evolution experiments to eliminate unused protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref018">18</xref>], or targeting transcription factors known to regulate unused protein [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref026">26</xref>].</p>
<p>While genome-scale models of metabolism are capable of accurate predictions of growth yields (gram dry weight per gram substrate) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref027">27</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref028">28</xref>], predictions of growth rates by have only resulted in moderate correlations (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g002">Fig 2B</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref007">7</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref029">29</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref030">30</xref>]. Our results suggest that unused protein expression is a key source of growth rate variability that has not been accounted for in genome-scale models to date and has limited the accuracy of growth rate predictions. Incorporation of the regulation of unused protein into genome-scale models may enable more accurate growth rate predictions [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref031">31</xref>].</p>
<p>We do not intend to imply that local rate-limiting bottlenecks in metabolic flux do not limit growth rates. Rather, these local bottlenecks and the global proteome allocation to unused protein can simultaneously limit growth rates; alleviation of either global or local bottlenecks can increase cellular growth rates. In fact, due to a cell’s native sensing and regulatory mechanisms, alleviation of local bottlenecks may naturally also result in reduction in unused protein expression (and vice versa). As an example, a mutation in glycerol kinase, glpK, alleviates a local rate-limiting step in glycerol metabolism during growth on glycerol [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref032">32</xref>]; this mutation also results in lower cAMP levels, which affects the expression of unused protein via its effect on the global transcriptional regulator CRP (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g003">Fig 3</xref>). On the other hand, a mutation in the RNA polymerase subunit rpoB (which can be considered a global regulator), results in the down-regulation of several un-utilized genes (mostly related to stress resistance) and the subsequent up-regulation of genes related to cellular growth [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref018">18</xref>]. Both mutations in global regulators and local rate-limiting bottlenecks are often found in adaptive evolution experiments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref017">17</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref032">32</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref034">34</xref>], suggesting that alleviation of both local and global bottlenecks are viable mechanisms to increase cellular growth.</p>

<title>Expression of an under-utilized core proteome may enable faster adaptation to improved growth conditions</title>
<p>While overexpression of an under-utilized core proteome incurs a fitness cost to steady-state growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g002">Fig 2D</xref>), the expression pattern of the core proteome (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g005">Fig 5</xref>) points to potential fitness benefits.</p>
<p>The over-expression of the core proteome may enable a fitness benefit upon encountering more favorable growth environments that can support faster growth rates (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g008">Fig 8B</xref>). Rather than depending solely on <italic>de novo</italic> protein synthesis to meet the demands of faster growth, an over-expressed core proteome can enable faster adaptation. To demonstrate this effect, we simulate growth upon shifting from the lowest growth carbon source profiled (galactose) to the highest (glucose) with the ME-Model. The expressed proteome before the environmental shift is used to constrain the growth phenotype immediately following the shift (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). If the core proteome is expressed in excess when growing in galactose, the organism grows faster upon the environmental ‘up-shift’; otherwise, the maximum instantaneous growth rate on glucose will be the same as that on galactose. This fitness benefit upon environmental up-shifts is consistent with experiments showing protein over-expression to incur a higher fitness cost upon environmental up-shifts (where the over-expressed core proteome becomes important for growth in the new environment) than down-shifts [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref035">35</xref>].</p>

<title>Fitness benefit of unused protein expression in changing environments results in fitness trade-offs.</title>
<p>(<bold>A</bold>) Green line indicates organismal growth rate through an environmental shift. After an environmental shift, the instantaneous maximal growth rate is computed using the ME-Model (asterisk; which is limited by the expressed proteome prior to the shift) and is the measure of fitness used in B and C. (<bold>B</bold>) Expressing an under-utilized core proteome may provide a fitness benefit under changing environments. When shifting from galactose (the lowest growth carbon source profiled) to glucose (the highest growth carbon source profiled), having the core proteome initially in excess beyond the needs for biosynthesis enables a higher growth rate upon the nutrient up-shift (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). (<bold>C</bold>) When carbon-limited, readiness for alternative carbon sources confers a fitness benefit whereas readiness for alternative nitrogen sources does not (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="sec017">Methods</xref>). Up-regulation of the C-proteome under carbon limitation (but not nitrogen limitation) provides a fitness benefit. (<bold>D</bold>) The pie charts summarize the proteome allocation across the environments profiled. In environments with lower growth rates, the proteome allocated towards growth is lower, but the proteome allocated to nutrient readiness (the portions of the C-, N-, P-, and S- proteomes not utilized for growth) and stress resistance (portions of the non-ME proteome) is higher. As the proteome is a limited resource, proteome allocation to the different segments results in fitness trade-offs between growth, nutrient readiness, and stress resistance. Proteome segments are calculated based on regressions and proteome segments delineated in Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">4</xref>–<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g007">7</xref>.</p>

<p>The expression of the non-core proteome likely enables readiness for environmental change (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). To demonstrate this effect, we simulate nutrient supplementations under C- and N-limitation with the ME-Model. Under C-limitation, supplementation with nitrogen sources provides no fitness benefit. On the other hand, supplementation with alternative sources of the limiting element provides growth advantages (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g008">Fig 8C</xref>). Thus, expression of the C-proteome provides a fitness benefit under C-limitation but not under N-limitation. While the non-core proteome segments are largely un-unutilized in a current environment, they may provide a fitness advantage upon environmental shifts. Indeed, higher activity of CRP has been shown to result in shorter lag phases at a cost of slower growth rates resulting in higher levels of catabolite repression to be beneficial in variable environments [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref036">36</xref>].</p>

<title>Proteome allocation reflects fitness tradeoffs and ecological strategies</title>
<p>The previous sections suggest that the expression of unused protein can be attributed to proteome segments whose expression incurs a fitness cost on steady-state growth but also confers fitness benefits in varying environments.</p>
<p>Here, we summarize the model-defined proteome segments and their regulation with growth rate under variation in carbon source identity and availability. The proteome devoted to cellular growth in these minimal media environments is primarily composed of an invariant core proteome (Figs <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">4</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g005">5</xref>). Also contributing to growth is smaller portions of the non-core ME (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g004">Fig 4B</xref>) and non-ME proteomes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). The remaining non-core ME proteome can be considered to be devoted to nutrient readiness (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g006">Fig 6</xref>); these proteins can be utilized for growth when alternative nutrients become available. The non-ME proteome that is not devoted to cellular growth is predominantly related to stress functions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g007">Fig 7C</xref>). Thus, quantifying the utilization and function of the proteome reveals its allocation towards growth, nutrient readiness, and stress resistance. At low growth rates, nutrient readiness and stress resistance functions are more abundant; at higher growth rates, allocation to these functions decreases to enable increased allocation to cellular growth (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g008">Fig 8D</xref>). Nutrient readiness and stress resistance functions can be considered ‘hedging’ functions that enable readiness for environmental change rather than being actively utilized, resulting in trade-offs between growth, nutrient readiness, and stress resistance due to proteome allocation constraints. Indeed, several studies have shown that slower growing cells are more resistant to cellular stresses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref037">37</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref039">39</xref>].</p>
<p>An important implication of the identified fitness trade-offs is that cellular growth rates may be primarily determined by environmental history, rather than nutrient quality (i.e., the maximum growth rate possible with a specified nutrient, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi.1004998.g002">Fig 2A</xref>). As growth rates are determined by the proteome allocated towards growth, evolutionary and ecological factors may be more important than the identity and quality of the substrates themselves. For example, while glucose and galactose have similar inherent qualities as sole carbon sources (chemically and as defined by the growth potential of <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> on these substrates), glucose is the highest growth substrate in this dataset and galactose is the lowest. Galactose may be a more rarely or transiently encountered carbon source or perhaps it is often associated with harsher environments, which would make environmental readiness and stress resistance comparatively more important components of overall cellular fitness [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref042">42</xref>].

<title>The proteome burden of a generalist species</title>
<p>While we broadly classify the proteome here based on nutrient readiness and stress resistance functions, it is important to realize that within these proteome segments is a variety of distinct functions enabling readiness for specific nutrients and stresses. Concerted up-regulation of these segments results in a general nutritional readiness and stress resistance. However, as an organism becomes prepared for a wider array of nutrients or stresses, these proteome segments must become larger. Therefore, in addition to a trade-off between the different components of organismal fitness identified here (growth, environmental readiness, stress resistance), proteome allocation constraints also result in a trade-off in specialist versus generalist ecological strategies. <italic>E</italic>. <italic>coli</italic> is a generalist species, capable of growing in a variety of environments. Its broad environmental niche results in large proteome burden. On the other hand, specialist species (capable of growing on a narrower range of substrates) would require a smaller proteome allocation to be equally ready for environmental change. Proteome allocation constraints will therefore also result in a trade-off between specialist and generalist strategies [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1004998.ref046">46</xref>].</p>

As all of the evolved strains have similar growth rates, a lower ribosomal protein transcriptome fraction implies a higher translation rate (amino acids per ribosome per second). Consistent with this, the change ribosomal protein fraction is negatively correlated with the change in <italic>in vivo</italic> enzyme turnover. One strain (strain 8) actually decreases the expression of ribosomal proteins compared to the wild-type strain even though the evolved strain’s growth rate is ~1.0 h<sup>-1</sup> compared to 0.7 h<sup>-1</sup> in the wild-type, suggesting that translation rates are higher in the evolved strains.</p>
