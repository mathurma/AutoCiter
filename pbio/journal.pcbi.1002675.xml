        <p>HIV protease, an aspartyl protease crucial to the life cycle of HIV, is the target of many drug development programs. Though many protease inhibitors are on the market, protease eventually evades these drugs by mutating at a rapid pace and building drug resistance. The drug resistance mutations, called primary mutations, are often destabilizing to the enzyme and this loss of stability has to be compensated for. Using a coarse-grained biophysical energy model together with statistical inference methods, we observe that accessory mutations of charged residues increase protein stability, playing a key role in compensating for destabilizing primary drug resistance mutations. Increased stability is intimately related to correlations between electrostatic mutations – uncorrelated mutations would strongly destabilize the enzyme. Additionally, statistical modeling indicates that the network of correlated electrostatic mutations has a simple topology and has evolved to minimize frustrated interactions. The model's statistical coupling parameters reflect this lack of frustration and strongly distinguish like-charge electrostatic interactions from unlike-charge interactions for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the most significantly correlated double mutants. Finally, we demonstrate that our model has considerable predictive power and can be used to predict complex mutation patterns, that have not yet been observed due to finite sample size effects, and which are likely to exist within the larger patient population whose virus has not yet been sequenced.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>HIV is incurable because its enzymes evolve rapidly by developing resistance mutations to retroviral inhibitors. Most of these mutations work synergistically, but the biophysical basis behind their cooperation is not well understood. Our work addresses these important issues by bridging the gap between the statistical modeling of HIV protease subtype B sequences with the energetics of mutations involving charged amino acids by showing that electrostatic stability is intimately related to correlations. Moreover, we demonstrate that our statistical model has considerable predictive power and can be used to predict complex mutation patterns that have not yet been observed due to the finite sizes of the current sequence databases. In other words, as the database size increases, our model has the ability to predict the identities of the high probability mutations patterns, which are more likely to be observed. Knowing which currently unobserved mutations are more likely to be observed can be very advantageous in combating the disease.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>Proteins evolve through random mutagenesis and their evolutionary selection is constrained by structural, functional and environmental factors <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Depristo1">[1]</xref>. Thermodynamic stability is by far the most important structural factor, as most proteins need to be folded in order to function. The stability range for each protein, however, is narrow and is estimated experimentally to be around 10 kcal/mol, which is of the order of three hydrogen bonds <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Pace1">[2]</xref>. As a result of this marginal stability, proteins operate “on a knife's edge” <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Pain1">[3]</xref>, whereby a single highly deleterious mutation could potentially lead to decreased stability and loss of activity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Shoichet1">[4]</xref>. By the same token, a single stabilizing mutation could be advantageous from an evolutionary point of view. For example, more stable forms of cytochrome P450 allowed for greater exploration of mutational space in directed evolution experiments than sequences without stabilizing mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Bloom1">[5]</xref>. This increased “evolvability” is not just limited to directed evolution experiments, but may be a general property of proteins evolving under selective pressure <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Tokuriki1">[6]</xref>. In fact, recent experimental work on HIV protease has shown that accessory mutations compensate for the loss of stability due to destabilizing primary drug resistance mutations, helping the virus evade drugs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Chang1">[7]</xref>. This stabilizing effect can have an external source as well: Hsp90, a molecular chaperone, buffers deleterious mutations, allowing for polymorphisms to appear and new traits to evolve <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Lindquist1">[8]</xref>. As a result of this work and prior research by other groups, it is now widely recognized that thermodynamic stability is intimately linked with the evolvability of a protein <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Zeldovich1">[9]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Bloom2">[11]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Even though the process of mutagenesis is random, the genetic and structural constraints mentioned above, coupled with functional selection, ensure that certain mutations in evolving proteins are associated with each other in a highly non-random fashion <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Gobel1">[12]</xref>. These correlated mutations are an inherent property of evolving amino acid sequences, and an evolutionary signature of viable proteins. A multitude of methods have been developed to identify such pairs and groups of mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Codoner1">[13]</xref>, some of which have been applied to HIV protease sequences to locate pairs or groups of coevolving residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Chen1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Liu1">[16]</xref>. Our previous work on higher-order correlations showed that for HIV-1 protease, including at least pair correlations is essential for reproducing statistical patterns of primary and accessory mutations observed in protease sequences from patients undergoing anti-retroviral therapy <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Haq1">[17]</xref>.</p>
      <p>It is tempting to attribute sequence correlations to effects arising from protein stability constraints <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Weinreich1">[18]</xref>, and several groups have tried to connect sequence correlations with protein energetics on a detailed atomic level. For example, Zhang et al. applied Bayesian networks to infer therapeutically relevant and conditionally dependent sets of resistance mutations in HIV protease and reverse transcriptase and then used molecular simulations to model the specific interactions that cause resistance <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Zhang1">[19]</xref>. Ranganathan et al. have attempted to explain mutational coevolution by connecting statistical free energies from multiple sequence alignments to differences in experimental folding free energies <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Lockless1">[20]</xref>. Some of these results have been difficult to replicate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Chi1">[21]</xref>, and are still a topic of active debate in the community <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Fodor1">[22]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Liu2">[23]</xref>. Thus while studies that link mutational correlations to thermodynamic constraints have made great progress <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Gobel1">[12]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Zhang1">[19]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Atchley1">[24]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Rost1">[26]</xref>, a consensus linking protein energetics and mutational correlation patterns has not yet emerged. These observations have motivated us to explore how correlated mutations in HIV protease are connected to energetics via their impact on protein stability.</p>
      <p>Since current methods for predicting stability changes upon mutation based on detailed atomic models are not sufficiently accurate <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Potapov1">[27]</xref>, we have chosen to focus instead on the electrostatic part of the total energy for which a coarse-grained model of electrostatics is appropriate. We find that this model captures many important effects of mutations on energetics and stability of HIV protease. We show that the average electrostatic stabilization of HIV protease increases with the number of electrostatic mutations (an electrostatic mutation changes the charge of that mutating residue relative to the wild-type residue), consistent with the hypothesis that accessory electrostatic mutations buffer the destabilizing effects of primary drug-resistance mutations, most of which are non-electrostatic mutations and are therefore not modelled here. We demonstrate that correlations among electrostatic mutations are critical for stabilization; uncorrelated mutations would strongly destabilize the protein. We show that our method, which employs both electrostatic calculations and sequence analysis based on statistical inference techniques, can be used as a predictive tool for novel mutational patterns that have not yet been observed. Finally, we comment on the structure of the electrostatic mutation network of HIV protease. Energy landscape theory, which provided the framework for understanding protein folding through funnels, introduced the concept of a smooth, minimally frustrated landscape for foldable, natural proteins <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Bryngelson1">[28]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Onuchic1">[29]</xref>. Our results indicate that the electrostatic interaction network is minimally frustrated as is evident in the derived statistical coupling parameters which strongly predict the underlying charge patterns, providing additional evidence that proteins have evolved to minimize frustrated interactions.</p>

        <title>Effect of electrostatic mutations on protein stability</title>
        <p>Our analysis of electrostatic mutation patterns is based on the alignment of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> HIV protease sequences from Christopher Lee's HIV Positive Selection Mutation Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/HIV" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/HIV</ext-link>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Chen2">[30]</xref>. Each amino acid sequence in the Lee database is converted into a charge signature, which is a three letter alphabet representation of that sequence (+, −, n) corresponding to positively-charged, negatively-charged, and neutral residues. These charge signatures are compared to the wild-type charge signature to determine electrostatic mutations. We examined all primary, accessory and polymorphic drug resistance mutation positions (as designated by the Stanford HIV database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Rhee2">[31]</xref>) and limited our analysis to a subset of 18 positions whose charged state mutates above a threshold frequency of 0.01%. Our model therefore includes more than 380 million states or unique charge signatures involving these 18 positions (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g001">Figure 1</xref>). Of the 18, 9 are sites which have been characterized as primary or accessory drug resistance mutations while the rest are sites labeled as polymorphic mutations. Mutations are labelled “polymorphic” if they are observed to mutate in the absence of drugs and whose compensatory effect has not yet been experimentally verified, even though drugs may have a significant affect on their correlations with other mutating residues <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Rhee2">[31]</xref>.</p>

        <p>The observed stabilization requires not only the correct frequencies of occurrence of each of the three possible charge states at each position, but also the presence of correlations. Generating random sequences with equal mutation frequencies for the three charge states results in a substantial destabilization of the protein (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g002">Figure 2</xref>, red curve). Introducing observed frequencies of occurrence of each charge at every position improves the stabilization relative to the previous model with equal mutation frequencies, but still results in substantial destabilization (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g002">Figure 2</xref>, blue curve). We refer to this latter model as the independent model as it generates an alignment in which mutations at each position occur independently with correct frequencies.</p>
        <p>If pair correlations are introduced by preserving the observed joint mutation frequencies (see Methods), substantial protein stabilization occurs, and the energies predicted by this pair correlation model (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g002">Figure 2</xref>, green curve) become comparable to the energies of the observed sequences. The magnitude of the difference between the observed and pair correlation model average energies is less than 2 kcal/mol for sequences with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e016" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> mutations, suggesting that introducing pair correlations is sufficient for explaining the observed energetic stabilization trends. Overall, the difference between the independent model and the pair correlation model is statistically significant given a sample size corresponding to the numbers of sequences observed in the database with those number of mutations (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e017" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> for sequences with 4 or fewer mutations).</p>

        <title>Contribution of specific sequences to the average protein stability and significant drug associations</title>
        <p>We find that the observed electrostatic stabilization can be attributed to a relatively small number of low-energy signatures which are highly unlikely under the independent model but become very probable once pair correlations are introduced (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For example, the well-studied pair of primary drug resistance mutations, D30N-N88D <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Rhee1">[15]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Mahalingam1">[32]</xref>, which occurs 2220 times in the Lee database, contributes <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e018" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e019" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> kcal/mol stabilization of the pair correlation model relative to the independent model shown in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g002">Figure 2</xref>. Together, these top 10 double mutants account for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e020" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the stabilization of the pair correlation model relative to the independent model. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s010">Table S3</xref> lists the most statistically deviated pairs and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s007">Figure S7</xref> depicts the distance between the pairs on the structure of HIV protease. It is interesting to note that 4 out of the top 10 most correlated pairs are greater than 10 Angstroms apart.</p>
        <p>With increasing numbers of mutations however, the stabilization spreads among multiple patterns (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s001">Figure S1</xref>). For 3 electrostatic mutations, the top contributor D30N-N37D-N88D is responsible for 20%, while the top 10 signatures account for 64% of the <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e021" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> kcal/mol stabilization of the pair correlation model relative to the independent model. For 4 mutations, K20I-D30N-N37D-N88D accounts for 10%, while the top 10 signatures account for 33% of the stabilization. For 5 mutations, K20I-D30N-E35Q-N37D-N88D accounts for 17% and the top 10 signatures account for 36% of the stabilization.</p>
        <p>These stabilizing charge patterns are also strongly associated with protease inhibitor therapies, as determined by our drug association analysis (see <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s011">Text S1</xref>). Most protease drug association studies focus on point mutations or pairs of mutations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Chen2">[30]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Wu1">[34]</xref>. Our drug association analysis allows us to examine the significance of drug association for patterns of more than two mutations. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s008">Table S1</xref> lists the most significant associations between drugs and charge patterns of 2, 3 and 4 electrostatic mutations with the highest probabilities as predicted by the pair correlation model. Most of the patterns listed are strongly associated with at least one drug and several are associated with many drugs. For example the D30N-N88D double mutant and the D30N-N37D-N88D triple mutant are both strongly associated with Nelfinavir monotherapy and Indinavir-Nelfinavir combination therapy with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e022" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. We also find strong association between drugs and patterns predicted by the pair correlation model with more than three mutations. For example K20I-D30N-N37D-N88D and K20I-D30N-E35Q-N88D are both associated with Indinavir-Nelfinavir combination therapy while K20I-D30N-H69Q-N88D is associated with Ritonavir-Nelfinavir therapy with <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e023" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>

        <title>Predicting novel mutational patterns</title>
        <p>The ability to predict drug resistant mutation patterns is of great therapeutic relevance. Approaches to predicting drug resistance mutations based on biophysical modeling have recently been proposed <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Frey1">[35]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Safi1">[36]</xref>. In contrast, our statistical-inference based approach which includes pair correlations among mutations, allows us to predict the probabilities of arbitrary charge signatures, many of which have not yet been experimentally observed. <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s002">Figure S2</xref> shows that most of the sequences with less than 5 mutations, whose probabilities are significantly enhanced by pair correlations, are observed in the Lee database, indicating that these mutational patterns are routinely utilized by the virus. However, for 6 mutations the most stabilizing pattern, K20I-D30N-E35Q-N37D-Q58E-N88D, was not observed (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s001">Figure S1</xref>). The probability of this pattern under the pair correlation model is <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e024" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, too small to appear frequently in a database of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e025" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> sequences due to finite sample size effects. However, if the size of the database were to increase five-fold, the probability of observing at least one copy of this pattern would be <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e026" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.</p>
        <p>The proportion of sequences not observed in the Lee database with significantly enhanced pair correlation model probabilities increases greatly with the number of mutations, of which it is likely that many are not observed because of finite sample size effects (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s002">Figure S2</xref>). In order to test our ability to predict novel patterns of favorable electrostatic mutations unobserved in the Lee database due to finite sample size effects, we examined the contents of a separate database, the drug-annotated Stanford database which contains HIV protease subtype B sequences from various sources <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Rhee2">[31]</xref>. <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g003">Figure 3</xref> plots the probabilities of sequences using the pair correlation model, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e027" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, as a function of the observed probabilities in the Lee database. Sequences are also shaded according to a gradient that represents how often the sequence occurs in the Stanford database, relative to the Lee database. The plot shows that sequences with the highest predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e028" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> probabilities that are unobserved in the Lee database are largely shaded red, indicating that most are observed in the Stanford database. In fact, of the top 25 most probable sequences predicted by the pair correlation model that are not found in the Lee database, 19 are present in the Stanford database (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s009">Table S2</xref>). Most of these sequences are also significantly associated with drug therapies (e.g. <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e029" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>). As the predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e030" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> probability decreases, the shading of the dots gradually changes to green, indicating that sequences with the lowest predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e031" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> probabilities are unobserved in both the Lee and the Stanford database. Thus our approach exhibits considerable predictive power. If we examine other sequences in the tail of the Lee probability distribution that are observed once, twice, three times etc in the Lee database, we notice a similar trend; sequences with higher predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e032" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> probabilities are present in the Stanford database at much higher frequencies than sequences with lower predicted <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e033" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> probabilities, even though the pair correlation model was parameterized on the Lee database. This result strongly suggests that the pair correlation model is a much better predictor of actual sequence probabilities than using the sequence counts from the databases themselves, because of finite sample size effects. In other words, the tail of the distribution is very well represented by the pair correlation model.</p>

As described in the Methods, we iteratively determine these parameters using a graph-theoretic inference algorithm, called belief propagation (BP) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Pearl1">[37]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Weigt1">[39]</xref>, a method which has recently been applied by other research groups to study protein conformational entropy and protein-protein interactions <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Kamisetty1">[40]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Procaccini1">[41]</xref>. Within the BP framework, we apply a mean field model which includes pair correlations in the Bethe approximation to estimate the bivariate marginals, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e046" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Yedidia1">[38]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Bethe1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Nishimori1">[43]</xref>. In the statistical physics community “mean field” in often used to refer to a class of approximations whereby the free energy of the system is written in terms of the marginals up to a given order, the corresponding mean field model at the pair correlation level is the Bethe approximation. However, it is well known that while <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e047" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is exact and converges to <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e048" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> on acyclic networks, <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e049" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> only approximates <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e050" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and can become unstable on cyclic networks <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Murphy1">[44]</xref>. For the electrostatic correlation network of HIV protease, we observe that the belief propagation algorithm converges quickly to the observed bivariate marginals (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s003">Figure S3</xref>). The convergence towards the observed probabilities for triplets and larger multiplets is also well approximated, a result that is non-trivial since the Bethe approximation is a pair-level approximation and does not guarantee the convergence for marginals beyond pairs <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Yedidia2">[45]</xref>. For trivariate marginals, the correlation coefficient between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e051" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e052" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 0.98 while for four mutations, the correlation coefficient between <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e053" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> and <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e054" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> is 0.90 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002675.s003">Figure S3</xref>). This close correlation between observed and predicted marginals argues for a simple network structure and suggests that for this system, the Bethe approximation is a good approximation and by implication the electrostatic mutation network is minimally frustrated.</p>
        <p>Another strong indicator of the lack of frustration in the electrostatic mutation network of HIV protease is that the statistical coupling parameters of the (Bethe) mean field model are able to distinguish like-charge patterns from unlike-charge patterns with high accuracy (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g004">Figure 4</xref>). We find that the sign of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e055" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>, a quantity derived from the sequence analysis alone, is able to correctly predict the charge patterns for <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e056" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> of the top 35 most significantly correlated charge pairs (<inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e057" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>.), reflecting the evolutionary optimization of the protein electrostatic interaction network (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g004">Figure 4</xref>). Moreover, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002675-g004">Figure 4</xref> also indicates that the magnitude of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002675.e058" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> correlates with the spatial distance between residues.

      <p>Our results suggest that electrostatic interactions play an important role in the coevolution of mutations in HIV protease. The extent to which electrostatics influences protein stability has been the subject of debate in the literature <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Hendsch1">[47]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Elcock1">[53]</xref>. One experimental study of protease has minimized the role of electrostatics in favor of the impact of compensatory mutations on protein flexibility <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Piana1">[54]</xref>. Others have suggested that buried charges play a more important role in protein function than stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Schneider1">[55]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Sindelar1">[56]</xref>. We recognize that electrostatics is only part of the total energy, and that contributions to stability from van der Waals interactions, hydrogen bonding and hydrophobic effects are significant. Nonetheless, long-range electrostatics is likely to have a substantial effect on protein stability <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Xiao1">[50]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Honig1">[52]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Dill1">[57]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Roca1">[59]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our results support the proposal that the presence of correlations among electrostatic mutations arises from the contraints imposed by the need to maintain the stability of the folded protein. HIV protease is under strong selection pressure from drugs. As a result of the initial build up of drug resistance, protease becomes less stable <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Mahalingam1">[32]</xref>. We hypothesize that electrostatic mutations not only bring the protein back to a more viable state, but may give the protein more “breathing room” on the evolutionary fitness landscape. Manipulating the charge distribution of HIV protease is complex and we find that uncorrelated mutations would tend to strongly destabilize the enzyme, contrary to the stability gain observed in the database. Therefore, we propose that sets of electrostatic mutations occur together, increasing the “evolvability” of a protein by providing a “reservoir of stability” which allows it to escape epistatic traps along evolutionary pathways towards higher fitness <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Weinreich1">[18]</xref>.</p>
      <p>The absence of frustration could reflect evolutionary optimization of the electrostatic interaction network in HIV protease under selection pressure from drugs, or it could be a general property of protein electrostatic interaction networks. Indeed, natural proteins tend not to be frustrated systems <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Onuchic1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Kuhlman1">[60]</xref> – they are fine-tuned biological machines with restricted evolutionary pathways <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Weinreich1">[18]</xref>. Within these pathways, proteins are highly robust and the physics underlying their folding display a kind of simplicity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Onuchic1">[29]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Onuchic2">[61]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Bryngelson2">[63]</xref>. Our conclusions based on a coarse-grained electrostatics model combined with statistical inference techniques reflect this lack of frustration. In future work we will study our algorithm on interaction networks with a larger alphabet size and different network topologies. In this context, we note that Balakrishnan et al. used an alternative learning algorithm that a solved similar problem but determined the optimal graph topology for the network <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Balakrishnan1">[64]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Our statistical analysis of HIV sequences captures biophysical constraints in the form of a statistical network of correlated mutations. Even though the model is based on pairwise correlations, it captures the higher-order effects and correctly predicts the probabilities of sequences found in the tail of the distribution. The fact that many of these patterns are also strongly associated with protease inhibitors from patients undergoing antiretroviral therapy, highlights the clinical relevance of our method. Other mutation patterns that we predict are likely to exist within patients whose virus has not yet been sequenced. Having knowledge of these unique, but as yet unobserved patterns, can be important for the design of future inhibitors to combat drug resistance.</p>
      <p>In this work, we go beyond a purely statistical approach to modeling patterns of electrostatic mutations, and show that the statistical results are entirely consistent when viewed in the context of a structure based energy model. Though electrostatics is only part of the total energy, our work has highlighted its importance and provided support for the proposal that correlated electrostatic mutations provide a reservoir of stability for HIV protease as it builds resistance to drugs.</p>

        <p>45,161 aligned HIV-1 DNA nucleotide sequences were downloaded from Christopher Lee's HIV Positive Selection Mutation Database (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/HIV" xlink:type="simple">http://bioinfo.mbi.ucla.edu/HIV</ext-link>) on March 4th, 2008 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Chen2">[30]</xref>. This database of sequences, which we call the Lee database, consists primarily of HIV-1 subtype B samples sequenced by Specialty Laboratories Inc from 1999 to mid-2002. These sequences are not annotated. <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Chen2">[30]</xref>. The amino acid sequences were converted into strings of characters “n”, “−” and “+”, indicating whether a given residue is neutral, negatively or positively charged at pH = 6 (i.e. His, Arg, and Lys are positively charged, while Asp and Glu are negatively charged). A second database of subtype B sequences, which we call the Stanford database, was downloaded from the Stanford HIV database on April 7th, 2010 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Rhee2">[31]</xref>. This database consists of drug annotated sequences collected primarily from more than 900 literature and GenBank references. This drug-annotated dataset was used to associate correlated mutation patterns with specific anti-retroviral therapies (see SI). The univariate and bivariate marginals extracted from the Lee database and from the Stanford database are effectively the same (correlation coefficient of 0.999), indicating that our results would be unchanged if we used the Stanford database to parameterize the model. Moreover, at a 20 letter amino acid alphabet level, there is little redundancy between the databases as only 7.63% of the sequences are present in both databases.</p>
        <p>To locate electrostatic mutations, the resulting charge signatures were compared to the HIV-1 subtype B consensus sequence from the Los Alamos National Laboratory HIV sequence database. This consensus sequence was used to define the wild-type charge signature. We define an electrostatic mutation as an amino acid mutation which changes the charge at a certain position along the protein sequence, relative to the wild-type amino acid at that position (e.g. D30N and N88D). In contrast, the L90M and R8K are not considered to be electrostatic mutations.</p>
        <p>We examined all the primary, accessory and polymorphic drug resistance mutations positions (as designated by the Stanford database <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002675-Rhee2">[31]</xref>) and included all electrostatic mutations above a threshold frequency of 0.01%. The 18 positions included are the primary drug resistance mutatation sites D30 and N88, accessory mutation sites K20, E34, E35, K43, Q58, L63, and Q92, and polymorphic mutation sites Q7, T12, G16, Q18, N37, Q61, H69, K70, and I72.</p>

          <p><bold>Distribution of the number of unique sequences for sample sizes equal to the size of Stanford and Lee databases.</bold> 13,286 and 45,161 sequences, corresponding to the sizes of the Stanford and Lee databases, were each randomly sampled from the probability distribution described by the pair correlation model. The distribution of the number of unique sequences for 1,000 simulations for both sampling distributions is plotted as a histogram. The sample average for the Stanford-sized sample distribution is 452.9 and the standard deviation is 14.3. The sample average for the Lee-sized sample distribution is 862.1 and the standard deviation is 18.7. The number of unique sequences in the Stanford database is 431 while the number of unique sequences in the Lee database is 828, both of which lie within 1.4 standard deviations of their respective sample means.</p>
