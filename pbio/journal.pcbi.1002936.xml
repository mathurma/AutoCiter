      <abstract>
        <p>The salamander has the remarkable ability to regenerate its limb after amputation. Cells at the site of amputation form a blastema and then proliferate and differentiate to regrow the limb. To better understand this process, we performed deep RNA sequencing of the blastema over a time course in the axolotl, a species whose genome has not been sequenced. Using a novel comparative approach to analyzing RNA-seq data, we characterized the transcriptional dynamics of the regenerating axolotl limb with respect to the human gene set. This approach involved de novo assembly of axolotl transcripts, RNA-seq transcript quantification without a reference genome, and transformation of abundances from axolotl contigs to human genes. We found a prominent burst in oncogene expression during the first day and blastemal/limb bud genes peaking at 7 to 14 days. In addition, we found that limb patterning genes, SALL genes, and genes involved in angiogenesis, wound healing, defense/immunity, and bone development are enriched during blastema formation and development. Finally, we identified a category of genes with no prior literature support for limb regeneration that are candidates for further evaluation based on their expression pattern during the regenerative process.</p>

        <title>Author Summary</title>
        <p>Salamanders such as the axolotl can fully regenerate a limb upon amputation, making them the vertebrate champions of regeneration. On the other hand, humans and other mammals possess a very limited ability to regenerate limb structures. Learning about the genes, gene networks, and pathways activated in the salamander during limb regeneration will provide cues to improving the regenerative response in mammals. Elucidating these genes, networks, and pathways is difficult, however, because the axolotl does not yet have its genome sequenced and because it has diverged evolutionarily from species with a sequenced genome. Here, we produce a set of gene transcripts via RNA sequencing (RNA-seq) for the axolotl and provide information on the nature of the genes activated during regeneration. To determine the identity of these axolotl genes, we use comparative transcriptomics techniques to match the axolotl transcript data to that of the well-annotated human gene set. Supporting previous studies, we find upregulation of many genes previously found to be involved in limb development and regeneration. In addition, we find a burst of cancer-related genes during the first phase of regeneration and identify a set of genes previously not associated with the regeneration process.</p>

      <title>Introduction</title>
      <p>The salamander's capability to regenerate various body parts, including limbs, has been the focus of study for almost 200 years <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Dinsmore1">[1]</xref>. Regeneration of the limb of the axolotl (<italic>Ambystoma mexicanum</italic>), in particular, has been widely studied, both in classical studies, and more recently in studies using modern molecular tools <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Rao1">[2]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Whited1">[10]</xref>.</p>
      <p>Recent publications have incorporated microarray, sequencing, and mass spectrometric technology into the study of limb regeneration. For example, a study focusing on the nerve dependence of limb generation utilized microarrays and 454 sequencing to identify genes expressed in the blastema with and without the presence of nerves <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Monaghan1">[3]</xref>. A more recent study utilized a microarray with 20,000 probe sets to identify genes expressed during the regenerative process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Monaghan2">[11]</xref>. However, there are limitations to this approach, as microarrays can only identify the expression of genes for which probes are designed, and the shallow depth of 454 sequencing in the first study limits the ability to detect low abundance transcripts. Another study in <italic>Xenopus</italic> identified several genes likely to be important to hind limb regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Pearl1">[12]</xref>, and a proteomic analysis of the blastema has also been published <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Rao1">[2]</xref>. More recently, a study employed microarrays to identify a list of genes specific to the regenerating epithelium <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Campbell1">[13]</xref>. In addition to the above axolotl studies, Expressed Sequence Tag (EST) and other sequencing efforts have made inroads in defining the transcriptome of the newt <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Borchardt1">[14]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Maki1">[16]</xref>.</p>
      <p>In our study, we examine the axolotl transcriptome using RNA-seq technology, which can provide accurate expression level estimates for genes across a wide range of abundances <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Wang1">[17]</xref>. To the best of our knowledge, a deep sequencing of the developing axolotl blastema using RNA-seq has not yet been reported. Despite its advantages, RNA-seq data analysis for the axolotl is challenging as the species' genome has not yet been sequenced, probably due to its size (∼30 GB) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Smith1">[18]</xref>, and its transcriptome is largely uncharacterized. To address these challenges, we have developed a novel computational approach to the analysis of axolotl RNA-seq data that allows for characterization of axolotl transcriptional dynamics in terms of the human gene set. Our approach uses statistical tools for transcript quantification when no reference genome is available <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Li1">[19]</xref> and comparative transcriptomic analysis with the human transcript set.</p>
      <p>Given the critical role played by the blastema in the regenerative process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Thornton1">[20]</xref>, we used RNA-seq and our novel comparative analysis approach to uncover the sets of genes regulated in the blastema over the first 28 days after amputation. We established a website that contains all of the RNA-seq read and assembly information from this work and other relevant “omic” information on the axolotl (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.axolomics.org" xlink:type="simple">www.axolomics.org</ext-link>). This paper provides information on genes and gene products likely important for the maintenance, growth and proliferation of stem cells, and for the regulation of growth and tumor formation. It supplies critical resources for a deeper understanding of the blastema's contribution to limb regeneration and lays the groundwork for important advances in the field of regenerative biology.</p>

        <p>We amputated juvenile (4.5–10 cm) axolotl right forelimbs at the mid-stylopod level and harvested tissue at 0 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g001">Figure 1</xref>). We focused on forelimbs because gene expression patterns can differ between forelimb and hindlimb during regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Khan1">[21]</xref> and used only right limbs because left-right expression asymmetries may also exist. Tissue from three animals at each time point were pooled to reduce the impact of individual variation. We then prepared mRNA and performed sequencing using the Illumina GAII platform (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>).</p>

        <p>Full details of our comparative RNA-seq analysis approach are provided in <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>. Briefly, RNA-seq reads were first mapped to an axolotl mRNA contig set containing 113,925 contigs. These contigs were then matched to human transcripts to allow for differential expression and functional analyses using the human gene set.</p>
        <p>Read counts and measures of Transcripts Per Million (TPM) were calculated for each human gene matched by at least one contig <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Li2">[22]</xref>. The numbers of reads sequenced and mapped to axolotl contigs and human genes for each sample are provided in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s007">Table S1</xref>. The validity of this approach can be seen through analogy with standard methods for gene-level RNA-seq analyses, which typically sum the counts of reads mapping to each exon or isoform of a gene to arrive at a gene-level count. In our case, the axolotl contigs are simply treated as “isoforms” of the human genes to which they are matched.</p>
        <p>Other quality axolotl transcriptome assemblies exist. A recent study producing axolotl ESTs resulted in 15,384 contigs, but these contigs are derived from brain sampling and thus may not give a good representation of genes active in limb regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Huggins1">[23]</xref>. Sal-Site (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.ambystoma.org" xlink:type="simple">www.ambystoma.org</ext-link>) also provides a web-searchable assembly of 17,000 contigs that map to human genes. We chose to use our assembly because many of the tissues used to construct the assembly are derived from the limb or blastema.</p>
        <p>Our samples have, on average, 10,242 human genes with at least one read associated with them and, on average, samples have 9,285 human genes with a TPM&gt;1 (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s001">Figure S1</xref>). Analyzing all samples, we identified 11,927 genes with reads (47% of the 25,484 protein-coding gene symbols in the human gene set). Given that approximately 60–70% of genes in the genome are expected to be expressed in any particular cell type, the 47% detected in the present study likely represents a substantial percentage of the genes actually expressed in the axolotl blastema <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Ramskld1">[24]</xref>.</p>
        <p>We further characterized the completeness of our axolotl transcriptome through an analysis of the high-quality RNA-seq reads without an alignment to an axolotl contig. A fraction of these unalignable reads are true axolotl sequences that could not be mapped due to an incomplete assembly while the remainder of these reads are probably RNA-seq artifacts, such as adapter sequences. To estimate these fractions we ran BLASTX on both high-quality alignable (AL) and unalignable (UN) RNA-seq reads against the human protein set. We found that 17% of AL reads had a significant BLASTX hit, while only 4% of UN reads had such a hit. We thus estimate that the fraction of unalignable reads that are truly from axolotl is 23% = 4%/17%. Given that 49% of all reads were unalignable, we estimate that 11% = 49%×23% of all reads were from axolotl but were unalignable either due to an incomplete assembly or sequencing error. Examining the sets of human proteins hit by the AL and UN reads, we found that 73% of the human proteins hit by either the AL or UN reads are hit by the AL reads. Thus we estimate that our axolotl assembly represents 73% of the transcriptome of our sampled tissues. A key assumption used by these analyses is that the transcripts in our axolotl assembly are not biased with respect to their sequence similarity to the human protein set. Although this assumption is not likely to be true across the board, we have no reason to believe that our assembly would be heavily biased in this respect. For additional details on the logic behind these calculations, see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>.</p>
        <p>Our approach is dependent on comparative techniques between axolotl and human transcriptomes, and thus it excludes salamander clade-specific genes. To address this, we mapped contigs to salamander genes available in NCBI (as of 5-23-2011), and recovered 677 salamander genes through this analysis. 614 of these 677 genes have reads associated with them. However, 88% of the contigs that mapped to a salamander gene were also mapped to a human gene. We also identify ∼80,000 contigs with BLAST e values &gt; = 10<sup>−5</sup> (to both salamander and human gene sets), which are generally shorter (median length = 480) than contigs with significant BLAST hits (median length = 602). While these contigs lack ties to human and salamander annotations, the expression patterns of many of them indicate that they likely are involved in the regenerative response.

        <title>Data quality</title>
        <p>We performed differential expression (DE) analysis through the time course comparing each time point after the zero hour control to the zero hour control using EdgeR (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref> for details) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Robinson1">[25]</xref>. For all downstream analyses, we consider only those genes with a false discovery rate (FDR)&lt;0.05.

We found that the expression pattern (relative to the zero hour control) matches closely in all 19 genes (average Pearson coefficient for all 19 genes = 0.741) (see <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g002">Figure 2</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s002">Figure S2</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s008">Table S2</xref>).

        <title>Comparison of the comparative RNA-seq approach to a simpler contig-level approach</title>
        <p>Our comparative approach to DE analysis of RNA-seq data may be contrasted with a simpler approach that performs the analysis directly at the level of individual contigs. In this contig-level approach, read counts are estimated for individual contigs in each sample and used to predict contigs that are DE (see <xref ref-type="sec" rid="s4">Materials and Methods</xref>). Contigs predicted to be DE may then be functionally analyzed through annotations obtained by BLAST hits to a well-characterized gene set, such as that of the human.</p>
        <p>We implemented the contig-level DE approach and found that it predicted 3,671 contigs as DE at any time point. These 3,671 DE contigs mapped to 1,040 human genes, a significantly smaller set (p&lt;2.2e-16, Fisher's exact test) than the 1,656 genes predicted as DE by the comparative approach. The smaller number of DE genes predicted by the contig-level approach is probably due to the fact that read counts had a significantly higher variance (p&lt;0.002, Wilcoxon signed rank test) at the contig-level (median edgeR common dispersion = 0.11) than at the human gene level (median edgeR common dispersion = 0.05). Read count estimates have higher variance at the contig level because contigs are typically shorter than full-length transcripts and often have high sequence similarity to other contigs that may represent alternative isoforms of the same gene. Thus, the comparative approach gains more statistical power for DE tests through its use of less variable counts at the human gene level.</p>
        <p>Of the 19 genes validated by qPCR that were called DE by the comparative gene-level approach, only 13 were called as DE by the contig-level method, and of the 19 contigs used for qPCR primer design, only 10 were called as DE. Given that the qPCR data support that these 19 genes and contigs were all DE across the time course, these results indicate that the comparative approach has superior statistical power. Examining the two DE gene sets, 709 genes are called as DE by both approaches. Of the 331 DE genes uniquely called by the contig-level method, two were identified as limb development genes (based on the 101 limb genes in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s003">Figure S3</xref>), whereas the 947 DE genes uniquely called by the comparative method included 19 of these 101 limb development genes. This result also indicates that the comparative approach had more power on our data, although the difference between the numbers of limb development genes uniquely called by the two methods is not statistically significant (p = 0.13, Fisher's exact test).</p>
        <p>Interestingly, a large fraction (53%) of the DE contigs did not have significant BLAST hits with the human gene set. These contigs were somewhat shorter (640 bp median length) than DE contigs with a significant BLAST hit (727 bp median length, p&lt;2.2e-16, Wilcoxon rank sum test). More revealingly, through an analysis of the lengths of the longest open reading frames (ORFs) within the DE contigs, we found that the DE contigs without a significant BLAST hit generally had a much smaller fraction of their length contained within their longest ORF (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s004">Figure S4</xref>). In addition, the distribution of the fractional lengths of the ORFs in shuffled contig sequences was relatively similar to that in the DE contigs without significant BLAST hits. These results suggest that these contigs are largely non-coding and may be derived from non-coding genes or the UTRs of protein-coding genes. Thus, the DE results obtained from our comparative method are likely capturing the vast majority of the protein-coding genes involved in axolotl limb regeneration.</p>

        <title>Patterns of gene expression along the juvenile blastemal time course: early oncogenes, later limb/blastemal genes</title>
        <p>We evaluated the entire list of DE genes and a subset of that list containing only transcription factors (TFs). Global DE statistics are available in . (And lists of all significantly differentially expressed genes and the TF list are available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.axolomics.org" xlink:type="simple">www.axolomics.org</ext-link>.) We performed two-dimensional clustering of all DE TFs along the time course (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g003">Figure 3</xref>), and found that oncogenes dominate during the first day, while TFs associated with limb development or regeneration, such as HOXD10 and HOXD11, peak at days 10 to 14 (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g003">Figure 3</xref>). We assessed the confidence of our sample clustering by performing cluster bootstrapping analysis (10,000 iterations) with the R package PVClust.

The observation of a burst of oncogenes early in the formation of the blastema is novel.

Note that oncogenes are very significantly enriched in the upregulated DE set (p&lt;10<sup>−5</sup>) during the first day, and continue to show some enrichment (p&lt;0.05) through day 10. Later in the time course, oncogenes are not significantly enriched in the upregulated DE gene sets. We also find significant enrichment of oncogenes in upregulated DE gene sets of the time points of the first day as a group (0 hr, 3 hr, 6 hr, 12 hr, 1 d) compared to later time points as a group (3 d, 5 d, 7 d, 10 d, 14 d, 21 d, 28 d) (p = 0.018).</p>

      <title>Discussion</title>
      <p>Evaluation of gene expression patterns in the blastema time course reveals a prominent burst of oncogene expression during the first day of blastema formation. In addition, our blastema-enriched gene set confirms many known findings from the limb development and limb regeneration literature including genes known to be expressed in the blastema or limb bud. This fact, when combined with qPCR validation of biological replicates, suggest that the RNA-seq data is robust and that the many novel blastemal-enriched genes we discover are strong candidate genes crucial for regeneration. Some of these novel genes include SALL genes, putative patterning and limb development genes, oncogenes, and HMG genes. These genes play roles in the establishment or maintenance of the stem cell state, chromatin accessibility, proximal/distal patterning, and cell cycle control. Novel gene categories are discussed below.</p>

        <p>The SALL genes (<italic>SALL4</italic>, <italic>SALL3</italic>, <italic>SALL1</italic>) are among the most highly upregulated TFs. <italic>SALL4</italic> has been shown to play a role in <italic>Xenopus</italic> limb development, and thus is a strong candidate for being involved in the regenerative process <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Neff1">[40]</xref>. The concordance of axolotl blastemal expression patterns of <italic>SALL1</italic>, <italic>SALL3</italic>, and <italic>SALL4</italic> with those in <italic>Xenopus</italic> supports the suggestion that <italic>SALL4</italic> plays a role in initiating blastema cell formation while <italic>SALL1</italic> and <italic>SALL3</italic> are involved in patterning events <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Kawakami1">[37]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Neff1">[40]</xref> (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g008">Figure 8</xref>).

        <p>Important homeobox (HOX) genes that are markers of, and perhaps specifiers of, proximal/distal pattern (<italic>HOXD10</italic>, <italic>HOXD11</italic>) are upregulated during the juvenile time course.

        <title>Oncogenes and tumor suppressors</title>
        <p>Analysis of genes expressed in the blastema over the time course indicates that oncogenes are activated early in the process and then downregulated. Oncogenes play multiple roles during development and may be crucial for opening chromatin to reactivate developmental programs. During the early time periods of blastema formation, both dedifferentiation and proliferation are thought to occur <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Nye1">[7]</xref>, and oncogenes may be playing roles in both of these processes. RAS and JUN family oncogenes are upregulated during newt lens regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Maki1">[16]</xref>.</p>
        <p>Tumor suppressors are also upregulated in the juvenile blastema. It is possible that tumor suppressors and oncogenes maintain a critical balance in the blastema. <italic>HMGA2</italic>, which is highly upregulated in the blastema, inactivates the tumor suppressor <italic>ARF</italic> in neural stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Nishino1">[42]</xref>. <italic>ARF</italic> inactivation has been shown to be important for activating regenerative muscle cells in the mouse <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Pajcini1">[58]</xref>.

        <title>HMG genes and chromatin modifiers</title>
        <p>HMGA1 and HMGA2 are highly over-represented in the blastema. HMG genes play a role in adult stem cells and in opening chromatin, preventing differentiation, and encouraging self-renewal of stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Nishino1">[42]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Lee1">[60]</xref>. <italic>HMGA2</italic> has been identified as a promoter of self-renewal and is more highly expressed in young adult stem cells than older adult stem cells <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Nishino1">[42]</xref>. Our observed upregulation of <italic>HMGA2</italic> in the blastema might be an indicator of the presence of actively renewing adult stem cells in the blastema. The axolotl blastema is likely composed of a variety of adult stem cells each with its own limited differentiation capacity <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Kragl1">[4]</xref>. Likewise, the zebrafish jaw blastema appears composed of distinct progenitors for muscle and skeleton <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Wang2">[61]</xref>. In the present study, no attempt is made to separate out the various progenitor cell types within the blastema. The upregulated genes identified here provide a springboard for the development of markers and affinity reagents for dissecting out the various cell types within the blastema. For instance, further studies using in situ hybridization for highly upregulated factors could potentially identify progenitor cell-specific transcripts based on position within the developing blastema, time of expression, and/or co-staining with mature cell-specific markers (e.g. muscle markers, cartilage markers, nerve markers), which would be expressed later in the time course or during limb regeneration. Finally, the upregulation of <italic>HMGA2</italic>, with its association with young stem cells, is consistent with the suggestion that the blastema is a “young” tissue where it is recapitulating developmental patterns of gene expression resulting in a possibly rejuvenated limb after regeneration <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-McCusker1">[62]</xref>. Verification of this possibility will require investigation of telomere length and other markers of aging before and after regeneration.</p>
        <p>Reprogramming differentiated cells back to the appropriate adult stem cell state likely involves chromatin remodeling and suppression of parental gene expression programs via the polycomb group (PCG) complex. Blastema-enriched genes include several involved in chromatin remodeling, the PCG complex, gene silencing, and DNA methylation (<italic>UHRF1</italic>, <italic>EED</italic>, <italic>SETDB1</italic>) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Federico1">[63]</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Bilodeau1">[65]</xref>.</p>

        <title>Conclusions</title>
        <p>In summary, the genes identified in this study as blastema-enriched, and active during different phases of blastema progression greatly expand the list of potential regulators of the regeneration process, providing clues as to how the axolotl regenerates its limbs and, by extension, how to potentially improve the regenerative response in mammals. To elicit a more effective regenerative response in mammals, it will be necessary to activate endogenous and exogenous genes in an appropriate, time- and pattern-controlled manner. It is feasible, however, that activation of appropriate networks would engage latent mechanisms that might simplify portions of this process. Although enhancing limb or tissue regeneration in mammals may be complicated by salamander-specific innovations <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Whited1">[10]</xref>, even partial regeneration of limb tissue or enhanced regeneration of tissues and organs has significant clinical implications.</p>
        <p>The fact that we identify many genes previously known to be involved in the regeneration process validates our comparative RNA-seq analysis methods as does the close concordance of expression patterns between our RNA-seq data and our qPCR results. Our methods draw strength from aligning reads directly to axolotl transcript contigs while performing differential expression analysis with respect to the better characterized human gene set. This strategy will likely be beneficial in studies of transcriptomes from other non-model organisms. Although we are unable to identify the functional roles of axolotl-specific genes that play a part in regeneration with this strategy, our analyses provide lists of axolotl-specific contigs that should be studied in more depth experimentally.</p>

        <p>We amputated juvenile axolotl right forelimbs at the mid-stylopod level. For the RNA-seq experiment, the animals were 4.5–8 cm in length.

Tissue was harvested as described in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g001">Figure 1</xref> at 0 hours, 3 hours, 6 hours, 12 hours, 1 day, 3 days, 5 days, 7 days, 10 days, 14 days, 21 days, and 28 days. Note that for the early time points, some tissue was harvested proximal to the original amputation plane owing to the small amount of regenerative tissue distal to the amputation plane at the time of harvesting. In all cases the harvested tissues were stored in RNAlater (Qiagen, Valencia, CA) at 4°C. In all experiments, samples are placed in denaturing lysis buffer provided in the RNA isolation kit from the manufacturer and homogenized by passing through a sterile 20-gauge needle attached to a sterile plastic syringe at least 5–10 times until a homogeneous lysate is achieved. For the RNA-seq experiments, the RNA was purified using the RNeasy purification kit from Qiagen.

RSEM v1.1.6 <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Li1">[19]</xref>, an RNA-seq quantification tool that does not require a reference genome, was used to estimate the relative abundances and expected read counts for the contigs. The default options for RSEM were used except where we specified the –no-polyA option for rsem-prepare-reference (as is appropriate for <italic>de novo</italic> transcriptome assemblies) and the –phred64-quals option for rsem-calculate-expression (to indicate the correct quality score encoding of the read data). By default, RSEM uses the Bowtie aligner <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Langmead1">[93]</xref> to map the reads against the contigs and we had Bowtie v0.12.1 installed for this purpose. Contigs mapping to rRNA transcripts (as determined through BLAST analyses described below) were removed and abundances were renormalized.</p>
        <p>Because the axolotl transcriptome is largely uncharacterized, we analyzed the dynamics and functions of transcripts in the regenerating limb with respect to the human gene set. To this end, we first used BLAST (NCBI BLAST v2.2.18) to align the contigs against human RefSeq (dated 12-07-2009) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Pruitt1">[94]</xref> RNA (via BLASTN) and protein sequences (via BLASTX), taking the best BLAST hit with e-value less than 10<sup>−5</sup> as the most closely related human homolog for each contig. When there was a tie for the best BLAST hit, the hit listed first was used arbitrarily. The expected read counts for contigs mapping to the same homologous human transcript were summed to give abundances. Read counts for human transcripts belonging to the same gene were summed to give human gene-level abundances. Abundances in terms of TPM were calculated by normalizing the read counts by the sums of the effective lengths (contig length – read length) of the axolotl contigs mapping to each gene and subsequently normalizing these values so that they summed to one million.</p>
        <p>Expected read counts were used as input to differential expression analysis by EdgeR (version 3.0.0, R version 2.1.5) <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Robinson1">[25]</xref>. Because we only had one biological replicate per time point, we compared pairs of samples from consecutive time points to obtain estimates of biological variation for DE analyses. EdgeR was used to estimate the common dispersion factor for each pair of samples from consecutive time points and the median of these values was used as the common dispersion factor for our DE analyses. For our comparative method, which uses counts at the human gene level, the common dispersion was 0.05, whereas for the contig-level approach, this value was 0.11. With the appropriate common dispersion factor, EdgeR was used to predict the set of DE genes or contigs at each time point with respect to the zero hour control sample. Unless otherwise specified, genes were determined to be DE by application of one criterion: a Benjamini-Hochberg <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Benjamini1">[95]</xref> adjusted p-value of less than 0.05.</p>

        <title>Analysis of the completeness of the axolotl assembly</title>
        <p>From each of the juvenile time course samples (average total number of reads ∼17.5 million), we extracted all very high quality reads (average phred score &gt; = 38) and partitioned them into two sets: those that had an alignment against the axolotl assembly (AL = aligned) and those that did not (UN = unaligned). Only the highest quality reads were selected to reduce bias in later steps because lower quality reads are less likely to be alignable. This step resulted in ∼5 million reads per sample on average (∼2.8 million aligned and ∼2.2 million unaligned on average). We ran BLASTX with these reads against the human RefSeq protein set with an e-value cutoff of 1e-5 and a single top hit for each read was reported.</p>
        <p>For each read, we consider the following possible events: it has an alignment to the axolotl assembly (AL); it does not have an alignment to the axolotl assembly (UN); it is truly derived from an axolotl transcript (A); it is not derived from an axolotl transcript (NA); it has a BLASTX hit (B); and it has average phred score &gt; = 38 (HQ). For the BLASTX analysis of the UN reads, we have<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002936.e001"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002936.e001" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where in the second line we assume that NA reads will not have any BLASTX hits, as these are presumably RNA-seq protocol artifacts, and in the third line, we assume that the quality of a read is independent of whether it is derived from axolotl and that having a BLASTX hit is independent of whether the read is aligned (AL), given that it is truly from axolotl. Then, considering the BLASTX analysis of the AL reads, we have<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002936.e002"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002936.e002" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>where in the second line we assume that all AL reads are from axolotl and in the third line we again assume that having a BLASTX hit is independent of whether the read as aligned (AL), given that it is truly from axolotl. Putting these two equations together, we have<disp-formula id="pcbi.1002936.e003"><graphic position="anchor" xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002936.e003" xlink:type="simple"/></disp-formula>and thus we can estimate the fraction of UN reads that are truly from axolotl from the fractions of the UN HQ and AL HQ reads that have BLASTX hits. To estimate the fraction of reads that are from axolotl but were unalignable, we simply compute <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002936.e004" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula>. In the case of false positive BLASTX hits from NA reads, we will overestimate <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002936.e005" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> because such hits will cause our estimate of <inline-formula><inline-graphic xlink:href="info:doi/10.1371/journal.pcbi.1002936.e006" xlink:type="simple"/></inline-formula> to be higher. Therefore our estimates of the completeness of the assembly are conservative.</p>

        <title>GO analysis and clustering</title>
        <p>We used DAVID (version 6.7) to perform Gene Ontology (GO) analysis <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Huangda1">[49]</xref>. The statistically significant (FDR&lt;0.05) upregulated genes compared to the zero hour control were used as input to DAVID. Each time point's upregulated genes were submitted to DAVID functional analysis chart GO analysis, with the background set being the set of human genes to which axolotl contigs had significant (e-value&lt;1e-5) best BLAST hits and had at least one matching read in our RNA-seq data. (The background set is available at axolomics.org, as are all of the DAVID result files.) For DAVID analysis, the following settings were used: categories selected are GOTERM_BP_5, GOTERM_MF_5; threshold options are Counts = 2, EASE = 0.1). The GO heat map (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g006">Figure 6</xref>) was constructed by creating a table of the DAVID FDR scores for each GO term with an FDR&lt;0.01 at any time point. The negative log base 10 of these FDR values was used in the heat map, and these values are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s010">Table S4</xref>. MeV 4.8.1 (<ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://www.tm4.org/mev/" xlink:type="simple">http://www.tm4.org/mev/</ext-link>) was used to cluster the GO terms (hierarchical clustering with distance measure = Pearson Correlation, linkage = average).</p>
        <p>We performed sample and gene clustering using MeV 4.8.1. Hierarchical cluster analyses were carried out with Pearson uncentered correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g003">Figure 3</xref>, <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g004">Figure 4</xref>) or Pearson correlation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g006">Figure 6</xref>) as the distance measurement with average linkage. Pearson uncentered correlation was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g003">Figures 3</xref> and <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g004">4</xref> because log fold changes are expected to be centered around zero (no fold change), whereas Pearson correlation was used for <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g006">Figure 6</xref> because −log(FDR) values are all non-negative. Clusters and heat maps were visualized via MeV 4.8.1.</p>
        <p>To assess the uncertainty in hierarchical cluster analysis over samples, we applied bootstrap resampling (10,000 iterations) via the R package Pvclust <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Suzuki1">[26]</xref>. The uncentered Pearson correlation is used as the distance metric with average linkage. Pvclust provides the Bootstrap Probability (BP) value from the ordinary bootstrap resampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Felsenstein1">[96]</xref> and the Approximately Unbiased (AU) probability value from multiscale bootstrap resampling <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Suzuki1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Shimodaira1">[97]</xref>. The ordinary bootstrap resampling method has been shown to be biased especially when genes are correlated. The multiscale bootstrap resampling method was introduced to develop an approximately unbiased test, and therefore it provides better estimations of the probability values <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Suzuki1">[26]</xref>, <xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pcbi.1002936-Shimodaira1">[97]</xref>. Let N denote the original number of genes. In multiscale resampling, instead of resampling N genes in each of 10,000 bootstraps, we resampled the genes with 10 different data sizes (as is the default setting of the package). The resampled data sizes vary from 0.6*N to 1.4*N. The numbers above each edge show the probability of nodes below that edge occurring as a cluster in resampled trees, via ordinary bootstrap resampling (BP, green) or multiscale bootstrap resampling (AU, red).</p>

        <title>RNA isolation for reverse transcription and real-time quantitative PCR (qPCR)</title>
        <p>We isolated total RNA with the <italic>mir</italic>Vana miRNA isolation kit (Life Technologies) according to the manufacturer's protocol. Total RNA (an input range between 88 to 808 ng/µl) was treated with DNaseI (Life Technologies) for 10 min at 37°C followed by heat inactivation for 5 min at 65°C. DNaseI-treated total RNA was combined with (oligo-dT)<sub>15</sub> primer and denatured by heating to 70°C for 5 min and chilling to −4°C for 5 minutes. The denatured (oligo-dT)<sub>15</sub> primer and RNA was reverse transcribed by adding the ImPromII reverse transcription system (Promega) to generate cDNA using the following program: 5 min at 25°C, 60 min at 42°C, and 15 min at 70°C to inactivate the reverse transcriptase. Total cDNA was diluted five-fold and used at 1 µl per 10 µl of qPCR reaction with TaqMan Universal PCR Master Mix (Life Technologies). Axolotl gene specific qPCR assays were designed using PrimerQuest for PrimeTime qPCR assays (Integrative DNA Technologies). Sequences for gene specific oligos are listed below. The qPCR reactions were performed with ViiA 7 Real-Time PCR System (Life Technologies) under the following cycle conditions: 2 min at 50°C, 10 min at 95°C followed by 40 cycles of 15 sec at 95°C, 1 min at 60°C. To quantify the relative expression level of a particular gene, three independent qPCR reactions (technical replicates) were performed on biological triplicate samples for each time point analyzed, unless otherwise stated. All data points were normalized to GAPDH and relative to samples collected at the 0 hour time point using the comparative C<sub>T</sub> (ΔΔCT) method.

        <title>qPCR data analysis</title>
        <p>For comparing RNA-seq data to qPCR data, the data were analyzed as follows: For RNA-seq data, the log<sub>2</sub> ratio = log<sub>2</sub> (TPM at time point x+1)/(TPM at time zero+1). One was added to TPMs to avoid divide by zero errors, log(0) errors, and to avoid obtaining a high ratio when both TPMs are low. For qPCR, ΔCT is defined as the difference in the cycle threshold (CT) between the gene of interest and the GAPDH control. For qPCR data, the log2 ratio = log<sub>2</sub>(ΔCT at time point x)/(ΔCT at time zero). Any ΔCT ratios of 0 were changed to 0.1 before log transformation to avoid error. For genes with undetectable levels from samples collected at 0 hour, CT values were assigned at 40 to avoid error.</p>
        <p><xref ref-type="fig" rid="pcbi-1002936-g002">Figure 2</xref> contains plots of the log2 ratios of RNA-seq and qPCR for four genes. The plots for the additional 15 genes validated by qPCR are shown in <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pcbi.1002936.s002">Figure S2</xref>. Upon analysis of this data, we noticed that for genes with a late peak (limb genes such as HOXD10), the qPCR peak is often delayed compared to the RNA-seq peak. The animals used for the qPCR experiment were slightly larger than the animals used for the RNA-seq experiment (7–10 cm for qPCR, vs. 4.5–8 cm for RNA-seq). It is well known that larger animals regenerate more slowly. Because of this lag in the later qPCR time points, when we calculate the Pearson correlation, we remove the 3 d time point from the qPCR data and then “shift left” the remaining qPCR time points. Thus we compare the 3 hr–21 d RNA-seq samples to the 3 hr–1 d plus 5 d–28 d qPCR samples. This comparison was used for the Pearson correlation calculation.</p>
