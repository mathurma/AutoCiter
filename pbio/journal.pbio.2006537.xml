<abstract>
<p>The development of highly complex vocal skill, like human language and bird songs, is underlain by learning. Vocal learning, even when occurring in adulthood, is thought to largely depend on a sensitive/critical period during postnatal development, and learned vocal patterns emerge gradually as the long-term consequence of vocal practice during this critical period. In this scenario, it is presumed that the effect of vocal practice is thus mainly limited by the intrinsic timing of age-dependent maturation factors that close the critical period and reduce neural plasticity. However, an alternative, as-yet untested hypothesis is that vocal practice itself, independently of age, regulates vocal learning plasticity. Here, we explicitly discriminate between the influences of age and vocal practice using a songbird model system. We prevented zebra finches from singing during the critical period of sensorimotor learning by reversible postural manipulation. This enabled to us to separate lifelong vocal experience from the effects of age. The singing-prevented birds produced juvenile-like immature song and retained sufficient ability to acquire a tutored song even at adulthood when allowed to sing freely. Genome-wide gene expression network analysis revealed that this adult vocal plasticity was accompanied by an intense induction of singing activity-dependent genes, similar to that observed in juvenile birds, rather than of age-dependent genes. The transcriptional changes of activity-dependent genes occurred in the vocal motor robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) projection neurons that play a critical role in the production of song phonology. These gene expression changes were accompanied by neuroanatomical changes: dendritic spine pruning in RA projection neurons. These results show that self-motivated practice itself changes the expression dynamics of activity-dependent genes associated with vocal learning plasticity and that this process is not tightly linked to age-dependent maturational factors.</p>

<title>Author summary</title>
<p>How is plasticity associated with vocal learning regulated during a critical period? Although there are abundant studies on the critical period in sensory systems, which are passively regulated by the external environment, few studies have manipulated the sensorimotor experience through the entire critical period. Thus, it is a commonly held belief that age or intrinsic maturation is a crucial factor for the closure of the critical period of vocal learning. Contrary to this idea, our study using songbirds provides a new insight that self-motivated vocal practice, not age, regulates vocal learning plasticity during the critical period. To examine the effects of vocal practice on vocal learning, we prevented juvenile zebra finches from singing during the critical period by postural manipulation, which separated the contribution of lifelong vocal experience from that of age. When these birds were allowed to freely sing as adults, they generated highly plastic songs and maintained the ability to mimic tutored songs, as normal juveniles did. Genome-wide transcriptome analysis revealed that both juveniles and singing-prevented adults, but not normally reared adults, expressed a similar set of singing-dependent genes in a song nucleus in the brain that regulates syllable acoustics. However, age-dependent genes were still similarly expressed in both singing-prevented and normally reared adult birds. These results exhibit that vocal learning plasticity is actively controlled by self-motivated vocal practice.</p>

<title>Introduction</title>
<p>Both human speech and birdsong are acquired through vocal learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref002">2</xref>]. This learning process is achieved through sensory learning to memorize model sounds and sensorimotor learning based on matching auditory inputs and motor output to the model sounds by iterative self-motivated practice of vocalization. However, neither humans nor songbirds maintain their vocal learning ability equally well during all phases of life; the ability is circumscribed by critical/sensitive periods for vocal learning. Although there exist abundant studies on the critical period of sensory system development regulated by environmental stimuli [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref003">3</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref005">5</xref>], the neural mechanisms underlying the critical period for sensorimotor learning, especially for vocal learning, are not well understood.</p>
<p>The songbird is highly advantageous for studying the neural substrate of vocal learning and its critical period. The critical period of song learning includes 2 phases, the sensory and sensorimotor learning phases (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). In the sensory learning phase, juveniles acquire sensory memories of song by listening to adult birds’ songs, which serve as a template to imitate. The sensorimotor learning phase starts with the generation of soft and highly variable syllables, called “subsong.” Thereafter, birds start producing “plastic song,” characterized by the gradual inclusion of recognizable yet variable syllables. At the end of the learning process, the song is crystallized with acoustically and sequentially stable syllable patterns (“crystallized song”). In a closed-ended vocal learner songbird, like the zebra finch, the time window of the sensorimotor learning phase lasts 2 months, beginning in juveniles at 30–45 post hatching day (phd) and ending in adulthood at 90–100 phd with the production of crystallized motif song patterns that are then maintained throughout life (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>). During the sensorimotor learning phase, zebra finches produce approximately 1,000 song renditions in a day through self-motivated vocal practice [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref006">6</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref008">8</xref>].</p>

<p>Neuronal activity itself causes genetic responses in the brain. These activity-dependent genes either directly or indirectly influence the physiological function and structural maturation of neural circuits as genetic regulators for long-term neuronal plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref009">9</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref011">11</xref>]. Singing behavior also induces a set of activity-dependent genes in specialized brain regions, called the song nuclei (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref012">12</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref015">15</xref>]. The song nuclei are interconnected to form neural pathways for vocal learning and production [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref001">1</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref016">16</xref>]. Some of the singing activity–dependent genes are differentially regulated in the song nuclei between juvenile and adult stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref019">19</xref>]. However, a large variety of genes are developmentally regulated as age-related genes during the critical period of vocal learning in the song nuclei [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref020">20</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref022">22</xref>]. These studies suggest that the differentially regulated genes during the sensorimotor learning phase could be crucial molecules for modulation of vocal learning plasticity.</p>

<p>In this study, we investigated first how self-motivated vocal practice influences song maturation and second whether such practice modulates vocal learning plasticity during the sensorimotor learning phase in the zebra finch. Using a reversible singing prevention paradigm, we found that cumulative singing practice itself is an essential regulator of vocal learning plasticity: singing-prevented (SP) birds retained the ability to imitate a memorized tutored song into adulthood, well beyond the critical period of the sensorimotor learning phase. This age-independent sensorimotor learning was accompanied by significant changes in the expression of singing activity–dependent genes—but not age-related genes—in the projection neurons of song nuclei RA. Furthermore, the number of dendritic spines of the robust nucleus of the arcopallium (RA) was also affected by cumulative singing practice. These results show that self-motivated practice itself changes the expression dynamics of activity-dependent genes associated with vocal learning plasticity and that this process is not completely determined by age-dependent maturational factors.</p>

<title>Prevention of vocal practice extends the sensorimotor learning period in the zebra finch</title>
<p>The zebra finch (<italic>Taeniopygia guttata</italic>) is termed a closed-ended learner songbird because they can only learn during a critical period and subsequently produce a stereotyped song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1A</xref>)[<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref023">23</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref024">24</xref>]. To elucidate the importance of self-motivated vocal practice to song development during the sensorimotor learning phase in contrast to age itself, we prevented juvenile zebra finches from singing before initiation of their first song (approximately 30 phd) until adulthood (91–133 phd, mean = 101.6 phd) by postural manipulation (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s001">S1 Fig</xref>). The postural manipulation was performed by attaching a custom-made weight on the neck of juvenile birds only during daylight hours, based on a modified method that uses weights to manipulate singing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref025">25</xref>]. The weight shifted their posture slightly toward an inferior position (approximately at 0.5–1.5 cm lower than normal height); the weight was supported by the floor of the cage (i.e., not carried by the bird’s neck). Although this manipulation prevented singing, the birds were exposed to a tutor song produced by their biological fathers and could still freely generate daily behaviors, such as drinking, eating, and producing non-song-related vocalization, like calls. The weight was detachable and daily adjusted for each bird (up to 16.5–24.0 g) so that it was at the threshold of preventing singing without adversely affecting the bird’s health or bodily growth. To account for the overall health of the animals, body weights were regularly monitored. Body weight and acoustic features of call vocalizations were not significantly different between normally reared and SP birds (<italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, 1-way ANOVA with Bonferroni correction for body weight; <italic>P</italic> &gt; 0.05, Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test for call acoustics) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), demonstrating no adverse effects on the growth of the peripheral vocal organs, such as the syrinx.</p>
<p>Singing prevention was highly effective: normal birds produce over 60,000 song bouts during the sensorimotor learning period (approximately 1,000 bouts/day × 60 days) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref006">6</xref>], while the singing prevention birds produced less than 0.1% of this output (24–485 song bouts, mean = 279.0 bouts). When the birds were released from singing prevention at adulthood, they produced “age-unmatched” immature songs with highly variable acoustics and sequence of syllables, i.e., subsong or early plastic-like song (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1B</xref>). To quantify the immaturity of song quality in SP birds, we calculated the values of pitch, pitch goodness, and amplitude modulation (AM) and the entropy variance of syllables as acoustic parameters [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref026">26</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref027">27</xref>] and motif consistency as a parameter of song sequence [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref020">20</xref>]. In all parameters, songs of the SP birds were similar to the subsong/early plastic song produced by normal juveniles (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). Despite the manipulation, in 3 of 24 birds, the weight-based postural manipulation did not affect singing practice, i.e., the birds persistently continued singing (more than 10,000 bouts of total singing). Even under the postural manipulation condition, the persistent singers developed crystallized songs with the typical motif structure and copied song traits from their tutors (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s001">S1 Fig</xref>), indicating that iterative singing experience per se but not the experimental handling influences song development and learning.</p>
<p>In adult SP birds producing immature-like plastic songs, we investigated whether or not they also retained vocal learning plasticity to mimic the tutor songs that they had already memorized. We found that SP birds quickly crystallized structured songs within 4 weeks after release at adulthood (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1D</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s002">S2 Fig</xref>), which was less than half the duration of the normal sensorimotor learning period in the zebra finch. Moreover, the syllables produced by the SP birds, despite being crystallized so rapidly, had the same acoustic traits that were observed in unmanipulated adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1C</xref>). In addition, the SP adult birds did not only develop species-typical crystalized songs, but they also mimicked their tutor songs at the levels of both syllable acoustics and sequence (motif) features. Comparison between the songs produced at 1–2 days after release (phd 101–103) and ones after 3–4 weeks (phd 120–126) revealed a significant increase of syllable and motif similarity scores toward their tutor songs (paired <italic>t</italic> test: syllable, <italic>t</italic>(4) = 7.7, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0015; motif, <italic>t</italic>(4) = 5.8, <italic>P</italic> = 0.0044) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). A subset of the SP adults near-perfectly mimicked the phonology and sequence order of all syllables of the memorized tutor song (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s002">S2 Fig</xref>). Consistently, the SP birds showed a similar imitation accuracy of their acquired songs against tutor songs as did the birds that persistently continued singing (Welch’s <italic>t</italic> test: syllable, <italic>t</italic>(6) = 0.68, <italic>P</italic> = 0.52; motif, <italic>t</italic>(6) = 1.2, <italic>P</italic> = 0.27) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g001">Fig 1E and 1F</xref>). These results indicate that cumulative singing experience (i.e., vocal practice) acts as an age-independent sensorimotor learning mechanism in the zebra finch.</p>

<title>Cumulative singing experience, but not age, regulates a novel set of singing activity–dependent genes</title>
<p>We conducted a genome-wide gene expression network analysis comparing juvenile, adult, and SP adult (1–2 days after release from the postural manipulation) birds to elucidate the transcriptional impacts of cumulative singing experience versus age in the brain regions. The song nuclei are interconnected to form 2 functional circuits: one being the vocal motor pathway (VMP) and another forming the anterior forebrain pathway (AFP), a cortical–basal ganglia–thalamic loop (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref028">28</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref030">30</xref>]. For this purpose, we sampled laser microdissected tissues of 2 song nuclei HVC and RA in the VMP, which regulate syllable sequence and acoustics, respectively (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2A and 2B</xref>). In 12,156 genes expressed in the telencephalon of the zebra finch, 3,214 and 1,811 genes were identified in HVC and RA, respectively, as genes that were differentially regulated by age and/or singing. For these genes, a weighted gene coexpression network analysis (WGCNA) identified 5 and 4 “Gene Clusters” in HVC and RA, respectively, as the coexpressed genes correlated with singing experience, age, and/or singing induction (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). Only one of the gene clusters, RA Gene Cluster I, met criteria that were significantly regulated by cumulative singing experience instead of age. This gene cluster contained 119 genes, including a novel set of singing activity–dependent genes (transcription factors/regulators: <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>Crem</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, and <italic>Irf8</italic>; subunits of histone deacetylase complex: <italic>Fam60a</italic>; serine/threonine kinases: <italic>Sik1</italic> and <italic>Sgk1</italic>; and mitogen-activated protein (MAP) kinase phosphatases: <italic>Dusp5</italic> and <italic>6</italic>). In general, the expression of neuronal activity–dependent genes in song nuclei is regulated by singing rather than hearing [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref020">20</xref>]. RA Gene Cluster I was induced by diurnal acute singing. However, the singing-driven induction response was gradually attenuated as singing experience accumulated over time (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2E and 2F</xref>), suggesting that the long-term cumulative experience of vocal practice progressively dampens the expression of singing activity–dependent genes as the sensorimotor learning phase progresses.</p>
<p>WGCNA further indicated that other gene clusters (Cluster II and III) were regulated by both singing experience and age (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2C–2E</xref>). However, when comparing each individual gene expression of the clusters in the expression heat map, most of the genes in Cluster II and III were similarly expressed in both normally reared and SP birds as age-regulated genes (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2F</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s003">S3 Fig</xref>), indicating that SP birds normally retain the developmental expression dynamics of age-regulated genes. In line with this, a <italic>cis</italic>-enrichment analysis revealed that differentially unique sets of transcription factors presumably bound the promoter regions of the coexpressed genes between different clusters. For an example, transcription factor families, including <italic>Nf-κB</italic>, <italic>Creb/Atf</italic>, <italic>Sp</italic>, <italic>Rfx</italic>, and <italic>Pax</italic>, were significantly enriched in putative proximal promoter regions (less than 1 kb from the transcription start site [TSS]) of the RA Cluster I genes but were not enriched in Cluster II genes (both Fisher’s exact test and G test, <italic>p</italic> &lt; 0.05) (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2G</xref>). These results suggest cumulative singing experience regulates the transcriptional of activity-dependent genes in RA.</p>
<p>In addition, to ensure that the expression of RA Cluster I genes reflects cumulative singing experience but not age, we further performed direct comparisons of the RA transcriptomes between the SP adult singing versus the normal adult singing groups and between the SP adult singing versus the juvenile singing groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g003">Fig 3</xref>). As the result, a total 57 of 119 RA Cluster I genes were sorted into the differentially regulated genes between the SP adult versus the normal adult groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g003">Fig 3B</xref>; green) but few into the ones between the SP adult versus juvenile groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g003">Fig 3B</xref>; purple). This result reconfirms that the expression of singing activity–dependent genes in the RA Cluster I is modified by cumulative singing experience instead of age.</p>

<title>Expression of cumulative singing experience–regulated genes in the song nuclei</title>
<p>To reveal the expression pattern of the cumulative singing experience–regulated genes in the entire song nuclei for vocal learning and production, we compared gene expression between silent and singing conditions in juveniles, adults, and SP adults (1–2 days after their release from the postural manipulation). We chose 13 genes: <italic>Arc</italic>, <italic>Crem</italic>, <italic>Nr4a1</italic>, <italic>Sik1</italic>, <italic>Dusp5</italic>, <italic>Fam60a</italic>, <italic>Atf3</italic>, <italic>c-fos</italic>, <italic>Egr1</italic>, <italic>H3</italic>.<italic>3b</italic>, <italic>Gadd45b</italic>, <italic>Dusp6</italic>, and <italic>Odc</italic>, which were independently identified as the cumulative singing experience–regulated genes by WGCNA (RA Cluster I genes in <xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2</xref>) and the direct transcriptome comparison between normal and SP singing birds (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g003">Fig 3</xref>). All 13 tested genes were induced by singing and had a unique expression pattern in song nuclei between the 3 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g004">Fig 4A</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s005">S5</xref> Figs). In addition, singing activity–dependent gene expressions were differently regulated among song nuclei and also between the juvenile, adult, and SP adult groups. For example, <italic>Arc</italic> was consistently and intensely induced by singing in HVC, lateral magnocellular nucleus (LMAN), and Area X in all 3 groups. However, in RA, although juveniles and SP adult birds showed strong response of <italic>Arc</italic> expression after singing, the singing-driven induction was attenuated in normal adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g004">Fig 4A</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s004">S4 Fig</xref>). We therefore compared each gene induction after singing in each song nucleus between the 3 groups and then identified that RA is a major region that differently regulated the singing-driven induction response between the 3 groups (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g004">Fig 4B</xref>, <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s004">S4</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s005">S5</xref> Figs). SP adults showed a striking resemblance to normal juveniles in the expression dynamics of the cumulative singing experience–regulated genes throughout song nuclei that was unlike normally reared adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g004">Fig 4B</xref>). Induction of 5 of 13 tested genes (<italic>Arc</italic>, <italic>Fam60a</italic>, <italic>Dusp6</italic>, <italic>Odc</italic>, and <italic>Gadd45b</italic>) was almost fully repressed in RA during adult singing, although singing evokes robust neuronal activity in RA in both juvenile and adult stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref031">31</xref>]. In contrast, a set of age-regulated genes identified as RA Gene Cluster II (including <italic>Gabra5</italic>, <italic>Evl</italic>, <italic>Dpysl3</italic>, and <italic>Il1rapl2</italic>) showed similar expression levels and patterns between SP and normal adults (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g004">Fig 4A and 4B</xref> and <xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s006">S6 Fig</xref>). These results indicate that SP birds selectively maintain juvenile-like expression for singing activity–dependent genes but express age-regulated genes in the entire song circuits similarly to untreated adults.</p>

<title>Discussion</title>
<p>We revealed here that cumulative singing experience regulates song development, the expression dynamics of activity-dependent genes, and dendritic spine density of RA projection neurons. These results demonstrate that singing practice, rather than age, acts as a nongenetic factor to regulate vocal learning plasticity. A number of neural circuits mature during the critical period of heightened neuronal plasticity early in life [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref003">3</xref>]. Past studies have shed light on the effects of “passive” sensory experience from the external environment on the regulation of critical periods of sensory systems [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref040">40</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref042">42</xref>]. Sensory input induces gene expression for the functional and structural plasticity of synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref043">43</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref044">44</xref>]. However, the regulatory mechanisms of the critical period of sensorimotor learning for the “active” acquisition of sequential motor skills, such as human language, playing instruments, or birdsong learning, remain unclear. In general, such complex and structured motor patterns do not suddenly emerge through the short-term experience of practice. They rather gradually develop after the cumulative experience of longer periods of self-motivated practice. Therefore, separating the effects of age (intrinsic developmental maturation) and practice (self-motivated behavior) is crucial for precise understanding of the neural mechanisms underlying the critical period of sensorimotor learning.</p>
<p>Compared with birds isolated from sensory learning (tutoring) or auditory feedback during the sensorimotor learning, SP birds produced immature subsong/early plastic songs when they were released from manipulations at adulthood (&gt;100 phd). In contrast to SP birds, both nontutored and auditory feedback–prevented birds can produce singing behavior during the sensorimotor learning phase and develop a certain degree of structured songs by adulthood even without referencing tutor song memories [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref045">45</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref047">47</xref>]. When nontutored birds in social isolation first hear tutor songs at 120 phd, they thereafter change a few syllables of their own already existing song to mimic those from their tutor’s song. However, they do not retain the vocal plasticity necessary to mimic their tutor’s song structures [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref045">45</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref046">46</xref>]. This decreased song plasticity in early isolated birds could be caused by partial closing of sensory and sensorimotor learning ability in nontutored birds at adulthood. In parallel, birds prevented from hearing their own song production through noise exposure can change syllable acoustics but not copy the sequence order of memorized tutor songs when they are released from noise exposure as adults [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref047">47</xref>]. In contrast to adult birds prevented from matching their song output to memories, SP adult birds retain sufficient vocal learning plasticity to copy both the syllable acoustics and sequence order of memorized tutor songs. This suggests that singing practice itself, rather than other age-related factors, regulates the critical phase of sensorimotor learning. The high degree of vocal learning plasticity in SP birds was associated with producing structurally immature songs when they are allowed to sing freely. Therefore, although interruption of normal tutoring and hearing experiences can retain a certain degree of vocal plasticity until the adult stage, preventing cumulative singing experience induces a more intensive effect on vocal learning plasticity by almost stopping song maturation. This song immaturity could be a direct cause of the later vocal learning plasticity, and it enabled age-independent vocal learning after the sensitive period in the SP birds. However, because of the limited sample size in this study, we could not fully examine whether the amount of singing practice during the prevention period affects individual’s song imitation accuracy after release.</p>
<p>We previously reported that early-deafened zebra finches produce a normal amount of singing during development and still maintain highly variable songs in terms of both syllable acoustics and sequence even as adults (140–180 phd) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref020">20</xref>]. Therefore, cumulative singing experience itself is not sufficient to decrease vocal plasticity. Rather, the cumulative experience of sensorimotor integration—i.e., self-motivated vocalization with normal auditory feedback (tutoring)—is an essential behavioral factor to promote song stabilization—i.e., closing of the sensorimotor learning period. However, this study does not examine a potential contribution of cumulative singing experience to closing the sensory learning phase versus the sensorimotor learning phase. To elucidate this point, it would be necessary to track the song development of SP birds that are exposed to a tutor only in adulthood. In addition, singing prevention longer than the 100 days used in the present study would allow us to examine the time limitation of retaining sensorimotor learning plasticity, which might be genetically constrained.</p>
<p>RA has a crucial role in the song circuits as the telencephalic output nucleus receiving 2 premotor inputs: a motor exploration signal from the LMAN as the cortical-basal ganglia-thalamic circuit output and a time-locked sequence signal from HVC of the motor circuit (<xref ref-type="fig" rid="pbio.2006537.g002">Fig 2A</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref048">48</xref>]. However, the 2 circuits do not equally contribute to song production during the critical period of sensorimotor learning. Early in song development, vocal output is dominated by LMAN input to RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref049">49</xref>]. With accumulation of singing experience, the LMAN’s effectiveness is curtailed by pruning and strengthening of the HVC to RA synapses [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref050">50</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref051">51</xref>]. In addition, synaptic connectivity from interneurons to projection neurons in RA is initially dense and nonspecific and then pruned with specific reciprocal patterns during sensorimotor learning [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref033">33</xref>], suggesting that song development engages multiple processes to reduce shared synaptic inputs to RA projection neurons. If so, our finding that the SP birds retained higher density of dendritic spines in the RA projection neurons like juveniles may indicate a singing experience—but not age-dependent mechanism for sculpting of functional connectivity of RA. Activity-dependent synaptic potentiation and depression are induced at the synapses of RA projection neurons [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref052">52</xref>]. Notably, zebra finch juveniles (45–60 phd) possess distinct capacity for long-term depression (LTD) in RA neurons compared with adult birds [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref053">53</xref>]. <italic>Arc</italic> is a critical regulator that modulates the synaptic plasticity underlying LTD induction [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref054">54</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref055">55</xref>]. This evidence supports a functional linkage between activity-dependent synaptic plasticity and activity-dependent gene induction in RA for regulation of vocal plasticity through the singing experience–dependent sculpting of functional connectivity.</p>
<p>Most of the singing experience–regulated genes were previously known as immediate-early genes, which regulate downstream effector proteins for activity-dependent synaptic plasticity [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref011">11</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref056">56</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref058">58</xref>]. Singing behavior generates robust neuronal activity in the song system, including RA and other song nuclei, throughout a bird’s life from juvenile to adult stages [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref031">31</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref048">48</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref059">59</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref061">61</xref>]. However, some immediate-early genes are more highly induced by singing in the song nuclei (e.g., <italic>egr1</italic>[<italic>zenk</italic>] and <italic>Arc</italic> in RA and <italic>penk</italic> in HVC) in juvenile than adult stages, although the causal reason of the developmental different induction is not known [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref017">17</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref019">19</xref>]. In this study, we found that RA shows a reduction of singing activity–dependent gene induction during the accumulation of singing experience. Which region-selective neuronal mechanisms regulate change in the expression dynamics of singing activity–dependent genes in RA? One possibility is neuronal activity–mediated epigenetic regulation—i.e., induction and activation of epigenetic regulators by neuronal firing to change epigenetic states at the regulatory regions of other activity-dependent genes [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref062">62</xref>]. In the RA Cluster I genes, we identified the epigenetic regulators that were induced by singing: a DNA methylation regulator <italic>Gadd45b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref063">63</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref064">64</xref>], replacement histone <italic>H3</italic>.<italic>3b</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref065">65</xref>], and a subunit of the Sin3–histone deacetylase 1 (HDAC1) complex <italic>Fam60a</italic> [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref066">66</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref067">67</xref>]. These singing-driven epigenetic regulators could directly change the epigenetic state of the regulatory regions of other RA Cluster I genes, but this hypothesis remains to be fully evaluated.</p>
<p>Vocal learning has evolved convergently in a few lineages of birds and mammals. Recently, there is accumulating evidence that marmoset monkeys possess the ability for production-related vocal plasticity, especially to develop acoustic features via feedback from their parents [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref068">68</xref>–<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref070">70</xref>]. Production-related vocal plasticity in marmosets could be a good mammalian model system to examine the cumulative vocal practice–related expression dynamics of activity-dependent genes that we found in songbirds. Avian vocal learners (songbirds, parrots, and hummingbirds) and humans possess analogous neural networks connecting anatomically similar cortical and subcortical brain regions as a form of convergent neural circuit evolution [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref016">16</xref>]. In addition, songbirds and humans share convergent transcriptional specializations in the brain regions for learned vocalization [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref071">71</xref>]. Therefore, language acquisition in humans could be mediated by the expression dynamics of neuronal activity–dependent genes in specific neural populations, such as cortical layer V projection neurons in laryngeal motor regions, analogous to songbirds’ RA [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref071">71</xref>]. Although many challenges remain in elucidating the neural basis of vocal learning, insights from songbirds may lead to a better understanding of the molecular mechanisms underlying learned vocal communication.</p>

<p>Zebra finch adult males were obtained from our breeding colonies at Hokkaido University. Birds were kept in breeding cages under a 13:11 hour light/dark cycle. During song-recording sessions, each bird was individually housed in a cage inside a sound-attenuating box.</p>
<p>For vocal practice restriction, singing prevention was performed from the initiation of first singing (at around 30 phd) until adult stage (<italic>n</italic> = 24 birds, 91–133 phd, mean ± SD = 101.6 ± 8.8 phd). During light-on time, juveniles were prevented from singing by a custom-made weight on the neck that shifted their posture slightly toward an inferior position (approximately at 0.5–1.5 cm lower than normal height). The weight was detachable and daily adjusted for each bird (up to 16.5–24.0 g). Note that weight was usually supported by the floor, not carried by the bird’s neck, during the days. Therefore, the birds could freely generate daily behaviors, such as drinking, eating, grooming, and calling. The weight was removed from birds during light-off time and for at least 1 hour during light-on time to reduce potential stress. During the weight-free time each day, the real-time singing behaviors were monitored with Sound Analysis Pro (SAP) and interrupted by light tapping or by opening the sound-attenuating box. No singing behavior was observed during light-off time. Body weight was carefully monitored every 2–3 days. For hearing experience to a tutor song, birds were kept with their biological fathers after hatching until 30 phd and subsequently exposed to their father every 2–4 days until adult stage.</p>

<title>Song recording and analysis</title>
<p>Songs were recorded using a unidirectional microphone (SM57, Shure) connected to a computer with SAP (v1.04) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref072">72</xref>]. Singing duration was defined as the total amount of singing during the last 30 minutes before euthanasia for brain sampling. A song bout was defined as the continuous production of syllables followed by at least 200 ms of silence.</p>
<p>Song motif consistency was measured as the motif similarity score within each day and calculated with the default setting in the SAP software using “time-course” and “symmetric” comparison modes. We randomly selected 20 bouts of songs produced after 3 PM in 1 day. The similarity scores between any 2 of 20 bouts were compared by the round-robin comparison—i.e., a total of 190 similarity scores were calculated at each developmental stage. The similarity score, which represents a global measure of percent similarity, was calculated by comparing syllable acoustic features (e.g., pitch, FM, AM, Wiener entropy, and goodness of pitch) within 9 ms sliding time windows. <italic>P</italic> values for comparisons of motif consistency between developmental stages or conditions were obtained using an unpaired <italic>t</italic> test for different conditions and a paired <italic>t</italic> test among similar conditions with Bonferroni correction.</p>
<p>For the motif-based song similarity analysis, 20 bouts of songs were randomly selected and analyzed at each developmental time point. Song similarity scores were calculated by whole-motif comparison against each pupil’s tutor songs using the of the SAP software. For the syllable-based song similarity analysis, we used 50 syllables from the same song bouts, which were analyzed for the motif-based song similarity. Introductory notes in a song were not included for analyses. The series of separated syllable files of songs were transferred to the CORRELATOR program of Avisoft SASLab pro (Avisoft Bioacoustics, Berlin, Germany) for calculating the similarity scores between the syllables from pupils’ and tutors’ songs by the round-robin comparison [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref073">73</xref>].

Each bird was individually placed in a sound-attenuating box overnight, and singing behavior (undirected singing) was recorded during the next morning after lights on. Similarly to above, for brain sampling of silent conditions, birds were prevented from singing (but allowed to produce calls) by light tapping on cages when the birds started singing after lights on.

For identification of clear RA and HVC boundaries against surrounding nonvocal areas under microscope observation, a fluorescent-retrograde tracer, Cholera Toxin B subunit conjugated with AlexaFluor555 (Invitrogen, 1 mg/μl in 1× PBS, 100 nl/hemisphere), was injected into RA 10 days before euthanasia. After behavioral observations, birds were decapitated, and brains were removed and stored at −80°C until sectioning. Brain sections were cut at a 20 μm thickness in the sagittal plane and mounted onto glass slides with a handmade membrane system for laser microdissection. Fluorescent-labeled RA and HVC tissues were microdissected from 14 to 20 brain slices using a laser capture microscope ArcturusXT (Arcturus Bioscience). The collected tissue was dissolved in Qiagen RLT buffer. Total RNA was purified using a column-based method (RNeasy Micro kit; Qiagen) and treated with DNase in the column to avoid contamination of genomic DNA. RNA integrity number (RIN) and concentration were measured with a Bioanalyzer2100 (Agilent Technologies) to confirm RNA quality (RIN: 6.4–7.4, RNA concentration: 3.5–10 ng/μl).</p>
<p>For cDNA synthesis, amplification, and library preparation, cDNA was amplified from purified total RNA using previously reported methods [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref074">74</xref>]. Total RNA (10 ng) was used for synthesis of first-strand cDNA. The following PCR amplification was performed with 14 PCR cycles at 98 °C for 10 seconds, 65 °C for 15 seconds, and 68 °C for 5 minutes. The amplified cDNA samples were purified using a PCR purification column (MiniElute PCR Purification Kit; Qiagen). To check the quality of amplified cDNA, concentrations and smearing patterns of cDNA samples were measured with a Bioanalyzer 2100 (cDNA amount, 72–434 ng) (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Amplified cDNA samples (10 ng) were fragmented to 100–300 bp in size using a DNA Shearing System LE220 (peak incident power 450 W, duty factor 30%, cycle/burst 200, and treatment time of 700 seconds) (Covaris) and then purified by a Zymo DNA 5 column. After end repair of DNA fragments, adaptors were ligated and amplified using a ligation-based Illumina multiplex library preparation method (LIMprep) with a KAPA Hyper Prep Kit (Nippon genetics) and 7 PCR cycles. All libraries were then sequenced using a Hiseq 2500 Sequencer (Illumina) for 100 bp single-end sequencing.

<p>The previous gene annotation file from Ensemble (<italic>Taeniopygia_guttata</italic> taeGut3.2.4.76.gtf) did not include 3′ UTR information. For annotation of read sequences obtained from the RNA-seq data, the lack of 3′ UTR information decreases the chances of accurate estimations of gene expression. Therefore, we elongated the annotation information with our RNA-seq data from zebra finch whole-brain samples (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s008">S1 Table</xref>). Total RNA was isolated from the pallium and pallidum regions of adult male zebra finches under silent and dark conditions (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 234–786 phd) using TRIzol Reagent (Invitrogen) according to manufacturer’s protocol (Invitrogen) and then column purified using a RNeasy Micro kit (Qiagen).

WGCNA identifies modules of densely interconnected probes by hierarchical clustering based on topological overlap and by assigning each probe to a “Cluster (module)” based on shared expression patterns. A WGCNA was performed using the WGCNA R package to further investigate the relationship between biological traits (singing experience, age, and/or singing induction) and identify coregulated gene clusters. General information about network analysis methodology and WGCNA software is available at <ext-link ext-link-type="uri" xlink:href="http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/htdocs/CoexpressionNetwork/" xlink:type="simple">http://labs.genetics.ucla.edu/horvath/htdocs/CoexpressionNetwork/</ext-link>. Pairwise Pearson correlation coefficients were calculated for all detected genes. The resulting Pearson correlation matrix was transformed into a matrix of connection strength (an adjacency matrix) using the power function [(1 + correlation) / 2 × soft threshold power], which was then converted to a topological overlap matrix. A preliminary network was built to assess overall connectivity. From this network, 3,214 and 1,811genes in HVC and RA, respectively, with the highest connectivity were retained for subsequent WGCNA (soft threshold power = 10, corType = pearson, minModuleSize = 30, detectCutHeight = 0.98, and merge CutHeight = 0.4). Clusters were defined as branches of the dendrogram obtained from clustering and were labeled with colors beneath the dendrograms. To study the relationship between expression variability within the clusters and behavioral trait variability, correlations were computed between the principal components of each module and traits. <italic>P</italic> values were computed for each correlation.</p>
<p>To further confirm the WGCNA results, we separately compared the expression profiles of the differentially expressed genes (1,811 genes) in RA under singing condition.

Frozen sections (12 μm thick) were cut in the sagittal plane. Brain sections for a given experiment were simultaneously fixed in 3% paraformaldehyde/1× PBS (pH 7.4), washed in 1× PBS, acetylated, dehydrated in an ascending ethanol series, air dried, and processed for in situ hybridization with antisense <sup>35</sup>S-UTP-labeled riboprobes of genes.

Developed slides were Nissl-stained with a cresyl violet acetate solution (Sigma) for the capture of high-resolution images. For quantification of mRNA signal, exposed X-ray films of brain images were digitally scanned under a microscope (Leica, Z16 APO) connected to a CCD camera (Leica, DFC490) with Application Suite V3 imaging software (Leica), as previously described [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref012">12</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref013">13</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref019">19</xref>,<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref020">20</xref>]. To minimize handling bias for signal detection among experimental groups, we performed in situ hybridization using multiple brain sections at once for each probe and exposed S<sup>35</sup>-riboprobe hybridized brain sections on the same sheet of X-ray films. The same light settings were used for all images. Photoshop (Adobe Systems) was used to measure the mean pixel intensities in the brain areas of interest from sections after conversion to 256 grayscale images. For statistical analysis of the expression of each gene, we performed analysis of covariance (ANCOVA) to examine the homoscedasticity from the regression line of the gene induction ratio between singing duration and expression level.</p>
<p>For fluorescence in situ hybridization, dinitrophenyl (DNP)—and digoxigenin (DIG)-labeled riboprobes were used. A total of 100–200 ng of the DNP/DIG-labeled riboprobe was mixed with the hybridization solution (50% formamide, 10% dextran, 1× Denhardt’s solution, 1 mM EDTA [pH 8.0], 33 mM Tris-HCl [pH 8.0], 600 mM NaCl, 0.2 mg/mL yeast tRNA, 80 mM dithiothreitol, and 0.1% N-lauroylsarcosine). Hybridization was performed at 68 °C for 6–13 h. Washing steps were performed as follows: 5× SSC solution at 68 °C for 30 minutes, formamide-I solution (4× SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.005% Tween20) at 68 °C for 40 minutes, formamide-II solution (2× SSC, 50% formamide, and 0.005% Tween20) at 68 °C for 40 minutes, 0.1× SSC 68 °C 15 minutes × 3, NTE buffer at RT for 20 minutes, and TNT buffer × 3, and TNB buffer (0.5% blocking reagent [Perkin Elmer]/1× TNT buffer) at RT for 30 minutes. DNP-labeled probes were detected with an anti-DNP horseradish peroxidase (HRP)-conjugated antibody using a TSA DNP system (Perkin Elmer) and anti-DNP KLH AlexaFluor488 (Molecular Probes, cat#A-11097). Following treatment with 1% H<sub>2</sub>O<sub>2</sub>/1× PBS for 30 minutes, DIG-labeled probes were detected with anti-DIG HRP-conjugated antibody (Jackson Laboratory, cat#200-032-156) and a TSA Plus Cy3 system (Perkin Elmer). Signal images were obtained by fluorescence microscopy (EVOS FL; Thermo Fisher Science).</p>

<title>Retrograde labeling of RA projection neurons</title>
<p>nXIIts of juvenile birds (30–34 phd) was targeted with stereotaxic coordinates in mm: −0.8 rostral, 0.2 lateral, and 5.9–6.0 ventral from the bifurcation of the central sinus at the border of the forebrain and cerebellum. The retrograde tracer DiI (SIGMA, 70 mg/ml dissolved in N, N-dimethylformamide; 100 nl) was injected into the nXIIts 10 days before euthanasia.

<title>Golgi staining</title>
<p>Zebra finch male juveniles (<italic>n</italic> = 6, 46–55 phd), adults (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 106–796 phd), and SP adults (<italic>n</italic> = 5, 100–101 phd) were used for Golgi staining. Brain tissues were sampled under silent and dark conditions and incubated in the impregnation solution from an FD Rapid GolgiStain kit (FD NeuroTechnologies) for 2 weeks in the dark, incubated in a replacement solution for 3 days, embedded in OCT compound (Sakura Fine Technical), and stored at –80 °C until sectioning. Brain sections with a thickness of 100 μm were cut in the sagittal plane. Sections were dried at RT, rinsed with water, and immersed in a staining solution (FD NeuroTechnologies). After staining, sections were dehydrated in an EtOH series, immersed in xylene, and then mounted with Permount. Dendritic spines were counted using photo images taken at 100× magnification with a BZ-X710 Microscope (Keyence). Golgi-stained cell images were obtained by Z-stacking images with 100 planes positioned at a distance of every 0.2 μm. Dendritic spine density was calculated for 3 RA projection neurons and 3 surrounding neurons in the arcopallium for each bird (<italic>n</italic> = 18 neurons from 6 juveniles, <italic>n</italic> = 15 neurons from 5 adults, and <italic>n</italic> = 15 neurons from 5 SP adults). Although only a few of the RA interneurons could be identified by the Golgi staining, RA projection neurons could be distinguished from interneurons by their characteristic mossy dendritic and axonal morphologies (<xref ref-type="supplementary-material" rid="pbio.2006537.s007">S7B Fig</xref>) [<xref ref-type="bibr" rid="pbio.2006537.ref036">36</xref>].</p>
